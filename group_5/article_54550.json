      "title": "Check the lights on the front of the Xbox 360.",
      "content": "Check the lights on the front of the Xbox 360. The ring of lights around your Power button can indicate what kind of problem you are experiencing. This can help determine how to go about fixing it: [1] X Research source Green lights - The system is operating normally. One red light - This indicates a general hardware failure, and is usually accompanied by a code on your TV screen (e.g. \"E74\"). See the next sections for some tips on getting this fixed. Two red lights - This indicates that the console is currently overheating. Turn the Xbox 360 off for a couple of hours and make sure that it is ventilated on all sides. Three red lights - This is the Red Ring of Death, and indicates a major hardware failure. This usually occurs because the motherboard has overheated and become warped, causing the chips to lose contact. You'll need to either open up your system and repair it yourself or send it in for professional repair. Four red lights - This indicates a faulty or unsupported A/V cable."

      "content": "Check the light on your power supply. Your Xbox 360's power supply also has a light on the back. This light can help you determine if your power supply is failing: No light - The power supply is not receiving power from the wall. Green light - The power supply is working correctly and the Xbox is on. Orange light - The power supply is working correctly and the Xbox is off. Red light - The power supply is failing. The most common cause is an overheating power supply. Unplug it on both ends and let it sit for at least an hour."

      "title": "Let the power supply cool.",
      "content": "Let the power supply cool. An overheating power supply is one of the most common reasons that an Xbox 360 will not start. Many people tuck the power supply away, but this can lead to heat build-up. Make sure your power supply is well-ventilated and not blocked by other object. Unplug the power supply on both ends and let it sit for at least an hour to cool. Make sure the fan in the power supply is still functioning. You should be able to hear a faint whirring sound when the power supply is plugged in and turned on. If the fan has failed, you'll need to get a new power supply."

      "title": "Let the console cool.",
      "content": "Let the console cool. If you get two red lights on your Xbox 360 Power button, your console is overheating. Turn it off for a few hours to let it cool down. Make sure that the Xbox 360 is placed in a well-ventilated area and that no other objects are directly next top it or stacked on top of it. [2] X Research source There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that keeping your Xbox 360 horizontal will lead to better cooling."

      "title": "Try a different video cable.",
      "content": "Try a different video cable. If your Xbox 360 is displaying four red lights, your video cable may be damaged or incompatible, or the connection isn't complete. Check that all of the plugs are connected properly. Try using a replacement official video cable to see if your problem is fixed."

      "title": "Disconnect any peripherals.",
      "content": "Disconnect any peripherals. Sometimes you can have too many things connected to your Xbox 360, causing it to draw too much power. This is especially common with modified consoles with unofficial hard drives or other peripherals. Disconnect everything you can and try to start the console again. This failure is commonly accompanied by error code E68 on your TV."

      "content": "Look for bent pins in the USB ports. A common cause of failure for Xbox 360 consoles is bent pins in the USB ports causing a short circuit: [3] X Research source Examine the USB ports on the Xbox 360, both in the front and in the back. If any of the pins inside are touching each other or the casing of the port, they are likely causing a short circuit. With the Xbox unplugged, use tweezers to gently bend the pins back to their original position. Avoid using the USB port in the future if possible so that the pins don't get bent again."

Most of the time, it will be because the console has overheated and the board has warped, causing chips to lose contact. You can use the secondary error code to determine the exact cause: [4] X Research source While the console is on and the red lights are flashing, press and hold the Sync button on the front of the Xbox. While holding the Sync button, press and release the Eject button. Note the flashing lights that indicate the first digit. One light means the first digit is \"1,\" two means \"2,\" three means \"3,\" and four means \"0.\" Press the Eject button again to get the next digit. There are four digits total."

Use a clean paintbrush to get dust out of the heatsinks, and a can of compressed air to blow dust out of crevasses. Remove the fans and carefully remove the dust from each blade using your brush. Don't blow fans with compressed air, as this can make the fans spin faster than they are designed to."
