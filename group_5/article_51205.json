Then, measure the width from each of the outside edges of the wooden decorative framing around the window.

      "content": "Cut the wooden boards for the catio frame using a miter saw. Cut eight 2x2 cedar posts to half the height of the window. Cut four 2x2 crosspieces for the front and the back of the catio to the width of the window. Cut eight 2x2 crosspieces for the side of the catio and two 2x2 support pieces 6 inches (15.24 cm) smaller than the width of the window. Cut four side-facing 1x4 trim boards 2 ¾ inches (6.98 cm) longer than the 2x2 side-facing crosspieces and the other four front-facing 1x4 trim boards 3 inches (7.62 cm) longer than the front-facing crosspieces. [2] X Research source The two 2x2 support pieces lie in the center of the frame towards the house, reinforcing the roof and the floor of the catio. The eight 2x2 vertical boards make up the height of the top and the bottom halves of the catio. The trim boards wrap around the base and the top of the frame. If you’d like to match the look of the rest of your house, paint your wooden frames with an outdoor-rated paint or stain before attaching the screen material."

      "content": "Start to build the internal frames using side-facing crosspieces. Lay a crosspiece down on the table and place another two crosspieces at the edges, creating a U-shape. Drill one 2 ¼ inch (5.7 cm) screw into each of the two crosspieces at an angle into the crosspiece at the bottom of the U. At the open end of the U, attach another crosspiece on top of the two other boards and drill in two 2 ¼ inch (5.7 cm) screws at an angle. Repeat this step to build the other side of the lower frame and both sides of the upper frame. [3] X Research source Coat any newly exposed wooden ends with paint or stain. The crosspiece that sticks out from the other three will create a ledge where the floor of the catio will sit. You will eventually attach the two frames to create a multi-level catio for your cats that goes over your entire window."

Stand up both of the crosspiece sides you assembled in the previous step so that the crosspiece that sticks out from the other three is on the bottom. Lay the front and side-facing trim boards against the crosspieces so that they create a border around both sides. Drill 1 ⅝ inch (4.12 cm) screws through the front-facing trim boards into the side-facing trim boards, then drill screws through the front-facing trim boards into the crosspiece sides. Place a 2x2 support piece in the center of the frame facing the house and attach it with two screws through the front and back trim boards. Repeat this process on the upper frame. [4] X Research source At this point, the frame should look like an incomplete box with a wooden ledge at the bottom, on the inside of the trim board frame."

Use a pencil to draw a 1 ½ inch (3.81 cm) by 1 ½ inch (3.81 cm) square at each corner of the plywood sheet and cut them out using a jigsaw. Place the sheet inside the frame to make sure it fits, then set it aside to install once the catio frame is mounted onto the brackets. [6] X Research source These square notches should fit around the side crosspieces, allowing the plywood sheet to slide into the bottom of the catio. This step is only for the bottom half of the catio—for the upper half, you will build a shelf so the cat can enter through the window on the bottom and climb up to the second floor."

Drill two 1 ⅝ inch (4.12 cm) screws about 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart into each of the sides of the 1x4 boards, creating a U-shape. Cut a plywood sheet the same height and width as the roof. Add wood glue to the top of the 1x4 boards, place the plywood sheet on top, and attach it with more screws. [13] X Research source The extra 6 inches will create an overhang that can allow rain to run off away from the inside of the catio. The free end of the U-shape will attach flush to the house along with the rest of the catio. To help protect the catio against the rain, use tin snips to cut and attach an aluminum drip edge to the side of the 1x4 boards using a bead of roofing cement and 1 ⅝ inch (4.12 cm) screws. Repeat this process for the other two sides of the roof, allowing the drip edges to overlap each other."

Center the roof on the frame so that the plywood on the free end of the U-shape is flush with the crosspieces.

Repeat this process with the second bracket. [18] X Research source You can drill a shallow ⅜ inch (0.95 cm) pilot hole through the lower leg before you drill the structural screw in. This can allow you to push plastic screw caps over the heads of the screws so that they’re hidden from view. You can also make the catio extend all the way to the ground. Just make sure to install a hard floor or extend the catio frame below the ground so small animals can’t dig their way inside. Ensure that each additional level you build includes a shelf so the cat can safely travel up to the window. [19] X Research source"
