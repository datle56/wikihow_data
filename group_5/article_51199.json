You may want the pond to be visible from a window or a deck. Try to keep the pond away from play areas of small children or pets, and avoid large trees as this can block sunlight from reaching the pond. [2] X Research source Choose a spot for the pond where it will get sun and shade throughout the day. Sun is necessary to keep the pond healthy, but too much means that algae could overgrow.

Plan a pond that is larger in size if you want a more elaborate design, as it all depends on how you want your pond to look and what it will be used for. [4] X Research source Large and elaborate ponds can be over 300 sq ft (28 m 2 )."

To have aquatic plants and goldfish in the pond, approximately 1.5–2 ft (0.46–0.61 m) deep is adequate. For a koi pond, you will need a depth of at least 3 ft (0.91 m). [5] X Research source Deeper ponds are able to maintain more consistent temperature ranges. This is ideal if you are wanting fish. [6] X Research source"

Choose a shape with rounded corners to make the pond look natural and avoid elaborate shapes as these can be difficult to construct. [7] X Research source If you need, mark out the shape on the ground first to experiment with different designs. Use rope, a hose, or spray paint.

If you want to include aquatic plants, dig small terraces in the pond to create shelves where the plants can grow. [9] X Research source The terraces look like small steps along the side of the pond. These provide a flat surface for the plants and you only need to dig these where you are planning to put the plants. An ideal size for each terrace is 1 by 1 ft (30 by 30 cm) and 8 in (20 cm) deep. You can hire a professional to use an excavator to dig the pond if you don't want to dig it by hand."

Get a friend to help you to install the liner, as it is much easier with more than 1 person. Place the liner in the center of the pond and roll it out across the base, up the sides, and over the edge, making sure that it is neatly pressed into all of the crevices. [11] X Research source Pond liners keep the water contained in the pond. These are made out of EPDM and polypropylene and are very weather resistant. Pond liners are heavy enough to remain in place and are unlikely to be moved by the wind. If you have concerns, use a few rocks or large stones to hold the liner in place. Make sure that the pond liner is rated as fish-safe if you are going to be placing fish in the pond. [12] X Research source"

Experiment with different designs and ways of stacking the rocks until they look just right. The rocks can be a range of different sizes and types. Some ponds are edged with large rocks that are over 3 ft (0.91 m) long, while other ponds use smaller rocks that are approximately 1 ft (0.30 m) long. [20] X Research source"
