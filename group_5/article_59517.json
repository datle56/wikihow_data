You can push this pin in with a flat-head screwdriver. This will release the blinds, allowing you to pull them off of the mount. Once you have the blinds off, pop the clutch (the part with the chain) off. [1] X Research source Use a flat-head screwdriver to pop the clutch off, if needed. This method is meant for blinds that have ball-and-chain style cords; they look similar to the chains found on key chains and dog tag necklaces."
