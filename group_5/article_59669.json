For example, on week 50, you put $50 in the 50th envelope. By the time you get to week 100 (or roughly 2 years later), you’ll have $5,050 in savings. [1] X Research source Raise the stakes: This harder version is the original viral TikTok savings challenge. Pick up an envelope every day (instead of every week) to save $5,050 after 100 days. Reduce the cost: Only number 50 envelopes and pick one up every other week to save a total of $1,275 in 100 weeks."

If you look at your statements and see a ton of online purchases without remembering what you bought, that may be a sign to stop purchasing items from those sites. Whenever you want to buy a non-essential item, wait 24 hours. If you still want the item after, then add it to your cart. [16] X Research source"
