When you look for shampoo, conditioner, and any styling products, make sure they don’t include silicones or sulfates to keep your hair looking healthy and shiny. Most products will say “silicone- and sulfate-free” right on the bottle, so you won’t have to search hard.

It is preferred to let your hair slightly dry up and air dry and then blow dry your hair till it is completely dry. However, do keep in mind to use the cool setting on the blow dryer as you do this.
