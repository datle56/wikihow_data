      "content": "Determine whether you have an addiction. A sex addiction is not the same as having a vigorous sex drive. You might have a sexual addiction if you exhibit persistent, escalating patterns of sexual behavior despite increasing negative consequences for yourself and others. [3] X Research source The high that you feel from sex occupies your mind constantly. You always are looking for your next chance to feel that pleasure. Examples include persons who spend half their income on prostitutes or business people who watch pornography at work despite warnings that they will lose their jobs. This preoccupation with sex leaves less room in your life for healthy relationships and other interests. Anyone can have a sex addiction, no matter his/her gender, sexuality, or relationship status. [4] X Research source The following signs indicate a possible sex addiction: Seeking extramarital affairs [5] X Research source Using compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Thinking about sex to the exclusion of other interests and occupations Using pornography excessively Masturbating frequently, especially in inappropriate situations such as while at work Having sex with prostitutes Sexually harassing other people Having unprotected sex with strangers that could lead to sexually transmitted diseases (STD)s. If you are unsure whether you have an STD, get tested right away. If you are in a relationship, your partner should get tested as well. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide whether you need professional help.",
      "content": "Decide whether you need professional help. For some people with hypersexual disorder or a sex addiction, they can treat their condition on their own through lifestyle changes. Ask yourself: can you manage your sexual impulses? Are you distressed by your sexual behaviors? Is your sexual behavior harming your relationships and work life, or leading to negative consequences like arrest? Do you try to hide your sexual behavior? If you feel your condition is leading to negative consequences, seek help.

      "content": "Find a qualified mental health provider or therapist. Ask your family practitioner for a recommendation of someone who specializes in sex addiction. Psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family therapists, or licensed clinical social workers are all potential options. It is preferable to find someone who has experience helping people work through sex addiction. Hypersexual behavior can appear similar to behavior associated with impulse-control or substance-use disorders. Still, it is unclear whether the brain operates the same way with hypersexual disorder as it does with substance addiction. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Thus, rather than finding someone who works on substance addiction, look for a specialist on hypersexual disorder. If you are in a committed partnership, marriage and family therapists can help both you and your partner."

      "content": "Discuss treatment plans with your therapist. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment method. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source CBT is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy treatment, which utilizes a hands-on, practical approach to problem-solving. In CBT, you work with your therapist to change patterns of thinking or behavior with the goal of changing the way you feel. [13] X Research source Your therapist might also prescribe medication. For example, anti-depressants curb compulsive sex behavior. Common examples are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft). Your therapist also might prescribe anti-androgens, mood stabilizers, or another drug. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source An experienced therapist can help you handle the intricacies of your situation. As societal acceptance of sexual addictions varies, your therapist can help you navigate your relationships and overcome any shame you might feel. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Set aside shame or embarrassment. Focus on the positive benefits of treatment. Remember that your therapist is there to help you. It is her job not to judge you or make you feel \"bad\" about your compulsions. Finding a therapist you feel comfortable with and who you feel like you can trust is essential for recovery. If you're having trouble because you feel embarrassed, consider therapy like any other form of treatment. If you had a physical illness, you'd see a doctor. If you had a cavity, you'd see a dentist. You probably wouldn't be embarrassed or ashamed about seeking those treatments. Remind yourself that you are seeking help to make your life healthier and happier, and that's a sign of courage and belief in yourself that is admirable. Remember you are not alone. Many people struggle with hypersexual disorder. Mental health providers are discreet and understanding. They will keep your information confidential unless you report that you will hurt yourself or another, report the sexual abuse of a child, or report abuse or neglect of someone in a vulnerable population (e.g. elderly or underage).

      "content": "Seek support from loved ones. Quitting a sex addiction can be a lonely endeavor. Even though your previous sexual activity might have lacked an emotional connection, you might miss the physical closeness. Spending time with loved ones will help you remember why you are quitting and commit to stop. You might have loved ones who do not understand sex addiction or who are angry with you for your past behavior. These feelings are normal. Try to find a few people who can understand your struggle and help you be successful. Do not spend too much time with critical people."

Instead, it means that you don't allow compulsive behaviors to control you. You feel in charge of your sexual behaviors, and happy and fulfilled by them instead of guilty or ashamed. Your therapist can help you work toward this. You may even find that a therapist with specific training in sexual health issues can be useful in teaching you ways to develop a healthy attitude toward sex. Explore what you like about sex. When you're addicted to sex, you may do things that you don't even really enjoy doing because they feed your compulsion. Take some time to explore what you actually enjoy about sex. What makes you feel valued as a sexual partner? What feelings do you enjoy inspiring in others? [23] X Research source Try to consider sex as a part of a healthy life, rather than its own \"forbidden fruit\" or something to hide or be ashamed of. Someone with a problem overeating won't simply stop eating food; similarly, you do not have to simply stop having sex. You just want to learn a healthier way of integrating it into your overall life.
