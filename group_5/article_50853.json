      "content": "A simple person is someone who’s happy with an uncomplicated life. When we say someone “leads a simple life,” we mean that they’re content with a straightforward routine, are easy-going and relaxed, and often generous or good-natured. They’re probably not caught up in drama, don’t want too much, and don’t let bad things or unfortunate events stop them from being happy. [1] X Research source Here are common characteristics of simple people: They don’t usually have many possessions, or many valuable things. They live within their means while taking care of others. They’re earnest and genuine, and want to live as their true selves. They’re grateful for what they have, and kind to other people. They’re humble and approachable, and don’t seek fame or fortune. They’re also often minimalistic. They’re thoughtful and careful about their words and actions. They tend to avoid drama and conflict, and seek to fix conflict wherever they can. They’re relaxed, low-stress, and live in the moment, with a clear purpose in life."

      "content": "On the other hand, “simple” is sometimes used as an insult to mean stupid. People sometimes describe others as “simple-minded,” meaning they don’t have complex thoughts and may struggle to use and understand reason or logic. It’s an old-fashioned meaning for \"unintelligent\" that isn’t super common today, and has nothing to do with living a simple life. [2] X Research source Example: “I’m starting to think Jack is simple. He couldn’t figure out how to work the can opener.” Example: “Can you use smaller words? I’m a bit simple.”"

      "content": "Find a healthy, productive daily routine to form good habits. A steady daily routine is key to keeping your life simple and free of distractions. Shahbazyan says to figure out what your “ultimate goal” in life is, then organize your life around that goal. If you want to be a writer, make writing a daily activity. If you want to spend more time outdoors, make it a point to leave the house every day. Also, organize your day into a consistent and repeatable schedule, but with room for variety. Maybe you start each day with a walk and a shower, then have a couple of hours of free time for hobbies before going to work. Research suggests that to form a reliable habit, you should practice something every day for 2-3 months. Then, it becomes like second nature. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Think positively, and make the most of hard situations. Life can seem overwhelmingly complicated when you’re only focused on the problems. To think more positively , Shahbazyan recommends writing a list of your troubles. No matter how many you have, she says, there’s only a finite number, and you can tackle them one by one to whittle them down. Also, try to find the upside of each of your problems. For example, if your car breaks down, take it as a learning opportunity to get more familiar with mechanics, so you can better solve the problem if it happens again later."

      "content": "Practice gratitude and count your blessings. Simple people know how good they have it, even if their lives may not look particularly shiny to other people. But acknowledging the good things in your life, however small, makes you happier to have them, and keeps you from wanting unnecessary things that complicate your life. Practice gratitude by listing 3 things you’re grateful for each day, and striving to make them different each day. [4] X Research source Start a gratitude journal to keep your gratitude lists. Or, talk to a friend and family member about what you’re both grateful for. Sharing your joy is the easiest way to multiply it!"

      "content": "Explore your own beliefs and convictions. Simple people know what they’re about. They talk the talk and walk the walk. If you don’t know your own values, you make unpredictable and inconsistent decisions that complicate your life. Reichard says to think back on your best days, when you’ve felt happiest, and ask yourself what made those days good. Then, strive to work and fight for the things that made that day possible. For example, if your best day was one you spent hiking in the wilderness, you might decide that conservation and wilderness preservation are some of the core things you believe in. Reichard also says to keep an open mind, and be willing to question or even abandon values that don’t help you."

Think about the things that make you happy, make your life easier, or which you use frequently. Then, think about the things you have that aren’t on that list, and consider donating them, giving them away, or trashing them. [6] X Research source You don’t have to go full minimalism or get rid of all your favorite things! Some people even love clutter. The trick is keeping only what serves you, which can be many things."
