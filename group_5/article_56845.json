      "content": "Add 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of 100% pure and organic dried catnip to a mug. While you wait for the water to boil, prepare the catnip. [1] X Research source If you'd like, place a strainer over the mug and pour the catnip into the strainer. Otherwise, you can simply pour the catnip directly into the mug. Opt for 100% pure and organic dried catnip to ensure that there aren't any pesticides or chemicals in the catnip. This variety is also much stronger! Using a strainer allows you to remove the leaves once your tea is done brewing. You also have the option of letting the catnip leaves float in the tea for a stronger beverage. Both are perfectly safe for your cat to drink."

      "content": "Pour the hot water into the mug and let it steep for 3 minutes. Once the water has come to a boil, take it off the heat. Wait for the water to cool until it's no longer boiling, then pour it over the strainer (or simply into the mug if you're not using a strainer). Then, allow 3 minutes for the tea to steep. [2] X Research source Letting the tea steep for 3 minutes will ensure that the tea is strong enough for your kitty. Once that time is done, remove the strainer if you're using one."

      "content": "Let the tea cool to room temperature before serving it. To make sure your cat doesn't burn their tongue when they take a sip, avoid serving the tea hot. You might try waiting until the tea has cooled naturally, adding cool water to the tea, or keeping it in the fridge for a few minutes to let it chill. [3] X Research source Double-check the tea's temperature before serving it. To be absolutely sure the tea is no longer too hot to serve, try the tea yourself (catnip tea is safe for humans to drink, too).

      "title": "Serve the tea to your cat and wait for them to try it.",
      "content": "Serve the tea to your cat and wait for them to try it. Set the teacup near your cat to encourage them to drink it. They may be reluctant at first, but will likely try it once they smell the tea's enticing aroma. [5] X Research source If your cat isn't going for the tea, try a different serving style. Add some ice cubes to see if they'd rather drink iced catnip tea. It's possible your cat won't drink the tea, but will simply smell it. Don't fret, since even smelling catnip can boost your cat's mood and allow them to experience a moment of bliss."

Excess catnip can also cause the ingredient to lose its relaxing effects over time. Give your kitty a little catnip throughout the week or once a day so your cat can keep experiencing its benefits!
