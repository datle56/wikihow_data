      "title": "Apply coconut oil to dry, clean hair.",
      "content": "Apply coconut oil to dry, clean hair. You can also use another type of oil or hair moisturizer, such as olive oil, shea butter, or a store-bought product. Lightly coat your hands with your preferred product, then spread the product throughout your hair with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. [1] X Research source You won't be putting your hair up into a protective style, so you don't need a lot here."

      "title": "Fluff your hair out with your fingers to volumize it.",
      "content": "Fluff your hair out with your fingers to volumize it. Use your fingers to gently comb out your hair from roots to ends. Every so often, dig your fingers into your hair, right down to the roots, and jiggle them. This will help break up clumps of curls and give you a fluffier look. [2] X Research source Shaking and jiggling your hair with your fingers will also help add volume, which in turn will help your Afro stand up."

    {
      "title": "Add more volume by pulling sections of hair away from each other.",
      "content": "Add more volume by pulling sections of hair away from each other. Grab a section of hair and split it in half, making sure that you go all the way down to the roots. Do this all over your hair, especially along your hairline. This splitting motion is similar to creating a 2-strand twist , except that you aren't actually twisting the strands together. Every so often, reach into your hair and jiggle your hand. This will help loosen the strands up a bit more and give you a more natural look. The sections should be around 2 to 3 fingers thick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a hair pick with flexible rubber or metal teeth.",
      "content": "Get a hair pick with flexible rubber or metal teeth. How long the teeth are will depend on the length of your Afro. The longer your Afro is, the longer the teeth should be. The key here is to choose something that is flexible. If the teeth are too stiff, they may damage your hair. [3] X Research source While metal or rubber will work, rubber is usually a bit gentler on the hair."

    {
      "title": "Run the pick through your hair, stopping when you hit a knot.",
      "content": "Run the pick through your hair, stopping when you hit a knot. Start near the tips of your hair, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the ends. If you encounter a knot, use the tips of the pick to gently detangle it. After detangling all the ends, repeat the process, starting a little further from the ends. Detangle and separate all your hair, slowly working your way toward your scalp. If you run up against an especially challenging knot, add a little extra coconut oil to loosen it up."

    {
      "title": "Continue to comb the pick through your hair.",
      "content": "Continue to comb the pick through your hair. Start at the bottom of your head and work your way up the sides and towards the top. For maximum volume, pull the pick away from your scalp. For example: [4] X Research source When you're doing the bottom of your head, pull the pick at a downward angle, toward your shoulders. When you get to the sides and back, pull it away from your head—not straight up towards the ceiling. Once you get to the top, pull the pick up towards the ceiling. Adjust the angle at which you flick the comb to match the curve of your skull."

      "title": "Fluff your hair with the pick until you get the look you want.",
      "content": "Fluff your hair with the pick until you get the look you want. Go over your entire head once more, picking out all your hair from front to back. Focus on the sections that look flat or clumped together. How much or how long you do this depends on your desired level of puffiness. Once you're happy with your look, you are ready to go. There's no need for any hairspray; your hair's natural texture will help maintain the style."

      "title": "Comb your desired moisturizer through dry, clean hair.",
      "content": "Comb your desired moisturizer through dry, clean hair. Pick your usual hair moisturizer and apply it to your hair. Next, use a wide-toothed comb to comb your hair starting from the ends. This will help distribute the product further as well as remove any knots or tangles. [5] X Research source You can use a natural moisturizer, such as coconut oil or shea butter, or you can use a store-bought one."

      "title": "Mist your hair with water, then apply a styling cream if desired.",
      "content": "Mist your hair with water, then apply a styling cream if desired. The styling cream is only necessary if your hair is fine and doesn't hold styles very well. If your hair is coarse and stands up on its own, you can skip the styling cream altogether. [6] X Research source Use enough water to make your hair damp, but not soaking wet. If you need to, use a wide-toothed comb to help distribute the moisture."

      "title": "Blow-dry your hair with a diffuser attachment until it's about 90% dry.",
      "content": "Blow-dry your hair with a diffuser attachment until it's about 90% dry. Pop a diffuser attachment onto your hairdryer. Turn the hairdryer on and hold it at a 90° angle relative to your scalp. Work the prongs into your hair so that they are close to, but not touching, your scalp. Hold it there for a few seconds so that it can dry your hair, then move onto another part of your head. Do this all over your head until your hair is 90% dry. [7] X Research source Don’t press the prongs of the dryer directly against your scalp, as this could burn or overheat your skin. You probably won't be able to dry a section of hair on the first pass; you may have to revisit it a few times before it is 90% dry. You can also just let your hair air dry until it is 90% dry instead. Don't use the hairdryer without the diffuser attachment. The heat will be too intense and damage your hair. It might also make it frizzy. A diffuser attachment looks a little like a funnel with comb-like prongs inside of it."

      "content": "Pull strands away from your head and blow-dry them with a concentrator nozzle. Replace the diffuser attachment with a concentrator nozzle. Grab a section of hair and pull it away from your scalp until it's taut. Blow-dry that section of hair, focusing on the roots, then move onto the next. [8] X Research source The angle at which you pull your hair depends on how you want it to stick up. For example, you can pull it straight up towards the ceiling, or off to the side. A concentrator nozzle is sometimes called a \"blast\" attachment. It is wide and thin. The exact size of the section of hair doesn't matter. Something that's about 2 to 3 fingers thick would do just fine, however."

      "title": "Use a pick to comb out your hair.",
      "content": "Use a pick to comb out your hair. Select a hair pick with long, flexible, metal or rubber prongs. Run the prong through small sections of hair. Start by combing out the ends and then move deeper into your hair, gradually working your way back to the roots. Use the tips of the comb to detangle any knots before you move on to the next section. [9] X Research source Don't try to comb your hair out completely with the pick. Use it to fluff and train your hair instead."

      "content": "Comb and shape your hair with your fingers. Here is where you have a little freedom. If you want extra volume, pull strands of hair apart right down to the roots. If you want to sculpt your hair, gently pull on it in the direction you want it to stand. [10] X Research source You don't need to use any hairspray, but you can apply a little hair oil, growth serum, or shine serum to make your hair look glossy."
