      "content": "Use body isolations to make yourself move like a robot. Body isolations are dance movements where you move one part of your body separately from the rest. [1] X Research source Using body isolations while you dance—like moving just your head or one of your arms at a time—will help you look more robotic. For example, while you’re dancing, you might move one of your arms to a new position, stop, and then move your other arm. Practice isolations by standing with your legs shoulder-width apart, then move only 1 body part at a time, starting with your head and working down to your feet."

      "title": "Wobble your body after each move to mimic a moving machine.",
      "content": "Wobble your body after each move to mimic a moving machine. Robots wobble back and forth whenever they stop or shift into a new position. Replicate that wobbling by rocking your body side to side a few times after you do a move—some pros also call this “bopping.” [2] X Research source Move about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) in each direction as you wobble. For example, after moving your arm to a new position, wobble back and forth a few times for dramatic effect."

      "title": "Use slow, controlled motions like a robot.",
      "content": "Use slow, controlled motions like a robot. Think of how a machine moves. Every movement is steady, intentional, and for the most part, consistent. When you're doing the robot, avoid fast, frenetic movements since they won’t look robotic. Instead, make each movement deliberate, and do each at the same speed. [3] X Research source Pause in between motions for added effect. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can vary your speeds to add some flair to your moves, or to make yourself look like a malfunctioning robot!"

      "content": "Use your feet to pivot, but avoid lifting them. Don’t step to the beat like you would for other kinds of dancing, since it won’t look very robotic. Instead, keep your feet on the ground, and focus on moving your arms, torso, and head while you dance. To reposition, pivot on your heels or the balls of your feet, then plant your feet again. [4] X Research source Pivoting instead of taking steps will help you look more like a robot. With practice, no one will"

      "title": "Give yourself robot arms by bending your arms at a 90-degree angle.",
      "content": "Give yourself robot arms by bending your arms at a 90-degree angle. Starting with your arms at your sides, raise one of your arms up so it's pointing straight out in front of you. Then, bend it so it’s at a 90-degree angle. Repeat with your other arm so both of your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle in front of your chest. When you’re finished, keep dancing with your arms bent, or straighten them back out one at a time. [5] X Research source By keeping your arms straight or at a 90-degree angle while you’re dancing, they’ll look like they’re moving on hinges. Keep your hands open, but your fingers together, like a doll’s, which looks more robot-like."

      "title": "“Tick” your arms and torso like they’re being controlled by cogs.",
      "content": "“Tick” your arms and torso like they’re being controlled by cogs. “Ticking” is when you break up 1 smooth motion into many jerky, small motions, like the ticking second hand on a clock. [6] X Research source To tick your arms and torso, start by bending forward at your waist with your arms out in front of you so your waist and legs make a 150-degree angle. Then, lift your arms up about 2 in (5.1 cm), and pause. Repeat 4-5 more times until your arms are over your head. [7] X Research source Once your arms are all the way up, do the same thing with your torso, moving it up 2 in (5.1 cm) at a time until you’re standing up straight again. Practice slowly at first. Then, as you get better, work on ticking at a faster pace."

      "content": "Do a ticking wave to get some hip-hop dancing into your routine. The wave is when you roll your arms and shoulders like an ocean wave. Make it a robotic move by adding ticking. Start with your arms out straight at your sides. Then, bend 1 wrist so your fingers point to the floor. Bend your elbow, then bounce your shoulders, and move the wave to the other arm. [8] X Research source As the wave moves across your body, straighten the first body parts (your wrist and elbow) behind it. Once you’re finished, make the wave go back the other way."

      "title": "Bend your waist and knees to add motion to your lower body.",
      "content": "Bend your waist and knees to add motion to your lower body. Since you mostly stay in the same spot while you’re doing the robot, bending down to a lower level is a great way to switch things up. Bend your entire torso at the waist, or just bend both of your knees at the same time so they’re at about a 125-degree angle, and keep them bent like that when you dance. [9] X Research source Don’t bend your knees too much or you might have a hard time balancing. After you bend at the waist, pivot your body left or right to reposition, then straighten your core again to give a fun illusion. For a more dramatic effect, pretend you’re using a crank on one of your knees, ticking your arm as you turn it while bending your knees in increments to make it look like you’re manually operating your knees. When you’re ready to stand up again, straighten your legs using a slow, controlled motion."

      "title": "Walk across the floor in a smooth, controlled motion.",
      "content": "Walk across the floor in a smooth, controlled motion. To walk while doing the robot, think of your legs and feet like they’ve been transformed into wheels. Bend your knees slightly, then walk your legs in almost circular motions, lifting your feet a little extra. [10] X Research source When walking, aim for fluidity, rather than jerkiness, which gives the move an unexpected element. Pay attention to your feet especially, and try to make it so that they “roll” across the floor, lifting your back foot by the heel and “peeling” it away, then stepping down with your heel first and rolling onto the balls of your feet."

      "title": "Pretend you’re controlling your legs with your hands.",
      "content": "Pretend you’re controlling your legs with your hands. First, bend down so your legs are at a 125-degree angle. Then, hold your hand about 1 foot (0.30 m) above one of your knees, and raise it up using a smooth, fluid motion. At the same time, lift your leg into the air so it looks like you’re pulling your leg up by an invisible string with your hand. It might take a few tries to find your balance since you’ll be standing on one leg."

      "content": "Combine different moves together to come up with your own routine. Making your own dance routine is a great way to practice all of the skills you’ve been working on. Plus, you’ll have a go-to routine if you ever go out dancing. Just choose your favorite moves, and then practice doing them in order until you have your routine memorized."
