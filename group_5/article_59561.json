The “F-boy emoji” is characterized by the emoji biting its lip, having one eye half-closed, wearing a baseball cap backward, and resting its thumb and index finger on its chin. [1] X Research source The origin of the Lip Bite Emoji wearing a baseball cap backwards remains unknown, but Twitter user @medusabraids shared the first viral post featuring the image on April 17th, 2018. That initial post received over 5,700 retweets and 18,500 likes before the account was shut down. In the weeks after its initial use, Twitter users widely adopted the image as a reaction emoji. On April 20th, 2018, Tumblr user \"lostwhere\" reposted the image and dubbed it the \"f**kboi emoji,\" a post that amassed over 36,000 notes in the following two years. Over the next few months, the \"F-boy Emoji\" gained widespread popularity in online memes, particularly on Twitter and Instagram. When you see or use this meme, it's generally a way to express sexual interest. For example, you could send the meme along with a text that says, \"What's up, sexy?\" or, \"Good morning, hot stuff.\""
