      "title": "Get the right bra.",
      "content": "Get the right bra. Measure yourself correctly. Bra sizing is a complicated thing that even trips up many cisgender females - 8 out of 10 women are wearing the wrong size! The average woman is a D-cup (though will most likely wear a B or C) so keep that in mind when sizing yourself."

      "content": "Measure yourself very tightly before wearing a fake bra (though still with room to breathe) around your chest, add 2 to this number, and add another 1 if it's an odd number. This is your band size. Once you've got your band size, just buy a bra with a cup size that looks good on your frame (if you're unsure, just get a C or D cup) and stuff it with tissues or something."

      "content": "Disguise your crotch. If you've been on estrogen for a while and have a smaller-sized area, great. If not, you could Tuck and Tape ."

      "title": "Figure out what to do with your hair.",
      "content": "Figure out what to do with your hair. Stereotypically, scene girls have very heavily teased, poofy, dyed hair. This is actually less than amazing for your hair and is often looked down upon by scenesters. However, if you're going to be a convincing scene transgender girl, you Require long, layered hair. While doing too much with your hair isn't a good idea, scene hair's not supposed to lie completely flat on your head. Being a long-haired girl is great because you can just mess around with your hair, see what looks good, looks bad and looks just plain horrible. However, if your hair is curly, you're going to NEED a straightener. No arguing. Put that teaser down! You shouldn't need it. It really frays your hair. Do it on special occasions only. Dye is excellent to help you pass-no green or dark colors, though. Stick with pink and purple unless your face is highly feminine. Light blond is also a good color on its own - it's mostly the scene girls who do that! Leopard spots and zebra stripes in your hair are both scene and feminine."

      "title": "Find a top you like.",
      "content": "Find a top you like. Scene girls often wear outlandish, happy and above all feminine T-shirts. This is very helpful for you. Scene clothes are quite close-fitting. With your padded bra, this isn't much of an issue and is a great way to show off that feminine chest!"

    {
      "title": "Flaunt your scene style but in a feminine way.",
      "content": "Flaunt your scene style but in a feminine way. Stay away from brass knuckles, and if you Need to wear skulls, use cutesy skulls. Hello, Kitty characters and diamonds score extra scene points, as well as being very feminine. The best possible scene slogans are those that say cute core, glamour, or \"haters make me famous.\" Avoid anything saying brutal or rawr."

    {
      "title": "Spend some time shopping to find the right pants.",
      "content": "Spend some time shopping to find the right pants. Now here comes the issue. Scenester pants are, and always will be skinny jeans. Skinny jeans are a death sentence for transgender girls and seem to gain pleasure out of stopping you from passing. If you can, find pants tight in the legs and loose in the pelvis. Tell everyone where you got them from. If you have feminine hips, you can definitely get away with skinny jeans. Medium hip-wise, and you can wear them so long as they're white or similar light colors. It'll make those hips look bigger. Slim hips, and you might want to wear medium-tight pants. Maybe you wouldn't look totally scene, but you'll be an individual! If you can find jeans that have sparkles, animal print, or hearts, or that are pink, wear them - these are feminine things!"

    {
      "title": "Put on that makeup!",
      "content": "Put on that makeup! Girls gotta love makeup, and so do scene girls! And scene guys, for that matter. For everyday wear, start with a cover-up and foundation, then put on dark eyeliner to make those beautiful eyes of yours pop out. Smear on a little white eyeshadow, some mascara, a bit of cheek highlighter, and pink lip gloss/lipstick (sparkly if you want to feel extra-special) and you're done."

    {
      "title": "Never forget the accessories.",
      "content": "Never forget the accessories. Scene girls love accessories. Just remember to never go out too much of a good thing is a bad thing. NEVER wear belts-they'll draw attention to your crotch-BAD IDEA for trans girls. Gauntlets are also out since they make your bone structure look bigger and the spikes look masculine. Stick with necklaces and bracelets. As Coco Chanel taught us-always take off one accessory before you leave the house. Looking tacky is bad, bad, BAD, and can stop you from passing."

    {
      "title": "Consider getting pierced.",
      "content": "Consider getting pierced. Piercings are a good friend, but a bad enemy. Lip piercings are both quite feminine and very scene-most scene girls have them, so they're a good choice. Belly button piercings aren't very scenic, but EXTREMELY feminine. With the right stud, they can look quiet scene. Definitely stay away from septum piercings unless you have a very feminine face-they're painful and a bit masculine (though somewhat scene). Of course, make sure you have pierced ears. Don't gauge your ears, though, since it's mostly guys who do that."

      "content": "Realize that any tattoo is a permanent thing. Laser surgery will keep the raised scar. If you still really, really want a tattoo, get something very feminine-such as a unicorn-tattooed somewhere inconspicuous."

      "content": "Show who you are. Are you openly bi or lesbian? If you're openly transgender and also fall somewhere to the right of the Kinsey Scale, you would've told your parents the same time you became open about your gender identity? Anyway, flaunt it, but in a feminine way. Wear a female on a female symbol, a female on a female/male symbol, or a lipstick lesbian flag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Love yourself.",
      "content": "Love yourself. As Lady Gaga sang, \"Rejoice and love yourself today, 'cause baby you were born this way.\". Girl, you've come a long way in admitting this to yourself and probably family. Be happy. And always look on the bright side of life. It's what scenesters do."
