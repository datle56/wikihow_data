      "title": "Use sturdy paper.",
      "content": "Use sturdy paper. To make sure your postcard won't get destroyed in the mail, choose a sturdy type of paper, like cardstock. The postcard you make should be about the same thickness as a regular postcard. If you're afraid the paper you have is too flimsy, you can glue more than one piece together to make it sturdier. The USPS specifies that postcards must not be thinner than .007\". Postcards thicker than .016\" are considered letter weight and will require a more expensive stamp. You can use any color paper that you want, as long as the address will be clearly visible. Blank notecards are a good choice - you can buy them in white or any other color, and they come in the right sizes."

      "title": "Cut the paper to the right dimensions.",
      "content": "Cut the paper to the right dimensions. Take a ruler and measure out a card between 3 1/2 and 4 1/4 inches high and between 5 and 6 inches long.You can also make it of any height if you dont intend to actually send it to someone or it is for a project etc. Carefully cut out the card, making sure it's not lopsided or irregular in shape. The USPS won't send a postcard that isn't rectangular."

    {
      "title": "Draw a line down the center of the back.",
      "content": "Draw a line down the center of the back. Now your piece of paper will start looking more like a postcard! Use a straightedge to help you create a straight line down the center of the back of your card. The space on the left side of the line will be reserved for your message, and the space on the right side will be reserved for the address of the recipient. There's no reason the line has to be drawn directly down the center of the card. If you want more space to write a longer note, scoot the line toward the right side of the card so you have more room on the left."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw address lines.",
      "content": "Draw address lines. On the right side of the center line, draw three horizontal lines. This is where you'll write the recipient's name and address. If you want, draw a box in the upper right hand corner where the stamp will go."

      "title": "Gather supplies.",
      "content": "Gather supplies. Now comes the fun part. Gather up the art supplies you want to use so you can create a one-of-a-kind picture for the front of your postcard.

Here are a few ideas: [2] X Research source Glue a photo you took to the front of the card. Decorate it with a fun border using colored paper and glitter.

    {
      "title": "Seal the card.",
      "content": "Seal the card. This step will help protect the front of your card in the mail. It's especially important if you used materials other than pens and pencils to decorate the card. Get mod podge or another clear craft sealant and use a paintbrush to paint it over the front of the card. Allow it to dry for a few hours before you finish your card. Don't cover the back of the card in sealant, or you won't be able to write on it."
