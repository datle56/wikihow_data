Level 5: Performing for others and struggling to identify their true needs. Level 6: Unsuccessfully trying to find joy in material things. Level 7: Trying to manage their anxieties with escapist behaviors. Level 8: Avoiding frustrations with mood swings and impulsive behavior.

In order to grow as a person, a Seven must take the time to understand their feelings and the feelings of those around them, even if it’s challenging or uncomfortable.
