      "content": "Define the formula for slope. The slope of a line is defined by (Y 2 - Y 1 )/(X 2 - X 1 ) where X and Y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of points on the line. You must define two points on the line to calculate this formula. The point closer to the bottom of the line is (X 1 , Y 1 ) and the point higher on the line, above the first point, is (X 2 , Y 2 ). [4] X Research source This formula can be restated as the rise over the run. It is the change in vertical difference over the change in horizontal difference, or the steepness of the line. If a line points upwards to the right, it will have a positive slope. If the line is downwards to the right, it will have a negative slope."

A point on a line is given by the coordinate (X, Y) where X is the location on the horizontal axis and Y is the location on the vertical axis. To calculate the slope, you need to identify two points on each of the lines in question. [5] X Research source Points are easily determined when you have a line drawn on graphing paper. To define a point, draw a dashed line up from the horizontal axis until it intersects the line. The position that you started the line on the horizontal axis is the X coordinate, while the Y coordinate is where the dashed line intersects the line on the vertical axis. For example: line l has the points (1, 5) and (-2, 4) while line r has the points (3, 3) and (1, -4)."

Take care to plug in the coordinates to the proper X and Y value in the formula. [6] X Research source To calculate the slope of line l : slope = (5 – 4)/(1 – (-2)) Subtract: slope = 1/3 The slope of line r is: slope = (3 – (-4))/(3 - 1) = 7/2"

Lines may look parallel on paper and may even be very close to parallel, but if their slopes are not exactly the same, they aren’t parallel. [7] X Research source In this example, 1/3 is not equal to 7/2, therefore, these two lines are not parallel."

The formula of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope, b is the y-intercept, and x and y are variables that represent coordinates on the line; generally, you will see them remain as x and y in the equation. In this form, you can easily determine the slope of the line as the variable \"m\". [8] X Research source For example. Rewrite 4y - 12x = 20 and y = 3x -1. The equation 4y - 12x = 20 needs to be rewritten with algebra while y = 3x -1 is already in slope-intercept form and does not need to be rearranged."

It only takes a little math and rearranging of variables to get it into slope-intercept. [9] X Research source For example: Rewrite line 4y-12x=20 into slope-intercept form. Add 12x to both sides of the equation: 4y – 12x + 12x = 20 + 12x Divide each side by 4 to get y on its own: 4y/4 = 12x/4 +20/4 Slope-intercept form: y = 3x + 5."

Using the equation y = mx + b where m is the slope of the line, you can identify and compare the slopes of two lines. [10] X Research source In our example, the first line has an equation of y = 3x + 5, therefore it’s slope is 3. The other line has an equation of y = 3x – 1 which also has a slope of 3. Since the slopes are identical, these two lines are parallel. Note that if these equations had the same y-intercept, they would be the same line instead of parallel. [11] X Research source"

You would use this formula when you want to define a second parallel line to an already given line with a defined slope. The formula is y – y 1 = m(x – x 1 ) where m is the slope of the line, x 1 is the x coordinate of a point given on the line and y 1 is the y coordinate of that point. [12] X Research source As in the slope-intercept equation, x and y are variables that represent coordinates on the line; generally, you will see them remain as x and y in the equation. [13] X Research source The following steps will work through this example: Write the equation of a line parallel to the line y = -4x + 3 that goes through point (1, -2)."

In this equation, -4 represents the variable m and therefore, is the slope of the line."

Subtract -2 from both side: y + 2 – 2 = -4x + 4 – 2 Simplified equation: y = -4x + 2"
