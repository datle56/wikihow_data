      "content": "Standard scoring To play cornhole with regular scoring, simply count the number of points each team or player earns during each round and add it to your overall game score. The first player or team to reach 21 points wins the game. [1] X Research source Some people use the “house rule” that you need to win the game by at least 2 points, but this is optional. Here’s how to score each bag toss: A bag goes through the hole: 3 points. A bag that gets knocked into the hole by another bag: 3 points. A bag that lands anywhere on top of the board: 1 point. A bag that hangs into the hole but doesn’t drop inside it: 1 point. A bag that lands on the edge of the board without touching the ground: 1 point. A bag that lands on top of the board but is also touching the ground: 0 points. A bag that hangs off the front edge of the board and rests on another bag that’s on the ground: 0 points. If the bag on the ground can be removed without the hanging bag falling to the ground, it’s worth 1 point."

      "title": "Cancellation scoring",
      "content": "Cancellation scoring In cancellation scoring, the team or player with the highest score at the end of an inning adds the difference between the two scores to their game score. The other team earns 0 points. For example, if you ended the inning with 5 points and the other team got 3, your score for the inning is 2. The first person or team to get 21 game points wins. [2] X Research source This version of the game usually takes a little bit longer than the standard method of scoring, but it can slow down the game and make it more fun for experienced players. Feel free to adjust the 21-point target score or the scoring method for the age and skill level of the players to keep the game moving at a fun pace."

      "title": "Blackjack scoring",
      "content": "Blackjack scoring For a fun twist on traditional cornhole scoring, try to score exactly 21 points without going over. If you score over 21, you “bust,” reduce your score to 13, and try to hit 21 again the next round. [3] X Research source For example, if you have 15 points and you earn 7 points in the next round, your game total is 22. That means you “bust” and in the next round, you'll start with 13 points. Some people like to reduce the score of a team that “busts” down to 11 or 15 instead of 13. It's up to you!"

      "title": "H.O.R.S.E. scoring",
      "content": "H.O.R.S.E. scoring To play this basketball game-inspired scoring , players or teams take turns saying what trick shot they're about to make through the hole. If the bag lands in the hole, the next player must attempt to make the same shot. If the other player misses, they get one letter from H.O.R.S.E. The first team or player to get all 5 letters loses the game. [4] X Research source In this version of the game, just landing on the board isn’t enough—you only score bags that make it into the hole. For example, if a player says that they’re going to bounce their bag off the tree into the hole and doesn't make the shot, then they get the letter “H.” If they make it, and the other player doesn’t, then the other player gets the letter “H” instead."

      "title": "When a foul occurs, the player loses the throw and the bag is removed.",
      "content": "When a foul occurs, the player loses the throw and the bag is removed. When someone “fouls” in cornhole, it either means that a player throws their bag out of turn or a player’s foot crosses over the line that stretches from the front edge of the cornhole board. The player then loses the throw and the bag is removed if it landed on the cornhole board. [5] X Research source This means that they don't earn any points and the opposite team or player takes their turn. The foul line that stretches from the front edge of the cornhole board to in front of the player may be physically drawn on the court or imaginary."

      "content": "Collect and lay out your cornhole boards and bags. Place your cornhole boards 27 ft (8.23 m) apart, with the front of the boards facing each other. Gather 4 bags of the same color for one team, and 4 bags of a different color for the other team. [6] X Research source Place your cornhole boards 12 ft to 15 ft (3.66 m to 4.57 m) apart if you have players who are younger or older, or if you have players who use a wheelchair or crutches. Regulation cornhole boards are 2 ft by 4 ft (0.61 m by 1.22 m). The hole is 6 in (15.24 cm) in diameter and positioned 9 in (22.86 cm) from the top of the board. Each regulation cornhole bag measures 6 in by 6 in (15.24 cm by 15.24 cm) and weighs approximately 1 lb (0.45 kg)."

      "title": "Flip a coin to decide which player or team tosses their bag first.",
      "content": "Flip a coin to decide which player or team tosses their bag first. If you’re playing doubles, flip a coin to decide which team throws first, then flip another coin to decide which player in the team throws first. After that, take your position beside the goal board and alternate turns between each team and/or player. [7] X Research source You can also play rock, paper, scissors to determine who goes first if you don’t have a coin on you. If you’re playing using cancellation scoring, you can also determine who goes first in the next round by whoever scored points most recently."

      "content": "Toss your bean bags at the opposite board until all 8 are thrown. Pitch your bags using an underhand motion from the side of your board to the opposite board. Alternate turns between one team or player and the opposite team or player. If you’re playing in teams, alternate each throw between team members. [8] X Research source For a singles game, both players stand on opposite sides of the board. For doubles, players stand on either side of the board facing the other team."

After both teams have thrown all 4 of their bags, count your points according to where the bags are on the board using the scoring method of your choice. Collect the bags up after the scores are tallied and begin the next round. [9] X Research source An optional rule: if both players score the same amount of points in a round, the game is a “wash” and no one gets any points. To keep score during a game, ask a person who isn’t playing to keep track, use magnetic scorekeepers, or download a cornhole scoring app like Scoreholio or the American Cornhole Association Tournament app ."
