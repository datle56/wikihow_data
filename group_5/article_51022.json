      "title": "Black auras mean you’re overcome by negative feelings or energy.",
      "content": "Black auras mean you’re overcome by negative feelings or energy. An aura is a field of energy around your body that changes color to reflect your inner emotional and spiritual well-being. When an aura is black, it means you’re experiencing negative emotions—grief, depression, loneliness, or a grudge, for example—that you’re struggling to confront or let go of. You may even have an emotional or spiritual obstacle that’s blocking the flow of energy between your chakras. [1] X Research source In this sense, a black aura is a sign of emptiness, or that something’s “missing” from your spiritual well-being."

      "title": "Spiritually, a black aura might mean you’re feeling lost or directionless.",
      "content": "Spiritually, a black aura might mean you’re feeling lost or directionless. One of your core beliefs may have been shaken, or maybe you feel so overwhelmed with grief or frustration that you’ve given up hope and feel defeated. Whereas having a goal to work toward and feeling fulfilled can make your aura bright and vibrant, feeling stuck or passionless can allow darkness to creep in and even turn your aura black."

      "title": "Black auras aren't the same as dark or dingy auras of another color.",
      "content": "Black auras aren't the same as dark or dingy auras of another color. Auras of any color—even bright shades like yellow or pink—can become dark, murky, or clouded with negative energy when you’re feeling down or suffering from an emotional or energetic blockage. This is not the same as a truly black aura, which is far more rare and indicates a more overwhelming or complete energy blockage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Suppressed or negative emotions",
      "content": "Suppressed or negative emotions If you’re bottling up your feelings instead of expressing and confronting them head on, your aura may turn black. Sometimes this is caused by events out of your control—the death of a loved one, a battle with depression, or a life change that’s left you feeling lonely, like moving. Other times, the cause is something you can control. Anger, hatred, or grudges—things you know are bad for you but that you can’t seem to let go of—can turn your aura black, too. [2] X Research source Long-term grudges or an inability to forgive others (or yourself) are especially likely to fuel a black aura."

    {
      "title": "Physical injury or trauma",
      "content": "Physical injury or trauma If only a part of your aura is black, it might mean you’re suffering from an injury, illness, or health problem related to the body part that the black patch of aura is hovering over. For example, if you recently broke your arm and it’s depressing you because you can’t play your favorite sport, there may be a black blotch in your aura around the affected arm."

      "title": "Blocked or unbalanced chakras",
      "content": "Blocked or unbalanced chakras Chakras are swirling pools of spiritual energy inside your body, each one with a different aura color associated with it. When all of your chakras are open and balanced, energy flows freely between them and your aura is radiant and bright. However, when a physical or emotional injury blocks or closes a chakra, your aura may dim or become black until you cleanse your chakras . [3] X Research source Black auras don’t stem from one chakra specifically, but they are sometimes thought to be related to the Root Chakra, which grounds you and makes you feel secure at the deepest levels."

      "title": "Dark spirits",
      "content": "Dark spirits In rare cases, a dark or negative presence—like a spirit or a spell cast on you by someone else—can attach itself to your aura and drain you of your energy. These forces aren’t necessarily “evil,” but can feed off of your negative feelings and reactions, blackening your aura. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Black auras reflect your current emotional state, not your personality.",
      "content": "Black auras reflect your current emotional state, not your personality. Unlike other aura colors, which reflect long-term aspects of your personality, black auras represent more temporary feelings of despair, loss, sadness, or blockage. In this way, a black aura just means you’re going through a tough time (everyone experiences hardship at some point in their lives) and doesn’t show that you’re a bad person with negative personality traits. [5] X Research source If anything, a black aura might mean you’re sensitive or emotionally deep, perhaps with an unresolved issue that’s causing your black aura in the first place."

    {
      "title": "A black aura does not mean you’re evil or a bad person.",
      "content": "A black aura does not mean you’re evil or a bad person. A black aura reflects your inner emotional state without making a judgment on the quality of your character. Everyone, no matter how “good” or “bad” they are, experiences periods of sadness, turmoil, change, or upheaval. It’s natural for your aura to turn black if you find yourself in tough circumstances, and it doesn’t say anything about what kind of person you are. [6] X Research source In fact, no aura color is inherently good or bad, and it’s normal for your aura to shift colors and shades as your emotional and spiritual well-being change."

      "title": "Hold off on dating with a black aura to focus on improving yourself.",
      "content": "Hold off on dating with a black aura to focus on improving yourself . When your aura is black, it means you’ve got some significant emotional and personal work to do before you’re in a position to offer the support and attention that a healthy relationship needs. Focus on your relationship with yourself, identify what past experience is blackening your aura, and make a plan to work through the issue before jumping into the dating pool. [7] X Research source Take yourself out on a solo date or spend a night in practicing self-care to spend some quality alone time with yourself. Take a moment to check in with your feelings and reflect on what you can do to improve your mental and emotional health. For example, you may be struggling with a black aura because you can’t let go of the hurt of a past breakup. Rather than jumping to the next partner, let yourself feel your feelings, acknowledge them, and release them. Remember that you don’t need someone else to “complete you.” You’re more than capable of finding happiness (and brightening your aura) on your own!"

To find your dream job , consider what positions or fields speak to your talents, passions, or values, and be patient with yourself while you balance searching for work with taking care of your well-being at your current job. [8] X Research source If you truly can’t stand your current job, consider finding temporary work that gets you outside or in nature, like gardening, pet care, or park management. Nature is very grounding and spiritually healing, and can soothe your black aura while you look for your next long-term job."

      "content": "Try cleansing your aura with daily chakra meditation. A cleanse will clear your aura of negative energy from others that may be blackening it. Get comfortable in a quiet spot where you can meditate and focus on your lower chakras that ground you to the Earth. Then, visualize a waterfall or bright light washing over you, clearing away any energy that doesn’t belong to you or serve you. After a few moments, say out loud “What's mine is mine, and anything doesn't belong to me, I return to its source cleansed and purified. I let go of any energy or emotions that don't belong to me.” Finish the cleansing by imagining bright light shining from within you.

If you have a specific aura color you want, like red, blue, or green, change your environment to surround yourself with it. Wear clothing and accessories in that color, put out decorations in that color, and even try to eat foods of that color.
