On your turn, pick up the stones in 1 of the cups on your side of the board. Never pick up stones from your opponent’s side of the board to start your turn. You must start your turn by emptying one of your cups."

Move counter-clockwise around the board to redistribute any remaining stones. Only put 1 stone into each cup.

When 1 of you has no stones in any of the 6 cups on your side, the game is over. Stop taking turns at this point. For example, if you empty the last of your cups on your turn, then the game would end right after your turn. Play would not pass to your opponent."

If you have the most stones, then you win. If your opponent has the most stones, they win. It does not matter how many more stones you have than your opponent or vice versa. For example, if you have 26 stones and your opponent only has 18 stones, then you win the game. But if your opponent has 21 stones and you have 20, then your opponent is the winner."

Any stones that remain on the board will not count towards either player’s points. For example, say your opponent ends the game by clearing the stones from their side, but you still have stones on your side. These stones do not count towards either of your points. The person with the most stones in their mancala is the winner. For example, if you have 21 stones in your mancala and your opponent has 20 stones, then the other 7 stones still on the board are neutral. You would be the winner because you have the most stones."

By placing your last stone into an empty cup on your side, you can capture your opponent’s stones in the opposite cup. Look for a cup that would allow you to do this. Then, find a cup with the right amount of stones in it and collect them. For example, if you see an empty cup on your side and spot a cup 2 spaces away with 2 stones in it, then pick up these stones to make the move."

As long as the last cup you dropped a stone into was on your side and empty, you may capture the stones in your opponent’s cup. You also get the stone you placed into your cup. For example, if there are 4 stones in your opponent’s cup, then capture those 4 plus your 1 stone for a total of 5 stones. Remember, it does not matter how many stones are in your opponent’s cup. Whether there is 1, 2, 3 or more stones in a cup, you get to capture them all using this strategy!"

In this variation, you can capture stones the normal way, or depending on the number of stones in your opponent’s cups. If the last cup you place stones in on your turn is an opponent’s cup with 2 or 3 stones in it, capture the stones in that cup. You can also take the stones in any other preceding cups with 2 or 3 stones in them. For example, if you place 1 stone into 4 of your opponent’s cups and they each have 2 or 3 stones in them after you do this, then you can capture the stones in all 4 cups. However, if only the first and last cup out of 4 have 2 or 3 stones in them, then you can only capture the stones in these cups."

If they do, then you can capture these stones by placing stones into them for a total of 2 to 3 stones per cup. Gather up stones from 1 of the cups on your side of the board.
