      "content": "Leader Sierra's team has been updated for April 2024. Currently, Sierra's team can include the following Pokémon in Pokémon GO: Phase 1 will always have a Trapinch. Phase 2 can have either a Sableye, Milotic, or Honchcrow. Phase 3 can have either a Victreebel, Alakazam, or Houndoom."

      "content": "Focus on Fairy-, Ice-, and Grass-types to beat Leader Sierra. Below are some of the best choices to beat Leader Sierra, but you should use Pokémon you have that are the strongest , as even a strong Pokémon can beat a non-ideal encounter. If you'd like to formulate your own team, keep reading the rest of this section to learn more about what Pokémon types are best for each phase. Tyranitar: Bring along a Tyranitar with moves like Smack Down, Bite, Brutal Swing, or Stone Edge to take advantage of Phase 3's Rock- and Dark-type weaknesses. Abomasnow: Bring along an Abomasnow with Razor Leaf, Powder Snow, Blizzard, and/or Weather Ball Ice to help take down Trapinch and any of Sierra's three possible Phase 2 choices. Primarina: Bring a Primarina with Charm and Moonblast to handle Sableye and Honchcrow. Sharpedo: Bring a Blaziken that knows Bite, Waterfall, Crunch, or Hydro Pump to deal with Trapinch and Alakazam. Mewtwo: Bring a Mewtwo with moves like Psycho Cut, Confusion, Shadow Ball, and/or Psystrike as a strong all-rounder."

      "title": "The best Pokémon for Phase 1 should have Grass-, Ice-, or Water-type moves.",
      "content": "The best Pokémon for Phase 1 should have Grass-, Ice-, or Water-type moves. Since Trapinch is weak against Grass-, Ice-, and Water-type attacks, it’s good to have a Pokémon that knows one of these move types to take it down quickly. However, this isn't necessary, and you can use any well-rounded, strong Pokémon."
    },
    {
      "title": "The best Pokémon for Phase 2 should know Fairy and/or Electric-type moves.",
      "content": "The best Pokémon for Phase 2 should know Fairy and/or Electric-type moves. Two of the three Pokémon that Sierra can send out during Phase 2—Milotic and Honchcrow—are weak to Electric-types. Sableye is an outlier, however, and takes damage from Fairy-type moves, so you may want to consider a Pokémon with moves in this skillset as well."

      "title": "There isn’t a Pokémon that naturally counters all Phase 3 Pokémon.",
      "content": "There isn’t a Pokémon that naturally counters all Phase 3 Pokémon. Sierra can send out a Victreebel (Grass- and Poison-type), an Alakazam (a Psychic-type), or a Houndoom (a Fire- and Dark-type). These Pokémon don’t have any overlapping weaknesses, so you might try having a Pokémon that targets 2 of the 3 possible Pokémon. A Fire- and Ghost-type Pokémon like Chandelure with moves like Incinerate, Hex, Flame Charge, and Shadow Ball could target both Victreebell and Alakazam. A Dark- and Fighting-type Pokémon like Scrafty with moves like Snarl, Counter, Foul Play, and Power-Up Punch could target both Alakazam and Houndoom. A Ground- and Ice-type Pokémon like Mamoswine with moves like Powder Snow, Mud Slap, Avalanche, and High Horsepower could target both Houndoom and Victreebel."

The indicated PokéStop is secretly a Leader Hideout, but the Hideout looks like a normal PokéStop until you're in range. You can tell that a PokéStop is a Leader Hideout because there will be a Team GO Rocket Leader standing next to it."

If the Leader Hideout disappears, you can keep challenging Leaders at new Hideouts as your Rocket Radar is not consumed until you win a battle against a leader."
