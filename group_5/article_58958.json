However, check your tongue often to make sure that the swelling is improving and not getting worse. Most people experience swelling for 3 to 5 days.

Sucking on popsicles, drinking ice water, and eating ice cream can also help. Suck gently on ice or popsicles to avoid irritating the piercing. For some parts of your body, too much ice can decrease blood flow and interfere with proper healing. However, your tongue is packed with blood vessels, so apply ice as often as necessary to control swelling and pain. [4] X Research source"

A reputable piercer should know of local medical professionals who are knowledgeable about piercings. If your piercer isn’t sure, just give your primary doctor a call.

Redness, pain, and swelling are normal, but these should get better over time. Your piercing might not be healing properly if these symptoms don’t subside within 2 to 4 weeks."
