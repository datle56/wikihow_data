      "title": "Mix the egg yolk and yogurt.",
      "content": "Mix the egg yolk and yogurt. In a small bowl, beat the yolk from 1 egg. Next, add 6 tablespoons of plain yogurt, and use a spoon to mix until the ingredients are fully combined. Egg yolk is rich in proteins and fats, so it helps strengthen and moisturize dry, brittle hair. In addition to protein, yogurt contains lactic acid, which helps remove dirt and product buildup while also moisturizing the hair. Milk products, such as yogurt, can condition your hair and give it a beautiful shine."

      "title": "Apply the mask to your hair and allow it to sit.",
      "content": "Apply the mask to your hair and allow it to sit. When the egg yolk and yogurt are mixed, smooth the mixture over your hair, paying special attention to the ends. Let the mask sit on your hair for approximately 20 minutes so the ingredients have time to penetrate. While the mask is sitting on your hair, it’s a good idea to put a shower cap over your head. That will help warm the mask so your hair absorbs the proteins more easily."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the mask from your hair and wash normally.",
      "content": "Rinse the mask from your hair and wash normally. After 20 minutes, wash the mask out of your hair with plain water. Work carefully to ensure that you remove all of the mixture. Next, use your normal shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair as you normally would. When you’re rinsing the mask from your hair, use cool water. If you use warm or hot water, it may cook the egg yolk, making it more difficult to rinse it."

      "content": "Mash the avocado. Place a ripe avocado that’s been peeled and pitted into a small bowl, and use a fork to crush it. Continue mashing the avocado until it has a smooth, creamy consistency. [1] X Research source Avocado helps moisturize and revitalize the hair."

      "content": "Add the mayonnaise. After you’ve mashed the avocado, mix 2 tablespoons (30 g) of mayonnaise into the bowl. Stir it into the avocado until a smooth, thick paste forms.

      "content": "Cover your hair with the mask and let it sit. Use your hands to carefully apply the thick paste to your hair, massaging it in with your fingers. To see the full benefits of the mask, allow it to sit on your head for approximately 30 minutes.

      "title": "Combine the water and gelatin in a pan.",
      "content": "Combine the water and gelatin in a pan. Pour ⅓ cup (177 ml) of water into a small saucepan. Carefully sprinkle 1 tablespoon (9.25 g) of powdered gelatin over the water, whisking the entire time to prevent lumps from forming. [5] X Research source Gelatin contains keratin proteins, which bind with the hair to strengthen it. If your hair needs extra moisture, you can substitute coconut milk for the water. You can also use peppermint, rosemary, or nettle herbal tea in place of the water. They help boost shine."

      "title": "Heat the mixture until it is steaming.",
      "content": "Heat the mixture until it is steaming. Place the water and gelatin mixture on the stove, and turn the heat to medium. Allow the mixture to heat until steam starts rising from the saucepan, which should take approximately 5 to 8 minutes. [6] X Research source Stir the mixture regularly as it heats so the gelatin doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan."

      "title": "Remove the mixture from the heat and add the other ingredients.",
      "content": "Remove the mixture from the heat and add the other ingredients. Once the mixture is steaming, take the pan off the heat and allow it to cool for 5 minutes. Next, mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon (7 g) of honey, stirring until all of the ingredients are fully combined. [7] X Research source The mixture should still be warm, but not hot enough to be uncomfortable to touch when you mix in the other ingredients. In addition to the vinegar and honey, you can mix in 1 to 2 tablespoons (50 to 100 g) of mashed banana or avocado or 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oil, such as olive, coconut, almond or argan, for extra moisture."

      "title": "Apply the mask to wet hair and allow it to sit.",
      "content": "Apply the mask to wet hair and allow it to sit. While the mixture is still warm, use your hands to work it through wet, clean hair from the roots to the ends. When your entire head is covered, let the mask sit on your hair for 10 to 30 minutes. [8] X Research source The longer you allow the mask to sit on your hair, the better results that you’ll see. If you plan to leave the mask on for longer than 10 minutes, put a shower cap over your head or wrap your hair in plastic wrap to keep the mask from drying out."

Follow up with a good conditioner, and let your hair air dry. [9] X Research source Using the mask once a month is usually enough to see results. Don’t use it more than once a week."

      "content": "Mash the bananas. While you’ll mix the mask up in a blender, it helps to break up the bananas beforehand. Peel 3 overripe bananas, and place them in a small bowl. Use a fork to mash the fruit into a smooth, thick paste. If you have an extremely powerful blender, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Puree the bananas, honey, and coconut oil in a blender. After you’ve mashed the bananas, place them in the pitcher of a blender. Add 2 tablespoons (14 g) of raw honey and 1 tablespoon (14 g) coconut oil, and puree the mixture until it has a thick, creamy consistency, which should take approximately 15 to 30 seconds. If you find that your blender needs some liquid to really blend the mask, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of water. Coconut oil can moisturize and condition your hair so it feels softer."
