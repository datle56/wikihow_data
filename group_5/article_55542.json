This is important no matter what, but it's especially important if you're hooking up with a relative stranger who you haven't spent much time with. Send a text to someone you trust who's local and let them know the details of your encounter. [1] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source For example, you might text, \"Bob Smith who I met at Hot Bar tonight is coming home with me! Please call if you don't hear from me before 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.\" If you're going to the other person's home or to a hotel, give your friend the address and apartment or room number so they know exactly where you are. Don't just spring this on someone out of the blue! Talk to your friend ahead of time and ask if they're willing to be your contact person. You might say, \"I'm thinking about having a one-night stand this weekend. Would you be willing to text or call me and make sure I'm safe?\""

If you don't want the encounter to last beyond one night, that means making sure you don't pick up an STI or have to deal with an unwanted pregnancy. Always plan on having protected sex and make sure any potential partner is good with that as well. If you're going to be using condoms, have your own with you—don't rely on the other person to have them. [2] X Research source Discuss safer sex with them before you start getting physical. If your potential partner is reluctant or refuses to wear protection, find someone else. That person doesn't respect themselves or you. Get tested for STIs at least once every 6 months if you've been sexually active with more than one person. Let your potential partner know when you last had an STI test and what the results were.

It's a lot easier than going to a stranger's place for the first time. [4] X Research source You're more likely to fully enjoy the experience if you're in your own territory and can relax and feel comfortable. Safety is always important as well. If you're at home, you're at least at a place where friends and family will know to look for you if something happens."

      "content": "Stay sober to keep the experience safe and memorable. Drugs and alcohol put women at greater risk for sexual assault. It also lowers your inhibitions, which can make you more likely to do something that you might regret after the fact. Besides, you want to remember everything about this experience, right? You certainly don't want to wake up with a hangover wondering what happened last night. [5] X Research source If you go out with your potential partner before the hookup, limit yourself to one or two drinks so you can keep your wits about you throughout the experience.

If there's anything that's completely off the table for you, let them know beforehand. Find out what their boundaries and limits are as well, so you can respect them. [7] X Research source If a potential partner is dismissive of your boundaries or tries to talk you out of them, they're not a safe person for you to share this experience with. Talk about body parts and ways you like (and don't like) to be touched. If there are any activities that are off-limits, let them know. For example, you might say, \"I don't want you to kiss me on the mouth. That feels too romantic and intimate—I want to keep this purely sexual.\" Reader Poll: We asked 1250 wikiHow readers who've had one-night stands, and 50% of them agreed that the best way to discuss boundaries is by letting things progress naturally and discussing boundaries as they arise.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Even though you're not looking to get into a relationship with the person, you still want them to be someone who's attentive and cares about your needs. It also helps to find someone who's a genuinely good person. If you can admire them for their personality and ethics, you'll be much more likely to have a pleasurable experience with them. If things start great and then go south, you can always block the person to make sure they can't contact you again."

Do you go to many shows?\" Try some flirtatious physical contact to let the person know your intentions and where your interests lie. For example, you might rest your hand on their leg or arm as you share a funny story. Feel free to take the lead , especially if that's something you don't normally do.

We can have fun tonight, but I need you to know that I'm not interested in dating or having a relationship.\" Talk about how discreet you intend the encounter to be. Is this something you're going to pretend never happened if you run into each other in the future? Do they want to avoid having friends or neighbors find out about it?

[16] X Research source You might want to avoid someone you're likely to see on a regular basis after the encounter—especially if you think it'll make things awkward. For example, you might not want to have a one-night stand with a coworker if you think it would be weird at work. You don't necessarily have to choose a complete stranger, though.

A one-night stand is the perfect opportunity to experiment in ways you normally wouldn't—especially if you're in a different city or you're with someone you know you're never going to see again. People tend to be less self-conscious with strangers, so you have the opportunity to try something you've always wanted to do. [17] X Research source If you've always been hesitant to be vocal before or during sex, use this as an opportunity to open up. Don't worry about being too aggressive—enjoy the freedom. Experiments and fantasies don't just relate to the things you do. Maybe you've always wanted to have sex in the kitchen or on the dining room table. Well, this is your chance."
