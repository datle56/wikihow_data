      "title": "Travel to Paleto Bay.",
      "content": "Travel to Paleto Bay. Drive on the dirt roads to the north of Beeker’s Garage. If the random event is available, you will see two red dots on your minimap. The red dots represent the two men trying to bury Antonia alive."

    {
      "title": "Kill the two men.",
      "content": "Kill the two men. They’ll start shooting at you when they notice you, so you are best served parking and using a sniper rifle as soon as they appear on your minimap. Melee combat is inadvisable, since you’re likely to be killed. Using explosives runs the risk of harming Antonia. The sniper rifle, by contrast, nets a definite kill with a single shot and will leave the second assailant frozen in shock and looking around helplessly, making them an easy target. It is also possible to line up the shot and hit both of them with a single bullet."

      "content": "Walk up to Antonia to rescue her, then gather money. Approaching her triggers a cutscene in which your character unties her. Afterward, she will follow you. You can take this opportunity to collect the money that was dropped by the two men you killed. They will have dropped around $2,000 to $3,000."

      "content": "Drive Antonia to Vinewood Hills. She will follow you to your vehicle. After she enters the vehicle, she’ll make a call and tell you to take her to Vinewood Hills. Your minimap navigation will guide you to the location. The entire trip is a little over six miles."

      "content": "Drop her off, then wait for your reward. A few minutes after she exits your vehicle in Vinewood Hills, you will receive a call from an unknown number. After the phone call is over, $60,000 will be wired into your player’s bank account.

However, the cultists will give you a much smaller reward of only $1,000. [2] X Research source"
