If the dimensions are given in meters, inches , feet, or some other unit of measurement, convert each dimension to centimeters (cm) before calculating the volume. This will make it easier to convert to liters. Always double-check that the dimensions of the shape you're working with have the same unit before you calculate the volume .

      "content": "Find the volume of the shape. How you find the volume will depend on the shape of the three-dimensional object you are measuring, since the volume of each type of shape is calculated differently. To find the volume of a cube , you can use the formula Volume = Length × Width × Height {\\displaystyle {\\text{Volume}}={\\text{Length}}\\times {\\text{Width}}\\times {\\text{Height}}} . [6] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. The volume of a three-dimensional shape will be in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters ( c m 3 {\\displaystyle cm^{3}} ). For instance, if a fish tank is 40.64 cm long, 25.4 cm wide, and 20.32 tall you would calculate the volume by multiplying these dimensions together: Volume = Length × Width × Height {\\displaystyle {\\text{Volume}}={\\text{Length}}\\times {\\text{Width}}\\times {\\text{Height}}} Volume = 40.64 × 25.4 × 20.32 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Volume}}=40.64\\times 25.4\\times 20.32} Volume = 20 , 975 c m 3 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Volume}}=20,975cm^{3}} To find the volume of a cylinder , start by finding the height h {\\displaystyle h} of the cylinder. Then, find the radius of the circle at the top or bottom. Next, find the area of the circle, which you can find with the formula π r 2 {\\displaystyle r^{2}} , where r is the radius. Finally, multiply the area of the circle by the height of the cylinder to find the volume. Volume {\\displaystyle {\\text{Volume}}} cylinder = {\\displaystyle =} π r 2 h {\\displaystyle r^{2}h} [7] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019."
