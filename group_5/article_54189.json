      "title": "Charismatic",
      "content": "Charismatic Batting eyelashes, sly winks, a slick compliment—it’s all par for the course for Leos. Leos could charm a raging bull, if they set their mind to it (though we don’t recommend they try)."

    {
      "title": "Courageous",
      "content": "Courageous Leos are known for being bold, strong, and courageous. After all, Leo is the only star sign out there that's ruled by the Sun and symbolized by a strong, fierce apex predator."

      "content": "Creative It’s like that big personality just overflows their body, and they have to find an outlet for it. [7] X Research source A Leo might be artsy, or they might just have a wealth of genius ideas. Whichever form it comes in, count on a Leo to think outside the box."

Their natural habitat is on the stage or in front of a camera. They were born with a microphone in hand. They will crush you at karaoke (but, to their credit, they’ll cheer the loudest when it’s your turn to sing). [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Scorpio",
      "content": "Scorpio Leos tend to mingle best with other fixed signs (signs that come in the middle of each season). Scorpios, which come at the height of autumn, gel with a Leo’s yearning for loyalty and intensity when it comes to romance. Both signs are all-or-nothing, yes-or-no when it comes to building relationships, and so they’re super compatible and tend to be on the same page. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius",
      "content": "Aquarius Another fixed sign, Aquariuses live in the magic of winter. Whereas Scorpios are great for Leos because of their similarity, Aquariuses are great because of their differences—Leos are attracted to Aquariuses’ leadership skills and ease in navigating social situations.

      "title": "Gemini",
      "content": "Gemini These 2 don’t mesh, and ought to look elsewhere for better chances at bonding. Geminis tend to be wishy-washy about their wants, which can frustrate Leos, who are eager to settle with their perfect person. Geminis don’t give attention so easily, which can lead to a severely neglected Leo. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Taurus",
      "content": "Taurus Taurus is the one fixed sign a Leo has trouble with. Both are bold, but they butt heads and become stubborn around each other. It’s a case of an unstoppable force vs an immovable object—things are bound to get explosive, and not in a good way. [21] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Virgo",
      "content": "Virgo Leos and Virgos both want the same thing: all-or-nothing with the perfect partner. That means that for a Leo and a Virgo to work, they have to be exactly perfect for each, and that’s about as likely as a lightning strike. They work better as intellectual collaborators, and not so much as close partners. [22] X Research source"
