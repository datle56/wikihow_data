      "content": "1. Set aside time for God each day. Take a small, 15-minute chunk of time to commune with God through prayer and scripture. Choose a time that works best for you, like right after you wake up or right before you go to bed. [1] X Research source Tip : Treat this special time with God as a high-priority part of your day, rather than an optional meeting. 2. Trust in the Holy Spirit. Once you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior , you invite the Holy Spirit to live inside of you and guide you . Trust that the Holy Spirit is there to help and support you, and follow where it nudges you. [2] X Research source Tip : Not sure if you’re hearing from the Holy Spirit? Dive into God’s Word to discern if you’re being led in a holy and God-fearing direction. [3] X Research source 3. Take time to study the Bible. The Bible is God’s Word to us, and reading it is one of the best ways to understand His will and plans for you. As you read, see if any verses really speak to you and your current life circumstances. [4] X Research source Tip : Following a daily devotional can be a great way to study the Bible in bite-sized chunks. 4. Appeal to God in prayer rather than making demands. Spiritual leader Olivia Woodford says to “not have a design on what the result should look like.” Instead, she advises saying something like “I put myself at Your feet, or I put myself at Your Mercy or Your Grace because I need Your Help.” Tip : If you don’t know how to start your prayer , Woodford suggests “to first express gratitude,” since “there’s so much that we all take for granted.” 5. Go to church regularly. Worshipping in a community can be a great way to hear God’s voice—plus, it’s a great way to set aside intentional time to meditate on the Bible and spend quality time with God. [5] X Research source 6. Meet with other believers. God most definitely speaks through and among multiple believers. If you’re struggling to hear the Lord, spend some time with fellow members of your church family and see if you can hear God’s voice through them. [6] X Research source Tip : It helps to meditate on Jesus’s words in Matthew 18:20: “For where two or three gather together as my followers, I am there among them.” (NLT) 7. Follow God’s instructions. Sin creates a barrier between us and God, like when we intentionally disobey his guidance and commandments. [7] X Research source With this in mind, taking time to obey God is a great way to better hear Him and be closer to Him. 8. Focus on God with a breathing exercise. As you breathe out, focus on acknowledging and repenting your wrongdoings to God. Then, as you breathe in, envision yourself handing over your life to God. [8] X Research source This exercise, known as spiritual breathing, can be a great way to grow closer to God and focus on Him, which, in turn, can help you to hear His voice."
