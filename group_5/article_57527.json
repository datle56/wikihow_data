      "content": "Design the tattoo . To make a great tattoo, put some thought into its design before you apply it to your skin. Use a regular pencil and paper to sketch out some ideas, keeping the following pointers in mind: Your eyeliner tattoo will look best with bold, simple strokes. Finer lines and more complicated designs could be more likely to smudge and become unrecognizable. Stick with clear shapes. Decide how large you want it to be. A bigger tattoo may be more likely to appear to be hand drawn, whereas a smaller tattoo may look more \"authentic.\" Design your tattoo according to the effect you want to achieve."

      "title": "Pick out eyeliner.",
      "content": "Pick out eyeliner. Go to the drugstore and buy a simple eyeliner pencil, the type that needs to be sharpened . Pick one that isn't meant to be shiny or oily; a pencil that makes smooth, dry marks will make a longer-lasting smudge-free tattoo. Jet black eyeliner makes for a striking temporary tattoo, but there's no reason not to choose more than one color. Try emerald, purple, and sapphire to create your design or add a small accent. Avoid liquid eyeliner. It's more difficult to keep this type of eyeliner in place on parts of your body other than your eyelids. [1] X Research source Practice drawing your design with your chosen eyeliner pencils on paper. Get used to the pressure you need to exert to create smooth strokes."

If you don't like it, you can wash it off and start over. You can draw your tattoo on any part of your body, but areas without a lot of hair might be easier to work with. Make sure the skin is clean and dry when you draw your design. Use a cotton swab to blend colors and create shading."

      "content": "Spray the design with hairspray. [2] X Research source The same chemicals that help hold your hair in place act as a sealant for the tattoo to keep it from coming off for a few hours. There's no need to completely soak it; just give the area a light application. You can also use a clear nail polish/topcoat instead of hairspray. The clear nail polish/topcoat can be matte or glossy; it is up to you."

      "title": "Wash it off",
      "content": "Wash it off . This tattoo will last about a day before it begins to smudge. It washes off easily with warm, soapy water. You may want to remove it before going to bed to avoid getting eyeliner on your sheets. If you're using clear nail polish instead of hairspray, you can peel it off or remove it with nail polish remover."

      "title": "Make a stencil",
      "content": "Make a stencil . You can create professional-looking temporary tattoos by making a stencil, which helps you control the tattoo design rather than relying on your drawing skills to do the job. Decide what shape you want your tattoo to be, draw it on an index card, and cut out the shape using a cutting knife or a pair of small scissors. Simple, bold shapes are the easiest ones to create with this method. Try diamonds, circles, and other geometric shapes. For a more detailed tattoo, you can create a stencil based on an existing image. Check out How to Make a Graffiti Stencil for more information on this method."

      "title": "Buy permanent markers.",
      "content": "Buy permanent markers. Choose one or more marker colors to use with your stencil. Black is a classic option, and may be the most likely to help your tattoo pass as a real one. Using another color can be just as fun. Permanent markers contain chemicals that aren't meant to be used on skin. Look for markers that are labeled as safe for this type of use. [3] X Research source If you'd rather not use permanent markers, washable markers are also fine. The tattoo just won't last quite as long. Another good ink choice is stamping ink, which comes on wet stamping pads. To use this type of ink for your tattoo, press a cotton ball onto the ink pad and use it to wipe the ink over the stencil and onto your skin."

      "title": "Apply the tattoo.",
      "content": "Apply the tattoo. Place the stencil against the part of your body where you want the tattoo to be. Use one hand to hold it firmly against the skin, so that the cut out shapes are lying flat. Use the other hand to color in the shapes with the markers you chose. When you're finished, lift the stencil away and allow the marker ink to dry. Make sure you apply the tattoo to clean, dry skin. Shave the hair in the area for a more even application. If you have trouble holding the stencil in place, try using tape to affix it to the area. You could also try applying the tattoo to a part of your body with a flatter surface."

Use Photoshop or a similar computer program meant for creating images to come up with a tattoo design. Decide whether you want the tattoo to be in black and white or color. If you have a color printer, your design can include as many colors as you want. Choose colors that will show up well against your skin. You have the chance to see the design beforehand on paper before it goes onto your skin. Keep in mind that when you apply the tattoo, the image will be reversed on your skin. That means that if your tattoo includes a word, it needs to be reversed in the design, or it will read backwards once you put it on."
