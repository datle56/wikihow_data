      "content": "Try on different nail sizes to find which fits each finger. Before painting press-on nails, you’ll likely need to try on a few sizes and shapes to find ones that fit over each of your fingernails. Your goal is to find nails that closely mimic the shape and curve of your natural nails so they’ll fit snuggly once applied. [1] X Research source Once you’ve found the right sizes, lay them out in the order you’ll apply them so they don’t get mixed up. Most press-on nails are sold in a pack with multiple sizes and shapes, so you’ll likely be able to find a size that fits each one of your nails. Some press-on nails come with a size chart, so you may want to write down the size you’re using for each finger to save yourself a bit of time in the future. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Press a thin strip of tape on the back of each nail. Using scissors, cut a small strip of tape that is thin enough to fit on the back of the press-on nails. Then, fold the tape edges inward with the adhesive side facing out so that the edges overlap and adhere together. Flip each of the press-on nails over so the bottom faces up and press the tape rolls onto the back of each nail. This will form a little adhesive roll that will allow you to stick the nails onto the cotton swabs. Instead of tape, you can roll a tiny piece of adhesive tack into a ball and press it onto the back of each nail. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Stick the end of a cotton swab onto the tape that’s adhered to the nails. Press down on the tape to make sure that the cotton swab and nail are both securely adhered. Then, flip each of the nails over so you can start painting. If you’re using adhesive tack instead of tape, you can use a toothpick instead of a cotton swab by pressing the end of the toothpick into the tack. [4] X Research source"

Then, use your dominant hand to paint the nail with the nail polish color of your choice. [5] X Research source Painting the middle of the nail from the back of the nail to the front and then the sides from back to front will help you apply the polish evenly and avoid any clumping.

      "content": "Set each nail off to the side to dry. Once you’ve completely coated one of the nails with nail polish, gently place it off to the side on a flat surface to dry. Repeat this process with each of the nails until all of them are painted with nail polish. [7] X Research source If you want to get creative with your polish, you can try doing nail art to create some fun, interesting designs. Lay a paper towel down over the flat surface to protect it in case any nail polish drips off the press-on nails."

      "content": "Apply a second coat if you want the polish color to be more opaque. Nail polish tends to be much more opaque on fake nails that on your natural nails, so you might not need a second coat. [8] X Research source However, if you want the color to be more opaque, you can apply another coat of paint to each of the nails after 2 minutes. After applying the second coat, place each of the nails off to the side on a flat, protected surface to dry."

If you want to add an extra layer of protection, paint each of the nails with a layer of top coat polish after 2 minutes. After applying the top coat, place each nail off to the side to dry completely before applying the press-on nails to your natural nails. Let the nails dry for 20 to 60 minutes. If you applied multiple coats, you’ll likely want to leave them to dry for the full 60 minutes to make sure the polish is completely set."

Once the press-on nails are adhered to each of your fingers, use the nail polish color of your choice to paint each of the nails. First, press the pads of your fingers into a flat surface to keep your fingers from moving too much. Then, paint each nail from back to front, swiping with the brush down the middle of the nail first and then filling in the sides with the excess polish on the brush.

While polish is generally more opaque on press-on nails than it would be on your nautral nails, you still might want to apply a second coat to make the polish even more opaque. When applying a second coat, let the first coat dry for about 2 minutes. Then, paint each nail with another thin coat of polish. Apply the second coat of paint to each of the nails once the first coat is partially dry but not completely set. To add a bit of pizazz to your press-on nails, use a glitter polish as your second coat. [13] X Research source"

To add an extra layer of protection for the color polish on your press-on nails, paint each nail with a layer of top coat polish 2 minutes after applying the second color coat. Then, let your nails dry completely for 20 to 60 minutes before using your fingers. [14] X Research source To get your press-on nails to dry quickly, you can soak them in an ice bath, or use a quick-dry spray or cooking spray. Nail polish takes about 24 hours to totally cure."
