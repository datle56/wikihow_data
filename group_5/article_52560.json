They can be kept in a tightly sealed package in the refrigerator for up to two months. Rinse fresh cranberries before using them and discard any that look squashed, browned, or otherwise spoiled.

      "content": "Combine the cranberries, water, and sugar in a small saucepan. Use 1 cup (240 mL) water and approximately 1/2-1 cup (100-200 g) sugar. Use less sugar if you prefer a more tart sauce or add up to 2 cups (400 g) sugar for very sweet results. [3] X Research source For a citrusy kick, add a strip of orange or lemon zest to the pan. You can also substitute orange juice for the water. [4] X Research source Add the amount of sugar you'd like if you'd rather your cranberry sauce have less sugar."

      "content": "Simmer the mixture over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. As the sauce cooks, the skins of the cranberries will split, making a popping noise that almost resembles popcorn. This allows the interior of the cranberries to escape, thickening the sauce. [5] X Research source The longer you simmer the sauce, the smoother it will be. If you prefer a chunkier sauce (similar to a pie filling), boil for closer to 5 minutes. [6] X Research source"

Allow it a few hours to reach room temperature before serving. [7] X Research source If you prefer, you can make cranberry sauce a few days in advance. Simply cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the sauce to an airtight container and store it in your refrigerator. Fresh cranberry sauce can keep for 7-10 days in the fridge or up to 1 month in the freezer. [8] X Research source Cranberry sauce can be used to top more than just turkey! Try using it to dress up baked brie or drizzle on top of roast pork."

Fresh cranberries are a great addition to many baked goods, bringing a nice sweet and sour berry flavor to your favorite recipe. Once you’ve made your batter, add about 1 cup (100 g) fresh cranberries and mix in gently. Then bake as directed. [9] X Research source The cranberries will soften as they bake so feel free to leave them whole. If you prefer, however, you can also chop them before adding to the batter for a more evenly distributed flavor. [10] X Research source"

Try using a hard squash such as butternut, acorn, or delicata. Sweet potatoes are also a good bet. You can also add cranberries to roasted Brussels sprouts for good results- just make sure to cut the Brussels sprouts in half lengthwise so they don’t fall apart.

For starchier or harder vegetables like squash, you may need to bake for a full 45 minutes. Sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts will likely be done in closer to 25 minutes. [19] X Research source To test for doneness, remove the tray from the oven and poke your vegetables with a fork. If it goes in easily, they're finished. For more even cooking, use a hard spatula to toss your veggies and cranberries about halfway through the cooking time. [20] X Research source If you prefer less caramelized, more firm cranberries, try adding them later in the roasting period for longer-cooking vegetables like squash. Remove the tray from the oven after about 25 minutes and add the cranberries. Toss well before returning to the oven for 15-20 minutes. [21] X Research source"

Your roasted veggies and cranberries will keep well in the fridge for 3-4 days. [22] X Research source Want to transform your roasted veggies and cranberries into an impressive appetizer?
