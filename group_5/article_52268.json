If your old hard drive has 500 GB of storage space, you will need an SSD with at least 500 GB. Also, be sure to find an SSD that fits your computer. Inspect your computer's specifications and determine whether or not your motherboard requires an M.2 drive, a U.2 drive, a 2.5in SATA, or an SSD add-in card. [1] X Research source To install your SSD on your laptop , you will likely need to consult your computer's user manual and handle the SSD with care. Also, make sure that you can connect a new hard drive to your laptop. On some laptop models, the hard drive is soldered in, making it difficult or impossible to replace. If you get an SSD that is smaller than your current hard drive, you may need to free up some hard drive space on your computer before cloning your current hard drive. All the data on your current hard drive will need to fit on the SSD."
