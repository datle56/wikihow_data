      "content": "These signs are opposite elements, which is why they attract each other. Typically, you don’t see a water sign (Scorpio) and a fire sign (Sag) pairing up, but somehow, these two can make it work. Sagittarius’s lively, gentle nature has a tendency to attract the more brooding, serious Scorpio. They both value honesty and loyalty, so their morals are similar, and they complement each other well. [1] X Research source The main pitfall in a Scorpio Sagittarius relationship is a Scorpio’s tendency to be stubborn. This is a pretty foreign concept for the mutable, easy going Sag, and it can cause them to clash."

      "title": "Sag’s spontaneous vibe blends well with Scorpio’s intense energy.",
      "content": "Sag’s spontaneous vibe blends well with Scorpio’s intense energy. Sagittariuses are more likely to be adventurous and try new things. Meanwhile, Scorpios love to stick to what they know. If both people in the relationship can compromise with each other, they’ll have a healthy, fulfilling sex life in no time. [2] X Research source This isn’t to say that Scorpio is boring in bed—quite the opposite, in fact. However, they tend to assign more emotional depth to sex, whereas Sags view it as a fun activity to do with someone they love. Scorpio is co-ruled by the planets Mars and Pluto. Mars is known for deep emotional passion, while Pluto is the planet of energy. Pluto is also known as the planet of intensity, intimacy, and sexuality."

      "title": "A brooding Scorpio helps balance out the more whimsical Sagittarius.",
      "content": "A brooding Scorpio helps balance out the more whimsical Sagittarius. Sags aren’t known for their emotional depth, but the Scorpio doesn’t mind—they’ll do the heavy lifting in this relationship, like most water signs are used to. Unfortunately, this can sometimes mean that Scorpio will fall hard and fast, while the Sag lags behind in the relationship. [3] X Research source These two can make things work if the Scorpio lets the Sagittarius develop their feelings naturally instead of pressuring them into anything."

      "title": "Both love to learn and discover, so the conversation is always interesting.",
      "content": "Both love to learn and discover, so the conversation is always interesting. Sagittarius is ruled by the planet Jupiter, the planet of exploration, and Scorpio’s natural perception and intuition is fueled by their water sign status. This pairing will have fun exploring and going on adventures together, as well as having deep conversations about the wonders of the universe. [4] X Research source This is why Scorpios and Sags sometimes make better friends than lovers. They might not mesh well emotionally, but they can hang out all day every day and never get tired of each other."

      "title": "A fire sign wears their heart on their sleeve, while a water sign is reserved.",
      "content": "A fire sign wears their heart on their sleeve, while a water sign is reserved. Ultimately, this can lead to some conflict—the chatty, upbeat Sagittarius will wonder why the quiet, contemplative Scorpio isn’t communicating with them. However, as both signs learn to love and trust each other, their communication style will only get stronger."

      "title": "Scorpio may try to tie the Sagittarius down, which can cause conflict.",
      "content": "Scorpio may try to tie the Sagittarius down, which can cause conflict. Sags are free spirits, and they hate feeling too attached to their partners. This can cause Scorpio to feel like they can’t trust the Sag, even though both partners value honesty over everything. The pairing can work on this issue by talking freely about what they’re thinking and feeling—once they both understand where the other is coming from, they can reach a compromise that works for them both. [5] X Research source Scorpios also tend to be jealous, which is a foreign concept to Sagittariuses. Reader Poll: We asked 485 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios what they value most in a relationship, and 69% of them agreed that loyalty is most important to them. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Sagittarius is willing to compromise, while Scorpio is more stubborn. In relationships, this can lead to a lot of confusion and hurt feelings. Scorpios are much less likely to go with the flow like the easygoing Sag, and that can cause some conflict. However, if the Sag is able to give the Scorpio enough time, they might be able to work past this difference."
