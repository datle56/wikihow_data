      "content": "Soak crusties in warm saltwater for 10 minutes to loosen and remove them. Wash your hands, then dissolve ¼ teaspoon (1.3 g) of sea salt or 1 teaspoon (5 g) of table salt in 8 ounces (237 mL) of warm water (or use 0.9% sterile saline wound wash from the store). Pour your salt solution into a small cup (like a shot glass) and hold it firmly over your piercing for 10 minutes. [1] X Research source Or, apply the solution with a cotton swab if the shot glass method is too unwieldy. After soaking, gently remove the wet crusties with a fresh cotton swab or tissue. Take care not to jostle, bump, snag, or pull on the piercing. Do not pick at crusties with your fingers, especially when dry, since this can irritate your piercing and slow down healing.

[3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Do not try to “heal” or prevent crusting with ointments or lotions; this will block oxygen to the recovering skin and slow down healing.

      "content": "Crusting can occur anytime throughout healing (usually 6-9 months). Typically, crusting is more frequent or noticeable in the first weeks or months after piercing and gradually reduces over time. However, crusting can occur at any time during healing; many nipple piercings are healed after 6 to 9 months, but some take 12 months or longer to fully heal. [5] X Research source Some fully healed nipple piercings may also crust from time to time (this is normal). [6] X Research source How long it takes to heal your nipple piercing (and how long it continues to crust) is slightly different for everyone. It depends on factors like the strength of your own immune system, how well you look after the piercing while it heals, or the quality of the jewelry."

      "content": "Your body produces lymph fluid during healing which dries into a crust. During the first few days or weeks after a piercing, it’s normal for the wound to produce a pale yellow, pale green, or clear fluid that dries into a crust. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This is lymph fluid—a mixture of plasma, proteins, minerals, and white blood cells that fight infections—and it’s a crucial part of your immune system. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your body sends lymph fluid to the piercing site as a response to the new wound, and excess lymph that reaches open air dries into a crust. This is why it’s extra important not to pick at the crust around your nipple piercing. It’s an important part of healing, and removing immune system cells without proper cleaning and soaking can interfere with healing."

      "content": "Stage 1: Redness, soreness, oozing (1 week) For the first week after piercing, your nipple may be red, sore, and/or swollen. It may also ooze clear lymph fluid (not pus) or blood. This is generally the most unpleasant stage of healing, and some report pain or an itchy feeling for the first few days. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Stage 2: Crusting, some itching or soreness (6 months or longer) Stage 2 lasts the longest and varies from person to person—some may experience crusting and tenderness for several weeks, while others may have it for the entire duration of healing (6-9 months or more). Soreness and itching may happen intermittently and will decrease over time. [10] X Research source Consistent cleaning is important during this stage to prevent infection, as bacteria-containing crusties might move back inside the wound."

The skin inside has smoothed out and jewelry may be changed without significant irritation. [11] X Research source Remember, everybody heals differently. It’s not uncommon for healing to take a full year or longer."

It’s normal for a piercing to be red, swollen, tender, or itchy, or to ooze for the first few days to a week after piercing. However, these symptoms should get better or go away after a few weeks. If they get worse or if you notice excessive crusting in addition to the following symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor to treat a potential infection : [12] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The piercing site is swollen, hot, or painful.

Or, research local studios and piercers online and look for positive reviews about cleanliness and transparency—a sterile, professionally administered piercing is less likely to get infected. Do not pierce your nipple yourself or let an unlicensed piercer do it. Look for: [14] X Research source A noticeably clean studio and staff. Smoking or drinking alcohol should not be allowed and the studio should not permit customers to try on piercing jewelry. Five separate areas: a retail counter, a waiting area, a public bathroom that is never used for cleaning equipment, a brightly lit and well-ventilated piercing room, and a sterilization area off-limits to customers. A piercer who washes their hands, uses sterile equipment, and changes gloves when they touch anything other than you and the sterile equipment. If they allow you to be present while they set up, that’s a good sign they’re professional and hygienic. A “sharps” container to dispose of needles (piercing needles should not be reused). Publicly posted or readily available test results from the studio’s autoclave sterilizer device."

      "content": "Do not unnecessarily touch, twist, or remove your piercing . Resist the urge to twist, turn, rotate, move back and forth, or bend the area around your piercing. Piercings are designed to break the skin and stay still rather than move or rotate or slide back and forth. Excessive twisting or touching may irritate the wound or introduce bacteria while it’s still healing. Never twist the piercing while dry. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If instructed for cleaning, twist the jewelry gently while wet. [17] X Research source Unless you plan on removing your piercing permanently, do not take it out yourself. Have a piercer help you with changing your jewelry out, and if you have to take it out for a medical procedure, see your piercer ASAP. The piercing hole may close up or shrink in a matter of minutes (even if it’s fully healed) if the jewelry is removed."

      "content": "Soak or wash your nipple piercing 2-3 times a day. To prevent infection, always wash your hands before cleaning or handling your piercing. Clean your nipple piercing with a mild, scentless soap and warm water or do a saline or saltwater soak at least once a day (preferably 2-3 times, especially in the first weeks after piercing). Rinse the piercing thoroughly with fresh water and gently pat dry with a fresh tissue or cotton pad.

      "content": "Be careful not to snag or bump your piercing. To care for a new nipple piercing , wear loose-fitting shirts during the first few days to avoid snagging and so any oozing fluids from the piercing do not get on or stick to your clothing. [19] X Research source After a few days, wear a tight-fitting t-shirt or sports bra for support and protection against snags (especially while sleeping). [20] X Research source Also be cautious not to bump your nipple into doorways, walls, or other chest-height objects—it may be painful and cause bleeding. If your piercing becomes sore or swollen from a bump or snag, take an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen according to package instructions."

      "content": "Keep the piercing dry (outside of showering). Until your piercing is healed, avoid submerging it in unhygienic bodies of water like lakes and rivers, pools, and hot tubs. If you must get wet, place a waterproof wound sealant bandage over your nipple to keep the piercing dry. Also keep the piercing free of cosmetics, lotions, sunblock, or other sprays. [21] X Research source Keeping the nipple piercing dry also means no oral contact or contact with other bodily fluids. Depending on your motivation for getting the piercing, this may be hard to resist—just remember that an infection will only delay your piercing pleasure longer!"
