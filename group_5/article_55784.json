      "content": "Tipping isn’t expected for a piercing, but it’s a really nice gesture. Like other service industry workers, many body piercers don’t earn a significant salary and often rely on customer tips to help make ends meet. Tipping your piercer is a great way to support them both personally and professionally. [1] X Research source When you go to a studio, you aren’t just paying for a piercing—you’re paying for an experienced professional to pierce you safely and with the proper equipment. Leaving a tip is a great way to acknowledge and thank the piercer for doing a service that you couldn’t (safely) do at home. [2] X Research source While it’s great if you can leave a tip, it’s not the end of the world if you can’t, either. If you aren’t in a great financial situation yourself, your piercer doesn’t expect (or want) you to leave a huge tip. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Give a 20-30% tip if you’re really happy with your piercing experience. Let’s say that you hit it off with your piercer and got a new cartilage piercing that you really love. If the piercing service cost $50 and the jewelry cost $60 ($110 combined), your total tip could range from $22-33 (or $132-143 total). [4] X Research source Some piercing studios let you add a tip at the bottom of the receipt (like you’d do at a typical business). You can also leave a cash tip, if you’d prefer. [5] X Research source It’s okay to leave a smaller tip (like a $10 or $20 bill) if that’s what you can afford. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave a 10-15% tip if you weren’t blown away by your experience. [7] X Research source Maybe your piercer was running a little late, or their bedside manner could use a little improvement. A 10-15% tip still acknowledges your piercer’s time and expertise while also reflecting your experience. Let’s say that you just got your septum pierced—the service cost $70, while the jewelry itself cost $20 ($90 combined). A 10-15% tip of $90 would be $9-18, making your total $99-108."

      "content": "Leave no tip if you have a really bad experience. Maybe your piercer was really rude and unprofessional, or they did a really sloppy job with your piercing. If you aren’t happy with the service you received, it’s valid and understandable to not leave them a tip."

      "content": "Post a really great review online for your piercer. Tons of people consult review sites before booking appointments with piercing studios—so, a glowing, 5-star review is a fantastic way to pay it forward to your piercer. After your appointment, drop a review highlighting what you enjoyed about the experience and why you would recommend the piercer to other people (don’t be afraid to list them by name!). [8] X Research source Example: I was really nervous about getting my first helix piercing, but Kyle was very kind and helpful. He walked me through the entire piercing process, made sure I was comfortable, and gave me really thorough after-care instructions. He did a really fabulous job with my piercing, and I’ll definitely be booking him in the future!"

On the day of your piercing appointment, surprise them with a gift related to these interests and hobbies, like a set of concert tickets or a vintage vinyl record. Does your piercer have any pets? Getting them a special pet toy is a really special and personalized way to show your appreciation. [9] X Research source If you don’t know a lot about your piercer, you can always give them a gift card to a popular store. [10] X Research source"

Baked goods, coffee, candy, and energy drinks are all great ways to show your piercer how much you appreciate them if you can’t afford a big tip. You could also give them a gift certificate to a local restaurant or coffee shop. [11] X Research source"

If you hear a friend talk about getting a new piercing, give them your piercer’s contact info (along with a glowing recommendation). [12] X Research source “I heard you talk about wanting a tragus piercing. I really recommend Daniel at Blue Chameleon Studios—I had such a great experience with him when he did my conch and daith piercings.” “Whoa, you’re thinking about getting a belly button piercing? You should totally meet with Kendra. Let me grab you her socials!”"
