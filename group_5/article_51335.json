      "title": "Request a vacation access code.",
      "content": "Request a vacation access code. Netflix allows you to use your subscription while on vacation when you log into a TV outside of the account's household. Once you sign into an unfamiliar TV, Netflix will ask the account owner if they need a vacation access code via email. If the account owner confirms, you can use the access code to watch Netflix outside of the account's main household. The access code does expire, so if you rely on this method to watch Netflix outside of the main account household, the account owner can set up email forwarding to send you the access code emails automatically when they come in. This method may not work long-term, since it's intended for short-term vacations."

If you live close to where the owner of the Netflix account is, you can get around Netflix Household by logging into Netflix from their Wi-Fi. Simply connect to the account holder's Wi-Fi, open the Netflix app or Netflix.com, and stream something for a few seconds. You can then return to your own home to continue watching Netflix.

You can, however, connect to Netflix on your phone, tablet, or laptop while on the account holder's Wi-Fi, then cast or stream your portable device to your TV once you're at home."

      "content": "Use Meshnet by NordVPN. VPNs and Netflix usually don't mix, but users have found that NordVPN's Meshnet works to bypass Netflix's household restrictions. Meshnet allows you to create a virtual network of devices even if those devices are far apart from one another. Because these devices share a unique Mehsnet IP address, Netflix will believe they are on the same network. To get started, both you and the account owner should install NordVPN on your devices and enable Meshnet. Meshnet is available to all users for free, even if they don't have a NordVPN subscription. [2] X Research source Add your devices to the account owner's Meshnet. Meshnet is compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iPhone, iPad, and Android TV."
