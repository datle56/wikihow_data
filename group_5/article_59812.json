      "content": "Budget for things like equipment, packaging, and advertising. Before you start making soap to sell, make a list of everything you’ll need. In addition to the obvious stuff, like the raw materials, keep in mind the cost of things like liability insurance or fees for setting up a craft fair stall. [1] X Research source Your average home business costs at least $30,000 to get started, but you probably won’t need nearly that much to start making and selling soap. [2] X Research source Many handmade soap bloggers estimate that you can get things off the ground for closer to $1000, especially if you’re producing small batches and aren’t hiring any other employees.

For example: [4] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If you plan to use any color additives, check to make sure the additive is on the FDA’s list of approved products for use in cosmetics. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Don’t try to claim that your soap treats any sort of medical condition without approval from the FDA. To make these claims, you must get your product officially classified as a drug or pharmaceutical. Follow the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to avoid contaminating or mislabeling your products.

      "content": "Even if you do everything right, the unexpected can happen. Before you start selling your soap—or even giving it away to friends and family—invest in a home business insurance policy. This will protect you from claims by consumers in case anything goes wrong (e.g., if someone has an allergic reaction or claims your product label is misleading). It will also cover the cost of damages in case your product is accidentally lost or damaged. [9] X Research source You can buy liability insurance directly from the insurance company, or join a trade organization that offers insurance coverage as a membership benefit. For example, you can get insurance coverage through the Indie Business Network or the Handcrafted Soap & Cosmetics Guild. Depending on how big your business is, where you make your soap, and whether you have employees other than yourself, you might need to purchase several different types of insurance. These could include general liability, product liability, home-based business, or commercial property insurance. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Good accounting is important for any business. Tracking profits and expenses will help you understand how your business is doing and give you a sense of where you need to make improvements—for instance, you might need to spend more on advertising, adjust your prices, or cut packaging costs. It’s also crucial to keep good records for tax purposes. Use software like QuickBooks to help you track your finances, and set up a dedicated bank account just for business purposes. [11] X Research source As your soap making business grows, you might want to hire a professional accountant to help you keep track of everything."

      "content": "You’ll need to charge more than you spend to make a profit. Sit down and create a detailed budget, then decide how much you want to mark up your products. You’ll need to take into account things like the cost of materials, labor, packaging, and overhead (other costs associated with your business, like advertising and fees for permits). From there, set a bare minimum price that you’d be able to charge per bar in order to make money back. [12] X Research source For instance, if it costs you $1.83 to make a single bar of soap, you might decide to charge at least twice that amount ($3.66) per bar for wholesale, and 4 times as much ($7.32) for retail. If possible, pad the price even more to take into account unexpected situations, like the price of an important ingredient going up. In addition to calculating your own production costs, look at similar products to find out what they usually sell for. For instance, if most soaps with the same ingredients tend to sell for an average of $12, aim for somewhere in that price range. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Do some research to find out what people are looking for. Different soaps meet different needs. You’ll have a better time selling your product if you know exactly who you’re pitching it to, and what they want. For example, you might market your ultra-gentle, moisturizing soaps to people with sensitive skin, or develop a line of glittery soaps for teens who love mermaids and unicorns. [14] X Research source Don’t try to make too many different things, especially when you’re starting out. Target a really specific audience and develop a few excellent products that they’ll want to tell their friends about! To get a sense of what’s out there and what people want, look at other shops selling handmade soaps. Check out which ones sell best and what people are saying about them. For instance, you might find that a lot of people are looking for a particular scent, or that there’s a big market for vegan ingredients."

Choose a name for your store or product line that reflects your values and those of your customers. Work with an artist or graphic designer to develop an attractive logo and graphics for your storefront and labels if you don’t feel confident about making your own. Choose ingredients and packaging that also reflect what you want your business to be about. [15] X Research source For instance, maybe it’s important to your customers to buy an environmentally friendly product. In that case, use minimal, eco-friendly packaging, such as wrappers made of recycled paper. Advertise that your soap is made with sustainable ingredients. Create descriptions for your products that reflect your brand. For instance, “Celestial Soaps are made with planet-friendly ingredients and nature-inspired scents to soothe your body and soul.”"

Use social media posts as an opportunity to interact with your customers. Be ready to answer questions, address people’s concerns, or just have a chat."

For example, if they buy the product directly from you at a discounted price, that’s wholesale. If they take the product from you and pay you a percentage of the profits once they make a sale, that would be consignment.
