      "content": "Use a potting mixture meant for orchids. The size of the pot depends on the size of your orchid, but choose one just big enough to fit the roots of your plant without twisting or manipulating them. Make sure it has drainage holes in the bottom and get a saucer to put under the pot. Next, cover the bottom of the pot with the potting mixture. Then, set the plant inside the center of the pot with the lower leaves hanging just above the rim. Add more potting mix to fill the gaps in between the roots. Keep filling the pot until you've reached below the base of the lower leaves. [1] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Avoid using a pot that's too big for your plant. Its size makes it hold excess water, which can rot the roots. Try not to leave any air bubbles between the soil and the roots. It's also best to avoid using regular houseplant soil to pot your orchid. Water the plant after potting!"
