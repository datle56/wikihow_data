      "content": "You can remove a ton of extra liquid just by using your hands. You won’t be able to get everything, but before you move on in the drying process, squeeze your pillow to remove extra water. Be sure to do this over a bucket, sink, tub, or outdoor area—that way, you won’t make a mess. [1] X Research source Be careful not to twist and wring out your pillow because you could damage the material."

      "content": "Set your pillow in a sunlit area with great ventilation. The keys to drying out a foam pillow are heat, air, and time. Find a clean spot on the ground (where your pillow won't pick up stains!), and if possible, make sure direct sunlight is hitting it. Make sure that air can flow through the pillow freely (on as many sides as possible). [2] X Research source [3] X Research source If it’s raining or overcast, your pillow will dry faster inside your home. In this case, place the pillow somewhere with great ventilation (you could even point a fan in its direction!). Drying indoors will take longer, sometimes up to 24 hours."

      "content": "Let both sides get equal air and sunlight so your pillow dries faster. This isn’t a requirement, but it might be wise to turn your pillow over after a couple hours in the sun. This way, you won’t have to wait around for the bottom of your pillow to dry long after the top has finished. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Your pillow might need a little extra time in the sun before it's ready for use. Squeeze or poke your pillow to feel for excess moisture. If it’s all dry, you’re done! If it’s not, you’ll need to leave your pillow out a little longer. [6] X Research source Don't jump the gun and bring it back inside before your pillow is dry. If water is left undried, it could be a breeding ground for mold and mildew. If you're really pressed for time, speed up the process by blowing a hairdryer on a low setting."
