      "content": "Clear a path. Make sure that the path you will utilize to move the sofa bed is or will be clear of all obstructions. Also take note of low ceilings or extremely narrow passages. Use a measuring tape, if available, to measure the width and heights of these obstacles and compare them against the dimensions of the sofa."

      "content": "Have a plan of action. Make sure you and your moving partner are clear about what you will be doing so you can synchronize your actions to make the move more efficient and less likely to hurt anyone. Discuss and rehearse the movement for the areas that may cause a potential problem in moving the sofa."

    {
      "title": "Remove the mattress and pillows.",
      "content": "Remove the mattress and pillows. To lighten the load, remove the mattress. This can usually be done by fully extending the sofa bed to its bed position. On the underside you will notice fabric ties connected to the mattress and then knotted around the frame. Untie each of the ties and move the mattress to an area out of the way. Once this is complete, fold the frame back into the sofa. Do not replace any of the pillows or cushions."

    {
      "title": "Tie off the frame.",
      "content": "Tie off the frame. You will want to tie off the metal frame in order to prevent it from unfolding while you are moving the sofa bed. To do this you will need a rope approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) in length. In the front of the sofa, where one would sit and around the center tie the mattress to the front of the sofa bed. If this is not available you can tie the mattress to the back or the arms of the sofa."

      "title": "Lay sofa bed on its back.",
      "content": "Lay sofa bed on its back. Now you will want to lay the cardboard on the ground and lay the back of the sofa bed on to the cardboard. At this point you may decide to use the rope to secure the sofa bed to the piece of cardboard. If you have furniture dollies you can set the sofa on them after you have secured the sofa on the cardboard."

      "title": "Remove the feet.",
      "content": "Remove the feet. If possible remove the feet of the sofa to ease its passage through doors. If this is not possible, skip to next step."

    {
      "title": "Move the sofa through the door.",
      "content": "Move the sofa through the door. Slide the sofa on its back on the cardboard (and furniture dollies) to the first door. If the feet are removed it should narrowly pass right through. If not, you may have to angle it such that each set of feet pass through."

    {
      "title": "Move the sofa down the stairs.",
      "content": "Move the sofa down the stairs. Remove the furniture dollies, if you have them. Slide the sofa forward while holding down pressure on the side furthest from the stairs. The sofa will begin to tilt downwards as it is moved forward. Slowly allow the sofa to lay on the stairs. Move the sofa until it is completely on the stairs. The person furthest down the stairs will need to make sure the cardboard does not catch on the stairs and direct the person highest on the stairs of when to push. The cardboard reduces the friction between the sofa and the stairs, thus making the stairs an easy obstacle to deal with. If the stairs corner or change direction, as in a flight of stairs, you will need to stand the sofa up on one of its ends (the arms). Then walk it, that is to say move it as though it were walking by sliding one side then the other, to the next flight of stairs such that the cardboard is facing the side of the stairs. Slowing lay the sofa down on the stairs. One person will need to guide the sofa down while ensuring that it does not slip while the other person will need to use their hands over their head to ease the sofa back down on the stairway slope. Repeat this step until the sofa is completely down the stairs."
