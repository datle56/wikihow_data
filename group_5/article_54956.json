Just mix distilled vinegar with water, pour it into a spray bottle, and spray the solution in and around mole holes. [1] X Research source Reapply the solution to the area every few days. White vinegar can also repel insects, a mole’s main food source, which might help drive the critters away from your yard. [2] X Research source Try to avoid spraying the solution directly on plants—it can burn and damage grasses and leaves. [3] X Research source"

For areas where spraying the ground might damage your lawn or other plants, try dipping sponges or rags in full-strength white distilled vinegar. [4] X Research source Place them in bowls and put them near mole holes or anywhere moles have been before. Re-soak the sponges or rags every day, especially after it rains. Apple cider vinegar is a popular alternative that can also repel ants, spiders, and mosquitos. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread nematodes in your yard to limit the mole’s food source. Garden nematodes , or roundworms, are harmless parasites that can eat a variety of insects that moles love to eat. Not only do they help limit a mole’s food source, driving them from your garden, but they can also feed on other insect pests that may be damaging your garden. [6] X Research source Make sure to choose a variety of roundworms that won’t damage your plants. Some grubs, like earthworms, are beneficial to your garden. Nematodes are a great choice because they tend to leave these grubs alone and feed on other insects."

Milky spore powder can control Japanese beetle grubs and other grubs that moles like to feed on, which can drive the small mammals away from your garden. [7] X Research source Sprinkle the powder on grub-infested soil and around mole holes, then water the top. [8] X Research source Milky spore powder can survive underneath your lawn for 15 to 20 years, making it a great long-term solution for pest control. If you’ve tried natural methods to remove the mole’s food source and it’s still invading your yard, consider hiring a pest control company to treat for grubs and beetles. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Install a solar-powered or ultrasonic mole repeller. Some store-bought mole repellers emit a low-frequency vibration through the soil that mimics the digging of predators and encourages moles to dig elsewhere. [10] X Research source Other repellers emit a high-pitched frequency or include strobe lights that drive away moles, rodents, snakes, and insects. [11] X Research source Some of these repellers can be irritating to pets, but others emit a frequency that can’t be heard by cats or dogs. Make sure to look for one labeled “pet-safe.”"

Caper spurge ( Euphorbia lathyris ) is another plant that may repel moles. Just make sure to remove the flower heads before they seed or they might invade the rest of your garden.

To get rid of moles, pest management professional Wilson Christner says to “install underground barriers made of mesh or hardware cloth around specific areas you want to protect, such as garden beds or vulnerable plant roots. Bury the barrier at least 1 foot (0.30 m) deep to prevent moles from tunneling under it.” Make sure the cloth curves around your plants and shows 6 inches (15 cm) above ground.
