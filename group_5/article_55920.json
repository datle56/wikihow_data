Click on this to start chkdsk. In the Check Disk dialogue box, select the options you wish to run. To attempt to fix bad sectors you must check the second option, Scan For and Attempt Recovery of Bad Sectors. If you are checking the system volume, you will see the message “Windows can’t check the disk while it’s in use. Do you want to check for hard disk errors the next time you start your computer?” Click Schedule Disk Check to run the check next time you start your computer."

If you wish to check a volume other than c: change to the appropriate letter. If you are checking your system volume, you will see a message saying: “The type of file system is NTFS. Cannot lock current drive. Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts?
