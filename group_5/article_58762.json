If you're going to be gone for more than 30 days, it may be more appropriate for you to have your mail forwarded. [3] X Research source Even if you're going to be gone for more than 30 days, you can still have your mail held for a shorter period if you prefer. Just make sure the end date coincides with the date when you'll return home so you'll be there to get your accumulated mail. The period of your request is measured in calendar days, not postal business days."

      "content": "Decide how you want to receive your mail when the hold ends. Once the hold ends, you can pick up your mail at your local post office or have the carrier deliver the accumulated mail to your address. If you normally get a lot of mail or are expecting a lot of mail during the time you're going to be gone, it may be easier to go pick it up yourself. [4] X Research source If you choose to let your mail carrier deliver the accumulated mail when the hold ends, they will only deliver as much as will fit in your mailbox. Any excess mail will be delivered at a later date."

You can get the form at your local post office or download it at https://about.usps.com/forms/ps8076.pdf . [5] X Research source The downloadable form isn't fillable, so you'll have to print it out and fill it out by hand. Write neatly in blue or black ink. If you submit your request online, you'll enter the same information you would normally enter on the authorization form. Even though you are providing your name, USPS holds mail for the entire address during the period requested â€” not just the mail addressed to you. If you have roommates, make sure they're okay with the request before you submit it."
