Fly in Creative Mode by double-tapping the spacebar. Hold the spacebar to fly upward and press “Shift” to fly downward again.

The first items you pick up will appear in your hotbar—this is the gray bar at the bottom of the screen with icons showing items. Navigate to the block you want to place by scrolling the mouse wheel. [3] X Research source If you don’t see the item you want in your hotbar, open your inventory by pressing the “E” key. Click and drag the item down to the last row in your inventory—this is your hotbar. You can also press the “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” “5,” “6,” “7,” “8,” or “9” buttons to select an item from one of the boxes in your hotbar from right to left. In Creative Mode, click the tabs above your inventory to find almost all the blocks you can possibly place in the game."

If you want to pick it up again, hold down the left mouse button until it breaks. [4] X Research source To place a block without a mouse, hit the right button on your computer touchpad. Some items need a special tool to pick them back up again—for example, any stone or ore blocks need to be broken with a Pickaxe selected in your hotbar. To place blocks faster, hold down the right mouse button with multiple of the same block in your hotbar. You can tell how many items you have by the number in the lower right corner. Player-oriented blocks have sides that change orientation depending on where you’re looking while you place them. Vertically locked blocks are blocks that can only be placed with the top and bottom facing up or down, like grass or half slabs."
