      "content": "Wait until the cold sore scabs over before you apply makeup. Open cold sores will continue to ooze as part of the healing phase, which can make makeup crack or peel. In addition, covering it with makeup may worsen the cold sore, lengthening your healing time. [2] X Research source It can take up to a week to get to the scabbing stage, though applying cold sore medicine may speed it along. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply ice to the cold sore to help the swelling go down.",
      "content": "Apply ice to the cold sore to help the swelling go down. Wrap the ice in a paper towel and hold it onto the cold sore. Leave it on for 20 minutes at a time and then take it off for 20 minutes. You can use this method off and on as long as you want. [4] X Research source Don't use a washcloth or towel, as that will introduce more bacteria. However, holding ice against your face without something between it and your skin is a bad idea, as it could give you frostbite."

      "content": "Add a layer of an invisible cold sore treatment. You can find cold sore creams at most drug stores. Put a small dab of the cream on a cotton swab and gently rub it onto the sore. Let it dry before trying to apply makeup over it. [5] X Research source You don't need much of the cold sore cream. A tiny drop will do. A 1% topical ointment of lemon balm oil at the start of a cold sore can help it heal faster. [6] X Research source A 0.5% aloe vera extract cream can also be helpful. [7] X Research source You can also combine 5 drops of eucalyptus oil, 3 drops of bergamot oil, 2 drops of tea tree essential oil, and 1 fl oz (30 mL) of carrier oil to make a helpful topical treatment.

      "content": "Try a cold sore patch in addition to treatment. These patches are invisible, but they provide a protective seal over the cold sore, making it easier to apply makeup even in early stages. Depending on the brand, it may have medicine in it, or you may be able to apply cream underneath it so read the instructions.

      "title": "Avoid scratching or touching the cold sore.",
      "content": "Avoid scratching or touching the cold sore. Scratching it will only irritate it, making its appearance worse. Plus, touching it can introduce more germs, which can inflame it. Keep your hands off your cold sores. [10] X Research source You can also pass them to other parts of your body or other people, as cold sores are contagious."

      "title": "Use a small, disposable makeup sponge.",
      "content": "Use a small, disposable makeup sponge. Because cold sores are contagious, you don't want to reuse an applicator later, as you can give them back to yourself. Sponges work better than cotton, as cotton swabs or balls can leave bits of themselves behind, highlighting your cold sore instead of hiding it. [11] X Research source In addition, sponges will create a smoother finish than cotton."

      "title": "Choose a thick, yellow- or green-based concealer to cover your cold sore.",
      "content": "Choose a thick, yellow- or green-based concealer to cover your cold sore. Pick one that comes as a paste rather than a liquid. Yellow or green concealers will help neutralize the redness of a cold sore, which is why they are the best option for the first layer, at least. [12] X Research source These concealers are sometimes labeled as correcter and concealer."

      "title": "Cover the concealer with a foundation.",
      "content": "Cover the concealer with a foundation . After working in a correcting concealer, you need to add a foundation that matches your skin tone. That way, the color-correcting concealer won't stand out against your skin. Add dots of it to your whole face in a light pattern, moving from the center of your face outward, then use more of it over the cold sore. Dab at the foundation with a sponge until it blends in with your skin. [13] X Research source Remember to toss the sponge when you're done."

      "content": "Finish your makeup with a fine setting powder . These powders help keep your makeup in place so they don't run later in the day. With a brush, you can thoroughly clean or don't mind tossing later, apply a light layer of powder all of your face. [14] X Research source It's important to apply the powder everywhere, as it makes your face look even in texture and color. If you just apply it over your cold sore, you could make it stand out more."

      "title": "Remove makeup gently with your facial cleanser.",
      "content": "Remove makeup gently with your facial cleanser. Taking off that thick layer of concealer can irritate your cold sore, so try to do it as gently as possible. Rub the cleaner onto your face, and let it sit for about 15 seconds. Then use a wet washcloth to gently wipe the makeup off. [15] X Research source You can use a bit of cleansing oil on the cold sore if the facial cleanser doesn't take it off. Make sure to use a clean washcloth each time you wash your face. If you prefer, you can use facial cleansing wipes so you can just toss them."

      "title": "Learn your triggers and avoid them.",
      "content": "Learn your triggers and avoid them. Different things can trigger cold sores for different people. Typically, things like colds, fevers, sunlight, windy conditions, and stress can cause outbreaks. While you can't avoid all of these, of course, avoid the ones you can to help prevent cold sores from popping up in the first place. [16] X Research source For instance, wear sunblock to avoid exposing your face to the sun and use protective lip balm with at least an SPF 15 to help block both the wind and sun. Work on cutting stress out of your life when you can. For example, if watching the news in the morning causes you to feel stressed throughout the day, skip it. Try taking yoga or adding meditation to your daily routine. Practice deep breathing when you start feeling stressed out."

      "content": "Get 8 hours of sleep each night when possible. Getting overworked and stressed can cause outbreaks of cold sores. By making sure you get enough sleep each night , you can help combat fatigue and stress and hopefully, stave off cold sores. [17] X Research source If you have trouble getting to bed on time, set an alarm an hour before you need to go to sleep. Turn off your electronics and start winding down for the night, preparing yourself mentally for bed. Make sure your bedroom is conducive to sleeping. Block out any light; for instance, use blackout curtains to hide street light. Similarly, use earplugs or a noise machine to help with noises that keep you awake. Think about locking your pets out of your bedroom if they tend to wake you up at night."

      "content": "Skip sharing makeup and hygiene products with other people. If another person has a cold sore outbreak, avoid sharing products like makeup, razors, and towels. If you do, they can cause you to have an outbreak. Use your hygiene and makeup products only. [18] X Research source Lipstick and lip-gloss are some of the main culprits."

      "content": "Avoid sharing food and utensils with other people. Similarly to makeup and hygiene products, food and utensils can pass the virus that causes cold sores back and forth. Stick to your own cups and utensils when eating and drinking. [19] X Research source For the same reasons, don't kiss someone who has a cold sore outbreak."
