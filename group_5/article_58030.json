      "title": "Examine the window.",
      "content": "Examine the window. Look at both sides of the window, interior and exterior. Make sure it is a window that is meant to be opened. Some new office and home windows are not meant to be opened. If there are no hinges or the window is a single pane with nowhere to slide, it likely does not open. Make sure that the window is not nailed or screwed shut for security or energy conservation reasons. Check for any staples around the interior of the window where plastic sheeting may have been fastened. Carefully remove them with needle-nose pliers. Make sure any locks are disengaged. Look to see if the window frame has been recently painted. Decide which direction the window is supposed to open: up, outward or sideways."

      "content": "Loosen any paint that is sealing the window shut. Removing dried paint that collected between the window and frame will free the window and allow it to be opened. [1] X Research source Use a razor knife to cut along the edge of the window and the frame. Cut across all four sides of the window. You may need to check the exterior of the window in addition to the inside to make sure that it isn’t painted shut on both sides."

      "title": "Hammer the edge of the window to break the seal created by paint.",
      "content": "Hammer the edge of the window to break the seal created by paint. Use a wood block to cushion the blows from the hammer and prevent making dents in the wood of the window. Be careful to hit gently so as not to break the window. Hammer the wood portion of the window and not the glass."

      "title": "Push on the window with your hands.",
      "content": "Push on the window with your hands. Try to loosen the window one side at a time. Then try to push the window down as if you were closing it. If it moves, make sure the window is straight in its frame and slowly attempt to open it. Push each corner to see if there is any movement. Press on the window gently to open it a little at a time."

      "title": "Force the window up with a pry bar.",
      "content": "Force the window up with a pry bar. Place a small block of wood on the window frame to give your pry bar more leverage. Gently force the window up with the pry bar. Reposition the pry bar along the bottom edge of the window to lift both sides of the window. Using a pry bar may damage the wood of the window or window frame, use this method very carefully as a last resort."

      "title": "Remove moisture from the window frame.",
      "content": "Remove moisture from the window frame. Wood may swell due to humidity causing windows to become stuck. Drying out the wood may help the window open more easily. [3] X Research source Run a hair dryer along the edges of the window frame for several minutes. After drying the wood, try opening the window. Place a dehumidifier in a room with stuck windows. Lowering the humidity in the room should help reduce the swelling of the window frames."

      "title": "Open the window repeatedly.",
      "content": "Open the window repeatedly. After you get the window to open one time, open and close it several times to loosen the action of the window. If it still sticks, check the frame to ensure that it isn’t warped or damaged from water. Feel for areas where the window meets some resistance and use a utility knife or sandpaper smooth it out. Window frames with severe water damage may need to be replaced entirely."

Examine the stop to determine how it is attached to the window frame. [4] X Research source Use a utility knife to remove any paint that is sealing the stop to the window frame. Remove any screws that are holding the sash in place. Gently pry the stop out using a flathead screwdriver or paint scraper. Be careful when removing the stops as they can snap easily.
