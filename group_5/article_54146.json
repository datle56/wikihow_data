      "content": "Be creative. Use this new command to stage some funny, horrifying, or just plain weird shows. For example, you could do a \"drinking can kill you\" demonstration. To do this, play as a demoman, then taunt (default G) while holding the Bottle. Then, while your character is taking a mouthful, press the explode key. Simply type in chat (Default y) \"Hey, Drinking kills.\" You could stage something similar with the Soldier. Taunt with your shovel, then right when he hits himself, explode."
