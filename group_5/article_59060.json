      "content": "Hold an ice cube against the gum for 3-5 mins to harden it. If you can, alternate holding the ice cube on either side of the gum to harden it on both sides. Gum is usually easier to remove if it's hard. Ice can freeze and harden the gum so that you can pull it out of the dog's fur. [1] X Research source If the gum becomes soft again while you're trying to remove it, stop and hold the ice against it again."

      "content": "Apply peanut butter, olive oil, butter, or mayonnaise to the gum. Use your fingers to work the oily substance into the fur around the gum. Make sure the affected area is completely covered. [6] X Research source If your dog licks off some of the peanut butter, it's okay, as long as you use a peanut butter that doesn't contain xylitol. [7] X Research source Dogs can eat other oils, as well. However, try to keep your dog from licking at the oil, as they may get diarrhea or suffer from pancreatitis if they consume too much.
