      "content": "Understand where to find the quick reaction inside a Facebook Messenger chat. Except for a chat stream directed solely at yourself (if you choose to), you'll find this directly to the right of the compose box - just above the keyboard. With quick reactions, you can hold them down to enlarge them to put a firmer \"force\" on their effect and send. However, you can't change them from this location. Some reactions' enlarging effects don't work right. However, they still display the same on your recipient's chat - but at one consistent size."

Facebook Messenger on an iPhone looks like a cloud-messaging graphic and contains an ~ with a gradient background between pink (near the top right corner) to bluish (on the bottom). It has a white border. Ensure you are on the Chats tab. The Chats tab - where most people default to - can be found at the bottom left of the screen. Tap the recipient you'd like to make these changes to. Ensure you are at the Home tab, then tap the recipient's name from the list."

On older Home-buttoned iPhones, you may need to scroll down just a little bit to find this option.
