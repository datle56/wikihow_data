[1] X Research source A strong password will be at least 10 characters in length, but the more the better. The longer your password is, the more time it will take the hacker to crack it. A strong password should contain at least one of each of the following characters: lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters."

It's not enough to use the same password with different numbers at the end (e.g., password1, password2 …). Consider downloading the Password Alert extension if you use Google Chrome. Password Alert will warn you whenever you enter you Google Password on a non-Google site, which can help protect you from phishing and accidentally using your Google password on another site. To use Password Alert, simply download it from the Chrome store , and then follow the onscreen directions."

      "content": "Consider Using a password manager. As you create more accounts and passwords, it'll likely be difficult to remember them all. There are many good password managers available that will encrypt and safely store your passwords, such as 1Password, LastPass, and KeePass . You might have a password manager built into your operating system — for example, Mac users have keychain available to them for free. If you don't want to use a password manager, consider using a passphrase, for example: “I like big butts and I cannot lie!” might become iLbBaIcL!"

Google prompt is the most secure method of two-step verification, while an authenticator app is somewhere in the middle with voice or text message being the least secure (although any of these methods would be more secure than not having two-step verification at all)."
