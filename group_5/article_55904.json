People with Narcissistic Personality Disorder may struggle to understand the feelings of others and may ascribe an unreasonably high value to their own importance. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Their inflated sense of self is actually due to a severely low sense of their worth, which causes them to crave constant attention and admiration. People with NPD often mask their self-doubt with bravado and confidence, but underneath they’re typically extremely uncertain of themselves. Risk factors for NPD may include depression, anxiety, eating disorders, other mental disorders, physical health problems, drug or alcohol abuse, problems in the sufferer’s relationships and work or school, or suicidal thoughts."

      "content": "End the relationship if necessary. While it’s possible to have a healthy relationship with someone with NPD, if it becomes too taxing on your mental health or if they refuse to treat you with respect, it may be worth it to distance yourself from them. This may mean going low-contact—for instance, if this person is your father, you may resort to only seeing him for major holidays and otherwise keeping your distance. Or it could mean cutting them off completely. For instance, if your partner has NPD and refuses to manage their behavior, you may opt to break up and block their number. It can be hard to cut off someone with NPD, especially if you care about them. But if they’re in any way abusive, it will be safer in the long run."
