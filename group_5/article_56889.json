      "content": "Find or buy fresh eucalyptus. Eucalyptus trees grow wild in warmer climates. In colder climates, eucalyptus is sold by nurseries as a potted plant or shrub. You'll need a good handful - approximately 1/4 cup - of leaves for every cup of oil you intend to make. [1] X Research source Eucalyptus is found at most florists, as it is a favorite addition to many floral displays. In warmer climates, you might find eucalyptus for sale at farmer's markets or gardening stores. You may find eucalyptus for sale online. Although it's technically a tree or shrub, it's also labeled as an herb for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The best time of day to cut eucalyptus is early in the morning, when its leaves contain a high concentration of oil.

      "content": "Wash the leaves in the sink with water. Rinse well, and set aside to dry. You may also choose to dry the leaves with a clean, dry cloth or towel. [4] X Research source This step is particularly important when buying eucalyptus from a florist, as the leaves may be sprayed with preservative. Get the leaves as dry as you can, but if there's a little water left it will evaporate,"

      "title": "Measure 1 cup (8 oz) of oil.",
      "content": "Measure 1 cup (8 oz) of oil. The best oil will be a light carrier oil, either cold-pressed virgin olive oil, coconut oil or almond oil. [5] X Expert Source Lorena Barcal Clinical Herbalist & Clean Beauty Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2020. A strong scent is unnecessary because you want the eucalyptus scent to dominate the oil. If you'd like to make less than 8 oz of eucalyptus oil, use less oil and fewer leaves. For example, if you'd like to make 4 oz (1/2 cup) of oil, measure 4 oz of oil, and use approximately 1/8 cup eucalyptus leaves. If you want to make more, just keep the proportions the same: 4 parts oil to 1 part leaves."

      "content": "Combine oil and leaves in a crock pot set on low. Make sure the lid is on your crock pot. There should be about 1/4 cup of oil resting above your leaves.

Make sure you're making your eucalyptus oil at a time you can enjoy it."

      "content": "Pour the eucalyptus oil through a fine mesh strainer when the oil is cool. Catch the oil in a jar. Ideally, this will be a dark glass jar, but any jar will serve so long as it's kept in a dark location in your home. It's important to wait until the oil has cooled before pouring, so the glass doesn't crack from the sudden heat. Use clean, glass jars with tight fitting lids. Make sure they are dry as well. Any water or moisture in the jars can cause mold."

You will use the same proportion of leaves to oil as you did in the crock pot method - about 4 parts oil to 1 part eucalyptus leaves. Use 1/4 cup of eucalyptus leaves for every cup of oil. Place the eucalyptus leaves in the jar, followed by a thin layer of sea salt. [9] X Research source The salt will help to extract the oil from the leaves.

The longer you allow the mixture to steep, the stronger it will be. Make sure your jar is tightly sealed, and give it a good shake to stir the leaves together with the oil. Continue to shake the jar every 12 hours or so until the steeping is finished. [11] X Expert Source Lorena Barcal Clinical Herbalist & Clean Beauty Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2020. The spot where you keep your mixture while it's steeping should receive 8-12 hours of direct sunshine per day for maximum benefit. Keep it in an area that's not hidden from site, so that you don't forget to shake it."
