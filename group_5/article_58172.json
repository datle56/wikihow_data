      "content": "Your marriage line is the small horizontal line just below your pinky. Your 5 main palm lines are your heart line (also known as your love line ), your head line , your life line , your fate line (or your money line), and your marriage line. [1] X Research source Your heart line is the topmost long line running underneath your fingers, and your marriage line is a short line directly above it, right below the base of your little finger. According to some traditions, the right hand is read for women, and the left hand is read for men. [2] X Research source In other traditions, both hands are read: the left hand represents the potential you were born with, and the right hand represents what you have done with that potential.

      "content": "One bold marriage line indicates an early, happy marriage. Some palmists interpret a single marriage line as an indication you will marry at the age of twenty-five. [4] X Research source Other palmists interpret a single marriage line as an indicator of a stable marriage, albeit one without much sexual chemistry. [5] X Research source Some palmists do not believe the number of marriage lines matters. [6] X Research source Many palmists choose to read only the longest line if there are multiple lines present.

      "content": "Two marriage lines foretells two committed relationships. Two marriage lines of equal lengths predicts you will experience two great loves in your life. [8] X Research source They will both be equally passionate and meaningful, and neither is more significant than the other. If one line is slightly shorter than the other, you may have a failed affair before a successful relationship. [9] X Research source Some palmists interpret two equal marriage lines as an indication you will experience great passion in your romantic life—but your passion will be torturous.

      "content": "No marriage line suggests you are indifferent to marriage. Not having a marriage line doesn't necessarily mean you won't fall in love or get married; it just means you may not be all that preoccupied by marriage. You may be more focused on other priorities, such as your career. [11] X Research source Just as priorities are always shifting, the lines of the palms are always changing. If you cannot find your marriage line and you would like to, try reading your palms again in a few years—things may have changed."

      "content": "A straight long line means your marriage will be successful. If your marriage line is long and straight, you can expect peace and love in your union, especially if it runs parallel to the heart line. [12] X Research source A line extending beneath the ring or middle finger indicates you will find your soulmate , or maybe you have already. [13] X Research source If your marriage line runs into your sunline, this may indicate that you will not only be blessed with a happy marriage; you will also achieve professional success . Your sunline is the vertical line that originates from the Mount of Moon (located at the base of the palm, opposite to your thumb) and extends upward to the Mount of Sun (the little pad at the base of your ring finger).

      "title": "If your marriage line is short, you may never marry or may marry late.",
      "content": "If your marriage line is short, you may never marry or may marry late. A short marriage line suggests you would rather focus on other things than marriage, or that you aren't the sort of person to fall in love or get attached, possibly because of the high standards to which you hold romantic partners (and yourself). You may remain single forever , devoting your life to other pursuits. By not devoting energy to your romantic relationships, you will have lots of time for other things. Or you may marry late in life, after you have found the right partner. It will be well worth the wait. A short marriage line may also indicate that you will enjoy a series of short-lived relationships rather than a long-term commitment. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "A line that curves gently upward at the end indicates a happy marriage. A marriage line that tilts upward suggests your life will be joyful and you and your partner will find financial success. The higher your marriage line curves, the happier your union will be. [16] X Research source However, a marriage line that curves sharply upwards is a sign you will be dissatisfied in your marriage. A sharp upward turn could be a sign that your partner is dishonest, and that your relationship will be emotionally unfulfilling in the long-term. [17] X Research source Keep in mind that palm lines change over time, and while a sharp curve may indicate possible unhappiness, your palms may give you a new narrative in a few years."

      "content": "A marriage line that curves downward may indicate your partner will fall ill. If your marriage line bends down towards your heartline, it may mean that poor health is in your partner’s future, especially if there are fine lines extending from the marriage line towards the heart line. This line may indicate your partner will pass away before you do. This line may also indicate personality conflict in your relationship. You may experience a divorce or a separation.

      "content": "A forked marriage line indicates time alone before meeting your soulmate. If your marriage line is forked at the beginning (the beginning is closer to the edge of your palm), this may suggest that you will experience solitude before eventually finding your true love in time. A fork at the start of your marriage line may also indicate that you and your partner will separate at some point, but will reconcile eventually. [19] X Research source"

The more broken your marriage line is, the more likely you are to experience frustration in your relationship.

      "content": "Islands in your marriage line may indicate incompatibility with your partner. An island in your marriage line is a small circle interrupting the marriage line. If the island appears at the beginning of your marriage line, it may mean your relationship will be tumultuous prior to your marriage. If the island appears in the center of your marriage line, it may indicate incompatibility during your marriage. And if the island appears towards the end of your marriage line, it may mean you will experience difficulty towards the end of your marriage or after your marriage. [21] X Research source “After your marriage” could mean that you and your partner separate or divorce, or that your partner dies. An island in your marriage could signify not only incompatibility with your partner, but with their family as well. [22] X Research source Another indicator of potential marital trouble is an X-sign. If you see an X-sign in your marriage line, this could mean you will experience difficulty in love. [23] X Research source"

If you have multiple marriage lines and they overlap with one another, this may suggest that your relationship will be unsatisfying, and either you or your partner will become involved with another person, threatening the marriage. [25] X Research source Overlapping lines do not mean this future is set in stone; rather, it is a reminder to be aware of the potential for unhappiness in your marriage, so that you are prepared to meet trials when they come."
