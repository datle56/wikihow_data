    {
      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. Most likely players who are more experienced will kill you more often, but that's all normal. Make sure to execute order 66 in any situation. Take time to get used to how they play, get used to your surroundings as that can be crucial if you are trying to survive in any FPS game. Get to know your weapons and how each will fire, what rate they will, and the distance they're best used at. [1] X Research source Play the single-player campaign. This will help familiarize yourself with the weapons, environment, etc. Play online multiplayer. You will only get better if you play against real opponents, as opposed to AI's. The more you practice, the better you will become. Remember, it's okay to be \"bad\", just as long as you know you're improving, that's the key!"

    {
      "title": "Get to know the controls.",
      "content": "Get to know the controls. This is very important. Shooting, crouching, reloading, etc. Knowing these inside and out is imperative."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn the maps.",
      "content": "Learn the maps. Familiarize yourself with the surroundings, vantage points, chokepoints, weapon pickups etc (depending on the game). It's very important to have the know-how on these maps as when you can navigate them easily, you can get the drop on the enemy. Additionally, experiment with different routes that will help familiarize yourself. You'll know where you're going, which is always to your advantage. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Find your playing style.",
      "content": "Find your playing style. In FPS games, having a quick playing style is essential for performing well in game. Different players have different playing styles, and some find them more quicker than others. Find yours as quick as possible, whether it be going offensive or defensive, and you'll more than likely have fun, killing others."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose which weapons suit your playing style best.",
      "content": "Choose which weapons suit your playing style best. Sometimes, however, you will need to vary your weapon usage, e.g if your weapon runs out of ammunition and you must pick up an enemies... so it's good to be familiarized generally with different weapons. Additionally, in most FPS games usage of a weapon (x amount of kills, x amount of headshot kills) will reward you with extra XP points, so it is a good tactic for fast levelling up!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the correct perks which suit your gameplay.",
      "content": "Have the correct perks which suit your gameplay. Certain roles demand different qualities... if you play with an SMG (Submachine gun) you may want to employ a perk which allows extended running times (Marathon, Extreme Conditioning, Lightweight), for example. Knowing what suits you will really help your ability! Experiment with different classes, weapons, and explosives, depending on what's available."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your equipment wisely.",
      "content": "Use your equipment wisely. Grenades are great for picking up kills and clearing objectives, especially in game modes where the enemy is capturing somewhere, throwing a grenade in can get you a nice amount of kills! Stun/Flashbang grenades are also great for incapacitating the enemy, creating an easy kill, especially if somebody is 'camping' (staying in a certain given area)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reload!",
      "content": "Reload! The best time to reload is when you find cover. If you're in the middle of the battlefield and you're low on ammunition while your opponent has full ammunition, use your secondary, run to the nearest cover you can find, and reload there. It can be the difference between life and death!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember that KDR isn't everything.",
      "content": "Remember that KDR isn't everything. KDR (Kill/Death Ratio) is only a minor part of an FPS game. Always stay with the team, and you can be able to ambush the opposing team. The best tactics are that you always have an attacking section and a defensive section. Even if you're either one of them, always try to communicate with the others. It could save your team, and yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn from your deaths.",
      "content": "Learn from your deaths. Think about where you were killed and why. Was it because you were in an open space and was shot by a sniper? Next time, try walking in an irregular pattern. This way, your movements are unpredictable and makes it harder for snipers to get you. This is one of the best ways to improving your FPS skills. When you're killed, or do something that gets you in to a bad situation, reflect upon it. 'What could I have done to have averted this?' Then put that into action. Learn from your mistakes and do not blame others for them."

      "title": "Consider adjusting the layout or sensitivity of the controls.",
      "content": "Consider adjusting the layout or sensitivity of the controls. You can often adjust the buttons on your game controller or keyboard to suit your playing style. After you are more comfortable, you may want to change the sensitivity on your mouse so that you can turn quicker. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Aim for killstreaks.",
      "content": "Aim for killstreaks. If you manage to get a certain amount of kills without dying, in some FPS games there are rewards. Within the gaming realm of Call of Duty, these are 'Killstreaks'. Try to use team-helping killstreaks such as an enemy locator (UAV/Spy Plane)."
