[1] X Expert Source Emily Christensen Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja Expert Interview. 8 July 2020. Most pendulums include a crystal. You might use a clear quartz crystal for chakra clearing or balancing because you can program it for any use. If you prefer, you can actually find special chakra pendulums that feature multi-color crystals to represent each chakra."

Pick one of the following cleansing methods that works best for you: [2] X Expert Source Emily Christensen Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja Expert Interview. 8 July 2020.

Æther: Place your pendulum in the moonlight and surround it with salt."

      "content": "A clear mind will give you better results. Set the scene with incense, candles, and relaxing music if you like. Then, sit or lay in a comfortable position. Take a few minutes to center yourself so you feel relaxed and open to receiving answers. As you do this, hold your pendulum so it picks up on your energy. You might repeat your intention to yourself. You could say, “I’m here to unblock my chakras,” or “Please help me clear my chakras.” If you like, meditate for a few minutes as you connect with your pendulum. Meditating also allows you to set your intentions for clearing your chakras. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The crown and root chakras are on each end of your spinal column. Your crown chakra is at the top of your head and represents your spiritual life. On the other hand, your root chakra is located at the base of your spine and represents stability and survival. Either chakra is a great starting point. [4] X Research source It may be easiest to start at your crown chakra and work your way down. Alternatively, you might start with your root since it's the first chakra. Ask a friend to help if you can because it'll be hard to reach some chakras on your own, especially your root chakra."

Try not to move your hand or arm at all so you don’t accidentally interfere with the pendulum’s response. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your pendulum isn’t moving, it’s possible your chakra is blocked. However, it’s also possible you aren’t holding it in the right place. It may help to move the crystal over slightly to see if that helps. [7] X Research source"

Here’s what the different directions mean: [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Clockwise spinning means your chakra is open. Counterclockwise spinning means your chakra is blocked or closed. Side-to-side means you have a horizontal block because you’re holding in energy. Up-and-down means you have a vertical block because you’re misusing energy. Diagonally means you’re partially blocked because you’re not being assertive. No motion means your chakra has no energy at all. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "You might find it easier to just ask your pendulum questions.",
      "content": "You might find it easier to just ask your pendulum questions. Generally, pendulums can give three possible answers: yes, no, or undecided. Just hold your pendulum over your chakra and ask, “Is this chakra blocked?” Soon, you’ll have your answer. For example, swinging clockwise might mean “yes,” while swinging counterclockwise might mean “no.” Swinging in a straight line might mean “undecided.” When you first start using a pendulum, find how it gives yes, no, and undecided answers by holding the pendulum and asking it “What is a “yes” answer?” Then, watch how it moves. Your pendulum should give you a different movement for “yes,” “no”, and “undecided.” If it doesn’t, try again."

      "content": "Pendulums also measure the amount of energy in your chakras. Wide circles or swings mean you have a lot of energy in your chakra. On the other hand, small movements mean you have low energy. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In general, all of your chakras should have the same amount of energy. If you have some chakras that have less energy, you’re out of balance."
