      "content": "Use mistakes as an opportunity to learn and grow. As you transition into adulthood, you're going to make mistakes—and that's okay! It's just a part of growing up and making your way in the world. Analyze your mistakes so you can figure out how to avoid the same situation in the future. [1] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Eliminating negative self-talk is a big part of having a growth mindset. For example, instead of saying, \"I'll never be able to do this,\" you might say, \"I messed up that time, but I know I'll figure it out eventually.\" Whenever you mess up, own up to it! You miss out on the opportunity to grow and learn if you make excuses or blame it on something or somebody else."

      "content": "Use a calendar to schedule events, tasks, and activities . When you were a kid, you probably relied on your parents to manage your time for you and tell you what you needed to do and when. To prepare for adulthood, start scheduling your classes, deadlines, work, events, and other activities on a calendar. Use the calendar app on your phone if that's easier for you. [2] X Research source With a calendar app, you can also set reminders for yourself so you don't forget anything, even if you're not the best at checking your calendar. Don't forget to \"schedule\" free time as well! Even if you have school, work, and other activities, you still need time to yourself to recharge and do your own thing."

      "content": "Use early jobs to get a handle on what you enjoy doing. At this stage, the most important thing you can do, career-wise, is identify your strengths and interests. Then, start looking at how those strengths and interests translate into marketable skills. Find out what kind of education and experience you need to do what you want to do and go from there. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, suppose you have a part-time job at a café and you really enjoy making the signs that are displayed out front with daily specials. That could translate into a career in graphic design, marketing, or social media. Whatever you decide now isn't set in stone—plenty of adults pivot to different careers after years (or even decades!) in the workforce. But it's still a good idea to narrow down your options early on."

      "content": "Set up a budget to help you develop good spending habits now. If you go on a shopping spree the second your paycheck hits your bank account, this one's for you. Even if you aren't responsible for a lot of bills right now, creating a budget and saving money (instead of spending it all) is a big part of adulting. [4] X Research source Set up a basic spreadsheet with these categories to get started: Income : Enter the lowest amount. For example, if you make between $150 and $200 a week from your part-time job, you would budget $150 a week. Necessary expenses : Bills you have to pay each month. For example, if you pay $50 for your mobile phone, that would be a necessary expense. Savings : Budget 20-30% of your income. For example, if you earn $150 a week ($600 a month), you would budget $120-180 a month to put into your savings. Discretionary expenses : These are expenses that you have regularly but aren't necessary —stuff like going to concerts or movies or ordering takeout. Experts recommend budgeting 20-30% of your total income for this category."

      "content": "Start an investment fund for retirement as soon as you can. If your employer offers a 401(k), take them up on it! With this retirement investment account, your employer takes money out of your paycheck before you even see it and invests it towards your retirement. Most employers also match your contributions (up to a specific total amount), which is basically free money—and you should never pass up free money. [5] X Trustworthy Source Financial Industry Regulatory Agency Non-governmental organization responsible for regulating brokerage firms and exchange markets Go to source If a 401(k) isn't an option, open a Roth IRA. If you're not 18 yet, talk to your parents about opening up a custodial IRA for you—once you turn 18, you'll have complete control over it.

Get a single credit card with a low limit to start building your credit. Charge things on your card that you normally pay every month, such as your mobile phone. Then pay the card off in full each month. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau U.S. government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector Go to source Apps such as NerdWallet, WalletHub, and CreditKarma offer pretty much the same services—it's really just a question of which one you like. If your parents have good credit, talk to them about adding you as an authorized user on one of their credit cards. They don't even have to give you a card or access to the account! When they make their payments every month, that payment history will go on your credit report to help boost your score. Focus on developing good habits with credit now to save yourself a lot of money in the future—especially when you go to finance those big-ticket purchases, such as a car or a house."

      "content": "Learn 2 or 3 basic healthy meals that you can easily prepare. Eating out all the time is going to put a huge strain on your budget. Come up with a couple of meals that you love and are almost always in the mood for. Once you get those down, you can expand if you want. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Start by making spaghetti ! It's a good basic meal that's hard to mess up. All you really need is pasta and sauce. Add sausage, ground beef, or any other meat for protein. You could also add vegetables, such as onions, green peppers, or spinach, to the sauce for flavor and variety. Eggs are also cheap and easy to cook in many different styles—and there's nothing wrong with having breakfast for dinner! Make a stir-fry with rice and veggies for another easy option. You can change it up pretty easily just by adding different veggies, meat, or sauce. Whatever you put in it, you still cook it basically the same way."

      "content": "Get in the habit of spending just 10 minutes a day tidying up. Keeping things clean and organized doesn't have to be a chore if you do it a little at a time rather than letting it pile up. If it's ingrained in you to pick up after yourself and put things away, things will be less likely to get out of control when you move out on your own. [11] X Research source Start your day by making your bed . A made bed makes any room instantly look a little neater, and you've already accomplished your first task of the day in just a few minutes. Before you go to bed at night, spend 5-10 minutes picking up and cleaning. You can even set a timer—when it goes off, just stop. Even if you have a lot of clutter, 5-10 minutes away will gradually eat away at it. Organize things you use regularly in a way that's convenient and makes sense to you. For example, if you always drop your jacket on the floor when you come in your room, you might find a hook for it that you can put right next to the door."

Search your name and see what comes up—then start the task of untagging yourself and adjusting your privacy settings on your social media accounts. Delete posts that you think would give people a negative impression of you. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source For example, if you have any photos on social media of you at parties where there was underage drinking, you definitely want to get rid of those. Open a LinkedIn account and use that as your \"professional\" face. Google pushes it to the top of search results, so if someone searches your name, it's the first thing they'll see. Now's also a good time to set up an \"adult\" email account if you don't already have one. A couple of years from now, you don't want to be looking for jobs with an email handle like \"kawaicutie7.\" Good adult email addresses are typically some combination of your name and initials, such as \"jthoward\" for Jenna T. Howard."

Getting involved with a hobby is a great way to ensure you'll always have a community. Even if you move to a different area, it's usually not too hard to find a group to join. [13] X Research source For example, if you like the outdoors, you might get into gardening. Many areas have community gardens where you can volunteer some time (and get free produce for your effort). If you love acting, get involved with a local improv group or your local community theater. They need people to work backstage, too, so you can find a spot there if you like fashion, makeup, or even carpentry."

If you learn to manage your stress now, it'll be easier to stay away from those things. Ultimately, this is all about finding things that work for you —there's no one-size-fits-all. Here are some things you can try: [15] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing and improving psychiatric care for children and adolescents. Go to source Go to bed earlier. Getting enough sleep will help you feel more relaxed and focused. Write in a journal for a few minutes each day. Journaling helps you stay in touch with your own thoughts and feelings and learn more about yourself. Try deep-breathing exercises when you feel anxious. Just a minute or two of deep, focused breathing can help slow your heart rate and calm your mind. Take a walk in nature. Research shows that spending at least 20-30 minutes immersed in nature reduces the levels of stress hormones in your body.

      "content": "Strive to spread kindness and generosity to everyone you meet. Being kind to a complete stranger can take some effort—but it's worth it. People always remember when a random person goes out of their way to be kind . That kindness boosts your happiness and self-esteem and makes you feel better about yourself as well, so it's really a win-win. [18] X Research source You never know who someone might turn out to be or how they might impact your life. When you treat everyone with kindness and respect, you acknowledge their importance as a human. Also remember that you don't know what someone else is going through. That stranger who snapped at you rudely or cut you off in traffic might have just lost their job or have a deathly ill loved one at home. Do what you can to be the highlight of someone's day rather than the low point."

      "content": "Friends boost your happiness and provide emotional support. Try to stay in touch with your closest friends after you graduate from high school or college. This can be tough since you might move far away from each other and develop different interests, but getting together even once or twice a year can be really beneficial. [19] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source It's often pretty easy to make friends when you're a kid, but it gets harder as an adult. Community sports leagues and hobby groups can help. If you're religious, join a church or faith-based organization near you. It's a great way to meet people who share your values. Keep in mind that a large social media network doesn't necessarily translate to having a lot of friends offline . In addition to online friends, you also need local people who can support you and do things with you in person."
