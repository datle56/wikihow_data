      "title": "A Virgo man appreciates someone with a great intellect.",
      "content": "A Virgo man appreciates someone with a great intellect. He’ll feel happy and comfortable with someone who can hold their own in conversation. Show off your knowledge on a variety of topics and current events—for Virgo, a well-informed partner is a sexy partner. Keep your conversations authentic. He’ll be able to tell if you’re pretending to have an opinion or trying to be somebody else to impress him. Great conversation topics could be anything in the local or international news, a new breakthrough or project at work, or telling an amusing story."

      "title": "A Virgo man’s mind and ego are his erogenous zones.",
      "content": "A Virgo man’s mind and ego are his erogenous zones. Give him lots of compliments—tell him how hot and attractive he is, how smart he is, or let him know you like his company. The more you show him genuine affection, the more he’ll start to like you and his sexual attraction will get even stronger. Keep your compliments genuine and don’t lay it on too thick. If he sniffs a hint of fake, he’ll be turned off and lose some trust in you."

      "title": "Virgo men aren’t natural pursuers.",
      "content": "Virgo men aren’t natural pursuers. If you make yourself open, available, and not a hard target, that might get a shy and receptive sign like Virgo to approach. As a mutable sign, Virgo is more go-with-the-flow than other earth signs and he’ll opt for the path of least resistance when it comes to making a move. Try intriguing your Virgo man by appealing to his intellect or a fetish you know he has. This will tempt him to approach you even more. Approach him first or strike up a friendly conversation to break the ice. Make it really clear you’re into him with eye contact, laughter, and welcoming body language. If your Virgo man isn’t getting the hint, make the first move with a seductive touch or by asking him out. A Virgo guy will appreciate a straightforward approach."

      "title": "A Virgo man has trouble voicing his thoughts and feelings.",
      "content": "A Virgo man has trouble voicing his thoughts and feelings. Help him express his desires by prompting him with flirtatious questions like “How do I look?” or “What do you think of this new perfume?” As he gets more confident complementing you, his sexual attraction will grow. A big turn on for a Virgo man is a partner who doesn’t need constant validation. Be careful not to overdo it or he might see it as attention-seeking."

      "title": "Good personal hygiene is a must for a Virgo man.",
      "content": "Good personal hygiene is a must for a Virgo man. He will always be impeccably clean and fresh and expects his partner to be too. He has a sensitive sense of smell and is easily turned off by any hint of BO. Jump in the shower before you meet up, especially if you suspect sex will be involved. Always wear deodorant and a pleasant perfume around your Virgo guy to tantalize him. Showering together is the best (and most fun!) way to satisfy Virgo’s need for everyone to be clean before sex. After you get squeaky clean, put on a crisp, well-fitting outfit and a light makeup look to appeal to his love of a classic, natural beauty.

      "content": "Virgo is the “virgin” of the zodiac. This explains their prudish front and their attraction to pure, modest partners. To attract him, showcase your angelic and innocent side and avoid jumping into your dirtiest desires right away. Once he overcomes his reserve, he’ll be open to your wilder side. Talk about work, volunteering, your family, or other wholesome things in your life to mesmerize him. The less he suspects your kinky preferences, the more pleasantly surprised he’ll be later. A Virgo man falls for the “lady in the streets, freak in the sheets” type. A proper partner with a secret kinky side is a big turn on for him. Virgo men are more likely to be freakier right away if they view you as a fling instead of a potential long term partner."
