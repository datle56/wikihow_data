      "title": "Decide which rules are most important.",
      "content": "Decide which rules are most important. Think about which rules will keep your class a safe and fun learning environment. Design rules to reflect this goal. These rules will be different depending on the ages of the students and the type of class you’re teaching. Some sample rules might include: Treat others with respect. Take care of yourself. Take care of classroom property. Raise your hand to speak or to get someone’s attention."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose no more than 5 rules for your classroom.",
      "content": "Choose no more than 5 rules for your classroom. This will make it easier for students to remember them. These rules will guide behavior in a variety of circumstances so that you don’t need to spell out rules for every scenario."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure students know the rules.",
      "content": "Make sure students know the rules. Take time on the first day of class to cover your classroom’s rules. Explain what each rule means. Give examples of how rules are followed or not followed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline consequences.",
      "content": "Outline consequences. Tell students about consequences for breaking the rules. These might occur in stages, such as a warning, then staying after class, then detention, then visiting the principal, and so on. You might include a time-out or break for younger students. Younger students who are disruptive may need to be removed from a situation for a few minutes to recover their attention. Then they can rejoin the class."
    },
    {
      "title": "Post the rules.",
      "content": "Post the rules. Make a rules poster and hang it in the classroom. Phrase the rules in positive ways. For example, instead of saying, “Don’t push other people,” you can write, “Treat others with respect.” [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the students make a commitment to the rules.",
      "content": "Have the students make a commitment to the rules. Ask the students to come to an agreement with you about the rules. They can sign a pledge form or even just raise their hands. In doing so, they will promise to uphold the class rules. Another way to get students to buy into the rules is for students to take ownership of them. Get their input when developing rules for the classroom. Take time every now and then to talk about the rules and review them with students."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use non-verbal communication.",
      "content": "Use non-verbal communication. Using hand signals, body cues and other tactics can be helpful in getting students’ attention. For example, you might turn the lights off and on when it’s time to wrap up an activity. [2] X Research source Hand signals work particularly well with primary grades. Changing the non-verbal cues periodically will keep students from getting bored with them."

    {
      "title": "Praise students for acting appropriately.",
      "content": "Praise students for acting appropriately. Make a positive example of students behaving properly by letting students know when they have followed the rules. By showing students what good behavior looks like, they will know how to model the behavior. [3] X Research source Make sure to praise different students. Don’t always praise the same few students."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get parents involved early on.",
      "content": "Get parents involved early on. If there are discipline problems at the elementary school level, it can be helpful to get in touch with the child’s parents. Think about doing this before the discipline problem becomes serious. Earlier intervention can redirect a child away from problematic behavior."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give students tools for interacting with each other.",
      "content": "Give students tools for interacting with each other. Reinforce positive interactions by giving students tools to handle disagreements and miscommunications. Having tools to use for these interactions may help diffuse potential discipline problems. For example, talk about how students should ask another student for permission to take something. A student should look directly at the other student, wait until she is listening, and ask politely. Give students tools if they disagree with each other. For example, have students look calmly at each other and say, “I understand how you feel.” Then the student can explain his opinion calmly."

      "title": "Define behavioral expectations using the CHAMPS model.",
      "content": "Define behavioral expectations using the CHAMPS model. The CHAMPS model is a way to define how you expect students to behave in the classroom. This approach works well for a variety of settings and learning goals. Use the following points as your guide for designing how students will complete an activity with good behavior and success: C – Conversation: Can students talk during this activity? With whom? About what? H – Help: How should students get your attention if they need help? A – Activity: What is the objective of the activity? M – Movement: Can students get out of their seats for the activity? P – Participation: How will students demonstrate that they are participating? S – Success: If students complete the CHAMPS expectations, they should be successful with the activity and good behavior."

      "content": "Build relationships with your students. Your students are curious about you and want to hear stories about your life. Don’t share everything, of course, but relating stories about yourself from time to time helps transform you into a human being that students can relate to. Likewise, get to know your students.

      "content": "Speak in a normal voice. When you speak in a normal voice, students will typically respond by also speaking in a normal voice with moderate volume. If the classroom is noisy, don’t respond by raising your voice. Rather, you might start speaking in a normal voice so that the students need to quiet down to hear you. Or, you might wait to speak until the students are quiet [6] X Research source"

Keep in mind, however, that you shouldn’t become the student’s close friend. It’s important to maintain a level of distance in order to preserve your authority in the classroom.

Also consider including policies regarding academic dishonesty, technology use, handing in assignments, and so on. Check with your institution to get proper wording on college-wide policies."

A : Attend more fully. Ask the student to tell you about the issue. Ask what’s happening and who is involved. S : Spell out directions. Remind the student of the rules and consequences.
