Having goals and plans may result in an overall better sense of well-being about a year after bereavement. In an experiment on emotional resilience and stress responses, participants were given a stressful task to complete. The results showed that all participants were anxious about the task, regardless of how naturally resilient they were. But the more resilient participants returned to a calmer state more quickly than the participants who were not as resilient."

[8] X Research source Self-reflection can be used to help develop a positive attitude as well. Writing down your feelings and thoughts can help you recognize your behaviors and responses. At first, it might seem strange or awkward to write self-reflections. But with time and practice, you’ll recognize some behavior and emotional patterns in your writing. This will help you target areas that may be blocking you from your goals."

      "content": "Write about positive things in your day. Review the day and find positive things about it. These can include things that made you happy, proud, awestruck, grateful, calm, content, pleased, or any other positive emotion. For example, recall your morning routine, and spend time noticing the moments you felt peaceful or happy. This might include a beautiful view along your morning commute, or the pleasure of your first sip of coffee, or an enjoyable conversation you had. Take special time to focus on moments where you felt proud of yourself or grateful to someone else. These can be small things, such as gratitude for your partner making the bed. You might also take pride in the way you accomplished a task or completed a challenge you set for yourself. You may find it helpful to start your reflections with the positive moments of your day. Re-experiencing positive emotions can help you adjust your perspective on the negative moments."

These might include guilt, shame, embarrassment, frustration, disappointment, fear, or disgust. Do any of these thoughts seem extreme? Perhaps you are mortified for spilling coffee on your boss. Do you think that you’ll be fired because of the incident and you’ll never be able to find a job again? Extreme reactions to everyday occurrences can block more positive, productive thinking."

      "title": "Reframe negative moments as positive ones",
      "content": "Reframe negative moments as positive ones . Look over your list of negative moments. Spend time reframing these moments in a way where you can get positive (or at least neutral) emotions out of these experiences. For example, if you experienced road rage on your drive home, reframe the other driver’s intentions as making an honest mistake. If you felt embarrassed about something that happened during the day, think about how it was actually a silly or laughable situation. Even if your boss was upset about having coffee spilled on him, mistakes happen from time to time. With any luck, maybe your boss will see the humor in it also. If you don’t treat smaller mistakes as life-altering experiences, you will be able to handle situations better. One way to handle the coffee situation is to express your genuine concern that your boss is first and foremost okay and that you didn’t burn him. Next, you can offer to go buy him another shirt on your lunch hour, or offer to dry-clean the stained one."

[10] X Research source For example, perhaps your inner critic called you a dummy for spilling coffee on your boss. Your inner critic puts you down all the time and is nasty to you. Reflect on the times your inner critic says things like this. You will gain more insight into the times and situations when your inner critic comes out. Also, you can start to challenge the inner critic and other negative ways of thinking. This is an important part of building a positive attitude."

      "content": "Do things you enjoy. Take time for yourself by doing things you enjoy or that make you happy. It can be hard to take time for yourself, especially if you’re someone who tends to put other people first. It might also be challenging if you have a life situation such as having small children at home or taking care of someone who is ill. But always remember to “secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others.” You are the best caretaker when you are your best self. If music makes you happy, listen to music. If reading books makes you happy, take a little time to read in a calm environment. Go look at a beautiful view, take yourself to a museum, or watch a movie that you enjoy. Stay active doing the things that bring you pleasure. This is a great way to focus on the positive."

      "content": "Take time to think about moments of satisfaction. No one else is watching or judging your review of your day and yourself, so there’s no need to worry about seeming arrogant. You don’t have to be good at something or please others in order to enjoy it. If you’re good at cooking, admit to yourself that you’re a talented cook. Likewise, you don’t need to be able to charm woodland creatures in order to enjoy singing. Observing moments of satisfaction, pride, contentment or joy in your life and the activities that cause them is a good way to make sure you can repeat them again in the future."

      "title": "Avoid comparing yourself to other people.",
      "content": "Avoid comparing yourself to other people. Your view of yourself is very different from your view of other people, just as viewing a Monet painting from one foot away is very different from viewing it from twenty feet away. Realize that the image of someone else that you see may be a contrived image that he or she strives to project. This image may only partially reflect reality. Let go of measuring yourself against other people and basing your self-worth on other people’s opinions. This will help you make less subjective inferences about other people’s behavior. For example, if you have a negative interaction with a casual acquaintance, don’t assume that they don’t like you. Rather, assume that there was a miscommunication between the two of you, or that something else is frustrating your acquaintance."

Relationships are an important part of the human experience, even if you classify yourself as an “introvert,” or someone who recharges by being alone and doesn’t feel the need for a large number of friends. Friendships and relationships are a source of support, validation and strength for all genders and personalities. Maintain the healthy relationships in your life with family members and friends.

      "title": "Try problem-focused coping.",
      "content": "Try problem-focused coping. Problem-focused coping is where you focus on the problem that is causing you stress and work out its solution. Break down the problem into steps that will allow you to accomplish it. Identify potential hurdles or stumbling blocks and decide how you will deal with them as they arise. For instance, if you are having trouble getting a team of coworkers to work well together, sit down first and analyze the situation. Identify the types of situations going on. Then brainstorm and write down possible solutions for these problems. For example, Jeff doesn’t like Sally, and your employer doesn’t encourage teamwork and instead rewards the efforts of the individual. Using problem-focused coping, you should assert that, while Jeff and Sally are allowed to not like each other, a standard of professional conduct is expected and reinforce those standards. Then do a group exercise where everyone says three positive things about each other. In connecting team members and completing projects with resounding success, your team can serve as an example to help change the culture in your company."

Another way people experience positive emotions in the face of adversity is by finding positive meaning in ordinary events and within the adversity itself.
