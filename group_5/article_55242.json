For Mac, you can also add the icon to your Dock by clicking and dragging it. Or, if Chrome is already open, press Ctrl and click the icon in your Dock, and select Keep in Dock . Clicking that will ensure the icon stays in your Dock even after you close the app. For Windows, you can also add the icon to your taskbar by right-clicking it and selecting Pin to taskbar ."
