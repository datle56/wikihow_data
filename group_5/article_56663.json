      "content": "Lmk means “Let me know” in online chats, texts, and social media. You might see the acronym written as “LMK,” “Lmk,” or “lmk,” but all spellings mean the same thing. “Lmk” (or “Let me know”) means you’re asking for information while knowing it might not be available right away—but you’re hoping for an answer soon. [1] X Research source For example: Wanna grab drinks after work tomorrow? Lmk! 🍻” What do you want me to bring to the party? 🎉 Lmk!”"

      "content": "Ask someone for additional information. “Lmk” doesn’t necessarily demand an immediate response. Lmk is typically used to ask a question that someone might not know the answer to yet—so by sending it, you’re just asking them to reply whenever they can tell you what you want to know. [2] X Research source “Lmk when you can meet up this week—I wanna hear all about your trip!” Can you share the notes from today’s class with me? Lmk!! 🙏🥺”"

      "content": "Remind someone to tell you when they make a decision. You can also use “Lmk” to ask about a decision that someone hasn’t made yet. It’s a casual way to ask them to get in touch once they have an answer for you (without putting pressure on them to make the decision too fast). [3] X Research source “Hey, just curious if you decided where you want to eat tonight? 🍝 Lmk!” “Lmk if you’d have any interest in seeing a movie this weekend. I’m buying! 😁”"

Simply reassure them that you’re going to answer their question soon and leave it at that (or talk about something else if you want to). Them: “Hey, are you free on Friday? Lmk! 😊” You: “Idk what my work schedule is yet, but I’ll text you when I do!”"

      "title": "Get back to the other person as soon as you can answer their question.",
      "content": "Get back to the other person as soon as you can answer their question. Once you have an answer or have made a decision, send a quick reply. That way, they’ll get the information they need (and they’ll know you’re not ghosting them or forgetting about their message). You: “Hey, looks like I’m free on Friday after all. What do you wanna do??” Them: “Yay! Let’s hit up the bookstore and get ice cream! 🍨”"

      "content": "Lmk could be used at work, but not when a formal tone is required. “Lmk” is a casual term, but still more formal than acronyms like “Omg” or “Ikr.” So, use your best judgment in the workplace. If you’re sending a casual message to a colleague, Lmk might be appropriate—but in academic writing or formal requests to a boss, it isn't. [4] X Research source Is your workplace culture pretty casual? Do other coworkers use acronyms? If so, you could likely use Lmk. Ask yourself if your coworkers will understand what you’re saying. If not, just write the full phrase! Need to use a full phrase instead of an acronym? Try similar phrases such as: Please reply soon Keep me posted Keep me updated Please get back to me Please contact me Notify me"

When someone requests follow-up information with “Lmk,” you could respond and tell them that you’ll get back to them soon with “Lyk.” [5] X Research source For example: Them: “Hey, any word on when everyone’s free for dinner on Friday? Lmk!” You: “Still waiting on a couple of people to respond, but I’ll lyk soon! 😀”"
