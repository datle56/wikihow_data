If it does have to be re-centered one might do that by measuring distances with the defrosting grid as a guide and, in any case, holding the glass temporarily in place with gaffer's or other sticky tape."

At least in the case of cotton canvas, this will probably be not as far up onto the glass as originally (or as on a still-attached inside layer) because it will have shrunk since new."
