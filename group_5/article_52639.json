      "content": "A cosmic connection is a shared bond encouraging personal and spiritual growth. Have you ever felt like fate brought you closer to someone? It could be fate or destiny, or it could be the universe. The universe has its way of bringing people, places, and things together in due time. With a cosmic connection, the same is true, although these connections can be positive or negative in familial, romantic, or platonic relationships. These experiences serve as inspirations or challenges in your life, and their sole purpose is to give you the necessary lessons needed to learn and grow from. Not all fated connections are meant to last a lifetime, even if we want them to. However, through the experience, you may learn what type of love you’re willing to accept or what boundaries you’ll need to set in future relationships. A fated connection can become a permanent fixture in your life. These folks have your back every step of the way. It may not always be a smooth ride, but you'll learn and grow together. In these cases, a cosmic connection can become a cosmic soulmate or a cosmic love. [1] X Research source"
