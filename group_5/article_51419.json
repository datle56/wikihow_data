Your gross pay is the amount you get paid before taxes, benefits, and other deductions. Then multiply your gross pay by the number of pay periods in a calendar year. This number is your annual salary. For example, let’s say your gross pay is $1500 and you get paid biweekly (every 2 weeks). [1] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source This means you’d have 26 pay periods per year. So your annual salary would be $1500 x 26, or $39,000.

For example, let’s say you work 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. In this case, you’d multiply 8 x 5, which equals 40. Then multiply 40 x 52, which equals 2080 hours worked per year. [4] X Trustworthy Source State of New York Official website for the State of New York Go to source If you don’t have fixed working hours, use an approximation for the average number of hours you work per day. For instance, if you often work 8-10 hours per day, you can use 9 hours per day as an approximation."

This comes out to $19.23 per hour. [5] X Trustworthy Source State of New York Official website for the State of New York Go to source This calculation doesn’t account for overtime, bonus pay, sick pay, vacation pay, or other variables. For example, some jobs may offer overtime pay that is above the equivalent hourly rate for your base salary. [6] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source For instance, say you have a base salary of $40,000, but your job offers $25/hour for overtime pay. If you work a lot of overtime, then your average hourly rate might be higher than it would be if you didn’t earn overtime pay. To approximate your net hourly rate (or, what you max after taxes and deductions), divide your net pay on your most recent paystub by the number of hours you worked during that time period. For example, if your paystub says your net pay was $1330 and you worked 70 hours, your net hourly rate after taxes and benefits is $1330 divided by 70, or $19/hour."

[10] X Expert Source Andrew Lokenauth Finance Executive Expert Interview. 19 January 2023. To calculate your average hourly wage for a whole year, keep track of all the hours you work for that year, including unpaid work. Then divide your income (total money you make, minus expenses) by the number of hours you worked. If you make roughly the same amount of money every month, and work roughly the same number of hours, you can calculate your hourly rate for an average month. This will give you an approximate hourly wage for the year."

[13] X Expert Source Andrew Lokenauth Finance Executive Expert Interview. 19 January 2023. To calculate your salary for the year, multiply your total hourly wage by the number of hours you work in a week. Then multiply that number by 52.

Technically, you’re required to report tips on your federal and state tax returns if the total amount of tips exceeds $20 per month. If you report tips on your tax return, you’ll receive a tax bill from the IRS and your state after filing. Your exact tax bill will depend on how much you made and the state where you’re employed.
