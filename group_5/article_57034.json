      "title": "Get a spell book.",
      "content": "Get a spell book. You can get a real one or just use a notebook . If you do use a notebook, decorate it with a gold or bronze plate that says something along the lines of \"Private. Do Not Open\" or \"Property of [Your Name]. Do Not Touch\" You can find spells online to put in your spell book to make it more believable. Or if you don't want to use the internet, you can make up your own."

      "title": "Get a necklace with a charm.",
      "content": "Get a necklace with a charm . Choose a charm that symbolizes something magical, like a dragon. You can also specialize what kind of \"magic\" you perform. If it is evil charm magic, wear a pendant that is black or a very dark color and has a symbol of a skull or of a scythe (the thing the reaper carries). If you prefer potions, wear one with a cauldron symbol or symbol of a possible potion ingredient. If your magic specialty is good charm magic, have a cheerful colored pendant (pink, yellow, blue) with a symbol of a heart, or of a sun, or something that symbolizes good. There are many other types of magic, but you should do more research before determining your specialized \"magic\" category. Wear your pendant everyday."

      "title": "Wear \"witchy\" make up, but not make-up for a witch costume.",
      "content": "Wear \"witchy\" make up, but not make-up for a witch costume. Try using smoky eye shadow, because it looks dark. Scary green or earth tone eye shadow color is recommended as well. Try blending dark earth tones with black and have it fade as it gets closer to you. Also try darker clothes like dark red, dark blue, or purple."

      "title": "Look offended if \"non-witches\" talk about witches.",
      "content": "Look offended if \"non-witches\" talk about witches. Roll your eyes , respond with heavy sarcasm and change the subject, or walk away or say, \"How did we get to this subject? You know witches are not real.\""

      "title": "Carry your spell book with you everywhere.",
      "content": "Carry your spell book with you everywhere. Make sure your spell book is handy - and act over-protective of it. Make people suspicious of you so they will want to take a peek in your \"special book\" A couple of times, leave your spell book unattended. Wait for someone to look inside for about 10 seconds and quickly snatch it away from them and say something like \"Hey! Didn't your mother teach you not to look in someone's stuff?\" Then quickly flip through your book like you are making sure that they didn't mess it up in any way, and finally walk away in a huff."

      "content": "Look worried when there is a full moon/new moon. And if anyone asks you if you have something planned that night, say, \"Sorry, I have to practice my char... I mean I have to study for a test.\" Then walk away in a hurry."

      "title": "Make a wand.",
      "content": "Make a wand . You can use a stick, you could make one out of paper, or you could buy one. The best way to make it more convincing is to buy a cheap wand (whether online or in-store, just make sure it's sturdy) and decorated with the magic that you prefer to perform. Paint it black or dark colored if you are better at dark charm magic, paint it an earthy tone if your favorite magic is potion, and use a pink, yellow, or even blue if you like good charm magic."
