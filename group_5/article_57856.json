      "title": "If the relationship was abusive, it may be best to stop all communication with them.",
      "content": "If the relationship was abusive, it may be best to stop all communication with them. Going no contact means blocking your ex from all ways of contacting you. That means social media, texting, calling, and seeing them in person. Avoiding them will help you heal from the relationship without them manipulating you. [2] X Research source The no-contact rule typically lasts 30 days, but it may be best to stick to the no-contact rule indefinitely when moving on from a particularly unhealthy relationship. [3] X Research source Someone who struggles to feel empathy and reciprocate feelings may turn to manipulation to form the relationship they want. Not communicating with your ex will break this manipulative cycle and help you connect with your feelings as an individual."

      "content": "Heal by creating distance between you and your ex. Boundaries will not only help you protect yourself from their selfish behavior, but they will encourage you to grow. You are worthy of respect and deserve kindness, so set boundaries that’ll help you bloom. Stick to the no-contact rule and avoid answering their calls, or try your best not to talk about them. [4] X Research source Build boundaries to protect yourself from further abuse rather than building them to keep people out. For example, keep some personal information like your fears to yourself when meeting new people, but don’t be afraid to express your interests. Vocalize your boundaries by telling your ex, “You can’t treat me this way,” or, “I don’t have to listen to your abuse.” Prioritize self-care when establishing your boundaries by focusing on your needs first."

      "content": "Move on by making peace with the past. You’re most likely angry with your ex and how they manipulated you. It’s normal—healthy even—to feel hatred toward the relationship, but your anger won’t help you move forward. Take time to reflect on the ups and downs of the relationship, focusing on what you learned. The goal is to eventually make peace with what happened. [5] X Research source Anger can help you see the wrongs in the relationship, but it won’t help you heal emotionally . Forgiveness doesn’t mean you have to let your ex off the hook. They hurt you, and you don’t need to forget it. What you do need is to forgive yourself."

You may feel lost, confused, angry, and frustrated when leaving someone with narcissistic traits, and it’s okay to grieve what you’ve lost. Be kind to yourself; healing takes time.

[12] X Research source Every feeling you’re feeling is valid, even if it contradicts what you think you should be feeling. Acknowledge your emotions, feel them, and let them go.
