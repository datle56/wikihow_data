[1] X Research source However, some people have had success machine-washing their Merrells even though it’s not officially recommended. [2] X Research source When in doubt though, it’s usually best to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations to avoid damaging your shoes. If your shoes are so dirty or old that it’s either the washing machine or trash, then it’s worth a shot! But if you still love your shoes and don’t want to risk ruining them, hand-washing them is your best bet."

If you recently hiked a muddy trail or spent a long weekend in the woods, you may need to bring in the soap and water. Mix some mild soap with warm water and wipe down your shoes with the mixture using a clean cloth. Then, rinse the shoes with water to wash off all of the suds.

Make sure you add clothes or even just a couple of towels to the machine so there's some cushioning for your shoes. [11] X Research source To speed up the drying process, prop your shoes up in front of a fan. Buy good quality shoes. They will last longer. Wear the shoes and get the ones that fit you properly. Go to buy them towards the end of the day when you have walked for some time."
