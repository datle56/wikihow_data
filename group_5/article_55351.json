While searching, a beautiful sacred woman appeared and told the scouts to tell their people that she had arrived. [8] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source When the White Buffalo Calf Woman arrived, she brought a sacred pipe and taught them 7 sacred ways to pray. Before she left, she told the Lakota people that she would come again to restore harmony and spirituality to this troubled world. The woman then rolled on the earth 4 times, changing color each time, and turned into a white buffalo calf before she disappeared. As soon as the woman left, great herds of buffalo surrounded the camps, ending the famine. Some Native groups say that the birth of a white calf is an omen because it often takes place in unexpected places around impoverished people.
