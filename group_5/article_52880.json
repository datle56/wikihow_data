Though you may be able to treat your Baker's cyst at home, you want to make sure it is, in fact, a Baker's cyst and not something that requires medical attention, such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial obstruction. If you experience swelling or purplish marks on your toes and feet, see a doctor right away.

      "title": "Ice your knee around the cyst.",
      "content": "Ice your knee around the cyst. Ice your knee injury as soon as possible. Icing helps reduce swelling and inflammation around the injury, which will also help relieve some of the pain. Only leave the ice on your knee for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Allow the area to warm to room temperature (another 15 to 20 minutes) before reapplying the ice. This can help reduce swelling and pain for the first day or two after the initial injury, and you can ice your knee as often as you want during this period.

      "content": "Use a compress. A compress helps reduce swelling to the injured area, and it also helps to stabilize your knee. Tie an elastic bandage (ace wrap), trainer's tape, a brace, or even a piece of clothing around the injury.

While lying down, raise your leg above the level of your heart (or as high as you can without causing pain). If you can't raise the injured leg, try to keep it at least parallel to the ground.

      "content": "Go back for a check-up if your cyst gets bigger. An enlarged cyst could cause swelling in your lower leg because it might compress the nearby veins. Because of this, it's important to see your doctor if your cyst grows. Allow your doctor to examine you, then follow their treatment advice.

Even if you've already consulted your doctor for a treatment plan, return if you suspect the cyst has ruptured or encountered other complications. If your Baker's cyst ruptures, the fluid will leak into the calf area in your leg, which can lead to: [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The sensation of water running down your calf Redness and swelling Bruising that spreads from the back of your knee to your ankle Sharp pain due to the leaked fluid and subsequent inflammation, which can lead to blood clots.

If you have secondary cysts (fluid accumulation from the front and back of the knee), your doctor may also remove fluid from the front or side of the knee as well. This will allow greater comfort by reducing pain and swelling and allowing you to move your knee more freely. Your doctor will use an ultrasound to correctly inject a needle into the fluid and will pull back on the plunger to suck it out. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your doctor will use an 18 or 20-gauge needle due to the thick fluid within the cyst(s). Your doctor may also need to perform the procedure more than once depending on the amount of fluid present or because the fluid has accumulated at multiple sites. Itâ€™s common for doctors to perform both an aspiration (drainage) followed by a steroid injection.

      "content": "Discuss surgical excision of the cyst. This is a last resort if symptoms persist, other treatments have failed, or the cyst has become very large. While you are under anesthesia, your surgeon will make small (3 to 4-millimeter) incisions around the cyst to drain the fluid. The surgeon may not remove the entire cyst because it can typically resolve on its own. The surgeon will stitch the incisions once the cyst has been drained. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The procedure typically takes an hour or less based on the size of the cyst. A larger cyst will take longer because the swelling may have wrapped it around nerves and blood vessels. You can expect to be given pain medication as needed. Once home, follow the RICE therapy method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). Your surgeon may suggest crutches or a cane to keep weight off the area for several days."
