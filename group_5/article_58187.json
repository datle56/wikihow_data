But even the tiny atom has even smaller parts that make up its structure. [1] X Research source An atom is made of 3 parts. Those parts are neutrons, protons, and electrons. The center of the atom is called the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons. Electrons are the particles that float around the exterior part of the atom, like planets circling the sun. [2] X Research source The size of an atom is incredibly small. To give some perspective, think about the largest sports arena you know about, maybe the Houston Astrodome. If you consider the Astrodome to be the atom, then the nucleus of that atom is about the size of a pea somewhere around the 50 yard line. [3] X Research source"

[17] X Research source The format for a chemical equation consists of reactants on the left side of the equation, then an arrow in the direction of the products of the equation, then the products. The parts on one side of the equation have to balance the parts on the other. [18] X Research source For example, Reactant 1 + Reactant 2 → Product 1 + Product 2 Here is an example using the symbols for Tin, which is Sn, in its oxidized form, which is SnO2, combined with hydrogen gas, which is written as H2. SnO2 + H2 → Sn + H2O. But this equation is not balanced since the quantity of reactants must equal the quantity of products. The left side has one more oxygen atom than the right side. [19] X Research source Use basic math to balance the equation by indicating 2 hydrogen units on the left side of the equation, and 2 water molecules on the right.

If you are having trouble balancing chemical equations, think about the equation as part of a recipe, but one that needs adjusting on both sides, so you can make more of less of your recipe. The equation gives you the ingredients, on the left side of the equation, but does not tell you how much to use of each ingredient. The equation also tells you what the products will include, but again does not tell you the quantity of the products. You have to figure that out. Using the previous example, SnO2 + H2 → Sn + H2O, consider why this equation, or recipe formula, won’t work. The Sn parts are equal on both sides, and the H2 parts are equal on both sides. But the left side has 2 oxygen parts, and the right side has only 1 oxygen. Change the right side of the equation to indicate the product will contain 2 H2O parts. The 2 in front of the H2O means all the quantities in that grouping are now doubled. So now the oxygen balances, but adding the 2 means there is more hydrogen on the right side of the equation than on the left. Go back to the left and change the H2 ingredient to be twice that, by putting a 2 in front of the H2. Now you have adjusted the ingredients on both sides of the equation. What goes into the recipe and what comes out, are equal, or balanced."
