      "content": "There are 3 mandatory and 4 optional Rakat in the Maghrib prayer. Maghrib is one of the 5 daily Salah (prayers), and Muslims perform it just after sunset so that it ends at dark. Maghrib has 3 rakat Fardh, 2 rakat Sunnah, and 2 rakat Nafl. [1] X Research source Rakat are units of movement and supplication performed during Salah. Fardh prayers are obligatory, and missing them is a major sin. If you miss a prayer, make it up as soon as you remember it. Sunnah prayers are highly recommended, and you will gain great rewards for performing them, but there is no sin for skipping them. Nafl prayers are completely optional and can be skipped without penalty. Wajib prayers are obligatory (second to Fardh) and are only included in the Isha (night) prayer."
