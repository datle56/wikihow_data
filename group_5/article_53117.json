Then, set the timer for no more than 30 seconds for smaller fruit, such as blueberries, to make sure the fruit doesn’t overcook. [2] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source For larger fruit, such as a frozen banana, set the timer for about 2 minutes. If your microwave doesn’t have a defrost setting, you can also use the 50% power setting. This will ensure that the outside of fruit doesn’t start to cook will the inside is still frozen.

Before microwaving the fruit any longer, open the microwave door and check to see if the fruit is done defrosting or needs to be stirred. [4] X Research source If some of the fruit is partially thawed while other sections are still frozen, use a spoon to stir it up so it defrosts more evenly. Because frozen fruit tends to defrost unevenly in the microwave, remove any pieces that are done before defrosting the rest for more time. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source Strawberries, for example, tend to defrost unevenly because they come in a wide variety of sizes. Therefore, some of the smaller strawberries may be done after 30 seconds, while larger ones may need more time in the microwave. Make sure that you use a spoon or fork when handling the fruit, as using your hands can cause bacteria to transfer.

To make sure that the water stays cold so the fruit won’t grow bacteria as it defrosts, remove the fruit from the bowl every 30 minutes and drain the water. As you change the water, press down on a piece of the fruit with a spoon to see if it’s done thawing. If the fruit is still frozen, refill the bowl with cold water and return the fruit baggie into the water as quickly as you can. [13] X Research source Smaller fruit, such as blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries, will likely thaw quicker than larger, more dense fruit, such as apples or peaches. Checking the fruit when you change the water will let you know as soon as it’s done defrosting so you can use it immediately or transfer it to the refrigerator."

Before defrosting fruit in the refrigerator, it’s important that you check the thermometer to make sure your refrigerator temperature is set at 40 °F (4 °C) or below to keep the fruit from getting too warm and risk growing bacteria. If your refrigerator temperature is set above 40 °F (4 °C), use the dial or arrows to adjust it so the fruit will defrost at a safe temperature. In most cases, the refrigerator thermometer is located at the top of the inside of the refrigerator. If this is not the case for your refrigerator, check the manual to see where it might be located."

In most cases, packaged fruit takes about 6 to 8 hours per 1 pound (0.45 kg) to completely thaw in the refrigerator. [17] X Research source It can be helpful, though, to start checking the fruit after a few hours if you’re defrosting a small amount to see if it’s done. For example, if you’re only thawing 1 ⁄ 2 pound (0.23 kg) of small berries, you’ll likely want to check on the berries after 2 to 3 hours to see if they’re done defrosting. Fruit frozen with syrup generally takes longer to defrost than fruit frozen in dry sugar or without any additives."
