      "content": "You must be at least 18 to start your own PayPal account. PayPal users must be the age of majority (typically 18) to sign and enter into a legal agreement, which is why a minor cannot create their own PayPal account. Additionally, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories. [1] X Research source Similarly, you must be 18 to use Venmo , Zelle , Meta Pay , and Google Pay . In the past, PayPal offered a student account for people under 18, but it was discontinued indefinitely in 2016."

      "title": "Yes, with the permission of your guardian.",
      "content": "Yes, with the permission of your guardian. A guardian can permit their legal minor to use their PayPal account to purchase items or receive money in their name. For example, if a minor wanted to purchase something online using their guardian’s PayPal account, they would ask them if they had permission before using their guardian’s login credentials to make their purchase. Alternatively, they can have their guardian make the purchase for them. [2] X Research source Any guardian who allows their minor to use their PayPal account must ensure that all purchases are approved and reviewed by them, as they have full legal responsibility over any transactions occurring over the platform. A minor may also arrange to pay their guardian back using funds from their student checking account if they have one."

      "title": "If you create a PayPal account underage, the account will be closed.",
      "content": "If you create a PayPal account underage, the account will be closed. Any minor who created a PayPal account before the age of 18 will have their account permanently deleted. Since providing false, misleading information is a breach of the User Agreement, PayPal has the right to terminate your account, refuse to provide PayPal’s services, hold any balance on the account for up to 180 days, contact the user’s bank, and take legal action against the user—it’s not worth it! [3] X Research source Underage PayPal account users could have their funds in holding for up to 180 days and have to contact their employers or clients to update their payment method. If you accidentally created a PayPal account under 18, the best thing to do is delete your account and make a new one once you’re 18."
