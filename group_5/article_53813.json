This is because Jello is less-pigmented. It also may not be effective on all hair types; some people's hair is more porous and accepts dye more readily than others'. Coloring your hair at home with heavy 20 or 30 volume bleach and store-bought dyes might get a little tricky, anywayâ€”lots of people who try that end up going to the salon to correct the shade. Jello gives you a way to experiment and have fun without any risks."
