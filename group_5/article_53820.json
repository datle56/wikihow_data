      "content": "Find a light-colored synthetic wig. Acrylic paint won’t show up on wigs that are dark. Go with a wig that’s blonde, white, silver, or pastel. Acrylic paint also won't damage the fibres of a synthetic wig. [1] X Research source Don’t try bleaching a synthetic wig so you can dye it with paint. Bleaching will destroy the synthetic fibers in the wig. Natural hair wigs should be dyed with real hair dye, not acrylic paint."
