[7] X Research source For example, if you’re manifesting a new car, visualize yourself in your dream vehicle in great detail. What’s the make and model? How does it smell inside? What does it feel like to sit in the driver’s seat? The more specific your visualization, the more motivated and focused you’ll be when it comes to making it happen in real life. Then, take action. Break your goal into smaller steps to make it easier. For example, how will you save up the money? Where will you search?"

This positive energy will help attract the blessings that 3232 has to offer! [8] X Research source Be optimistic. Expecting the best outcome from a situation makes it more likely that you’ll experience it (or be able to cope better with negative results). In fact, optimism is linked to better mental and physical health! [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Accept change. Change is inevitable, but even changes for the better can be scary or uncomfortable at first. Persevere and know that a new beginning awaits you on the other side. Release self-sabotaging negativity. Forgive yourself and others for past wrongdoings or mistakes and let go of grudges. Emotional negativity weighs you down and makes it harder to be your best self. Surround yourself with positive people. You don’t have to accomplish your goals alone. Surround yourself with people who love, support, and nurture you to help you succeed. Be more present. Don’t forget to enjoy today while you work toward a better tomorrow. Spend time with loved ones, practice self-care , and don’t be afraid to simply “be.”"
