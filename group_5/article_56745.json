[2] X Expert Source Kamal Ravikant Author, Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It Expert Interview. 2 December 2019. Drill down to the core of those negative thoughts and tell yourself a different story. Think about what you would say to a close friend who said those things about themselves. [3] X Research source For example, if you forgot to buy trash bags when you got groceries, you might say to yourself, \"Ugh! I'm so stupid! How could I forget that?\" Instead of calling yourself stupid, you might think, \"Oops! Forgot those pesky trash bags. I'll just pick some up next time I go out—no big deal.\" Don't try to fight negative thoughts, though—they're a part of who you are. Simply drown them out with more positive, affirmative thoughts about yourself. It might feel weird at first, but after a while, it becomes habitual to think that way.

Self-love isn't about fixing all the \"bad\" things about yourself. Instead, accept that they're all parts of the same whole. When you love yourself, you love all of you because you wouldn't have the good without the bad. [5] X Expert Source Kamal Ravikant Author, Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It Expert Interview. 2 December 2019. For example, maybe you have a hard time trusting people. You wish you could be more trusting and open up more, but instead of trying to change, focus on how not immediately trusting people helps keep you safe."

      "content": "Focus on your effort rather than the result to control perfectionism . If you expect yourself to be perfect all the time, you'll never be pleased with anything you produce. This can lead to low self-esteem. Instead, make a point to appreciate the work you put into completing a task, rather than looking for flaws in what you produced. [6] X Research source Changing your focus from the final product to the effort you put into it will help you appreciate your own good work and take pride in what you do. Avoid stereotypical ideas and images of perfection, such as models in beauty magazines or on social media. Remind yourself that the actual person probably doesn't look like that in real life!"

      "content": "Practice gratitude for good things rather than focusing on the negative. It's human nature to see negative things as bigger and more important than positive things, but this also does tremendous damage to your self-esteem. When you find yourself focusing on negative or less favorable events in your life, immediately try to name 3 to 5 things that you can be grateful for. Look for the positive side even when bad things happen to you. [7] X Research source For example, if you lose your job, it can be easy to spiral into thinking that you were terrible at your job and no one will ever hire you again. Instead, you might think that now you have the opportunity to find something that's a better fit for you."

If you wouldn't call your best friend these names, don't call yourself those names either! [8] X Research source For example, if you lose your job, you might think \"I'm such a failure. I'll never amount to anything.\" Stop. Take a deep breath and be more constructive. Think instead, \"I lost my job, but I can learn from this experience to find and keep a new job that suits me better.\" You might also look at yourself in the mirror and think, \"I'm so ugly.\" Instead of thinking that, list 3 things that you like about your appearance and focus on those. Each time, challenge yourself to add one more thing to your list. Reader Poll: We asked 392 wikiHow readers to tell us how they stop negative thinking and build their self-esteem, and 72% of them said that it’s most helpful to avoid “comparing themselves to other people.” [Take Poll] One of the kindest things you can do for yourself is avoid negative comparisons!"

This sort of \"catastrophizing\" is really bad for your self-esteem because you spiral from a small error to basically believing that everything is doomed—and that's rarely the case. Challenge those thoughts with realistic and logical observations to reframe your conclusion. [9] X Research source For example, you might make a small mistake at work and obsess about it to the point that you're convinced you're going to be fired for it (when that's likely not the case at all). Instead of allowing that to happen, tell yourself, \"I just made a small mistake. I can fix it and let everyone know it won't happen again.\""

[10] X Expert Source Kamal Ravikant Author, Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It Expert Interview. 2 December 2019. Be specific! For example, instead of, \"I am generous,\" you might write, \"Any time I see that a friend is struggling, I give them a small, thoughtful gift to show that I care. This makes me generous.\" As you read and reflect on your list, remember that even the items that seem insignificant are still reasons that you are worthy of respect and love."

The idea of boundaries can sound like a big, scary thing, but it's really just about saying \"no\" when you don't have the energy or desire to do something. Remember that \"no\" is a complete sentence—you don't have to explain or justify yourself. Honor and respect your own limits and other people will recognize that you're respecting them as well. [13] X Research source For example, a co-worker might've asked you to take them home after work, but they're always running late. This bugs you because you have to get home as soon as possible to let your dog out. You might say, \"I'm happy to give you a ride, but I need you to leave on time so I can get home.\" When you let others know what you are and aren't okay with, your relationships become more balanced and healthy because you're not putting up with things that make you uncomfortable."
