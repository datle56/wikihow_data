      "content": "Make a joke or a meme with MFW. This abbreviation is also handy when you want to crack a joke —either at someone else’s expense or your own—or even turn the joke into a meme. Making a meme is pretty easy; just track down an image that represents your “MFW” statement in a funny way and paste the text over it in a photo editing program. [3] X Research source For example, you could use the “puppet monkey meme” template as a base and write “MFW someone says, ‘What’s that smell?’” on it. Alternatively, you could start with the “man blinking meme” and write something like, “MFW someone tells me the math test wasn’t even that hard.”"

      "content": "MFW is sometimes written with the > symbol, as >MFW. The abbreviation MFW originated on 4chan in 2009, used in “green text stories” (so named because they’re written in green-colored text). The > is part of 4chan’s usual formatting, where stories are segmented, and each piece begins with >. Thus, people who don’t use 4chan will probably just write “MFW” and not “>MFW,” but they mean the same thing. [4] X Research source “>locked my keys in my car / >waited for 3 hours for help / >missed my date / >MFW 😵” “>broke my computer / >sent it in for repairs / >it’s still not working right / >MFW 🙄”"
