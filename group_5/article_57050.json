    {
      "title": "Start with a 4 block deep hole.",
      "content": "Start with a 4 block deep hole. The larger the hole you dig, the more likely it is for someone to fall into the quicksand. It can help to pick a sandy spot such as a desert or beach so that your quicksand blends in with its surroundings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a layer of dirt along the bottom.",
      "content": "Add a layer of dirt along the bottom. Fill the bottom of the hole with dirt, coarse dirt, or grass blocks. Flowers only grow on dirt, coarse dirt, and grass, so this layer is necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place tall flowers/tall grass above the dirt.",
      "content": "Place tall flowers/tall grass above the dirt. Fill the layer directly above the dirt with either tall grass or 2-block tall flowers (ie. rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs, or peonies). This will support the final layer of sand/gravel. The dirt and flowers act as space-holders. You canâ€™t place gravity-affected blocks (ie. (normal/red) sand, gravel, concrete powder, anvils) above air, otherwise they'll collapse, so the flowers are instead used to keeps the top layer of sand from falling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a layer of sand on top of the flowers.",
      "content": "Place a layer of sand on top of the flowers. This layer of sand serves to hide the trap from outside observers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place string on top of the sand.",
      "content": "Place string on top of the sand. This keeps the sand blocks from falling once you remove the blocks below. When someone walks through the string over your sand, the strings will break and the sand will fall."

      "content": "Dig a access tunnel down towards your trap."

      "content": "Break all the flowers. Now that the sand has been placed, they're no longer needed, and can be broken."
    },
    {
      "title": "Break the layer of dirt at the bottom.",
      "content": "Break the layer of dirt at the bottom. Similarly, now the the flowers have been removed, the grass is also no longer needed. This also allows you to deepen the trap, should you choose to do so."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a layer of cobwebs (optional).",
      "content": "Add a layer of cobwebs (optional). If you like, place a layer of cobwebs 2 blocks below the top layer of sand, such that there's a layer of air above them. This can make it harder victims to escape, and will simulate the slow-motion falling effect of quicksand."

      "content": "Deepen the hole by a few blocks. This is to make room for possible additions to the trap."

      "title": "Fill the bottom of the pit with lava (optional).",
      "content": "Fill the bottom of the pit with lava (optional). This'll quickly kill anyone/anything that falls into the trap, otherwise they'll be stranded at the bottom til they dig themselves out. Only do this if you're not concerned with looting items."

      "title": "Alternatively, deepen the hole by at least 23 blocks (optional).",
      "content": "Alternatively, deepen the hole by at least 23 blocks (optional). 23 blocks is the minimum lethal fall height (without armour or Feather Falling). Place a layer of hoppers along the bottom to collect the items."
