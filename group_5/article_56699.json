It helps to keep your writing just a bit hard to read, so people don't know what you're actually writing without looking closely at it. Of course, what you're writing doesn't need to be on task. Write a grocery list or the next great novel."

You can just be playing around, as long as you can hide the screen from others' view. [3] X Research source If you do play on your computer, though, make sure that your company doesn't take screenshots, which could get you fired if you're not working when you should be. Similarly, if you're at school, you can get in trouble for not being on task. Also, make sure no one can walk up behind you and see what you're doing. It helps to have a work document open that you can easily flip to."
