      "content": "Write the conversion factor as a fraction. Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has an overall value of 1. This is useful, because you can use the conversion fraction to change units without changing the value of the measurement. When you begin with nanometers and want to convert to meters, you will use the following conversion factor: [3] X Research source 1 meter 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 nm {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1{\\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\\text{ nm}}}}} This is the fraction to convert from nanometers into meters. If you want to begin with meters and convert to nanometers, you just need to flip the fraction upside down."

      "content": "Set up a conversion equation. To convert from one unit to another, you need to set up a simple multiplication equation. You begin with your initial measurement and multiply it by the conversion factor. The result will be your answer. [4] X Research source Remember that you can cancel units that appear once in a numerator and once in a denominator. This is the purpose of the conversion fraction. Your original measurement begins with nanometers, and the conversion fraction has nanometers in the denominator. Thus, the units of nanometers will cancel, and what remains will be the answer in meters. For this conversion, suppose you have measured a germ that is 2,600 nanometers wide. The conversion equation will be: 2 , 600 nm = 2 , 600 nm ∗ 1 meter 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 nm {\\displaystyle 2,600{\\text{ nm}}=2,600{\\text{ nm}}*{\\frac {1{\\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\\text{ nm}}}}}"

      "content": "Learn the relative positions of the units. The strength and simplicity of the metric system stem from the fact that the units are based on multiples of 10. Therefore, converting from one unit to another is simply a matter of moving the decimal point the correct number of spaces. To use this shortcut tool, you need to know the exponent measures of the units involved. [6] X Research source The meter is the basic unit of length measurement in the metric system. Written as a base 10 exponent, 1 m = 10 0 m {\\displaystyle 1{\\text{ m}}=10^{0}{\\text{ m}}} . The nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. Written as a base 10 exponent, 1 nm = 10 − 9 m {\\displaystyle 1{\\text{ nm}}=10^{-9}{\\text{ m}}} ."

      "title": "Know the LARS mnemonic.",
      "content": "Know the LARS mnemonic. For moving decimal places, “LARS” is a handy memory device. It stands for “Left-Add, Right-Subtract.” This tells you what to do with the decimal point if you wish to either add or subtract to change exponents. If you want to convert your measurement from a small exponent to a larger one, you will be adding units to the exponent, and for each one addition to the exponent, you will move the decimal point one space to the left. Moving from a larger unit of measure to a smaller, you will be subtracting exponents, which will involve moving the decimal point to the right. For example, consider converting kilometers to meters. A kilometer is 10 3 {\\displaystyle 10^{3}} meters, but the single meter is 10 0 {\\displaystyle 10^{0}} . Thus, you want to subtract 3 in the exponent, so you will move the decimal to the right three places (\"Left-Add, RIGHT-SUBTRACT\"). Therefore, if you begin with a measure of 1.234 km, you would make the following change to meters: 1.234 km ............(original unit) 12.34 .................(move decimal one space right) 123.4..................(move decimal two spaces right) 1,234 m..................(move decimal three spaces right)"

      "content": "Decide how you want to change the exponent. To convert from nanometers, which are units of 10 -9 m, into meters, which are units of 10 0 m, you are moving from -9 to 0. This requires you to add 9. According to the LARS mnemonic, adding 9 units in the exponent means moving the decimal place 9 spaces to the left (“Left-Add”)."

      "content": "Move the decimal as needed. For this example, suppose you have the measurement of a germ at 2,600 nm. You need to move the decimal point 9 spaces to the left. Since this is a whole number with no decimal point showing, you can insert the decimal at the end of the number and then count the spaces to move it. When you run out of numbers, you will fill in all remaining spaces with zeroes. [7] X Research source Write 2,600 nm as “2,600. nm” with a decimal point. Then move the decimal as follows: 260.0………. (one space left) 26.00……….(two spaces left) 2.600……….(three spaces left) .2600……….(four spaces left) .02600………(five spaces left) .002600…….(six spaces left) .0002600……(seven spaces left) .00002600…..(eight spaces left) .000002600…..(nine spaces left)"
