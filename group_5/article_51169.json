This can be achieved by breeding certain double-element monsters, or a triple-element monster and a single-element monster. The best combination is a Spunge and a Noggin , as if you fail and get a Noggin instead of a Shellbeat you can immediately try again. [1] X Research source The following combinations are also the breeding combinations to get a Rare Shellbeat.
