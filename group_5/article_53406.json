      "content": "No, not if you have virgin or unprocessed hair. While there is a misconception that perms will leave your hair damaged and dry, if your hair is already healthy, a perm shouldn’t do too much damage. If you have lightened or bleached hair, getting a perm is slightly riskier, so it’s important to go to a professional. [1] X Research source If you have colored or bleached hair, make sure you use a perm for colored hair. It will be less damaging and protect your hair more. Hot perms (or acid perms) are slightly less damaging than cold perms (or alkaline perms). If you have damaged or bleached hair, consider asking your stylist about a hot perm."

      "content": "Your hair could be weakened. Perm chemicals change the protein bonds within your hair. After a perm, a lot of your natural moisture is lost, and you might be prone to split ends and breakage, especially on the ends of your hair. Perming your hair the first time usually isn’t the problem, it’s perming multiple times over already damaged hair. You may notice that your hair becomes drier and frizzier as you get more perms."

As long as the perm chemicals stay on your hair strands and not your scalp, it shouldn’t cause any issues. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that perms can cause hair breakage, though. The chemicals in perms cause swelling of the hair follicle, which can lead to it breaking off.

      "content": "Yes, if you wash it right away. Most perms take 48 hours to neutralize, which is why hair stylists recommend waiting 2 days before washing your hair. If you don’t like your perm, hop in the shower as soon as possible and wash your hair with shampoo. Use a conditioner to hydrate your hair and protect it from any damage. [7] X Research source If it’s been longer than 2 days, you may not be able to undo a perm . The best thing to do for your hair is to use deep conditioning treatments for moisture."
