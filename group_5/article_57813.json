As long as you address any moisture problems in the car, the mold spores can’t grow.

There are a few other options to make sure the mold is dead.

Then, wipe clean. NEVER combine bleach and ammonia. They produce a toxic vapor when they are mixed. Bleach also reacts with hydrogen peroxide and other cleaning products, so only mix it with water to be safe. [10] X Research source"

Mold is still a problem even when you can’t see it, but getting rid of it is a little trickier. Kill mold in your car’s AC by turning the car off and spraying a disinfectant into the air vents. [12] X Research source Then, turn on the car and switch the AC to fan mode – so it’s not cooling the air – with the fan on high. With the fan still running, set the system to recirculate the air. An image of a small car with a U-shaped arrow inside usually identifies this feature. Spray the disinfectant into your car’s recirculation vent. It’s often on the driver’s side floor, near the console, or in the trunk. Check your owner's manual if you can’t find it. If you continue to smell mold when you start your car, replace the cabin filter . With the doors open, run the car for 5 minutes running the fan on full power to dry everything out."

Since it grows anywhere with adequate moisture, it often infests your car’s air conditioner evaporator and ducts. This means you may smell mold long before you see it."

Ragnolo says, “Mold is generated by humidity, and so you should be reducing that at a minimum.” Cleaning your car regularly and allowing it to completely dry is the best way to prevent this growth. It’s also important to clean up any spills immediately. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Use a fungicide after you clean to ensure you’ve killed any mold that’s present in your car. Parking your car in the sun instead of in a damp garage also helps prevent mold growth. Ragnolo recommends ventilation and allowing sunlight to reach mold-prone areas to help prevent growth. Use a moisture trap to dry out the air inside your car. Ventilate your car and turn up the heat to dry out the air vents."

[20] X Research source Here are a few conditions that might cause mold to grow in your car: You’ve been driving in wet weather or left your windows open. There’s excess condensation and bad ventilation in your car. Your sunroof, windshield, or windows is leaking. You spilled a beverage or left wet items in your car. Your car has been sitting in a damp place for a long time. You don’t clean your car regularly. The car was flooded during inclement weather events."
