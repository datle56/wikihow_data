      "content": "Find rod brackets specifically made for the ceiling. Brackets meant for the wall will have a shallower \"hook,\" which may not work for the ceiling. Ceiling curtain rod brackets have a deeper hook to secure the rod. Choose between screw-mounted and no-drill self-adhesive curtain rod brackets depending on your ceiling. Screw-mounted brackets are sturdier but may not be the best choice if you’re renting your home. Installing curtains with adhesive hooks or brackets is easier but may not work for textured ceilings. Choose a rod that's 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) wider than your window or the area you want to curtain off. [1] X Research source Pick up a hollow wall anchor set or some molly bolts if your brackets don't come with them and you have lath and plaster or drywall ceilings. Choose the same size as the screws that come with your kit. Screws work fine if you're going into wood, but with drywall, you need to anchor the holes with something sturdier. Lath and plaster ceilings may or may not need wall anchors, depending on the weight of your curtain and rod. If you're not sure what to get, ask for help at the home improvement store. Bring in your brackets so they can see them. If you're using wall anchors , make sure they're made to support the weight you're hanging up. Anchors come in different weight ratings, recommends Phillip. [2] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."

      "title": "Measure and mark where you want the brackets to be.",
      "content": "Measure and mark where you want the brackets to be. For a window, place the brackets about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the wall so the curtains aren't right against the window frame. Then, place the brackets either right at the outer edges of the window or 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) past the edges of the window on either side. Mark the placement of the brackets on the ceiling with a pencil. [3] X Research source Keep in mind, you're aiming for the curtain rod to extend 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) on either side of the window. However, a decorative end cap may affect how far you want the brackets out from the window. If the endcaps are longer, you may want to place the brackets closer to the width of the window so there's room for the caps to extend past the brackets. When dividing a room with a curtain , your measurements can be less precise as long as the curtain hangs where you want it. Always hold the rod up to your marks to see if it looks like it’s in the right place, and adjust the bracket placement if necessary. If you're going to hang curtains for several windows of the same size, try making a cardboard template. Mark where the edges of the windows are and where to drill the holes in the cardboard. Then, use it to easily figure out where to drill above each window."

      "title": "Drill a pilot hole that's the width of the hollow wall anchors you'll use.",
      "content": "Drill a pilot hole that's the width of the hollow wall anchors you'll use. If your ceiling is drywall or lath and plaster, use hollow wall anchors. Typically, you drill a hole that's the same size as your anchors. So if the anchor is 1 ⁄ 8 inch (3.2 mm), use a drill with a drill bit that’s the same size. [4] X Research source Press the bit against the place you've marked. Turn the drill on and slowly press it into the ceiling, making sure you go all the way through the lath and plaster or drywall. Drill a hole for each anchor. You'll need an anchor for each hole in the bracket. If you do have wood ceilings, you can simply use a screw without the anchor to secure the brackets. Phillip cautions that you should always wear protective goggles when drilling into the ceiling so nothing gets into your eyes. [5] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. Self-adhesive brackets do not require drilling pilot holes, screws, or wall anchors. Simply peel off the protective backing to reveal the adhesive and press it firmly to the spot for several seconds to allow the adhesive to set. Most self-adhesive brackets need about a day to fully set before you place the rod and hang your curtains. Refer to the instructions that come with your brackets for specific details."

      "title": "Insert the hollow wall anchor into the holes.",
      "content": "Insert the hollow wall anchor into the holes. When using plastic anchors, gently tap the anchor into the hole with a hammer or the heel of your hand. Then, insert the screw into the anchor and turn to the right to tighten it. When using a molly bolt, press it into the pilot hole with your hand until the teeth on the back catch in the plaster. Use a screwdriver or drill to turn the screw to the right. Just the screw should turn, not the anchor. This will tighten up the anchor behind the screw. [6] X Research source Repeat this process with all the anchors."

      "content": "Place the bracket over the anchors and screw it into place. Hold the bracket against the ceiling. Set a screw into one of the holes, turning it lightly into the anchor below. Place the tip of the drill at the head of the screw, fitting it into place. Turn the drill on slowly and let it rotate the screw into place by turning it to the right. [7] X Research source Ask someone to hold the bracket while you use the drill if you need more stability. Make sure the brackets go in the direction you want the rod to run."

      "content": "Put the curtain on the rod and hang it in place. Slide the curtain over the rod. If you're hanging a curtain with eyelets , alternate going front-to-back and back-to-front so that it pleats the curtain and hangs properly. Screw the end caps onto the rod and hang it by setting it onto the hooks, centering it between the brackets. [8] X Research source To hide the bracket, make sure you slide the rod into the front of the curtain (and out the back) first when putting it on, then through the back and out the front. That will create a concave effect that you can slide around the bracket to hide it. In some cases, you may need to put the rod in place before you screw the end caps back on."

Simply use a screwdriver or drill to tighten them, which will help keep the rod from moving around. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a track bracket specifically for the ceiling.",
      "content": "Find a track bracket specifically for the ceiling. These brackets are a long piece of metal with tiny loops in them for hanging curtains. Opt for one that's 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) wider than your window, allowing the curtain to expand past the edges. Both rigid and flexible ceiling curtain tracks are available. Rigid curtain tracks are perfect when the curtain will run flat, like over a window. Use a flexible track when you’re hanging the curtain around a curved or rounded space. You can find these online or at most home improvement stores. [10] X Research source If you have lath and plaster or drywall ceilings, you'll also need hollow plastic wall anchors or molly bolts if your kit doesn't come with them. Pick ones that are the same size as the holes in the brackets. These help anchor the screws into the ceiling. If you have a wood ceiling, just screws are fine."

      "title": "Add the braces to the brackets as needed.",
      "content": "Add the braces to the brackets as needed. Some kits come with little braces that you snap into place on the back of the track. Your kit should tell you how to install them, but typically, you just slide them over one edge of the track and pull them toward the other side. Then, you snap them into place by pressing down. When using a flexible track, it’s helpful to create the shape before placing the brackets. Gently bend the track into your preferred shape to plan out where you want the brackets. Some brackets have little \"arms\" that must be pulled open before putting them in place and closing the arms. Spread the brackets out evenly along the track. They can move back and forth along the track for the perfect placement."

Hold a tape measure up and mark a spot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the wall, depending on how far out you want your curtains. Hold the track up at this spot. Center it above the window or at the edge of the section of the room you want to divide, using a tape measure as needed to help you find the middle. Once you have the track where you want it, mark where each of the anchors needs to go with a pencil. [11] X Research source If you're having trouble holding the track in place and marking at the same time, use painter's tape to temporarily attach it to the ceiling. Take the track down again before drilling the pilot holes."

Place the drill against the ceiling, making sure it's perfectly perpendicular. Then, turn the drill on slowly. Let it do the work of drilling the hole as you apply gentle pressure.

      "content": "Press and screw each anchor into place. Push the anchor into the plaster or drywall with your fingers. Then, use a Phillips head screwdriver or screwdriver bit for your drill to tighten the screw by turning it to the right. The anchor has teeth on the back that hold it in place. As the drill turns, the metal or plastic pieces behind the anchor will tighten up. [14] X Research source Turn the screw to the left to pull it out. You can use the screwdriver or a drill bit, but make sure to reverse the drill to pull it out. Most drills have a \"reverse\" button. Repeat the process for all the holes."

Begin at one end, and put the screw through the track's braces to the anchor below. Use your fingers to screw it in a little until it catches, then place the tip of the drill against the tip. Turn the drill on slowly to screw it into place. [15] X Research source Repeat the process with each screw until you've done them all and the track is held in place."

      "content": "Insert the curtain hooks into the loops on the track. You should have loops all along the bottom of the track. Start at one end, and grab a hook on one end of the curtain. Put one hook in each loop you see. Make sure not to skip any, as that will leave gaps in your curtains. When you've reached the last loop and hook, you're done. [16] X Research source If your curtain doesn't have the hooks, you can insert them in place at the top of the curtain on the back. The holes should be marked, and you just slip it underneath the bottom edge of the hem and out through the top. [17] X Research source You can also install pull wands in the middle of the track simply by hooking them into place over the loops."
