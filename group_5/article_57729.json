Translating to “wheels” in Sanskrit, chakras are the spiritual emblems or points of energy within you. Each energetic point governs different emotions and frequencies, which are said to influence your overall health and well-being. Many believe nourishing your chakras can help you feel balanced and in tune with your surroundings. The 7 chakras are as follows: [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The root chakra (Muladhara) is at the base of the spine and governs safety, security, and stability. When imbalanced, it can cause insecurity, doubt, and loneliness. The sacral chakra (Svadhisthana) is in the lower abdomen and is associated with sexuality and creativity. When blocked, it can cause envy, lust, and jealousy. The solar plexus chakra (Manipura) is between the navel and diaphragm and controls individuality. When blocked, you may feel depressed or fatigued. The heart chakra (Anahata) is in the middle of the chest and is associated with love, compassion, and friendship.

Opt for a dark, quiet room free from distractions. Turn off all electronics (TVs, radios, cell phones, etc.) and dim all the lights. Close the doors and windows to prevent any future distractions, and make sure there’s a cozy place for you to sit or lay (yoga mat, couch, bed, etc.). Light a candle or turn on some fairy lights to make the space extra cozy. Diffuse essential oils to help calm your energy and make the space more inviting. Ask your friends and/or family not to enter the space for a designated time. This way, you won’t have to worry about outward distractions."
