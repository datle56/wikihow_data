      "content": "Cut a hole in the lid with tin snips. You may need to punch a hole first with a nail and hammer, then cut it out with the tin snips. Go around the inside of the line you traced, as you want the stopper to fit snugly. [2] X Research source If your stopper is small enough, you can also use a drill to make the hole. Place the lid on a flat surface you don't mind drilling into, and clamp it in place. Turn the drill on. Apply gentle pressure until the drill bit goes through the lid."

      "title": "Cut a hole in the rubber stopper.",
      "content": "Cut a hole in the rubber stopper. Shove the stopper in the hole in the lid until it fits tightly. If the nozzle of your vacuum pump can go through without a hole, just push it in. Otherwise, use an awl, ice pick, or screwdriver to dig out a hole big enough for the nozzle. [3] X Research source However, make sure the hole is JUST big enough for the nozzle. Don't leave any extra space."

      "content": "Squeeze super glue around the rubber stopper. Use a steady stream of glue on the outside edge of the stopper, going all the way around. Make sure the glue gets down in the crack between the stopper and the lid. [5] X Research source A fast-acting glue works best."

      "title": "Put something in your vacuum chamber and screw on the lid.",
      "content": "Put something in your vacuum chamber and screw on the lid. You can use things such as a marshmallow or a tied-off balloon that has a tiny bit of air in it to experiment with your chamber. Put the item in the mason jar, and screw the lid on tightly. [6] X Research source Use an item that's only about 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the jar, as it will likely expand in the vacuum."

      "title": "Remove the air by turning on the pump.",
      "content": "Remove the air by turning on the pump. Put the nozzle in the rubber stopper, making sure it is tight and secure. Turn on the vacuum pump to remove the air. Once it is out, turn off the pump immediately. [7] X Research source If you try to keep pumping air, you could damage the pump. You can even just use a reversed bike pump to pull out the air for a simpler vacuum."

      "title": "Find or buy a pressure cooker pot.",
      "content": "Find or buy a pressure cooker pot. You don't actually need the lid from the pot. However, pressure cooker pots are stronger than standard cooking pots, so they will hold up better to the vacuum. [8] X Research source You can use a regular stainless steel pot, though make sure it's sturdy enough. [9] X Research source If you want to use a regular pot, try pushing on the side of it. If you can push it in at all, it's too soft for a vacuum chamber."

It's fine if it's even a little bigger than that. You just need a big circle wide enough to cover the whole pot. [11] X Research source"

Leave the circle you want to cut over the edge of the table so you can cut it with the jigsaw. [12] X Research source To cut it, set the jigsaw on the edge of the acrylic and turn it on. Push it into the acrylic until you meet the edge of the circle, then follow the circle around. Always push the jigsaw away from you; don't cut towards yourself."

You can put the hole anywhere you want in the acrylic, but near the edge is probably better, so you can see what's going on inside. However, make sure to put it at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the edge of the acrylic so you don't affect the seal. Drill on the paper side of the acrylic. [13] X Research source Peel the paper off the acrylic when you're done."

      "content": "Use pliers to screw in a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) NPT tap. A tap makes the ridges for a screw, and this one will make the ones you need to attach the vacuum tube to the acrylic. Insert the tap with the ridges into the hole you just made, and use pliers to twist it down into the hole. [14] X Research source Remember to twist to the right. \"NPT\" stands for \"national pipe thread.\" Once you've screwed it in, take it back out. You're just making threads in the hole."

Start by squirting some liquid food coloring in a bowl; this makes the putty colorful, but the moisture also helps activate the silicone. Pour in enough silicone 1 caulk (100% silicone) to make enough putty for a large band that will go all the way around the lid. Mix the two together with a popsicle stick. Work quickly, as this will set in about 10 minutes or less. [15] X Research source In a second bowl, pour in enough cornstarch to mostly fill the bowl. Dump the silicone and food coloring mixture into the bowl, and use your hands (with gloves on) to mix the silicone into the cornstarch. Coat the silicone with cornstarch to keep it from sticking. Knead the mixture for about 2 minutes, adding cornstarch if it feels sticky. [16] X Research source"

Press it down lightly with your fingers to set in place, then put the acrylic circle in place on top of it. Press down on the acrylic so that it squishes the dough out until it's flat, forming a seal with the acrylic. [17] X Research source Leave it to set for about 10 minutes, and it should form a rubber-like seal around the top of the pot. You can now peel the lid and the proto putty away from the pot as needed, then put it back in place."

You need one on each side of the metal cross, as one controls the air in, and one controls the air out. Use pliers to twist them into place. [19] X Research source It's best to have the valve switch on top if you can manage it."

If you're not using one, cap off the top with a fitting or use a t-fitting instead. [21] X Research source"
