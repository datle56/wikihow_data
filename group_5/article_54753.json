      "title": "Enable World of Warcraft’s War Mode before going to the Dragon Isles.",
      "content": "Enable World of Warcraft’s War Mode before going to the Dragon Isles. Bloody tokens are exclusively part of WoW’s PvP (player versus player) gameplay—specifically, War Mode. To get bloody tokens, enable War Mode by traveling to Stormwind City (if you’re in the Alliance) or Orgrimmar (if you’re Horde). Then, find the toggle for War Mode at the bottom right of the Talents interface. Toggle War Mode “on” and head to the Dragon Isles. [1] X Research source Tip: Regardless of how you plan to farm bloody tokens using the steps below, War Mode absolutely must be active first—so be sure to enable it! Keep in mind your WoW character needs to be at least level 20 to toggle War Mode on and off. Once you unlock dragon-riding, you can fly across the Isles that way—but initially, you’ll need to take public transportation from your capital city to the Dragon Isles."

      "title": "Complete PvP World Quests on the Dragon Isles.",
      "content": "Complete PvP World Quests on the Dragon Isles. One of the quickest ways to farm bloody tokens in WoW is by completing World Quests, which become active daily. However, remember that not all World Quests offer the same rewards; the baseline reward is 50-100 bloody tokens per quest, though some quests come with an extra 300 tokens, while others offer a piece of War Mode gear or faction reputation instead. [2] X Research source Tip: PvP World Quests spawn sporadically and usually remain available for a couple of days, so check the available list of World Quests periodically each week to ensure you catch them all. To get bloody tokens, any World Quests you complete must take place on the Dragon Isles; World Quests elsewhere won’t feature the same rewards."

      "title": "Loot bloody tokens from War Supply Crates.",
      "content": "Loot bloody tokens from War Supply Crates. War Supply Crates appear during Air Drop events in Dragonflight —which spawn randomly across the Dragon Isles. Watch out for a zone-wide announcement by a Dracthyr; after that, you’ll see a plane fly across the zone at a particular trajectory, dropping a War Supply Crate partway through its flight. Find and loot the crate! The first crate of the day grants 200 bloody tokens, and every crate after that grants 50 of them. [3] X Research source Tip: Open your map after an Air Drop announcement. You’ll see a gray dot with wings flying across the map, representing the plane. Once the crate drops, the plane will disappear—so place a custom marker on your map where the plane vanishes to find the crate more easily!"

      "title": "Win bloody tokens by battling players from the opposing faction.",
      "content": "Win bloody tokens by battling players from the opposing faction. Killing hostile players in free-for-all zones will net 1 or 2 bloody tokens per kill. While this method for gathering bloody tokens technically works indefinitely, it’s also much slower (and less efficient) than other farming methods. Thus, it’ll take a while to afford any items with bloody tokens if you only use this method! [4] X Research source Tip: Odds are you’ll get the opportunity to fight other players when you do World Quests (since most of them take place in free-for-all areas). So, rather than seeking out enemy players to fight on your own, just keep doing quests and battling enemies along the way."

      "title": "Bloody tokens are a currency introduced in the Dragonflight expansion.",
      "content": "Bloody tokens are a currency introduced in the Dragonflight expansion. The Dragonflight expansion, released in 2022, added several new dragon-themed gear sets to WoW —and bloody tokens, also added in the expansion, are the only way to buy them. Thus, bloody tokens are specific to Dragonflight gear and the Dragon Isles area. [5] X Research source Because bloody tokens are only available in PvP mode, it’s easy for players who don’t usually do PvP to miss them. The gear and items you can buy with bloody tokens are level 366 (although they increase to level 408 when used in Arenas and Battlegrounds)."

      "title": "Visit Fieldmaster Emberath or Malicia to spend bloody tokens.",
      "content": "Visit Fieldmaster Emberath or Malicia to spend bloody tokens. Ready to spend your hard-earned tokens? Head to Gladiator’s Refuge in Valdrakken, a settlement on the Dragon Isles. There, you’ll find Fieldmaster Emberath and Malicia, the only two vendors in the game who accept bloody tokens in exchange for high-level gear. [6] X Research source Additionally, the gear sets they sell provide the following bonuses: Two set: Your character’s versatility increases by 131. Four set: When your character is stunned, their resolve hardens and absorbs up to 71, 654 damage for 10 seconds. This effect can’t happen more than once every 2 minutes. Six set: When you kill enemy players, your character gets “Breaker’s Frenzy,” which increases their versatility and movement speed. This effect stacks up to 10 times. Tip: You can find both vendors using your map at the coordinates 40.58, 45.03."

      "content": "Buy armor, weapons, and clothing items from bloody token vendors. The game’s bloody token vendors sell a wide range of weapons and armor sets—so it likely won’t be hard to find something that works well with your character’s class and specialization. However, neither vendor sells jewelry (including necklaces, rings, or trinkets) and you can’t buy mounts from them. When it comes to pricing, each type of gear piece generally has a similar price. [7] X Research source For example: 200 Bloody Tokens: Back, wrist, and waist pieces 350 Bloody Tokens: Shoulder, hand, and foot pieces 500 Bloody Tokens: Head, chest, and leg pieces 400 Bloody Tokens: One-handed weapons and Off-hand weapons 800 Bloody Tokens: Two-handed weapons"
