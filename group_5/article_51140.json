Imagine that your stomach is a balloon and you are deflating it. Your abdomen will contract at this point, moving your hands inward. [4] X Research source"

Your chest and shoulders normally move up and down in your daily breathing, but when you are singing, you will want to always breathe from the deepest part of your lungs. When you are breathing from the lower part of your lungs (your diaphragm), your chest should very little, if at all. [6] X Research source Focus on breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Breathing horizontally means that your diaphragm and abdoment should move outward instead of the usual up-and-down movement that accompanies shallower breathing."

The most important aspect of breathing is breathing with your diaphragm, the muscles underneath your lungs that help them to move air in and out. A great way to visualize breathing with your diaphragm is to picture a rubber ring around your waist. This ring will move in and out, getting bigger and smaller, with each inhale and exhale.

      "content": "Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you exhale, attempt to make the ring contract and become smaller. This visualization should help you to breathe with your diaphragm, thus improving your singing. Breathing through your nose ensures better breath control and helps you to breathe in more slowly, allowing you to focus on how you are breathing, rather than how much air you are sucking in."

      "content": "Avoid tension in the shoulders. It is common to hunch your shoulders as you breathe. Sometimes tension creeps up on us. Another important aspect of singing is to relax our muscles. This will allow them to move properly. If you feel tension in your shoulders, remind yourself to relax. Visualize your neck getting longer and the tension melting away from your shoulders and into the ground. It can also help to take a few long, deep, slow breaths to relax and stabilize your mind and body. [12] X Research source"

Do not aim to fill yourself until you feel like you are bursting; rather, inhale just enough air to feel the difference between shallow breathing with your chest and deep breathing with your diaphragm. During the inhale, you will feel your hands raise up and outward as they rest gently on your belly. As you breathe in, fill your abdomen from the bottom to the top, noticing your stomach rising first, then your chest.

Even when breathing diaphragmatically, expanding the side and back ribs is crucial for maximum air volume. To get a feeling for this, either wrap a resistance band around your rib cage or practice inhaling after your air has been tightly squeezed out."

You will simply notice your stomach area contract, starting with your stomach and ending with your chest. Learn how to keep your ribcage up and expanded to control the airflow, and try exercises such as the “ssss” hold out in order to learn how to control your air. If you learn to control your air, you will soon be able to exhale for a count of 20 or more."
