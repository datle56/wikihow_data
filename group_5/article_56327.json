      "content": "Remove the insoles and laces from your Yeezys. Take special care to not damage the insoles when taking them out of the shoes. You should pull the laces slowly from the shoes so you don't cause wear and tear to the eyelets. Place the insoles and laces to one side to protect them from damage while you clean the rest of the shoes."

      "content": "Make a vinegar and water solution. Pour 1 part water and 2 parts white vinegar into a small cup and use a spoon to mix them together.

      "title": "Dip a hard-bristled brush in the mix and scrub the soles.",
      "content": "Dip a hard-bristled brush in the mix and scrub the soles. The sole is easily the dirtiest part of any shoe so you might need to scrub especially hard to remove the dirt. Don't be afraid to be rigorous with the scrub, the soles are very durable. Avoid the knitting and stitching with the brush. You can use a cloth or rag if you don't have a hard-bristled brush. The cloth or rag might not be as effective though. Dip your brush into the mixture frequently to ensure you aren't simply scrubbing the dirt into the sole of the shoe."

      "title": "Use a damp cloth to wipe off the soles.",
      "content": "Use a damp cloth to wipe off the soles. After you've finished scrubbing the soles, soak a clean cloth in water. Thoroughly rub the soles with the cloth to remove dirt. Wipe the sides as well to make sure they're as clean as they can be. Don't forget to clean the Boost window when cleaning the soles of your Yeezys. The Boost window is a triangular shaped area on the sole of the shoes where dirt and dust can easily get trapped."

Your hand in the shoe should provide protection against water getting in."
