      "content": "Apply scratch remover to your lenses. There are a wide variety of products that can be used to remove scratches to your lenses. Begin by dabbing a non-abrasive toothpaste on the lens. [1] X Research source Rub it on the scratch in a circular motion with a cotton ball and rinse it with cool water. If the scratch is deep, you may need to repeat the process a few times. If you don't have non-abrasive toothpaste you can make a paste from baking soda and water. [2] X Research source Put baking soda in a bowl and mix in small amounts of water until you have a thick paste. Rub the paste on the same way you did the toothpaste, and rinse it off when you think the scratch is gone."

      "content": "Try another cleaner if toothpaste or baking soda did not work. Try buffing the scratched plastic glasses with brass or silver polish and a soft rag. Rub the polish around on the glasses and wipe any excess off with a clean, soft rag. Repeat until the scratch is gone. Be careful of your glasses frames when using a cleaner that is not made for glasses. Try not to get any on your frames because it is unknown what the cleaner will do to the frames."

      "content": "Apply a scratch filling product if scratches remain. If you still have visible scratches on the surface of your plastic lenses you can apply a product that will fill the scratches temporarily with wax. [3] X Research source Simply rub on the product onto the lenses using a clean micro-fiber cloth, rub it around in a circular motion, and then wipe it off with a clean area of the cloth. This will allow you to see clearly through your glasses but will need to be reapplied weekly. The two types of products that work best for this are products made to wax your car, such as Turtle Wax, and furniture polishes that contains wax, such as Lemon Pledge."

      "content": "Verify that your lenses are plastic, not glass. This method can ONLY be used on plastic lenses, as it will permanently and irrevocably ruin glass lenses. It is also a method of last resort for plastic lenses, as it will remove all coatings from your plastic lenses. [4] X Research source This means that once all the coatings are gone, your lenses will no longer have any protection and you are more likely to get major scratches in your lenses in the future. [5] X Research source Only do this method if you are ok with removing the anti-reflective or anti-scratch coating from your glasses. Many times it is scratches to these coatings that hinder your sight and so removing the coatings will allow you to see through your lenses once again. It's best to try this method as a last resort before you cave in and buy new glasses."

Glass etching compounds contain hydrofluoric acid, an acid that eats through almost anything other than plastic. When you apply it to your lenses it will eat through any coatings but will leave the plastic lenses completely intact.
