      "title": "Pretend the fart was your shoe or chair.",
      "content": "Pretend the fart was your shoe or chair. The second you fart, move your feet on the floor so your shoes squeak. Create a diversion by dropping a book or talking right at the moment that you fart. [1] X Research source Move in your chair to create noise from your chair moving across the floor or from the cushions in the chair. You could also cough at the same time that you fart. This won’t hide the smell, but it will help camouflage the sound, which helps identify you as the culprit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend someone else did it.",
      "content": "Pretend someone else did it. There’s always the good old blame someone else tactic. This works best if you are the first person to point out the fart. Rather than waiting for someone else to notice it, notice it first. Point it out, and look at the person next to you and point out that they just farted. Or, better yet, blame someone who doesn't know you're blaming them. The kid in the chair ahead of you who hasn't smelled the fart or heard it or the teacher who just walked past. It’s less suspicious if you bring it up than if you ignore it. Who should you blame? If you're struggling for a suspect, just pick the person closest to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk behind.",
      "content": "Walk behind. If you’re about to fart in the hall in a group of people, just lag behind a little bit. If you’re walking behind them, they won’t very easily smell the smell. Or make an excuse and go to the restroom or your locker when you sense that a fart is coming on. Just don’t stand around a group of people. Try to go to the bathroom right before class. You will need to be in a group of at least three people for people to not be sure where to put the blame. So, if you’re in a large group, you might get away with it. If you’re with one or two people, lag behind or walk away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go outside.",
      "content": "Go outside. If you can sense a fart coming on, and you’re able to do so, go outside before you let it rip! Obviously, the outside air will more closely dissipate the smell. The worst place to fart is in a small and enclosed space, such as an elevator. You might not be able to hold it for long, but it’s a good idea to hold it at least long enough for the elevator doors to open. If you’re stuck in a classroom, you could ask to go to the bathroom, but that will give away that you did it if you’ve already farted, so better to try a diversionary tactic in that case."

    {
      "title": "Buy a flatulence deodorizer.",
      "content": "Buy a flatulence deodorizer. Yes, believe it or not, there is a medical supply website that has created an ultimate scented pad. The goal of the Flatulence Deodorizer is to camouflage the bad smells that might come out of your body. [2] X Research source You wear the deodorizer like you would a pad, but it’s scented. The same company produces scented pillows."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use perfume.",
      "content": "Use perfume. You could just douse the smell the old-fashioned away with perfume, cologne , deodorant, or room freshener – if you’re able. Even if you’re in a school classroom, you might be able to subtly rub some perfume on your wrists. Buy a small roll-on perfume stick you can keep in your purse. Too much perfume doesn’t smell very good, either, but it’s a lot better than people smelling your farts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light a match.",
      "content": "Light a match. Obviously, don’t light a match if this will get you in trouble at school. Playing with fire is serious business, and you shouldn’t do it. However, if you’re able, lighting a match will cover up a fart smell. The reason is that the smell from a fart comes from hydrogen sulfur. [3] X Research source When you light a match, you’re igniting phosphorus. This will ignite the sulfur in the air, and mask it."

    {
      "title": "Avoid carbonated drinks and chewing gum.",
      "content": "Avoid carbonated drinks and chewing gum. Some activities cause more gas in your body, and this can lead to stomach aches and unexpected farts. The reason is that you are taking too much air in. Carbonated drinks, including soda and water, are known to cause more stomach gas. Chewing gum also builds up the amount of gas you might have to pass. Holding in gas is not a good idea, either, as it can cause stomach aches. It’s hard to hold farts in for a very long time anyway, so just avoid ingesting things that will cause gas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try not to eat foods that are hard to digest.",
      "content": "Try not to eat foods that are hard to digest. Foods that have a lot of cellulose in them are very hard to fully digest. Partially digested food leads to flatulence. Instead drink herbal teas. Beans, lentils, and root vegetables like onions, scallions, and garlic, will cause more farting. Avoid them. Dairy products and green vegetables, such as sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli, are also going to create more gas inside of you. Dairy products will especially cause flatulence in people who are lactose intolerant."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use over-the-counter medication.",
      "content": "Use over-the-counter medication. If you’re in high school, you need permission of your parents to take medication. But there are some over-the-counter medications that will lower the gas. Bean-O is an enzyme supplement that breaks down carbohydrates. It’s going to help reduce your gas if it’s caused by certain foods like beans or broccoli. [4] X Research source Mylanta Gas, Maalox Anti-Gas and other similar products reduce intestinal discomfort by breaking up gas bubbles. Lactase supplements will help you with gas that is caused by intolerance to dairy."

      "title": "Hold it in.",
      "content": "Hold it in. Ignore it, and hold it in as best as you can. You can do this by not squeezing and \"holding it in.\" You may feel weird, but this is the most non attention grabbing way to do it. If this is not possible and you have a big one, try one of the other measures. If it is a big one, ask to go to the bathroom because there is no way to hide it. To do this raise your hand, tell the teacher it is an emergency, and go to the hallway. Once in the hallway let it rip (unless people are in the hallway), then go to the bathroom. If you know it will not be as noticeable, then you are in the clear. Just cough while executing the dirty deed, and you will be fine. But if you feel people will still notice, stand up and sharpen your pencil because it makes a lot of noise. Thus, make the fart inaudible."
