[1] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Animals need time to get to know each other's smells and to get to know new homes before they can deal with getting to know another animal. Cats and dogs are much more likely to fight or be unhappy if you try to force them together suddenly. Keep them in separate rooms and out of sight of one another until they are both calm. Begin mixing the animals smells by stroking the cat then stroking the dog and vice versa (with pets in separate rooms)."

      "content": "Alternate the rooms you keep the animals in. This is so they can sniff where each other has been without the other animal being present. Smells are a very important way that animals get to know each other. Let your animals get to know the other's smell before they actually get to know them face to face. Try rubbing a towel on your dog and then putting the towel under your cat's bowl. This will help your cat get used to the dogs smell and accept it."

[4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If the cat is frightened and runs and hides whenever the dog gets near the door to their room, you need to give the cat more time. When the cat is adjusted to the smell and sounds of the dog, it may be time to let them see each other."

      "title": "Hold your cat in your arms until it is calm and relaxed.",
      "content": "Hold your cat in your arms until it is calm and relaxed. Then ask a family member or friend to slowly bring your dog on a leash into the room. Gradually bring the dog closer in small steps, waiting for your cat and dog to both settle down as each step of the way before getting closer. Do not let the animals make physical contact with each other, just get them used to the presence of the other. Be sure to hold the cat only if it is happy to be held. Wear long sleeves to protect your arms from scratches. Another option is to have the dog or cat in a crate while keeping the other animal loose.

Once the cat seems comfortable enough, keep the dog on a leash but let the cat go loose in the room. [8] X Research source After several weeks of this, your dog should be trained not to go after the cat, as so you can let the dog off the leash as well. You can also use pheromones, available through your veterinarian, to help both animals stay calm and relaxed. Ask your veterinarian if he or she thinks that the use of synthetic hormones could help your pets during their adjustment period."

Yay!\" and sound very happy. Then give the dog a small training treat. Your dog will soon learn to associate pleasant feelings with the cat."
