      "content": "Dirty parking brake button If the button doesn’t light up and your emergency brake doesn’t engage when you press it, the button itself is likely the problem. It could be that dust or crumbs are stuck in the area behind the button or the switch itself is somehow damaged. This is the most common reason for an electric parking brake to not work correctly. Most people don’t use the electric brake all that often, so it’s rare that something fails."

      "title": "Wiring issues or loose connections",
      "content": "Wiring issues or loose connections Since your electric parking brake isn’t mechanical (only the servo motor and brake pads physically move), the odds are high the issue is primarily electronic. You may have a blown fuse, a loose connection between two wires, or a wire that was chewed through by an ambitious squirrel. [1] X Research source This is especially likely to be the case if the error ever goes away and then comes back on. This is a sign that a connection is coming loose then occasionally reconnecting."

      "title": "Servo motor problems",
      "content": "Servo motor problems A servo motor refers to any an independent motor that rotates to engage. On vehicles with electric parking brakes, there is a dedicated servo motor specifically to turn the parking brakes on. If that motor has failed or it isn’t working properly, your emergency brake won’t engage when you press the button. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the brake switch button if it’s dirty.",
      "content": "Clean the brake switch button if it’s dirty. Grab an antibacterial wipe and scrub down the button and the areas surrounding it. Use a toothpick to pry out any crumbs or junk in between the button and its housing. Once the button is sufficiently clean, try using the button like normal. If the brake works, you’re good to go! [3] X Research source It’s unlikely you’ll actually need to replace the switch, but you can purchase a replacement switch for your make and model and pry the old one off to swap it out if you’d like."

      "title": "Inspect and replace the fuse for the parking brake.",
      "content": "Inspect and replace the fuse for the parking brake. Turn the vehicle off and disconnect the battery terminals. Refer to your vehicle’s manual to locate the individual fuse dedicated to the servo motor and electric parking brake system. Pop the hood and remove the fuse. If the metal wire inside the fuse looks broken or fried, replace the fuse with an identical fuse designed for your make and model. The fuse box is almost always under the hood near the steering wheel. There will be a plastic cover on top that you either need to unscrew or pry off."

      "title": "See a dealership mechanic to fix electrical or servo motor problems.",
      "content": "See a dealership mechanic to fix electrical or servo motor problems. The servo motor and electrical wiring need to be inspected and repaired by a professional. Go to a dealership service center—they’ll have the replacement parts you need. The odds are high the repair will be free too, since these brakes often require software updates and adjustments due to recalls. [4] X Research source The electric parking brakes are notorious for failing or running into bugs. If this is a systemic problem with your make and model, you won’t have to pay for anything at a dealer. You can see a regular mechanic if you prefer, but the odds are very high the dealership will cover your costs if you bought the car through them."

      "title": "Disconnect your vehicle’s battery to reset the parking brake system.",
      "content": "Disconnect your vehicle’s battery to reset the parking brake system. In rare cases, your vehicle’s computer may just need to be reset. Turn the vehicle off and pop the hood. Then, locate the negative terminal on your battery and disconnect it . Wait a few minutes then reconnect the terminal and turn your vehicle back on. If the error code went away and the parking brake now works, you’re good to go! [5] X Research source This is a common solution for resetting check engine lights. It works because it forces the engine module to run a complete scan to confirm everything is working correctly. If you have a vehicle where the electric parking brake’s electrical is connected to the engine module, this may get rid of the warning."

      "title": "The electric parking brake is the emergency brake in modern cars.",
      "content": "The electric parking brake is the emergency brake in modern cars. Electric parking brakes are common these days—especially in Hondas. They function the exact same way as a traditional emergency brake with one major difference: they aren’t mechanical. When you press the electric parking brake button, your vehicle’s computer sends a signal to a servo motor in your undercarriage which locks the wheels. [6] X Research source In older vehicles, the emergency brake is a lever you physically pull which engages hydraulics and lock your vehicle’s wheels in place."

      "content": "“Electric parking brake problem” may appear on your dash screen. If you have a digital screen in the center console of your vehicle, you’ll probably get a notification there that the electric parking brake isn’t working correctly. On some Honda vehicles, you’ll get a code (like D5 or C100C01, for example) that indicate there’s a problem. [7] X Research source Check your manual to find a list of your vehicle’s specific error codes or messages."

      "title": "The words “brake” or “brake system” will illuminate on your dashboard.",
      "content": "The words “brake” or “brake system” will illuminate on your dashboard. If you don’t have a dashboard screen, you’ll still get a warning. Usually, a chime will come on and a little light will appear on your dash with the words “brake,” “electric brakes,” or something of the sort to let you know the electric parking brake isn’t working properly. [8] X Research source Pro tip: Try engaging the brake when you get an error on the screen. Take your foot off of the normal brake and let your vehicle idle. If the vehicle moves, your electric brake isn’t working, which is important to know if you need to park on an incline or hold your vehicle in place."
