      "title": "Locate your unit's sensor chamber.",
      "content": "Locate your unit's sensor chamber. All smoke detectors have a small internal chamber that sucks in trace amounts of air to check for the presence of smoke. [1] X Research source Most newer models have an open casing design, with narrow “windows” encircling the bottom portion of the unit's housing. On older models, these windows may be found along the top of the unit where it attaches to the ceiling. The sensor chamber on a smoke detector is very sensitive, making it reliable. Unfortunately, this can also cause it to accidentally set off when it picks up dust, steam, or chemical fumes."

    {
      "title": "Place a strip of tape over the sensor chamber.",
      "content": "Place a strip of tape over the sensor chamber. Stretch out a piece of brightly-colored duct or painter's tape long enough to cover the entire opening. Press the tape into place, taking a moment to make sure it won't come undone while you're busy cooking or cleaning. Choose a tape in an eye-catching color so you won't accidentally forget about it and leave it on after completing your chores. Try to avoid using clear or plain white tape, which is more likely to be forgotten when you’re done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember to remove the tape when you're done.",
      "content": "Remember to remove the tape when you're done. Once the room has cleared out, simply peel off and dispose of the tape. Be sure to wait until most of the visible haze is gone. Otherwise, you might manage to set off the alarm in spite of your efforts. Consider writing yourself a note or setting an alarm on your phone to remind you to remove the tape just in case. Alternatively, buy a smoke detector cover to snap over your detector before cooking or cleaning."

    {
      "title": "Find a plastic bag that's the right size to fit over your smoke detector.",
      "content": "Find a plastic bag that's the right size to fit over your smoke detector. The bag should be big enough to easily slip over the unit, but not so large that it might have trouble staying put. A quart-sized freezer bag or something of a similar size and thickness will work well for most models. A grocery bag could also work, as long as there are no holes in the surface. If you use a bag that's too big, the material may bunch up around the edges, allowing dust and steam to find their way inside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a rubber band or tape to hold the bag in place.",
      "content": "Use a rubber band or tape to hold the bag in place. Open the bag and guide it over the outside of the smoke detector. Then, stretch a rubber band or tape around the upper part of the bag where the opening meets the ceiling. Check to confirm that the bag is secure before you engage in any activities that might produce smoke, steam, or dust."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take off the bag when you're ready to reactivate your smoke detector.",
      "content": "Take off the bag when you're ready to reactivate your smoke detector. Pull off the rubber band or tape keeping the bag where it is and uncover the unit. Wait until the air is clear of smoke to avoid setting off the alarm. Drop the bag and tape in the trash; hold onto rubber bands for future use."

      "title": "Grab a cheap plastic shower cap.",
      "content": "Grab a cheap plastic shower cap. Inspect the shower cap and make sure there are no holes, slits, or tears in the material. Even the smallest opening could let in dust or steam, which could in turn lead to a false detection and a lot of blaring noise. [4] X Research source Buy a single disposable shower cap or a package of multiple caps at any supermarket or drugstore for just a few dollars. If you can’t find a shower cap, lay a sheet of sealing plastic wrap on the brush of a broom and use the broom to seal the wrap around the smoke detector. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stretch the shower cap over the entire smoke detector.",
      "content": "Stretch the shower cap over the entire smoke detector. Shower caps have elastic bands around the bottom that expand and contract to fit a wide range of head sizes. This also makes them perfect for slipping on and off your smoke detector. [6] X Research source To prevent the cap from slipping off, make sure the elastic band is resting over the top of the unit between the housing and the ceiling."

    {
      "title": "Uncover the unit as soon as the dust or steam has dissipated.",
      "content": "Uncover the unit as soon as the dust or steam has dissipated. Pull off the shower cap and toss it in the trash. You could also hold onto it if you think you might need it again. Keep the cap in a nearby drawer or cabinet so it will be within reach. [7] X Research source A colorful shower cap may make a safer cover than tape because there's a slim chance that you won’t notice it the next time you walk by. [8] X Research source"
