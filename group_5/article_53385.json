      "content": "The more you speak, the easier it is to become emotionally attached. The goal of a friends with benefits relationship is for both parties to remain emotionally unattached, and how often you see one another or talk sets the stage for how close you two will be in your casual dynamic, especially if your conversation is deep or vulnerable. Although sex between friends can seem fairly innocuous, sometimes strong feelings of attachment can develop between one or both partners. It’s important not to harbor any illusions about a future with your FWB: a casual relationship could end at any moment, and that’s OK. [1] X Research source A successful FWB requires that all parties involved take frequent stock of their emotions, needs, and expectations. While some folks can talk daily without getting emotionally attached, other people may find it hard not to become attached unless they minimize interactions. Is it bad if you get attached? Not necessarily: there are plenty of couples who go from a no-strings-attached relationship to a committed romance. But it’s also very common for one party in a FWB scenario to become attached—while the other doesn’t. Essentially, FWB is emotional Russian roulette."

      "content": "Casual relationships can be just as complex as committed relationships. Some people believe that having a FWB is less complicated than a significant other, but, as almost every romcom ever has taught us, relationships can get sticky whether there are strings attached or not. A FWB relationship takes just as much communication and respect as a committed relationship, as properly managing your boundaries is essential to the success of the situationship. [2] X Research source In fact, going into a FWB relationship blindly assuming it will be easier than a serious partnership is likely to make it even messier!"

      "title": "How often you and your FWB should talk depends on your relationship.",
      "content": "How often you and your FWB should talk depends on your relationship. Just as every committed relationship is different, so too is every casual sex relationship unique. The general rule of thumb for FWB situations is to maintain emotional distance so as to avoid becoming invested in the relationship, but what exactly that looks like for you and your bum chum is up to you. Just make sure you talk about it, communicate needs and expectations (which may be ever-shifting), and establish ground rules before getting involved (or if you’re already involved, set up those ground rules ASAP). [3] X Research source If you and your sex pal weren’t really friends before hooking up, it’s best to keep it that way: don’t mix your friend groups, don’t hang out outside of your hookups, and only speak when you’re meeting up to do the devil’s dance. Communicate with your FWB just how often you plan to interact, and be realistic about the future: if a FWB relationship goes according to plan, you will have no (romantic) future together."

      "title": "Close friends may talk every day.",
      "content": "Close friends may talk every day. While it may take more effort to maintain boundaries when hooking up with close friends rather than with acquaintances or someone fresh off an app, best buds or roommates do sometimes develop into sexual relationships, and they sometimes make a FWB relationship work. If you were pals before you started up a sexual relationship, you may already be talking or hanging out on the reg, especially if you move in the same social circles or live together. [4] X Research source When you’re hooking up with a good friend, prioritize friendship over sex. Hanging out just to hook up may convey that sex has become the priority, so regular non-sexual hangs might be essential to maintaining the friendship after you’ve stopped sleeping together. [5] X Research source Once you’ve entered the FWB realm, set strict boundaries with your bud about how often you can interact (and about what). [6] X Research source Some close friends can easily add sex to their relationship without it affecting the friendship. For others, sex can blur the lines between a friendship and a committed relationship. That being said, if you’re considering starting up a casual relationship with a close friend or someone you share a social circle with, think long and hard about that. (Tinder exists for a reason.)"

      "content": "As a general rule, don’t expect regular interaction. Whether you and your FWB are close pals who see each other every day or you met via a dating app and see each other once or twice a month, one of the major differences between a committed relationship and a casual relationship is obligation. The point of a FWB relationship is that you are not expected to see your partner on a regular basis—but that doesn’t mean you can’t. [7] X Research source While regularly hanging out with your significant other is a priority (and you would likely be hurt if they didn’t want to), in a FWB situation, there should be no pressure to see one another more often than either of you is comfortable with."

      "title": "Keep your conversations surface-level.",
      "content": "Keep your conversations surface-level. What friends with benefits talk about is just as important as how often they talk. Even if you and your FWB see each other every day, you may find it easier to minimize emotional attachment by keeping your conversations shallow and about mundane topics. This might mean avoiding emotionally vulnerable topics like family, work stress, or what have you. [8] X Research source Set ground rules with your FWB regarding what you can and cannot talk about. It’s not inherently wrong to rely on your FWB for emotional support, but ask yourself at what point emotional reliance (plus sex) turns into a relationship."

      "content": "If your FWB is blowing up your phone on the reg, they may want more. If your FWB is texting you every day—especially if they didn’t before you started hooking up—it could be a sign they’re becoming emotionally attached. It's paramount to have occasional check-ins with your FWB to see where they’re at emotionally (and to tell them where you're at). FWB relationships can’t succeed if the involved parties have mismatched expectations or desires. [9] X Research source It’s common to develop romantic feelings after you’ve begun hooking up with someone, even if you weren’t interested before. But do yourself a favor and don’t try to make a FWB relationship happen with someone you know you’d like to date—it’s bound to backfire. [10] X Research source If your FWB has developed romantic feelings, be gentle and don’t judge them—but stop hooking up."

If you didn’t begin as friends, they may feel that they can confide in you now that you’re hooking up—and it could be totally platonic. Just make sure you put those boundaries in place regarding how often you’d like to talk, and let them know if you get uncomfortable with how much you’re talking. [11] X Research source Just as it’s not uncommon for a friendship to become a FWB relationship, it’s also not unheard of for friends with benefits to stop having sex and just be friends."

      "content": "If your FWB keeps texting you, they could be playing games. Ugh. The worst. If your FWB is talking to you all the time, they might be trying to pique your interest and string you along. They may feel validated by your attention (even if they have no romantic inclinations themselves). If your FWB is playing games, it’s time to end the relationship. [12] X Research source Signs your FWB might be playing games are if they text you a lot and then ghost for a while, or if they seem to be going out of their way to give you a little attention every day. A FWB who’s playing games might also overshare about their other hookups or their love life with the seeming intent to make you jealous."

As we said, some people (understandably) assume FWB relationships are naturally less complicated than committed relationships, and your FWB might be one of those people. They might be texting you…just because! But casual relationships demand a great deal of self-awareness and—not to beat a dead horse—communication in order to succeed. If your FWB is acting in ways that make you question the dynamic, reach out to them and see what’s up. You may both need to communicate your expectations more clearly. [13] X Research source All relationships, whether committed or casual, require respect, tact, and forthrightness. Even if your FWB doesn’t think talking every day is a big deal, if they’re a good FWB, they’ll understand and respect your concerns."

If your FWB is your go-to when you have a bad day or when you want to celebrate a big win, think long and hard about what the difference would be if you were dating—and what it would mean to you to lose this dynamic once your FWB situation dissolves. [14] X Research source Some emotional reliance isn't necessarily a red flag, especially if you were already close friends prior to hooking up. But if you're overly reliant on your FWB or vice versa, it's definitely time to have a conversation about boundaries to ensure neither of you gets hurt. Again, some FWB situations do evolve into committed relationships, but you should never count on this. Keep checking in with your friend and with yourself to ensure you're both on the same page."

But if you and your FWB are making increasingly bigger and more involved plans, such as getting tickets to a concert 6 months from now or going on vacation together, rethink your dynamic. [15] X Research source It might be really fun to do these things with your FWB. After all, you like them—that's why you're hooking up! But ask yourself if you're using your FWB as a stand-in for a real relationship. If so, you could be in danger of getting too emotionally involved in a romance that isn't meant to last."

Touching outside of a sexual context and calling each other \"babe\" could be symptomatic of burgeoning emotional attachment. If you and your FWB are engaging in lovey-dovey interactions, it's time to ask them directly what this means for your relationship. [16] X Research source If you and your FWB were already close friends, being physically affectionate outside of sex may not be a big deal.

[17] X Research source In the same vein, do you feel compelled to share your plans with your FWB when they don't involve them, as you might when you're in a committed relationship? That could be a sign you're overly involved with your FWB."

It's human to feel a little jealousy or insecurity when a FWB wants to break things off or hook up with someone else, but if your fun buddy seeing another person would leave you heartbroken, it's a sign you need to reevaluate your expectations. [18] X Research source It's fine for FWB to see multiple people at once, as long as they are up front with one another about it (and as long as they stay on top of their STI testing)."

If you're uncomfortable with how often your FWB is reaching out to you, if you're not sure what their motives might be for talking to you so much, or if you're starting to feel some emotional attachment yourself, ask them if you can chat about it. See what they're feeling and let them know what your needs and expectations are. Reassure them you care about them and want to make sure things are going well for both of you. [19] X Research source Set ground rules regarding your preferred communication style: text only? No hangouts? Once a week? Once a month? Every day? Whatever makes you both feel comfortable is the right answer. Remember that your needs may shift again over time. You and your FWB will likely need to check in with one another regularly throughout your relationship to ensure you're both on the same page and neither of you is feeling uncomfortable or getting emotionally attached. \"Hey Dan, I'm really enjoying our situation, but I wanted to check and see how everything is going just to make sure we're still on the same page.\" \"Hi Martha! Just wanted to check in with you re: our FWB situation. Maybe brunch tomorrow?\" \"Hey Jo, you up for a chat? Just feels like we've been talking a lot more lately, so I wanted to reach out and see where you're at with this whole FWB thing! I really care about our friendship, so I want to make sure that's protected at all costs.\""
