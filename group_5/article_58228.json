      "content": "You don't need a very powerful bike. You can definitely clutch wheelie a 500 cc sport bike, it just takes higher revs. Stock gearing is fine, however, with this setup it can't clutch up in 2nd. You'll need a 520 kit for that. (To clutch up in second with less bouncing, try going -1 on the front sprocket, and +2 on the rear. If you buy these sprockets in 525 pitch, you will be able to change them and use the stock chain). (Edit: The chain length will be correct, but you cannot use a 520 chain on 525 sprockets, or vice versa.)"

      "title": "When you are ready for liftoff, quickly open up the throttle and accelerate.",
      "content": "When you are ready for liftoff, quickly open up the throttle and accelerate. This is VERY important because it compresses your rear suspension. It's very difficult to clutch a wheelie without compressing rear suspension first. You're not trying to build up speed! Starting at low RPMs is very important. If you start a clutch wheelie at 5000RPM, it will be very difficult and you'll red line long before you go vertical. Power comes from low RPM."

      "title": "Quickly release the clutch at about 80%.",
      "content": "Quickly release the clutch at about 80%. This is the hardest part. You HAVE to release fast. You'll know you released too fast when your RPM drops down to 2000 - this means you released too fast. Practice, practice, practice. When you get it right it will feel like you have hydraulics on your front wheel and pop right up (much quicker and smoother than a power-bounce wheelie)."

      "content": "Once you master this, your bike should be popping up a little bit. The next step is throttle control . While releasing the clutch, add throttle. If you want to go big - vertical - and stay there - the big thing to learn is that you can not let go of the throttle OR the clutch. You will control height of the wheelie with your clutch at this point."
