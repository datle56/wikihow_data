      "content": "Park your car in a shaded area. Washing your car in a cool, shaded area will prevent soap suds from drying quickly and leaving stains on your car before you get the chance to rinse them off. If the body of your car is hot from sitting in the sun or from driving, wait 20 to 30 minutes for your car to cool down before cleaning it. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a shady spot where you can wash your car, work in small sections. Rinse off the soap with water from a hose and dry it as soon as possible to avoid soap and water stains. If you’re washing your car at home, park it on the grass, gravel, or other surfaces that’ll absorb the water you use to wash it. This helps prevent sending the dirty water down storm drains that usually lead to natural water sources. [2] X Research source"

If there are leaves, twigs, and other big pieces of debris, simply remove them by hand. [4] X Research source Set the hose on a high-pressure setting to rinse hard-to-remove dirt, debris, and grime. However, make sure the pressure isn't too high since that can remove your car's wax or paint. Use special bug and tar removers to get rid of bugs, bird droppings, and other stubborn stains. Spray a liberal amount on the problem area, let it sit for a few minutes (following your product’s instructions), then rinse off the product with water and a clean cloth."
