[1] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020. Gutters should be attached to the fascia and run the entire length of the roof, ending with a downspout. If a gutter run will measure longer than 40 feet (12 m), the gutter should be positioned to pitch down from the middle, aimed toward a downspout at each end. A fascia bracket will be attached to every other rafter tail, or approximately every 32 inches (81 cm). [2] X Research source Depending on the type of gutters you want, expect to pay anywhere from $2 to $6 per linear foot for aluminum gutters. Copper gutters could run as much as $20 per linear foot. [3] X Research source Expect to pay approximately $2 per linear foot for downspouts, and $6 to $10 each for the brackets that attach the gutters to the fascia. [4] X Research source"

To inspect the fascia, poke at the ends of fascia boards, or where two ends of fascia boards meet. If it feels spongy or compromised, you may want to consider replacing the fascia before moving on. [5] X Research source Think about replacing the fascia with more resistant material, or just sticking with wood. [6] X Research source If you believe the rotting is caused by excessive moisture due to ineffective gutters, then wood might acceptable. (You are going to install working gutters, after all). If you believe the rot to be caused by other factors, consider choosing a material like aluminum or vinyl that withstands the elements a bit better than wood."

      "content": "Measure and snap a layout line using a chalk line. You want your gutters to work properly, and in order for them to do that, they need to have a slight downward angle to feed any running water toward the downspout. Longer gutters (35 feet and longer) will slope from the center to each end. They will start at the same height in the middle and tilt downward to the edges, ending at the same point. Shorter gutters should tilt from one end to the other. They should start at a high point and end at a lower point."

If it's shorter than 35 feet (10.7 m), your gutter will run from one end to the other.

[10] X Research source Locate each rafter tail — usually spaced every 16 inches (40.6 cm) apart — by looking for their signature nail heads. After you've marked the location of each one, drill pilot holes along every other rafter tail to make installation of the brackets easier. Brackets will either snap onto the gutters or will be mounted into the face board first, depending on the type of gutters you purchase. Review the manufacturer's recommendations for your particular type of gutter."

Use a stainless steel lag screw long enough to penetrate the face-board at least 2 inches (5 cm)."

To keep water from leaking through small cracks or openings at conjoined corners, insulate the aluminum strip further using waterproof caulk. This aluminum strip can be spray-painted ahead of time to blend in seamlessly with the color of the gutter. Make the strip long enough to extend an inch or two beyond the top of the gutter. Cut a triangular shape into the top of the extending strip, and then fold each corner or the strip over onto the top of the gutter, creating a clean look."
