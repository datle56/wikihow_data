Meditation is most effective when you can find a quiet space with limited distractions. The space should also be physically comfortable, with no extreme temperatures, so you can focus on connecting your body to thoughts of peace and calm. If you are using a meditation space in your own home, you can prepare this in multiple ways to be your ideal space. Consider incorporating elements of nature in your space, such as hanging planters, artworks featuring flowers or a beautiful landscape scene, or a natural souvenir from a recent trip, such as a seashell or jar of sand from your favorite beach. If you are using your meditation space in a shared room (like a living room of home gym), consider putting up a screen to divide the space specifically for meditation. Many colleges also offer meditation centers in their student life centers or in their university gyms. If you are a student facing the stress of mid-terms or finals, consider looking into whether your university offers a space like this. You can also use many beautiful spaces such as public gardens, parks or mountain trails if you are comfortable meditating in public. Many vacation destinations also offer meditation retreats, so you can even plan your next trip to help you ground and center. Know that you can also ground yourself during daily activities. You don't need to meditate to get results, although that certainly helps. [4] X Expert Source Kari Samuels Intuitive Counselor & Happiness Coach Expert Interview. 2 September 2021."
