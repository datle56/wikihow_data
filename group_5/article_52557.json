Note that you can use 2 tsp (10 ml) of butter or margarine instead of the cooking spray, if desired, but the cooking spray affects the flavor less and makes the dish somewhat healthier."

Beat well by hand with a wire whisk until all of the ingredients have been combine and the mixture appears mildly frothy. The eggs are the only essential ingredient, so you can choose to opt out of the milk, salt, and pepper if desired. Milk creates a richer taste, however. If you beat the eggs lightly, the final result will be fairly dense. If you beat the eggs significantly, though, you will beat more air into the mixture and your scrambled eggs will have a lighter texture as a result. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the egg mixture into the skillet.",
      "content": "Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Add the beaten eggs to the hot skillet and allow them to cook until they begin to set around the edges. Cook the eggs on medium heat to avoid overcooking or burning them. Note that the eggs should still look liquidy along the top surface when you prepare to turn them for the first time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn and fold the eggs until thoroughly cooked.",
      "content": "Turn and fold the eggs until thoroughly cooked. Once the eggs begin to set around the edges, use a heat-resistant spatula to carefully pull the eggs toward you, flipping them over so that the bottom portion comes to the top while the liquid underside gets swapped to the bottom. Pull the eggs toward you by scraping the spatula beneath them from the side opposite you and dragging the spatula toward you so that the eggs are flipped over. Periodically flip the eggs as they cook, resting 20 seconds or so in between each flip. Do not move the eggs around too frequently. Otherwise, they may end up breaking into pieces that are too small and difficult to eat. Keep turning the eggs in the pan until all traces of liquid have been removed."

      "title": "Place eggs in a pot of water.",
      "content": "Place eggs in a pot of water. Put your eggs in a medium to large saucepan and fill the pan with enough water to cover the eggs completely. Note that the eggs should be at room temperature before you begin to boil them for best results, as this generally prevents eggs from cracking as they boil. You can use cold eggs, but cold eggs are more likely to crack. Also note that older eggs are better to boil than fresh eggs. The shell will be easier to remove from the fully cooked egg if you start with an egg that is at least a few days old. The closer the eggs are to their expiration date, the easier it will be to peel them once done."

      "content": "Turn off the heat and cover the pan. As soon as the water begins to boil, turn the heat off, cover the saucepan, and let the eggs cook in the still-hot water for several minutes until they reach desired doneness. The precise time will vary based on how large your eggs are and whether you want them to be soft-boiled, medium-boiled, or hard-boiled. [2] X Research source Soft-boiled eggs have a firm white but a runny yolk. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 4 minutes, large eggs 4 to 5 minutes, and extra large eggs 5 minutes. Medium-boiled eggs have a firm white and a semi-firm yolk with some hint of liquid running throughout. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 5 minutes, large eggs 6 minutes, and extra large eggs 7 to 8 minutes. Hard-boiled eggs have a firm white and firm yolk. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 12 minutes, large eggs 17 minutes, and extra large eggs 19 minutes."

Let the eggs sit for at least 10 minutes in the ice water. This is not a crucial step, but dunking the eggs in cold water will stop the cooking process and ultimately make it easier for you to peel the eggs."

Slide the egg off so that it sticks to the bottom of the pan. Allow it too cook there for a full 1 minute. Add the eggs to the simmering water one at a time. You can technically break the eggs directly into the water instead of lowering them in with a spoon or ladle, but breaking the eggs into the water may make it more difficult to control how the eggs turn out."
