Keeping your back straight, lean your head forward as far as it will comfortably go, ideally until your chin is pressed against your chest. You can use your hand to press gently on the back of your head to extend this stretch, being careful not to push past where you are comfortable. Stay in this stretch for about 15 seconds.

You can stretch them by lifting your elbow up above your shoulder and resting it on a door jamb. Gently lean into the wall so that the underside of your upper arm is stretched upwards. Tilt your head in the opposite direction of the arm you’re holding up to stretch your levator scapula muscles. Hold this stretch for 15-20 seconds, then switch sides. [8] X Research source"

Lift your shoulders up towards your ears, hold them for a few seconds, then slowly bring them down. Repeat this 20 times, rest, then do another set of 20. Start with small weights, then gradually increase the weight as you feel your strength increasing. Other exercises that can stretch your neck include farmer's carries (where you walk with a weight in each hand), suitcase carries (where you hold the weight in only one hand), and deadlifts.

      "content": "Do a plank bridge once your neck strength has increased. A plank bridge is similar to a front bridge, but instead of keeping a triangular shape with your hips pointed towards the ceiling, your body will be parallel with the ground as if you’re about to do a push-up. Start by holding yourself up with the balls of your feet, your hands, and your head, and eventually put your hands behind your back to increase the weight on your neck. [13] X Research source This exercise can cause serious injury to the neck, so it's best to start out slow. You may also want to talk to your doctor first before attempting this exercise."

      "content": "Start off with lighter weights and fewer reps. In the beginning, even if you work out regularly, you will want to keep your weights relatively light and stick to 1 or 2 sets of under 20 reps for each exercise. How much weight you start with will vary depending on your current strength and build, but it should be light enough that you can comfortably lift it without struggle or soreness. As your strength increases, you can gradually add more weight and increase your reps."

It’s a good idea to get your muscles loose before you work them out, and it can also be helpful to stretch after exercising to avoid soreness or cramps. Allow yourself time for a full set of stretches before and after each workout. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid using momentum when doing reps. While it can be tempting to build up momentum when doing reps because it makes the movement feel easier, it can actually be harmful to your muscles. Neck muscles are very important and often sensitive, so it’s best to be cautious and pause between each rep. [15] X Research source For instance, when doing dumbbell shrugs, you should be slowly lowering your shoulders and pausing before you lift them again, instead of “bouncing” your shoulders up and down."

      "content": "Move slowly and carefully. Even if you work out often, your neck muscles may not be as strong as you think. To avoid pulling a muscle or causing chiropractic issues, make sure you’re moving slowly when you exercise and not doing anything that gives you discomfort beyond a normal muscle “burn.” [16] X Research source"

Particularly when you first begin exercising your neck muscles, it’s best to give yourself a couple days between workout sessions to rebuild your muscles. Even if your workout wasn’t especially strenuous, exercising a set of muscles that doesn’t usually get much use can lead to soreness and injury if you overdo it. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk to your doctor if you’re having frequent neck pain or stiffness. While it’s natural to feel slight soreness after a workout, you should consult a doctor if you’re experiencing any intense pain or stiffness that makes it uncomfortable to move normally. Your doctor may instruct you to do certain neck stretches or to use heat or cold on your neck muscles to relieve the pain. They may suggest that you take a break from exercising your neck muscles until the pain has subsided.
