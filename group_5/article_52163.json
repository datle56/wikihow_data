Never use a napkin, paper towel, toilet paper or another paper product, since these are scratchy and will damage the screen. A microfiber cloth is handy for cleaning all sorts of screens and lenses. Note: If your computer screen has nano-texture glass (such as some iMacs), you’ll need a special cleaning cloth instead of a microfiber cloth."

Do not soak the cloth; you just want to get it moist, which is the purpose of using the atomizer bottle to wet it. A wet cloth can drip or run when cleaning the screen and the solution can go behind the bezel, permanently damaging your screen. Try applying the solution to just one corner of the cloth at a time, to make sure you don't get it too wet. 1 to 3 sprays should be enough."

Hold the screen toward the very top or very bottom to avoid re-smudging it as you work. You may need to pass over the screen multiple times before all the smudges have been removed. You may also need to re-dampen the cloth as you work, depending on how many passes over the screen you need to make. If you notice dripping liquid on the screen, there is too much solution on the cloth. Use a dry microfiber cloth to dab away the excess solution on the screen to avoid damaging it."
