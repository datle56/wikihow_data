      "content": "Purchase earplugs that can easily be moved between your fingers. Try to test them in your fingers before buying if possible. Buying in bulk is advised as soft foam ear plugs are not reusable. They should be thinner and rounded on one edge so the plugs can be easily inserted into your ear."

Wash your hands with soap and clean running water before using ear plugs.

      "content": "Roll the earplug between your thumb and index finger. You want to roll the earplug into a snake-like shape. This will make it smaller so it can be easily inserted into the ear. The foam will expand again once you’ve fitted it inside your ear, blocking sound. If the ear plug is particularly thick, you can roll it between your hands instead. Just make sure that you are just thinning the ear plug out lengthwise, rather than rolling it up into a ball."

      "title": "Pull your ear up and back.",
      "content": "Pull your ear up and back. Grab the top of your ear with the hand not holding the ear plug. Stretch it slightly up and backwards. This will pull your ear open a bit, allowing you to more easily insert your earplug. Don’t pull too hard. Just a gentle tug is enough to have your ear expanded enough for the ear plug. It may be helpful to use a mirror so you can more clearly see what you're doing."

      "content": "Carefully insert the earplug. Slowly and gently insert the plug it into your ear canal. It should easily slide in place with your ear canal expanded slightly. Do not put the plug in too far and don't force it. While most of the foam body should be in the ear canal, there should be enough of the plug outside the canal that you can easily grasp it with your fingertips. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold in place for 20 – 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold in place for 20 – 30 seconds. Hold the plug in place with your fingertips. This will allow the foam to expand, preventing sound from getting into your ear canal. Slowly count to 20 or 30 as you hold the plug in place. To see if the plug is working, listen to yourself speak. You should sound muffled, as should the sound around you. Do not expect it to completely silence the surroundings, but it should quiet them. If the plug is not working, you may need to try a different form of plugs or possibly smaller ones. Most of the foam body should be in your ear canal by the end. Sometimes you have to try again if the foam is not sealing sound out properly."

      "title": "Purchase the right size ear plugs.",
      "content": "Purchase the right size ear plugs. If you use ear plugs a lot, it may make sense to purchase reusable plugs. As long as you clean them after use, you can reuse plugs made from silicone, plastic, or rubber multiple times. However, you'll first need to figure out your size. Reusable plastic ear plugs are sometimes marketed as \"one size fits all\" while some come in sizes ranging from small to large. You can try a \"one size fits all\" to start, but may have to do some trial and error before you find the right size for your ears. You may need different sized plugs for each ear. This is not uncommon, so don't be surprised if you have to buy two different types of plugs. It may be a good idea to buy a few packs of plugs in different sizes and see what works for your ears."

      "content": "Read the instructions first. Before attempting to insert a reusable ear plug, read the instructions that came with your package thoroughly. How you insert reusable ear plugs varies depending on the precise shape of your plugs. For the most part, the process of inserting a reusable plug is very similar; however, it's a good idea to review your instructions for any special considerations regarding your specific type of plug."

Rock the plug back and forth to slowly push it into the canal. Keep going until you've sealed off the ear canal. [3] X Research source Make sure you do not push the plug in too far. Most of the plug should be in the canal, but you should still be able to easily grab the plug with your fingertips when you need to remove it. If you can still hear well with the plug in place, you may have inserted it incorrectly. Refer to the instructions manual and try again. If the plug still does not work after a second attempt, you may need a different size plug."
