      "content": "Dreadlocks are a hairstyle where hair is wrapped and twisted into long pieces. This hairstyle is mostly worn within African American, Nubian, and Jamaican communities. Dreadlocks are created by braiding, rolling, or backcombing the hair for a rope-like appearance. The strands are typically thick and a bit haphazard. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Locs are an African hairstyle that has a neat, rope-like look. This universal hairstyle is created by coiling, braiding, twisting, or pal-rolling the hair. People with Nubian or African hair typically favor this hairstyle as it helps lock in moisture and can be an easier, low-maintenance way to style their natural hair."

      "content": "Cultural origins Dreadlocks are deeply rooted in African and Jamaican history, while locs date all the way back to Ancient Egypt. Both of these hairstyles are rich with culture. It’s believed that the first appearance of dreadlocks was in East Africa, where warriors wore them. Years later, the holy Rastafarians in Jamaica started sporting dreads to symbolize their religious status and power. On the other hand, locs are rooted in Egyptian and Hindu culture. The Egyptians and Hindus believed the hairstyle was a manifestation of their energetic power. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Appearance",
      "content": "Appearance Dreads and locs both have a similar appearance but locs are neater than dreads. Neat rows aren’t made at the roots when forming dreadlocks, whereas locs do. When forming locs, each section of hair is neatly sectioned and twisted. Overall, locs have a more polished, sleek look, whereas dreads are more relaxed."

      "content": "Connotations Dreadlocks are connected to the slave trade, while locs are not. For some, the term “dreadlocks” has a negative connotation. While the origin of the word is unknown, many believe it stems from the “dread” Africans faced during the slave trade. The horrific conditions of slave ships caused their hair to mat together or “lock” up. [3] X Research source Similarly, dreads and locs have a negative societal connotation. These hairstyles are typically worn within Black communities, and unfortunately, people are often unjustly discriminated against because of their hair or the color of their skin. [4] X Research source The term “dreadlocks” can be offensive to many within the African American community because of this history; however, many have also embraced the term in an attempt to give it a new positive connotation.

It’s not necessarily offensive to mix up the terms “dreads” and “locs,” but using the terms correctly can help you appear that much smarter. Remember, dreads have a more matted look and don’t have a defined root structure, whereas locs are more polished with a defined root structure.
