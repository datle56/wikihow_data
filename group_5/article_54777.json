      "content": "Wash the stains with dish soap and water. Before turning to more complicated solutions, try removing the crayon with plain soap and water. Wet a microfiber cloth , wring it out, then add a couple drops of dish soap. Rub the affected area firmly yet gently, and wring out the cloth now and then so you don’t smear the crayon around. [1] X Research source Make sure to wring out the cloth when you first dampen it. If you get the wall too wet, it could damage the paint."

      "content": "Scrub the wall with a magic eraser. Magic erasers are one of the most recommended products for getting crayon off of walls. Follow the instructions provided with the eraser to wet it, squeeze out excess water, and rub it firmly but gently on the crayon marks. This should work on any crayon marks, though it works best if they’re fresh. [2] X Research source Cleaning expert Laura Smith recommends using magic erasers to get crayon off of walls. However, she says, “You do have to be very careful because they can damage some paints. So, you always want to test a little spot and an inconspicuous place. Don't really scrub it; just wipe gently with a very saturated Magic Eraser, because the drier it is, the more abrasive it is.”"

      "title": "Try applying mayonnaise.",
      "content": "Try applying mayonnaise. This may sound strange, but the oils in mayo can sometimes break down the wax in crayon. Apply the mayonnaise to the crayon marks with a microfiber cloth and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Then, wipe the wall with a clean, damp rag and let it air dry. [6] X Research source Full-fat mayo typically works best because it has the most oils. To avoid smearing mayo all over your walls if this method doesn’t work for you, test it in a small area first. If you have pets, keep them out of the room so they don’t try to lick the mayo off."

It’s also possible to spray the WD-40 directly onto the wall, but do so in an inconspicuous area first to make sure it doesn’t damage the surface. [9] X Research source WD-40 often has strong fumes, so work in a well-ventilated area."

Then, place a clean, white paper towel over the marks and set your iron to low heat. Gently press the iron onto the paper towel, moving it in a circular motion. The heat should melt the crayon wax, allowing it to transfer onto the paper towel. Replace the paper towel as needed until the marks are no longer transferring. [12] X Research source Non-woven wallpaper has a paper backing which makes it easy to install and remove. Do not use a hairdryer in place of the iron. Direct heat can cause wallpaper to peel or warp."
