      "content": "Include a cheerful sign-off to create a friendly, open tone for recipients. A playful quip at the end of an email can really lift someone’s mood!

      "content": "Tease your recipient with a funny, passive-aggressive sign-off. Sarcasm can be super funny, but only if the person on the receiving end can clearly tell you’re being sarcastic or knows your sense of humor well. These quips aren’t ideal for formal emails—but when it comes to people you’re on good terms with, a little wittiness and dry humor can go a long way. [2] X Research source For example: Please hesitate to reach out! Lukewarm regards. Warmest regards from the depths of my last nerve. Yours in eternal anticipation. With eye rolls… Congrats on reading this whole email! With more enthusiasm than your email deserved. Sincerely, despite the circumstances. If you have any questions, please ask someone else. Currently running on caffeine and dry humor. At a loss for words. Have the day you deserve. Thanks (not sure what for). Yours unfaithfully. Insert pleasantry here. Live, laugh, leave me alone. Deeply disinterested. Affectionately annoyed."

      "content": "Share a pop culture reference to add personality to your email. Pop culture references can be tons of fun to use, give other people hints about the franchises you’re really into, and encourage them to reply quickly. However, it’s generally a good idea to either use pop culture references that are extremely well-known or use them when you know your recipient will understand the reference. So long, and thanks for all the fish. May the Force be with you. To infinity and beyond. Don’t stop believin’. That’s all, folks! You can’t handle the regards. May the odds be ever in your favor. Hakuna matata! Stay classy, San Diego. Yabba dabba do! Hasta la vista!"

[3] X Research source Logging off with corporate flair. With all due respect and a bit of jest… Warm regards from my desk to yours. Sincerely, your favorite coworker. Best regards and a chuckle.

A quirky sign-off could be anything from a play on words to a pun or witty remark. For example: This message is transmitted on 100% recycled electrons. Riding off into the email sunset. Stay tuned. Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth! Teleporting to my next adventure. Gone fishing in a sea of emails. I’ve already told you more than I know. Swan-diving into the weekend.

      "content": "Use generational slang in a sign-off to a fellow Gen Z or Millennial. Although the slang below is super common among Gen Z and Millennials, it’s not as well known to older generations.

Live long and stay valid. No cap. Adulting successfully, one email at a time. In the words of our generation, “Lit.” Slay, serve, survive. Sending good vibes your way. Another day, another slay."

You know how drafting an email from your phone typically adds a “Sent from my iPhone” or “Sent from my Android” message at the end? Well, if you want to make your recipient chuckle, you can edit that message and put a silly spin on it. For example: Sent via carrier pigeon—I mean, iPhone. Sent from the Starbucks drive-thru. Sent from my cat’s litter box. Sent by iPhone. Please imagine this message was perfectly composed. Sent from a mobile phone, which should explain any typos. Sent from my Android device which sometimes has a mind of its own. Sent from a telegram in the 1860s…or maybe from my Android. Sent from the future. Sent from Area 51 Sent from my Walkman. Sent from my Android. It might be smarter than me. Sent from my iPhone. Siri may have helped, but probably not. Sent via smoke signals. Just kidding, it’s from my iPhone. Sent from my calculator. Sent from the club."
