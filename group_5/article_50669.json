      "content": "Identify and understand your triggers. When you first decided to quit, you likely identified at least some of the things that trigger you to drink. Go back and look at that list—you might even have things you can add to it. Dig into the things on the list and try to understand them better so you know how to avoid them. The better you are at avoiding your triggers, the less likely you'll be to relapse. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may have heard exposure to a trigger described as a high-risk situation . These are times when you're at a higher risk of drinking. For example, if you typically drink when you're around a certain friend, going out with that friend—even if there's no drinking involved—puts you in a high-risk situation. During the emotional stage of relapse, you might be in denial of the risk of relapse. You might believe that you're capable of handling high-risk situations without going back to drinking. Be mindful of your triggers at all times. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Use \"HALT\" when you feel a craving to drink. Sometimes, a craving to drink is really a sign that your other basic needs aren't being met. Ask yourself if you're really hungry, angry, lonely, or tired (HALT). If you determine that you are one of those things, do something to address that need and see if the craving goes away. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if you've determined that you're lonely, you might call a sober friend and talk to them for a while or even go visit them and hang out until you feel better. Sometimes, having a bite to eat and some water and taking a nap is all you really need to overcome the craving."

      "content": "Build a strong support system around you. When you're going through the recovery process after drinking heavily, a strong support system makes all the difference. Keep people around you who are ready to be there for you when you need them, any time. Keep in regular contact with these people and be honest with them about how you're doing. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you're in the emotional stage of relapse, you might be inclined to push these people away. You probably don't feel like expressing your emotions that much, or you might be ashamed that you're thinking about drinking again. Just be honest with them—they'll understand. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pull together an emergency contact list of a handful of people (or more) to call in case you are feeling like you're going to relapse. People who've been through the same thing are especially good for this kind of support. Because they've been where you are, you don't have to feel embarrassed or ashamed to reach out when you're struggling. Reach out to your doctor as well. They can prescribe medication that will help curb the cravings that can lead to relapse. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice mindfulness meditation. Being more mindful is a great way to prevent relapse. If you find it beneficial, meditate when you feel a craving coming on—it will help you stay in the present moment and understand that craving as a momentary feeling that you can control. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Research shows that mindfulness significantly reduces cravings in people who've recently quit abusing alcohol. Meditation also helps you become more aware of your actions so that you can act with intention rather than doing things mindlessly on autopilot."

      "content": "Change who you hang out with. This is a tough one if your social life revolved around drinking before, but remember that your real friends will support your decision not to drink and they won't want to drink or be drunk around you. If you have people in your life who are still going to tease you about drinking or offer you drinks, don't hang out with them anymore. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source During the mental stage of relapse, you'll often come up with excuses for why you can hang out with these people you previously enjoyed or thought you were having fun with. You might tell yourself it'll be okay. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Remember that if you go back to hanging out with the same people you hung out with before you quit drinking, you're more likely to start drinking again. Make new sober friends and you won't face the same risk."

This is a high-risk situation for anybody who's recently quit drinking and it's just not a risk you need to take. Instead, go to a café or invite your friends to a park for a picnic—something that doesn't involve alcohol. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you're in the mental stage of relapse, you might have convinced yourself that it's okay if you go to a bar or a party where alcohol is being served—and that might be true!

But there are some negative thoughts that you need to hold onto—specifically, the memories of the negative and bad things that happen when you drink. If you keep reminding yourself of those bad times, you'll be far less likely to relapse. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A big part of the mental relapse stage is that you start thinking about the good times when you drank and idealizing drinking. You'll tell yourself that you had a lot of fun with alcohol and there's no reason you can't do that again. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Instead, focus on the bad side of those good times—not the start, but the end. Think about how hungover you felt the next day, how you got sick, or how you had to call out of work."

This does mean that sometimes you have to force yourself to go to meetings or talk to your therapist when you aren't feeling like it. Be honest with those around you about how you're feeling and they can help. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source During the emotional relapse stage, people tend to isolate themselves from others and pull away from their support groups.

Sometimes, those issues only come to the surface when you quit drinking alcohol—and if you don't deal with them, you'll be more likely to relapse. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if you have depression, talking to a therapist and taking antidepressants can help get you in a better place mentally.

This is especially important during times that you'd previously drink. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if you previously started drinking after work, you might start volunteering at an animal shelter and go walk dogs after work so you won't be tempted to drink."

Treat yourself well and you'll start to feel better. [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source During the emotional and mental stages of relapse, you're likely to pull away from any new things you've started doing as part of your sober life.
