      "title": "Wire the LEDs.",
      "content": "Wire the LEDs . Make sure your wires are long enough (around 15cm / 6 in each) depending on how big your hat is. Start wiring up the LEDs one by one, making sure to note the positive and negative terminals. (Color-coding the wires is highly recommended: for example, you can use a white wire for each positive terminal and a color wires for each negative terminal.) Wrap the wires tightly to each LED so they won't fall apart. You can even solder the connections, though it's probably not necessary."

      "title": "Mark and cut the hat.",
      "content": "Mark and cut the hat. This part is also crucial, as you need to pick logical (but inconspicuous) spots to place the LEDs: if you place them too far apart from each other, the light beam won't be strong enough to blind a camera, but if you place them too close, they will hide your face from a certain angle but not others. Think this out and position them well. Mark each spot with a marker, then cut a few holes with a pair of small scissors in the middle of the front of the hat as well as a few on the sides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the LEDs.",
      "content": "Attach the LEDs. Turn the hat inside out. Take each LED and place it tight in its hole. For extra stability, secure each LED with a dab of glue so that it won't fall out; however, try not to cover the bulb, focusing instead on holding the wire in place. Hot glue will work well for this purpose. When youâ€™re done, flip the hat right-side-out."

      "title": "Secure wires with tape.",
      "content": "Secure wires with tape. Tape all the wires together using electrical tape and secure them to the inside of the hat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Power up.",
      "content": "Power up. Connect a small 9v battery to the wires and secure it with electrical tape. (This is where having color-coded wires will really come in handy, as they will tell you which wires to connect to the positive and negative terminal of the battery.) You can even add a little on/off switch if you want. In this example, the battery is placed on the inside back of the hat."
