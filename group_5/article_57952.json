      "content": "If a heel can’t solve your problem, it’s time to look for other solutions. If you know how to sew, hemming your dress will be pretty easy. If you’ve never really sewn before, take your dress to a professional tailor. They shouldn’t charge you too much, and the dress should be ready to wear again in just a few days! [1] X Research source It’s much better (and safer) to hem an overly long dress than to chance going out in it. You’re asking to trip if you decide to just go for it! If you can't hem the dress, try using double-sided wardrobe tape to hem it. Fold the dress under to the length you want it to hang, then place the tape inside the fold to stick the two sides together. [2] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 3 November 2020. Another way to shorten the dress a little might be to put on a belt, then pull a little of the fabric over the top of the belt.

      "content": "This will give you a benchmark for where the dress hits. While you probably won’t be wearing it barefoot, you also don’t want to have to wear five-inch heels to lift it off the floor. A trip-proof dress should be just hitting the ground even when you’re not wearing shoes."

      "content": "Take a few steps back and forth. The skirt should allow you to move around the room easily. Unfortunately, some fabrics may stick to your legs, making it much more difficult to walk without tripping. If this is the case, spray some anti-static product on the inside of the dress. You can buy anti-static spray at local retailers or online."

      "content": "Wearing heels can keep the hem of your dress from dragging. Even if it’s just hitting the floor, you might still feel that it’s too long for you. Start with a one to two-inch (2.5 to 5.1-cm) kitten heel. If you need an extra bump, move up to a three to four-inch (7.6 to 10.2-cm) heel. This should lift the dress so it’s a few inches (or several centimeters) above the ground. [4] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 3 November 2020. [5] X Research source Only wear heels that are higher than four inches (10.2 cm) if you’ve had some practice walking around in high heels. You don’t want the heels to add to your tripping problems!"

      "content": "If your feet get tired and sore, you’ll be more likely to trip. Test out the shoes you plan on pairing with your long dress with another outfit first. If they give you blisters or -- even worse -- cause you to trip, they’re definitely not a good choice for your floor-length dress. [6] X Research source Your shoes should also have a good tread on the bottom to prevent them from slipping across floors."

      "content": "Wear them around the house to get used to them. Once you’ve got a pair of shoes (or even several) picked out to go with your dress, take some time to get used to walking around while wearing them. This will allow you to see how big your steps should be in your dress. It’ll also help you feel more confident that you won’t trip when you leave your house."

You may also walk faster because you’ll be less comfortable.

Use your other hand to steady yourself on the banister or side of the stairwell. [9] X Research source Make sure your skirt is high enough that you can easily bend and lift your legs. You should also be able to see your feet so you can put them down on each stair safely."

      "content": "Gather the skirt in your hand while you go down the stairs. While going downstairs isn’t usually as much of a hazard in long dresses, the back of your skirt may drag behind you. If you’re in a crowded stairwell, lift and gather your skirt and bring it to your side. Use the banister to steady yourself as you walk down slowly."

      "content": "You're more likely to trip when you sit down or stand up. Place both hands on your mid-thighs. Gently lift your skirt a bit as you sit down. This will keep the hem from catching on the floor as you pull your chair in or out. When you stand up again, lift your skirt in the front to keep from tripping on it as you rise."

These could snag your long skirt and quickly leave you tripped up and stuck. You also shouldn’t ride your bike while wearing a long dress, as the skirt might get caught in the gears or pedals. This could cause a truly epic kind of trip. [10] X Research source"
