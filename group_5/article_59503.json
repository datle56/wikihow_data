      "content": "Take a photo or scan the document and adjust the contrast. While you may not be able to restore the ink on the faded document itself, you can try taking a high-quality photograph of it. You could also scan the document to turn it into a digital file. Then, you can use a photo-editing program such as Photoshop to manipulate the image and adjust the contrast so the ink is more legible. It’s common for ink on old documents to fade over time. By taking a digital photo or scan, you can preserve them forever."

      "content": "Press drawing paper between 2 boards overnight to remove dents. If your sheet of drawing paper has dents or other minor surface imperfections, take the paper and place it between 2 clean, rigid supports that are bigger than the piece of paper such as mat boards or large books. Then, place a weight on top of the boards such as a book to help press the paper. Leave the pressed paper overnight or even up to 24 hours, then remove it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a soft-bristle hair brush and a spatula to clean up old maps. Lay your map flat on a table and anchor the corners with books. Take a soft-bristle hair brush and gently brush away grime, dust, and debris from the surface. If there’s any glue, adhesive residue, or gunk on the surface, use a spatula to gently scrape it off."

      "content": "Use acid-free glue and a bone folder for a quick fix. Choose an acid-free glue that dries clear, such as craft glue. Place a piece of wax paper beneath the ripped paper and paint a tiny amount of glue over the tear with a fine brush. Then, place another piece of wax paper over the tear and press the bone folder, which is a dull-edged hand tool used to fold and crease material, over the tear. Allow the glue to dry and then remove the wax paper and bone folder. [2] X Research source You can find bone folders at your local craft supply store."

      "content": "Use wheat starch paste and Kizukishi paper for a professional repair. Wheat starch paste is the best adhesive to use for paper repairs. Kizukishi paper is thin, Japanese paper that’s great for patching tears. Use a small paintbrush to spread a thin layer of your wheat starch paste over some Mylar paper (to prevent sticking). Cut a strip of the Kizukishi paper to match the size of your tear, press it down into the layer of wheat starch paste, and place it on the tear with a pair of tweezers. [3] X Research source Use your fingers to smooth out the sticky paper over the tear so it’s even and consistent. You can order wheat starch paste online."

      "content": "Use a soft-bristled brush to remove dust. If your old prints have gathered lots of dust, it’s important that you clean them gently so you don’t damage the fragile paper. Take a soft-bristled brush, like an old-style bristle shaving brush, and lightly brush off any dust on the surface. [4] X Research source Avoid using a vacuum cleaner, which could potentially suck off loose fragments and damage the paper."

      "content": "Remove dirt by gently rubbing the paper with a chemical sponge. A chemical sponge, also known as a smoke sponge, is made from vulcanized rubber and is able to trap dirt in the surface of the sponge. If you have dirty paper prints, rub away the dirt with the dry chemical sponge. When the sponge gets dirty, use scissors or a knife to cut off the dirty surface to expose clean sponge. [5] X Research source Make sure the sponge is dry! Water can quickly damage old prints."

      "title": "Take prints with foxing stains to professional restorers.",
      "content": "Take prints with foxing stains to professional restorers. Foxing stains are reddish-brown stains that appear on old paper. They’re caused by either mold or iron contaminants and they can be treated by specialized procedures such as gas bleaching with chlorine dioxide gas, laser treatments, and chemical treatments. However, these treatments need to be done by professional restorers, so if you’re trying to remove foxing stains from your old prints, look up paper restorers in your area who can fix the issue.

      "title": "Soak the paper in a bleach solution for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the paper in a bleach solution for 10 minutes. Combine 1 part bleach and about 15 parts water in a bowl and place your yellowed paper in the solution. Push it down slightly so the entire surface area of the paper is wet. Allow the paper to soak for a full 10 minutes. Then, carefully remove the paper from the bleach mixture and lay it flat on a sheet of dry waxed paper until it’s dry. [7] X Research source You may want to test the solution on a smaller strip or scrap of yellowed paper to make sure the bleaching solution doesn’t damage it. Handle it gently once it’s dry as the bleaching process can make it more brittle."

Most pieces can be restored for between $300-$500 USD. However, more complex restorations can cost more, and sometimes basic or simple restorations can cost less. [8] X Research source"
