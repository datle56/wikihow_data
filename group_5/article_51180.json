      "content": "Inform the driver that you have your pet with you. Let the driver know that you’re with your pet before they arrive so that they know what to expect and make needed adjustments. If you are a service dog handler traveling with your legitimate service dog (one that performs trained tasks to mitigate your disability) you do not have to call the driver. You may choose to but, by federal law, you are not required to call ahead. Drivers with medical conditions like allergies have logical reasons why they need to decline from giving you a ride. However, the law still protects service dog handlers and their dogs. If a driver must refuse you for medical reasons, they must notify Lyft immediately and Lyft must send another driver to you immediately. Lyft abides by the American Disability Act and has a No-Discrimination policy, which covers people who have service animals. Drivers who decline to give a lift to people with service dogs will be banned and removed from the Lyft service."

Companion dogs, therapy dogs, and emotional support dogs are not service dogs. Although service dog handlers can, if they choose to, call Lyft to tell them they are traveling with their service dog they are not required to. [1] X Research source"
