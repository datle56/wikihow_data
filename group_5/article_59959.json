      "content": "The Shahada (ٱلشَّهَادَةُ) is the proclamation of faith in the Islamic religion. The Shahada (or shahadah ) is a declaration of faith in one God (Allah) and his messenger Muhammad. It’s the most sacred statement in Islam, and a person must recite it with a full understanding of its meaning and mindfulness. The Shahada is also the first of the five pillars of Islam. These pillars are the five core beliefs and practices of the Islamic religion. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The first part of the Shahada proclaims a belief in one God, Allah. This is the center of Islam around which everything else revolves. When Muslims recite the Shahada during the five daily prayers, they’re continuously reminded of this foundational belief.

      "content": "The Shahada’s second part declares belief in the messenger Muhammad. This part requires Muslims to testify to their belief in the Prophet Muhammad as Allah’s messenger. Muslims also accept other prophets, such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, but recognize Muhammad as the final prophet of Islam. This part of the Shahada is also meant to remind Muslims that Muhammad is only a profit, not an equal to Allah.

      "content": "The Shahada is recited during adhan (أَذَان, the call to prayer). The adhan (also “ azan ” or “ athan ”) is the announcement made to let Muslims know that it’s time to pray. The announcer, or mu'adhdhin (مُؤَذّن), stands in the minaret of a mosque or another high place and calls the announcement 15 minutes before each of the 5 daily prayers. Each line of the Shahada is repeated twice at the beginning of this call. [5] X Research source The adhan starts with the announcer calling out Allahu Akbar (ٱللهُ أَكْبَر, “Allah is the greatest.”) four times. After that they say the first part of the Shahada — Ashhadu ala ilaha illallah (أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله, I testify that there is no god but God)—twice. They continue by then saying the second part of the Shahada — Ash hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulu-Allah (أشهد أن محمد رسول الله, I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God.)—twice."

Each prayer consists of a set of prescribed movements and iterations, called rak’ah (ركعة), that Muslims must perform. The dawn prayer has 2 rak’ah , the dusk prayer has 3, and the midday, afternoon, and night prayers have 4. The Shahada appears in the second rak’ah, in a piece called the Tashahhud (تَشَهُّد).

The term “ zakat ” literally translates as “purification.” This is a donation made to help less fortunate members of the community and ensure justice in society. This acts as a reminder to Muslims to use their wealth unselfishly and to care for others who don’t have as much. The amount of this donation is usually about 2.5% of a person’s annual accumulated wealth. [11] X Research source In some countries, the government collects and distributes zakat . In other places, Muslims donate through local mosques and Muslim associations."

During daylight fasting hours, Muslims abstain from food, water, sexual activity, and evil thoughts. Ramadan is all about practicing patience and commitment, and the fast is a way for Muslims to discipline their body and spirit. It’s also a reminder of the social injustice that still occurs for people who can’t eat every day. [12] X Research source Ramadan is also a time to come together as a community since many Muslims gather with friends and family to eat and celebrate once daylight hours are over."

Every Muslim is required to make this journey at least once in their lifetime, so long as they’re in good health and have the financial means. The Hajj shows that Muslims of all races, ethnic groups, and cultures are equal in God’s presence, and everyone wears the same white garment as they walk, pray, and eat together.
