      "content": "Soak a cloth in 3% hydrogen peroxide. This is a standard hydrogen peroxide type. You can get it at any drugstore or pharmacy. Take a clean rag and soak it with the peroxide. [1] X Research source Don’t use a stronger concentration of peroxide. This might discolor the wood or lighten it too much. Peroxide shouldn’t irritate your skin, but wash your hands after you handle it. Don’t touch your eyes or face before you wash your hands. This trick works on finished and unfinished wood. It shouldn't discolor the finish."

      "content": "Press the cloth onto the stain. Take the rag and rub it a bit over the stain to wet the wood. Then lay it down directly over the stain and press it a bit so the peroxide soaks into the wood. [2] X Research source Make sure you cover the whole stain. If it’s a very large stain, you may need another rag."

      "content": "Leave the cloth over the stain overnight. This isn’t a quick treatment. The peroxide needs a few hours to lift and soak up the stain. Let it sit over night for the best results. [3] X Research source If you do this in the morning, then let the rag sit for 4-6 hours instead of waiting until the next morning."

      "content": "Remove the rag and wipe up any remaining peroxide. After a few hours pass, you can pick up the rag. Wipe it around to pick up any excess peroxide. If the treatment worked, the stain should be significantly lighter or gone completely. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe the wood before applying peroxide again.",
      "content": "Wipe the wood before applying peroxide again. It’s normal if the stain isn’t completely gone, and you might need 1 or 2 more peroxide applications. Before using additional treatments, take a wet sponge and wipe the wood to remove any dried peroxide. Let it dry, then try another peroxide treatment. [5] X Research source If you’ve tried this 2 or 3 times and don’t see any improvement in the stain, then it probably won’t work. You need a stronger treatment like bleach or sanding."

      "content": "Get a wood bleach that contains oxalic acid. There are a few types of wood bleach and they all work differently. Oxalic acid is best for spot-treating wood to remove set-in stains. You can find it at most hardware stores. [6] X Research source Oxalic acid usually comes in powder form, which you can mix in with water when you’re ready to use it. This method also works for finished and unfinished wood."

Always protect yourself by wearing goggles and rubber gloves whenever you handle it. [7] X Research source If you get any bleach in your eye, flush it for 15 minutes with cool water. Just let the water flow over your eye and don't rub it at all. After that, call poison control for further instructions. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix 1 oz (28 g) of oxalic acid with 1 pint (473 ml) of warm water. Since oxalic acid comes in powder form, you need to mix it with water before using it. Measure out 1 oz (28 g) of oxalic acid and pour it into a container with 1 pint (473 ml) of warm water. Stir the mixture until the powder entirely dissolves. [9] X Research source hhttps://www.grannyb.co.za/blogs/news/how-to-bleach-wood-tutorial Always check the instructions to confirm the mixing instructions. They may be different for different brands. Don’t mix the bleach ahead of time and try to use it later. It doesn’t last very long in storage."

[10] X Research source Make sure the toothbrush is clean and unused so you don’t get any stains on the wood. Don’t rub the bleach on unstained spots or you might discolor the wood. If you want to protect the unstained areas, you can tape off the stain with masking or painter’s tape. [11] X Research source"

If the treatment was successful, the stain should be significantly lighter. [13] X Research source You can repeat this 1 or 2 more times if the stain isn’t completely gone. If it still isn’t gone after this, then you may need to sand the wood."

Breathing this in could irritate your lungs, so make sure to wash it away before you start. Use a wet sponge and dish soap to scrub the area around the stain. Then rinse and dry the wood. [14] X Research source Even if you haven’t tried to clean the stain with chemicals, it’s a good idea to wash the area first to get rid of any dirt."

      "content": "Remove the wood finish over the stain with 100-grit sandpaper. Coarse sandpaper is best for stripping away the wood finish. Take 100-grit sandpaper and sand the finish above the stain. Work along with the grain of the wood. Continue sanding until you reach the bare wood. [15] X Research source If the stain is only in a small spot, then you probably don’t need an electric or belt sander. If you’re removing a lot of stains, like on an entire floor, then an electric sander might help. Try to limit your sanding to the small area above the stain. If you sand too much, you’ll have more to refinish later."

Take 150-grit sandpaper and sand the stain directly, again along the grain of the wood. Continue sanding until you remove the whole stain. [16] X Research source For very severe stains, sanding won’t even get them out. In this case, you’ll have to replace the wood panels or floorboards. [17] X Research source Try to collect some of the sawdust while you're sanding. You can mix this with wood putty to match it to the wood color if you need to fix any holes."

      "content": "Refinish the wood in that spot. If you removed the stain from a finished piece of wood, then you’ll have to repair the spot that you sanded. Since it’s only a small spot, this isn’t a big job. Start by filling any holes or cracks with wood putty. When the putty dries, sand it down with fine-grit sandpaper until the surface is smooth. Then vacuum the area to get rid of dust from sanding. Brush the finish onto the area and let it dry to complete the job. [20] X Research source Try to match the finish that you use with the original finish on the wood. Otherwise, the colors will be different. If you aren't sure what that color was, try using a finisher's color wheel from a hardware store to match colors and find the right finish type. [21] X Research source If you have to plug any holes with putty, try mixing some sawdust from when you sanded the floor with the putty. This matches its color to the wood for a less noticeable repair."
