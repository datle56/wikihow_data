[1] X Research source When you’re wearing a short skirt, you definitely don’t want to go commando. If it’s laundry day and you’re all out of underwear, put on some leggings instead."

      "content": "Tights help cover you up without adding too much bulk to your lower half. If it’s not too warm out, pull on a pair of tights or pantyhose underneath your skirt. They’ll provide extra coverage and make you feel extra secure while wearing a skirt. [2] X Research source If you’re looking for extra-full coverage, go with leggings instead of sheer tights. Don’t like the look of tights but still want some protection? Try wearing skin-colored pantyhose."

      "content": "Bodysuits cover a little more than what underwear covers. If you don’t want to add an extra layer underneath your skirt, try a bodysuit instead. Bodysuits fit almost like one-piece bathing suits, and they look like a shirt that’s been tucked into your skirt. Bodysuits are especially nice if you like the tucked-in look, but you don’t want to worry about your shirt bunching up all day.

      "content": "These stretchy shorts give you ample amounts of coverage. Bike shorts are usually made out of stretchy material such as lycra or spandex, and can be worn over your underwear to provide an extra layer of coverage. Because they're so fitted, you shouldn't be able to see that you're wearing them once the skirt is on. [5] X Research source If you’re wearing a mini skirt, go for short bike shorts instead of the longer ones. That way, you won’t see them peeking out from underneath your skirt. Want to make a fashion statement? Pick out longer shorts in a fun print or with lace on them."

      "title": "Loose, flowy skirts might fly up in the wind.",
      "content": "Loose, flowy skirts might fly up in the wind. In order to avoid accidentally showing too much skin, try wearing a tight or fitted skirt that hugs your body. [6] X Research source If tight-fitting skirts aren’t your style, opt for a flowy skirt that’s a bit longer on windy days. Pencil skirts are a great choice for windy days because they’re so fitted. Denim skirts are also a great choice, because they use stiffer material."

      "title": "Keep your skirt covering everything to avoid any unwanted skin showing.",
      "content": "Keep your skirt covering everything to avoid any unwanted skin showing. Use one or both hands to smooth your skirt from mid-thigh downward as you sit, especially if you're wearing a skirt with a slit in the back. This makes sure you're sitting evenly on the fabric without it bunching, and also closes off any potential space that could be too revealing. Use this same trick when you get into a car, too."

      "title": "When you sit, put your bag in your lap to prevent any wayward glances.",
      "content": "When you sit, put your bag in your lap to prevent any wayward glances. A large handbag or purse can give you a lot of extra coverage if your skirt starts to ride up. Using a big bag is also a great trick when you’re getting out of a car. Backpacks and crossbody bags work, too."

      "title": "Keeping your legs together will help keep your underwear from showing.",
      "content": "Keeping your legs together will help keep your underwear from showing. Be sure to cross your legs carefully in order to avoid exposing your underwear. If you want to play it really safe, only cross your ankles—this will draw your legs closer together without exposing any additional skin. You can also situate your hands on your lap so that they cover any area that might be exposed while sitting."

      "title": "Bending your knees keeps you covered up as you reach toward the floor.",
      "content": "Bending your knees keeps you covered up as you reach toward the floor. If you’re wearing a short skirt, you don’t want to bend at the waist, since that can cause your skirt to ride up in the back. If you need to grab something, slowly bend with your knees to avoid any fashion mishaps. [7] X Research source The same thing goes for tying your shoes."

    {
      "title": "Going slowly will help keep your skirt in place.",
      "content": "Going slowly will help keep your skirt in place. Take stairs one at a time, and try to keep your steps as close as possible. When you're traveling in a group, hang back and start up the stairs last. This way, you can avoid any wayward glances from the people behind you. If you're on an escalator with people behind you, position yourself so that your rear is pressed against the side rail. That way, the people on the steps beneath you won’t be able to see up your skirt."

      "title": "When you sit on a chair, it’s much easier to keep yourself covered up.",
      "content": "When you sit on a chair, it’s much easier to keep yourself covered up. Flat floors can cause your skirt to ride up, especially as you bend down to sit. If it’s at all possible, sit in a chair or a bench instead. You might be covered while you're sitting, but lowering yourself and standing back up might put you in a revealing position, especially if you have to maneuver around high heels. If you can’t avoid sitting on the floor, try sitting with your back to a wall and bending down slowly. Once you’re on the ground, cross your legs to keep everything covered up."

      "title": "Fully covered railings and elevators will protect you from eyes down below.",
      "content": "Fully covered railings and elevators will protect you from eyes down below. Many two-story malls and shopping centers use glass railings and elevators. If you are worried about an upskirt, avoid standing or walking too close to a glass railing, because people on the ground floor may be able to see up your skirt. The same thing applies to glass elevators. Try not to stand along the glass—instead, situate yourself in the middle of the elevator so that you aren’t visible from the ground."
