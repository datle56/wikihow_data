Pick one up from your local electronics store or order one online so you can hook it up to your old speakers. [1] X Research source A few popular Bluetooth adapters include the Vamp or Chromecast Audio. A Vamp Stereo can power up to 2 speakers at the same time. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach the device to your speakers with a foam pad or magnet. Your Bluetooth adapter will come with a foam pad you can stick to the outer surface of your speaker to keep it attached. Some devices, like the Vamp, come with 2 magnets—1 you attach to the bottom of the device and another you put inside the speaker so it connects with the magnet on the device to hold it in place. If your device doesn’t come a foam pad or a magnet, you can use tape or another adhesive to attach it to your speaker. You also don’t have to attach the device to your speaker if you don’t want to!"

Pair them together so they’re connected and you can send audio through the speakers.

Pull out the inserts and cones, which are the round speaker parts in the front of the speaker. Take out any foam padding and wiring that’s inside the speakers so you’re left with a hollow box. [6] X Research source Once you take the parts of the speaker, they won’t be usable, so don’t use speakers you don’t want to break! Check out local thrift stores for old speakers you can turn into a table or bookshelf."

Take some medium-grit sandpaper and sand all the sides of the speaker to remove any old varnish and create a rough surface that your wood stain will adhere to. Use a clean cloth to wipe away the dust when you’re finished. [7] X Research source It’s super important that you remove the dust so it doesn’t get all gunky in your wood stain."

Use a paintbrush to spread a thin layer over the surface of the box. Wait about an hour to allow the wood stain to fully dry (but check the packaging for specific drying times to be sure). [8] X Research source For instance, if the speaker box is a darker wood color, use a darker stain to match it. If you want to go an extra step, you can paint the rim of the speakers in a bright, fun color to really make it pop, but it’s totally up to you."

Place the legs over some newspaper or paint them outdoors so you don’t get paint everywhere. Shake the can of spray paint really well to mix the paint and spray a thin layer over the feet of the legs. Allow the paint to fully dry when you’re finished. [10] X Research source Check the directions on the can of spray paint for specific drying times. Make sure you work in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing in the paint fumes."
