      "content": "Choose your preferred style of sharpening stone. Select a stone that has dimensions of at least 2 by 6 inches (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) to make your sharpening job easier. Some of the most common commercial options for sharpening stones include diamond stones, ceramic stones, and whetstones. [1] X Research source Diamond stones : These stones are the hardest, longest-lasting, and will sharpen your blade the quickest, but they’re the most expensive. Ceramic stones : These stones last longer and will sharpen your blade faster than a whetstone, but they’re more challenging to use. They must be soaked in water for 3-5 minutes before use. Whetstone : These stones are generally considered the easiest to use and are made from fine to coarse grit stone. You must soak your whetstone in cold, clean water for ten minutes before you sharpen your blade on it."

      "content": "Lubricate the sharpening stone according to manufacturer instructions. Some stones require lots of water while others only need a trickle and many require no lubrication at all. [2] X Research source Follow the package instructions for whatever specific sharpening stone you purchased. Some knife sharpening experts also recommend using a lubricant such as mineral oil , which can be found at most hardware stores. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean your pocket knife. Use soap and water to wipe the blade clean and remove any residual dirt or grease. Dry it completely with a clean cloth. [4] X Research source While cleaning the knife, check for any nicks in the blade that might require more gently handling when being sharpened."

      "title": "Identify the edge angle (or edge bevel) of the blade.",
      "content": "Identify the edge angle (or edge bevel) of the blade. The blade of every knife is honed at a particular angle to suit the purpose of the knife—when sharpening, you want to match that angle. [5] X Research source Contact your pocket knife’s manufacturer or look for the information in your owner’s manual. Alternatively, you can go into your local knife shop for help or search online for the bevel angle of your specific knife. Victorinox, one of the most popular pocket knife manufacturers, recommends sharpening their Swiss Army knife blades at a 15-20 degree angle on both sides. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Position the knife at its edge angle and glide it along the stone.",
      "content": "Position the knife at its edge angle and glide it along the stone. With the blade facing away from you, place the knife at the proper edge angle against the stone. Sweep the knife down and off the end of the stone. Repeat as many times as necessary to produce a sharp edge, usually about 5-10 times. [7] X Research source Blades that are curved or longer than your whetstone will need to be swept down and across the stone to evenly sharpen the entire blade. Keep your hand steady and maintain the angle throughout the entire sharpening stroke. If not, you may end up putting a rounded edge on the blade instead of a sharp edge. Use the same angle each time you sharpen the knife. Keeping the angle consistent is more important than the actual angle itself. Some pocket knife users recommend tracing the entire edge of the blade with a Sharpie. When sharpening, you’ll be able to see if your angle is correct and know to stop when the ink has all been removed. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Refine your blade along the finer side of the stone.",
      "content": "Refine your blade along the finer side of the stone. Flip the stone over so that the finer side is facing up. Run your blade, at its proper bevel angle, along the finer side of the stone. Doing this will remove any bumps or 'burrs' that may have formed along the edge of the blade during the sharpening process. [9] X Research source Instead of using the finer side of the stone, you can also run each side of the blade down a honing rod at an angle more open than the one you held the blade at to sharpen it. The honing rod removes the burrs and fine tunes the blade's sharpness. Honing is also a quick way to refresh an edge in between sharpenings."

      "title": "Test the sharpness of your knife.",
      "content": "Test the sharpness of your knife. Hold up a piece of paper and try to slice down through the paper with your knife. A sharp blade will easily slide through the paper. [10] X Research source You can also test for any rounded part of the blade or imperfections by holding your knife up to a light and looking for a bright reflection of light. Reflections exist only when there is a rounded edge somewhere along your knife, or a section of a knife that is no longer sharp."

      "title": "Select a bevel angle that matches your pocket knife.",
      "content": "Select a bevel angle that matches your pocket knife. Set your guided sharpening system to sharpen at the same angle as your knife’s bevel edge. If you’re not sure what your knife’s bevel angle is, check the owner’s manual or contact the manufacturer. For a professionally-sharp blade, try an angle between 15-17 degrees. For a tougher edge, set the system to a more obtuse angle like 22-25 degrees. [11] X Research source Make sure your guided system will hold the knife in a fixed position where the angle won’t change during the sharpening process."

      "title": "Profile the edge of the blade using the guided system.",
      "content": "Profile the edge of the blade using the guided system. Trace your knife’s blade with a permanent marker and clamp it into the system. Select the lowest-grit stone to sharpen the blade against. Use a back-and-forth motion to slide your blade from heel-to-tip along the stone. [12] X Research source Repeat this process on both sides of the blade. Make sure there’s no trace of the marker left before deciding your blade is sufficiently sharpened."

      "title": "Refine the edge on the next-highest grit level.",
      "content": "Refine the edge on the next-highest grit level. Change the stone to the next-highest grit and re-sharpen the stone until the scratch patterns have disappeared. Repeat this step on both sides and on each level of stone until your blade has a smooth, mirror-like finish. Unclamp the knife from the guided system—it’s ready for immediate use."

      "content": "Hold the honing rod by the handle so that its tip is on the counter. For safety, place the tip on an old tea towel on top of your chopping block or cutting board. [13] X Research source The rod should be held straight up and down so that it is perfectly vertical. The most common type of rod is a steel honing rod , which is also known as sharpening steel. It is a very effective and reliable way to sharpen your knife. Rods can also be made out of ceramic and diamond. Both of these materials are reliable because they are two of the hardest materials in existence. Diamond rods are known to create smoother blades than ceramic ones , but both will sharpen knives very quickly."

      "content": "Determine the angle at which you should hold the blade against the rod. Go to your local knife shop or hardware store and ask them to determine the angle of your knife if you don't feel confident that you have the right angle. Pocket knives should generally be held at a 15 to 20 degree angle. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Switch sides so that you hone both sides of the knife. If your knife is relatively sharp, you should only have to swipe the knife along the rod a couple of times on each side. If your knife is very dull, you will have to swipe the knife several more times. [16] X Research source Keep in mind that honing rods are not really meant for sharpening a blade—their main purpose is to hone the blade, which can have a similar effect that suits most people’s purposes.
