      "content": "Spray the insides, outsides, and insoles with 70% rubbing alcohol . If your shoes are at all damp, let them completely air dry before spraying. Remove the insoles and spray them until they’re saturated, then wipe them down with a clean cloth and let them air dry. Then, spray the insides and outsides of both shoes and use a clean cloth to wipe and rub the alcohol into the shoe material. [1] X Research source Let the shoes air dry completely before replacing the insoles and wearing them. Hardy shoes like canvas or sneakers can be saturated with rubbing alcohol. For more delicate materials like suede, leather, or heels, use a fine mist of alcohol and wipe them very gently. Alternatively, use rubbing alcohol wipes instead of a spray."

[3] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide is a bleaching agent, so do not spray it on the outsides of your shoes unless they’re white (otherwise, you may end up with discolored patches). It may also discolor the insides of your shoes if they’re very dark. Spray and wipe peroxide on the bottoms of your shoes to disinfect and clean them as well."

Let the shoes air dry completely before wearing. [5] X Research source Alternatively, sprinkle the insides of the shoes with baking powder, then spray them with a mix of equal parts vinegar and water.

In a small bowl, mix warm water with a few drops of laundry detergent or liquid dish soap. Then, use a sponge, rag, or old toothbrush to scrub away any smell, dirt, or stains clinging to the insoles. Rinse them off with clean water and lay them near a window or on a towel to air dry. [8] X Research source If your insoles are still smelly after they’ve dried, put them in a plastic bag with some baking soda and leave them overnight. If the insoles still smell bad after a night of baking soda, soak them for 2-3 hours in a mixture of vinegar and water. Then, wash the insoles again with soap and water to remove the scent of the vinegar. If the insoles are leather, do not submerge them completely in water. Scrub them with the least amount of soapy water possible."

Many shoes are washing machine-safe, including running or gym shoes, sneakers, and shoes made of canvas, mesh, and other fabrics. Remove the laces and tie the ends together to prevent tangling, then toss the laces and both shoes in a mesh laundry bag or old pillow case. Wash on a cold, gentle cycle with your regular detergent. Stuff the shoes with newspaper and let them air dry before replacing the laces or insoles. [10] X Research source Cold water protects the adhesive that holds most shoes together from heat damage. If the used shoes are extra smelly, add laundry sanitizer during the rinse cycle to kill odor-causing bacteria (check the product instructions for exact directions). Do not machine wash boots, high heels, or shoes made of leather, suede, plastic, rubber, vinyl, or that have bead or buckle embellishments."
