      "content": "The blue tick means the sender’s identity is verified. Google uses these blue ticks the same way a lot of social media platforms do: it means they’ve confirmed the identity of the organization or person that sent the message. The blue verified checkmark is a great way to prevent phishing, spoofing, and other scams where senders pretend to be someone else (like a bank or social media support account) to trick people into giving them sensitive information."

      "content": "These checks are mostly for businesses rather than individuals. While some public figures or celebrities may be able to get blue checks, Google mostly uses them to identify organizations and companies. For example, emails from a major retailer, bank, hospital, or social media platform might feature a blue check next to the sender’s logo."

If you run a business or other organization and you want to get a blue verified checkmark from Google, there are several steps involved. First, you’ll need to set up a few security features for your organization’s web domain. To do this, you’ll need to: [1] X Research source Get administrator login information for your domain provider. For example, if your business’s domain is hosted by a company like Squarespace or IONOS, you’ll need to sign in at their website to turn on these security features for your domain. Create an SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record for your domain. This will help recipients verify that emails sent from your specified domains and servers really come from your organization. For detailed instructions, check out this page from Google Support . Add an encrypted digital signature to your emails with DKIM. For detailed instructions, check out this guide from Google . Turn on DMARC to catch messages from spoofers pretending to be your organization. DMARC works with SPF and DKIM to help screen out messages that don’t pass those verification checks.
