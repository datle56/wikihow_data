      "title": "Drink lots of fluids before the test.",
      "content": "Drink lots of fluids before the test. Also called flushing, this method remains one of the easiest, cheapest, and most successful ways to get a false negative on a pee test. Pee tests do not measure the amount of drugs in urine; they measure the amount of metabolites in the urine. Drugs are ingested and then come out of the system as metabolites. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Drinking more water will help your body produce metabolites that aren't tainted by drugs. Urinalysis checks for 31 different metabolites caused by marijuana, 4 caused by cocaine , 3 caused by opiates, 1 caused by Phencyclidine, and 5 caused by amphetamines. Be careful not to over-hydrate. Although rare, it is possible to drink too much water and damage your internal organs, enough so to become fatal. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is called water intoxication."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Coffee, diet pills, and certain prescription drugs are also diuretics, but they're not as effective as Midol at ridding your body of the water that contains those telling metabolites. It may sound weird to have Midol if you're a dude, but don't worry, you'll thank Midol after your drug test comes back negative."

      "title": "Try peeing into the cup mid- or end-stream, not immediately.",
      "content": "Try peeing into the cup mid- or end-stream, not immediately. How you pee into the urinalysis cup matters. Try peeing a little bit into the toilet, and then direct your stream into the cup when you're nearing the end of your stream. Pee near the end of the stream is supposed to contain fewer metabolites than pee at the beginning. Try also to pee several times in the morning before taking the drug test. Your pee will contain more metabolites if you haven't already gone to the bathroom before you take the test. Be smart and chug some water first thing when you wake up the day of the test."

      "content": "Try taking an aspirin a couple of hours before the test. One study suggested that taking 4 aspirin 4 to 6 hours before the screening can mess with the test, EMIT. [5] X Research source Don't worry, 4 aspirin in a single serving will leave you fine, albeit a little light-headed."

      "content": "Don't waste your money on commercial products that disguise or clean urine. There's no evidence that these products work. On top of this, they're expensive, and many of the ingredients are simple diuretics, which you can purchase or make for far less cash. It's pretty safe also to assume that drug testing companies are trying just as fast to come up with ways to detect these substances as manufacturers are coming up with ways to invent them. If you can, stay away."

[6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This method takes at least a week, but it's healthier than overloading your system with water, which can flush out important vitamins, nutrients, and electrolytes. To do a healthy flush, you'll need to constantly replace what is being flushed out. Stock up on the following: Multi-vitamins Sports drinks Fresh fruits and veggies Tea (green detox tea Other diuretics (cranberry or apple juice, coffee, etc.)"

Drink roughly 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to flush your body of toxins. Drink the tea and other diuretics throughout the day as well. Do not drink more than 2 gallons (7.6 L) total of fluids per day."

      "content": "Drink cranberry juice or take cranberry supplements. Cranberry is a natural diuretic, meaning it will help your body flush itself of water and sodium, though not at the rate that Midol might. Although there is some doubt about cranberry's effectiveness for regular drug users, it really can't hurt if you use it responsibly and in combination with other methods."

      "title": "Try experimenting with zinc.",
      "content": "Try experimenting with zinc. Many drug users report successfully passing an EMIT test after taking zinc sulfate. The zinc is reputed to bond to the metabolites and guide them into the fecal tract instead of the urinary tract. Take about 250 mg of zinc sulfate the night before your test. Avoid eating too many solids. Then, the morning of your test, take the same dose of zinc sulfates. Do not take any more than this if you choose to use zinc. Over-medicating with zinc can lead to harmful mineral deficiencies and should be avoided."

      "content": "When all else fails, spike it. This is a last resort, but if you can't try any of the above methods, you can try to spike the urinalysis. Bleach, detergent, or blood is rumored to be capable of throwing off the results of the test in order to buy you more time. If you have long fingernails, try hiding a small amount of bleached laundry detergent crystals underneath them. Then, when it comes time to take the test, add the detergent crystals to the pee sample and be sure to mix well. This may buy you enough time to take the test again another time when you're more prepared."
