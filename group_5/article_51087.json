      "content": "Nail polish only Paint your entire nail with a light base color. Popular options include milky-white or light pink colors, like Essie’s Marshmallow or OPI’s Lisbon Wants Moor . While your base layer is still tacky to the touch, add your “blush” color. Try a soft pink shade (like Sally Hansen’s Heart of Stone ) or a dark magenta (like Essie’s Swoon in the Lagoon ). [1] X Research source Dab a circle of the darker nail polish into the center of your nail with a sponge or eyeshadow blush. Continue tapping the polish and diffusing it toward the outside of the nail. To achieve the diffused, gradient effect, use a lighter touch as you move away from the center. Wait 1-2 minutes for the nail polish to set before applying a top coat ."

[2] X Research source Hold your brush perpendicular to your nail and gently tap the blush into the center. If needed, use the brush or your fingers to diffuse the blush toward the edge of your nails.

[3] X Research source Dot your makeup sponge or brush to create a small circle of the darker polish in the center of each nail.

      "content": "Blooming gel polish Apply a light pink or sheer nude polish to your entire nail. Cure this layer with a UV manicure lamp . Paint a layer of transparent blooming gel polish onto the entire nail. Without curing the blooming gel layer, place a dot of pink or plum gel polish into the center of the nail. [5] X Research source Wait 1-2 minutes for the circle of polish to “bloom.” When it blooms, you’ll see the edges of the circle start to spread toward the outside of the nail. You can use a fan brush to help it along. Once you’re satisfied with the look, cure it with the UV lamp. As its name suggests, blooming gel polish helps any layered colors spread and “bloom,” so it’s often used in nail art to achieve marbling or watercolor effects."
