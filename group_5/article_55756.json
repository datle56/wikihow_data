If you give yourself enough time to process and heal, you’re going to be able to trust people again.

If you don’t stay with the person who cheated on you, that’s totally valid—not every relationship can survive infidelity. When you find someone new, you might feel the hangover effects of distrust from your old relationship. Try to remind yourself that your new partner is different from your ex, and be open about your past. Hopefully, your new partner will be able to reassure you so you don’t have any doubts about them."

Serial cheaters, or people who cheat on their partners all the time, might say that they’re sorry, but they don’t actually mean it. If you confront your partner about cheating and they try to brush it off or tell you that it wasn’t a big deal, chances are, they’re going to do it again. On the other hand, if it was an honest mistake that your partner feels really badly about, there’s a high likelihood that you two can work on your issues together. [10] X Research source Just because someone cheated in their past relationships doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to cheat on you. If they can talk about it and admit that it was wrong, they may have grown and matured enough to where they won’t cheat again."
