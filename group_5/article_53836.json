      "content": "Eat avocado every day. For example, you can spread avocado onto a sandwich in place of mayo, add sliced avocado to a salad, incorporate avocado into a wrap, or make guacamole. How much avocado you eat will depend on your calorie goals and preferences. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep in mind that the average avocado has about 322 calories. Half an avocado has 161 calories. You can consume the avocado all at once, or spread it throughout the day. For example, you could have ¼ of an avocado mixed into a smoothie for breakfast and ¼ of an avocado mashed, mixed with salsa, and enjoyed with veggie slices."

      "title": "Use avocado",
      "content": "Use avocado in place of other fats. Avocado can help you to feel full longer because of the fat each fruit contains. Make sure that you replace the fats in your diet with avocado. Do not add avocado as an additional fat source or you may end up consuming too many calories in a day, as a whole avocado has 322 calories. For example, you could replace the sour cream on your baked potato with avocado slices, spread avocado over a slice of toast instead of butter, or replace the cheese on a sandwich with a few slices of avocado."

      "content": "Substitute an equal amount of avocado for butter in baked goods. Avocado works well as a 1 to 1 substitution for butter in baked goods, which can reduce the saturated fat and cholesterol in your meals. Replace all of some of the butter in your recipes with an equal amount of mashed avocado. This is a great way to reduce saturated fat and cholesterol in cookies, muffins, and cakes. You can replace all or some of the butter. If you replace all of the butter in a recipe with avocado, decrease the oven temperature by 25 °F (−4 °C). [4] X Research source"

Using avocado as a base for your dressing is a great way to include more avocado in your diet. Swap an equal amount of avocado for sour cream or mayonnaise when making a salad dressing.

      "content": "Use avocado as a base for pudding when you have a sweet tooth. Pudding recipes often call for whole milk and eggs which contain lots of saturated fat and cholesterol. Instead, use a fork or food processor to mix 1 whole mashed avocado with 0.5 to 1 oz (14 to 28 g) of sugar or honey, 1 to 2 oz (28 to 57 g) of cocoa powder, and 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) of vanilla for a quick and easy chocolate pudding.

Try swapping your pesto or cream sauce for 2 mashed avocados. Mix the avocados in with 1 16 oz (450 g) box of cooked pasta. Add 0.5 oz (14 g) of fresh basil and a salt and pepper to taste. [7] X Research source You can also season your avocado pasta sauce with the juice of 1 lime or lemon, 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and 0.25 oz (7.1 g) of cumin or chili powder for a spicy avocado pasta sauce."

Instead of adding 4 oz (110 g) of mayo to a casserole recipe, use 4 oz (110 g) of mashed avocado."

Cut ¼ to ½ of an avocado into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) chunks and add them to your salad just before you eat it. [9] X Research source Avocado works especially well in Southwest salads. Top lettuce with ½ a cup of black beans, 4 oz (110 g) of salsa, 4 oz (110 g) of corn, and 4 oz (110 g) of avocado chunks. Add hot sauce to taste and enjoy!"
