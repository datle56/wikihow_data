      "title": "Find a sturdy plastic cap.",
      "content": "Find a sturdy plastic cap. The cap needs to be able to support the weight and rigidity of your iPhone, so you should avoid caps with a lot of give that bend significantly. Caps from aerosol cans work well."

      "title": "Cut the cap vertically twice.",
      "content": "Cut the cap vertically twice. Make the cuts approximately 5mm apart down the sides of the cap. Cutting about halfway down seems to work well. The width of your cut may differ depending on the size of your phone. If your iPhone is an older model (pre-iPhone 5), make your cuts closer to 10mm apart."

    {
      "title": "Rotate the cap 180 degrees.",
      "content": "Rotate the cap 180 degrees. You should now be holding the cap with the cuts you just made on its opposite side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the cap again.",
      "content": "Cut the cap again. It will be the same type of incisions you made in Step 2. Try to keep all 4 cuts equal distances apart. If one side is cut more narrowly than another, your phone may rock while sitting in the tripod or slip out of its hold."

      "title": "Push the 2 flaps away from each other.",
      "content": "Push the 2 flaps away from each other. This is done by pulling the flaps downward as far as they will go. It will create a permanent crease in the plastic. Be careful not to break the flaps off of the cap - you'll be using them to help stabilize your phone."

    {
      "title": "Release the flaps from your grip.",
      "content": "Release the flaps from your grip. Doing so will make them return to near horizontal position which provides more stability for your phone. If you want the option of being able to angle your camera to shoot up or down, repeat the steps above with 30 degree angled cuts."
