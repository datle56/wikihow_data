Segments can be thought of as containers that group like kinds of data. These data are contained in a segment's fields. The three-character codes in blue are the segment labels for this message. Each segment contains fields that are separated with the light-blue ‘|’ character. Fields and segments can be repeating. Repeating fields are separated with the red ‘~’ character. Components are the data points within fields, and they are separated with the green ‘^’ character. Sub-components are demarcated with the light-purple ‘&’ separator. These special characters are called control characters. The table contains the standard control characters used in HL7."

[3] X Research source The message type determines which segments a message contains as well as which ones are optional and which are repeatable. This syntax is dictated by the HL7 version used in creating the message. Segments are re-usable in different message types. The segments in the example message are listed in the table:"

The three-character codes used at the start of each segment serve as labels. Fields are notated by extending the segment to include the index number of the field. For example, the first field in the message header would be MSH-1, the second field would be MSH-2, etc. [4] X Research source MSH, the message header, is the first segment in every HL7 message and contains message metadata. The second segment in every message is the EVN segment. This contains the event the message triggers. In this example, that event is the scheduling of an inpatient surgery."

Fields are notated by extending segment notation with a decimal point followed by the index number of the field. The street address component, for example, is part of the address field and it can be indexed with PID-11.1. PID is the patient identification segment. PID-11.1 is the street address component of the address field (PID-11). Components can be further broken down into subcomponents using the & character as a separator."

The data dictionary for all of the elements contained in a message can be located by referencing the standard for the version of HL7 used to create the message. [5] X Research source The version number can be found in the MSH-12 field of any message header. Appendix A of the standard contains a data dictionary for all of the elements in a message. It is available in both PDF and XLS file formats. The data dictionary for HL7 v2.6 is a typical example."
