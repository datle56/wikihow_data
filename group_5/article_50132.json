      "content": "Identify your intentions for accessing the Akashic records. Before you attempt to access the Akashic records, think about why you want to do it. What do you want to know, and how might this knowledge help you? Clarify this for yourself before you begin. Not knowing what you want to find out can result in a disorganized search, making it difficult to access helpful information. [1] X Research source Possible intentions might include understanding why you have a short temper so you can learn to control it better, gaining clarity on your goals to make an important career decision, or getting in tune with your values to seek like-minded people to cultivate relationships with."

      "content": "Write down specific questions about your past lives. Make a list of questions or topics of interest that may help you to get the information you seek. Try to make your questions as specific as possible to aid you in your search. [2] X Research source For example, you might ask, “What professions did I have in my past lives?” or “Where did I live in my past lives?” or “Have I ever experienced a tragedy in a past life that is affecting my current life?”"

      "title": "Or, ask questions that can help you make a decision in your current life.",
      "content": "Or, ask questions that can help you make a decision in your current life. Express a problem you’ve been having, then state or ask for the information you need to solve it. This will help narrow your search and make any information you find more relevant to your current experience. [3] X Research source Try saying something like, “I’m considering moving to a different city, but I change my mind a lot. Is there anything in my past that could help me to understand if this is the best choice for me?” Or you might say, “Lately, I’ve been struggling to trust my significant other. I feel this may be based on something more than I am aware of in my present life. If I am correct, please provide me with the information on when and how this problem originated.”"

      "content": "Plan to ask one question at a time to focus on them more. This approach might make it easier to clarify an issue, similar to focusing on one aspect of your life at a time during a tarot card or palm reading. Focus on your relationships, career, health, and other personal interests one at a time. [4] X Research source For example, you might start by asking, “Is my relationship going to result in marriage, or are we just too different for things to work out?” Or you might ask, “Will I get the promotion I have been working so hard to get, or will I have to wait?”"

      "content": "Sit or lie down in a comfortable, quiet place. You may attempt to access your Akashic records anywhere, but it helps if you're somewhere you won’t be interrupted like your bedroom with the door closed. Try this early in the morning, at night, or when no one else is at home, and use pillows and blankets to make yourself as comfy as possible. [6] X Research source It may help to light a candle or incense to help you ease into relaxation. Smudging is another great way to relax, plus, sage cleanses the energy around you!"

Request permission by asking aloud or silently, “I am seeking information about my past lives. May I please access the Akashic records to find what I seek?” After you ask this question, continue to breathe deeply and clear your mind—you’re almost there! You may hear, feel, or see a response in your mind’s eye. Remain patient even if you get no response—this might just mean that you need to continue meditating and ask again."

      "content": "Wait for information to come into your consciousness. Now that you've put your question into the universe and requested access to the Akashic records, the only thing left to do is wait. Continue to breathe and meditate and remain receptive to any information that floats into your consciousness as this may be coming from your Akashic record. [10] X Research source Remember that the information you receive can take on different forms. You may hear, see, taste, feel, or even smell something meant to convey a special message just for you. For example, if you’ve asked about your profession in a previous life, you might see a hammer in your mind’s eye, which could indicate that you were a carpenter or blacksmith. Or, you might experience a sweet taste, which could indicate that you were a baker."

Sometimes when you’re accessing the Akashic records, you might see or feel the presence of another being or soul nearby, such as your spirit animal. [11] X Research source If this happens, introduce yourself and state your question again. The being may be a guardian or keeper of the records who can help you find the information you seek or another soul you've known in a past life! Either way, you may gain valuable information by taking a moment to introduce yourself and ask for help. Try saying something like, “Hello, my name is Jonah Johnson, and I am looking for information about any phobias I had in my past lives.”"

You may also stand up or stay seated for a while if you prefer."
