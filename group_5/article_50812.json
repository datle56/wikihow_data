Interpreted languages like BASIC aren't very good for true computer programming, but if all you want to do is write a simple computer game, it's fine. HTML or CSS are for web pages, and it's a good idea to know them, but they won't be especially useful for really programming your computer. It is recommended that you learn the scripting language of your prompt (e.g. Bash) as that will bring power and simplicity for a novice programmer and admin. However, you may learn any language you like."

Whatever your methods, be sure to be continuously learning more about computers."

Learn how many bytes are in a kilobyte (KB), megabyte (MB), gigabyte (GB) and so on. While most people think that there are 1024 megabytes in a gigabyte, there actually aren't. There are exactly 1000 megabytes in a gigabyte. The things that most people are speaking about are gigabytes and megabytes. Do some research on the topic of data storage. Once you have that down, get comfortable with binary . From there, learn to use octal and hexadecimal , and how to convert from one base to another. When you understand why programmers always get Christmas and Halloween mixed up, you're well on your way to becoming a true geek."
