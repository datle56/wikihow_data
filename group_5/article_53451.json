      "content": "Try a water or juice fast first to build up to a dry fast. It may shock your system if you try to start immediately with a dry fast. A water fast allows you to drink water throughout the day, while a juice fast lets you drink fruit and vegetable juice. Pick 1 day to commit to either a juice or water fast to see how your body handles it, followed by a day where you eat normally. You can alternate days where you eat normally with fast days. After doing a 4-5 water or juice fasts, then you can start a dry fast if you feel comfortable.

      "title": "Choose a soft dry fast if it's your first time.",
      "content": "Choose a soft dry fast if it's your first time. A soft dry fast allows you to come in contact with water, like taking a shower, washing your hands, and brushing your teeth. Start with a soft dry fast if you've never done any other dry fasts before. This way, you're less likely to get dehydrated since your skin absorbs the moisture. If you've done soft dry fasts before, you can attempt a hard dry fast where you don't allow any water in or on you. Only do a hard dry fast if you feel comfortable with it."

      "title": "Eat a meal with omega 3 fatty acids and salt before you start.",
      "content": "Eat a meal with omega 3 fatty acids and salt before you start. Choose foods that have healthy omega 3 fats, such as mackerel, salmon, and avocados. These foods break down slowly so you don't feel as hungry when you start fasting. Add an extra 1 tsp (5 g) of salt to the last meal before your fast to help your body retain vitamins and minerals that promote healthy functions. Otherwise, your body may naturally get rid of them while you're fasting. [2] X Research source You may also try a fish oil supplement right before you start your fast so your body can break it down as you start."

      "title": "Stop eating and drinking for 16-24 hours.",
      "content": "Stop eating and drinking for 16-24 hours. Dry fasting can take a toll on your body since it's not getting any energy from food or drinks. If you want to do a dry fast, only try it for a day at a time with at least 2 regular eating days after. This helps you set an easily achievable goal and protects your body from getting too dehydrated. While others have dry fasted for 3 days or more, avoid doing any fast longer than 24 hours since it could lead to dehydration."

      "content": "Rest if you're feeling tired. It's natural for your body to feel tired during a dry fast, so sleep to pass the time. Sleeping can help curb any cravings you have and retain your energy. When you get out of bed, try doing some light stretches and walking around your home to wake up more. Take periodic naps throughout the day if you feel too exhausted. [4] X Research source"

If you notice a loss of balance or you're getting disoriented doing simple tasks, stop the dry fast and immediately drink water to rehydrate.

      "content": "Drink 1 US pt (470 ml) of water immediately after your fast. As soon as you're finished with your fast, drink 1 US pt (470 ml) of water slowly. Take small sips from your glass so you don't overwhelm your system. Swish it around your mouth to coat it completely before swallowing.

      "title": "Have 1 US pt (470 ml) of water every hour after you break the fast.",
      "content": "Have 1 US pt (470 ml) of water every hour after you break the fast. Slowly reintroduce water back into your diet to rehydrate over time and prevent bloating. Take small sips and savor the water as you drink it. Continue having 1 US pt (470 ml) of water throughout the first few hours after your fast. As you drink, you'll start to feel more energetic again.

      "content": "Try small amounts of healthy food for the first day after your fast. Choose dried fruits, such as raisins, figs, and apricots, for a light snack. Make sure you have the portion size listed on the packaging so you don't overeat when your fast is finished. Continue eating only light snacks, such as unsalted nuts or a piece of fruit, for the rest of the day.

      "content": "Avoid foods high in carbs and sodium for at least 2 days. Sodium and carbs can retain water and can reverse the weight loss from your dry fast quickly. Don't eat any cured meats, soups, sweets, or grains. Pick foods that are low in sodium, carbs, and fat for your first few meals. Only use light seasoning or no seasoning at all once you start eating normally. [8] X Research source For example, a plain cooked chicken breast with green vegetables is a great meal to have after your fast."
