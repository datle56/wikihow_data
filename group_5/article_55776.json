Sunnah prayers are optional but highly recommended because the Holy Prophet of Islam offered them. Nafl prayers are completely optional, but those who offer them benefit from Allah’s favor. [1] X Research source Fajr: 2 Rakat Sunnah, then 2 Rakat Fardh. Dhuhr: 4 Rakat Sunnah, then 4 Rakat Fardh, then 2 Rakat Sunnah, then 2 Rakat Nafl (optional). Asr: 4 Rakat Sunnah, then 4 Rakat Fardh. Maghrib: 3 Rakat Fardh, then 2 Rakat Sunnah, then 2 Rakat Nafl (optional). Isha: 4 Rakat Sunnah, then 4 Rakat Fardh, then 2 Rakat Sunnah, then 2 Rakat Nafl (optional), then 3 Rakat Witr Wajib (obligatory, second to Fardh), then 2 Rakat Nafl (optional)."
