You can go to a thrift store and buy bags of candles that are very cheap. You could also talk to friends that you have and see about getting their old candles. Some churches give away old candles."

You can also try to fill a pot with water and then put an old can which you will later fill with wax into it. This method will most likely not get the pot as full of wax."

Take an old pencil or something similar that is round and long, even a straw and place it over the top of your container. Place your wick in the middle of the container so that it drapes over the pencil. Optionally use a piece of tape to hold the wick to the pencil."
