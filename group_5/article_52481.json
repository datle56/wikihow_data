[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To figure out how many calories there are in the fat content, simply multiple the fat grams by nine. [3] X Research source For example, if there are ten grams of fat, you would multiple ten grams of fat by nine calories, for a total of 90 calories. This is how many calories there are in the fat grams."

To figure out how many total calories there are in the fat content of a product, multiply the original number you received before, by the amount of servings there are on the label.

Multiply the number of carbohydrates by four to figure out how many calories there are. [6] X Research source For example, if a product had nine grams of carbohydrates, you would use the equation (9 x 4) to get a total of 36 calories. You would use four as your multiplier because there are four calories in every one gram of carbohydrate."

The human body can derive energy (employ calories) from three main macro-nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can't weigh food and convert the grams into calories. You have to know how many calories there are in a specific type of macro-nutrient gram to calculate the total calories in it."
