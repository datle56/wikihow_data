      "title": "Visit the Jeopardy ticket website on the first day of the month.",
      "content": "Visit the Jeopardy ticket website on the first day of the month. Jeopardy releases its new tickets on the first of every month. Usually, these tickets are for a few days during the current month and the following month when taping takes place. You normally can't book tickets any further in advance. These tickets get claimed very quickly, so don’t delay. Check first thing in the morning on the first of the month. Remember that Jeopardy tapes in Los Angeles, so you may have to travel to attend the taping. You're responsible for making your own travel plans if you get tickets."

      "title": "Look for your desired date on the calendar page.",
      "content": "Look for your desired date on the calendar page. On the tickets page, a calendar displays that shows the taping dates. Usually, the show tapes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in a morning and afternoon session. Find your desired dates to see if they’re available. If there are no tickets available, click on the arrow next to the month to scroll to the next month. There may be available dates during the following month. Jeopardy usually films on 4 days during the month. The show releases tickets 1 month before filming, so this is as far in advance as you can book your tickets."

      "title": "Click on a purple date to see available tickets.",
      "content": "Click on a purple date to see available tickets. Available dates are in purple and unavailable dates are in gray. If there is a purple circle on the date you’d like, click on it to see the options. Pick between a morning or afternoon session. There may only be one session left on the date you choose. If that time slot doesn’t work for you, try a different day."

    {
      "title": "Fill out your personal information when the website prompts you to.",
      "content": "Fill out your personal information when the website prompts you to. If you’ve landed on a date and time when tickets are available, you’ll advance to an information page. The page asks your name, address, phone number, email, and number of people in your party. Fill out all of this information accurately to receive your tickets. Note that children under 8 are not allowed in the Jeopardy studio. If you’re going in a group, don’t bring young children with you. Use your normal phone number when you reserve your tickets. Before the taping, you’ll have to call to confirm your tickets and use the same phone number that you used to reserve them."

    {
      "title": "Save and print out your email confirmation.",
      "content": "Save and print out your email confirmation. Once you’ve filled out the information, wait for your email confirmation to arrive. When it does, your tickets are officially reserved. Jeopardy suggests that you save or print this email as proof of your confirmation. Do both to be safe. Screenshot the email as well, just to have an extra confirmation that you received it."

      "title": "Avoid getting your tickets from anywhere except the official Jeopardy site.",
      "content": "Avoid getting your tickets from anywhere except the official Jeopardy site. There are other websites out there claiming to offer Jeopardy tickets. Most of these are scams. Do not get your tickets from anywhere except the official Jeopardy site. This is the only website that gives out Jeopardy tickets. Jeopardy tickets are always free. If you come across someone offering to sell you tickets, these are not legitimate. On occasions that Jeopardy is taping outside of its main studio in Los Angeles, Jeopardy sometimes partners with Ticketmaster to distribute tickets. However, these are also free. Never pay for Jeopardy tickets."

      "title": "Call to confirm your tickets 5-7 days before the taping.",
      "content": "Call to confirm your tickets 5-7 days before the taping. Jeopardy requires guests to call ahead and confirm their tickets a week before the taping. Call 818-773-3465 and leave your first and last name and phone number to confirm your tickets. Remember to give the same phone number that you gave when you reserved the tickets. If you leave a different number, the reservation may not go through. If you don’t confirm your tickets at least 5 days before the taping, your reservation may be cancelled."

    {
      "title": "Plan for a 4-hour visit.",
      "content": "Plan for a 4-hour visit. Live tapings record multiple shows at the same time. The morning session shoots 3 shows and the afternoon session shoots 2. Including getting there early, waiting in line, and waiting to leave, the whole thing will take around 4 hours. Keep this in mind when you’re making other plans around the taping. Plan your day around whether you're attending the morning or afternoon session. The afternoon session is usually shorter because they only tape 2 shows instead of 3. If you’re pressed for time, consider booking the afternoon session instead."

    {
      "title": "Arrive at least 45 minutes before the taping time.",
      "content": "Arrive at least 45 minutes before the taping time. If you’re late, you may not be allowed into the taping. Plan ahead and get there early so you don’t miss the show. The Jeopardy studio is at 4080 Overland Ave, Culver City, CA 90232. Parking at the Overland Gate is free. When you confirm your tickets, producers may recommend a particular time for you to arrive. Follow their instructions if they tell you a particular time."

      "title": "Bring an official government-issued ID with you to the taping.",
      "content": "Bring an official government-issued ID with you to the taping. Security will check your ID to make sure you’re the person who reserved the tickets. Bring your driver's license, passport, or similar government ID to confirm your identity. Also be prepared to walk though a metal detector and have your bags checked at the door. This is a normal part of the security process. Speed this along by minimizing the number of bags and items you bring with you. Follow all of the security’s directions to avoid being ejected from the studio."

    {
      "title": "Turn off your cell phones and cameras before the show starts taping.",
      "content": "Turn off your cell phones and cameras before the show starts taping. For security reasons and to keep the show winners a secret until the show airs, phone or camera use is prohibited inside the studio. Turn off your phones and leave you cameras in a bag. Don’t take them out while the show tapes. Remember that phones must be completely off, not just silenced. If you’re caught taking pictures or video inside the studio, you may be ejected."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enjoy the show.",
      "content": "Enjoy the show. Now that you’ve gone through all the security procedures, watch the taping! Sit back, relax, and enjoy the next few hours of Jeopardy. Remember to be quiet unless you're told to cheer or get excited. The cameras can pick up even faint sounds. As much fun as it is in your home, don't shout out the answer to a clue. Doing so will result in you being escorted from the studio."
