      "content": "Familiarize yourself with what current is. Current is the flow of electrically charged carriers like electrons or the flow of charge per unit of time. But what is a charge and what is an electron? An electron is a negatively charged particle. A charge is a property of matter that is used to classify whether a thing is positive or negatively charged. Like magnets, alike charges repel and opposites attract. [1] X Research source We can illustrate this by using water. Water is composed of the molecule, H2O – which stands for 2 atoms of Hydrogen and 1 atom of Oxygen bonded together. We know that the oxygen atom and hydrogen atoms make up the molecule, H2O. A flowing body of water is composed of millions and millions of this molecule. We can compare the flowing body of water to the current; the molecule to electron; and the charge to the atoms."

      "content": "Understand what voltage refers to. Voltage is the “force” that drives the current to flow. To best illustrate voltage; we will use the battery as an example. Inside the battery is a series of chemical based reactions which create a buildup of electrons in the positive terminal of the battery. [2] X Research source If we now connect a medium (eg a wire) from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the battery, the electron buildup will now move to get away from each other because as we said, alike charges repel. In addition, because of the law of conservation of charge, which states that the net charge of an isolated system should remain constant, the electrons will try to balance the charges by going from the higher concentration of electrons to the lower concentration of electrons or positive terminal to the negative terminal, respectively. This movement causes a potential difference in each of the terminals which we can now call voltage."

      "title": "Know what resistance is.",
      "content": "Know what resistance is. Resistance, on the other hand, is the opposition of certain elements to flow of charge. [3] X Research source Resistors are elements with significant resistance. They are placed in certain parts of a circuit to regulate the flow of charge or electrons. If there are no resistors, the electrons are not regulated, the equipment may receive too much charge and it will be damaged or cause a fire due to overcharging."

      "content": "Find the total resistance of the circuit. Imagine a straw you are drinking from. Pinch it several times. What do you notice? The water flowing will be lessened. Those pinches are the resistors. They block the water which is the current. Since the pinches are in a straight line, they are in series. Drawing from this example, the total resistance of resistors in a series is: [4] X Research source R(total) = R1 + R2 + R3."

      "title": "Identify the total voltage of the resistor.",
      "content": "Identify the total voltage of the resistor. Most of the time, the total voltage is readily given, but in cases where individual voltages are given, we can use the equation: [5] X Research source V(total) = V1 + V2 + V3. But why is this so? Using the straw analogy again, after pinching the straw, what do you expect? You need more effort to get water through the straw. The total effort you are delivering is brought about by the individual force the individual pinches need. The “force” you need is the voltage, because it drives the flow of water or the current. Therefore it is only logical that the total voltage is brought about by adding up the individual voltages across each resistor."

      "title": "Calculate the total current of the system.",
      "content": "Calculate the total current of the system. Using the straw analysis again, even in the presence of pinches, did the amount of water you get change? No. Although the speed at which you are getting the water changes, the amount of water you can drink is fixed. And if you look closer at the amount of water entering and leaving, the pinches are the same because of the fixed speed the water is flowing, therefore, we can say that: [6] X Research source I1 = I2 = I3 = I(total)"

Take for an example a pipe split into two paths with different diameters. For the water to flow into both of the pipes, do you need to use unequal forces in each of the pipes? No. You just need enough force for the water to flow. Therefore, using the analogy that the water is the current and the force is the voltage, we can say that: [11] X Research source V(total) = V1 + V2 + V3 . [12] X Research source"

Do you put just one blockage on each path or do you put multiple blockages arranged consecutively to control the water flow? You would need to do the latter. For resistances, this analogy is the same. Resistors connected in series regulate current far better than those arranged in a parallel way. The equation for the total resistance in a parallel circuit is: [13] X Research source 1/R(total) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) ."

Since there are multiple paths where charges can flow, it can be said that to be split. The pathways do not necessarily receive equal amounts of charge. It is dependent on the resistances and the materials the elements have in each path. Therefore, the equation of the total current is just the summation of all the currents in all of the paths: [14] X Research source I(total) = I1 + I2 + I3. Of course, we can't use this yet because we do not have the individual currents. In this case Ohm's Law can also be used."
