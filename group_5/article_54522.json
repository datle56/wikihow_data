      "content": "Purchase spackling paste and a small putty knife if repairing a very small hole. Very small holes are usually caused by nails or screws and can be repaired easily and quickly with spackle. There are a variety of spackling pastes for sale. It's usually a good idea to get a lightweight spackling paste that uses the new primer technology, so that a crack does not develop at the seam between the wall and the patch. Small cracks between molding and trim can be filled with spackling paste but it is probably easier to use paintable caulk, which is available at any home improvement store. Simply run a bead of caulk along for crack and smooth with a wet finger."

Since you may only need a piece of sheetrock that is a few feet square, see if you or a friend has a piece of it lying around, instead of buying a whole sheet. However, most home improvement stores also sell smaller pieces of sheetrock. Make sure that the sheetrock is the same thickness as the sheetrock on the wall you are repairing. Residential walls are typically 1/2\" and ceilings are 5/8\". Commercial walls and ceilings are always 5/8\".
