      "content": "This is a fast way to come up with multiple ideas to choose from. Type “villain name generator” into a search engine and click on one of the search results. Fill in the required fields to give the generator some information to use, then click the button at the bottom of the screen to generate a list of villain names. [1] X Research source There are many different name generator tools online, but they all work pretty much the same. You don’t have to fill out all the fields to generate names. However, you can add things like adjectives to describe your villain, what animal they are most like, and what their nationality is to get more specific suggestions. For example, if you describe your villain as cold, bat-like, and British, you might get a name suggestion like Tyndareus Hansen, AKA Cold-Bat."

      "content": "This can tell exactly who your villain is without being obvious. Come up with words or phrases that describe your villain in English or whatever your native language is. Then, look up the translations for these words or phrases. Feel free to mash multiple words together to name your villain! [2] X Research source For instance, in The Hobbit, the name of the evil dragon “Smaug” comes from an old Germanic verb that means to “creep” or “crawl.” If your villain is undead, then the words “grave” or “tomb” might come to mind when you think of them. You could name them something like “Sepulcrum,” which is Latin for tomb or burial place, or something like “Tom Grab.” “Grab” is German for “grave.”"

      "content": "Many of the best villains have names that sound like other words. Come up with a list of words that evoke villainy, such as “bad,” “evil,” “dark,” and “malevolent.” Now, try to brainstorm some names that sound enough like those words to bring them to mind and make it obvious that the character is a villain. [3] X Research source For example, the “darth” in Darth Vader brings to mind the word “dark.” If you want people to think of the word malevolent when they hear your character’s name, you could call them something like “Maldred.” Or, name them something like “Malvil” to combine “malevolent” and “evil” into one name."

      "title": "Naming a villain after a dangerous animal or monster shows they’re bad.",
      "content": "Naming a villain after a dangerous animal or monster shows they’re bad. One way to do this is to give your character a person’s first name, followed by something like “the snake” or “the dragon.” Another idea is to use the word for a monster or a dangerous animal from another language in the name, such as the Latin “draco” for “dragon.” [4] X Research source You can see this done in the Harry Potter series with the semi-villain “Draco Malfoy,” who also happens to have the Latin word “mal” for “bad” or “evil” in his last name. For example, you might name your character something like “Frederick the Snake” or “Fred Serpente.” “Serpente” is Italian for “snake.”"

      "title": "A nickname can help show what your villain is all about.",
      "content": "A nickname can help show what your villain is all about. Choose a nickname that describes the type of villainy your character does, something evil that they’re known for doing, or a power or skill they have. Keep it simple and straight to the point. [5] X Research source For example, if your villain has magical powers of fire, you could call them something like “Inferno.” Or, if they have powers of ice, you could call them something like “Icepick” or “Frost Face.” If your villain is a hitman known for their sharpshooting skills, call them something like “Bullseye” or “Headshot.”"

      "content": "Villains can either be intimidating or unimposing. Choose a simple, understated name like “Brad” if you don’t want your villain’s evilness to be perceived right away. If you want your villain to be more obvious, pick something foreboding like “The Lord of Darkness.” [6] X Research source For example, in Harry Potter, it’s pretty obvious that “He Who Must Not Be Named” is a really bad guy. On the other hand, his former identity of “Tom Riddle” is not immediately known to be a villain."

      "content": "This ensures that your villain’s name is believable. For instance, don’t name your villain “Bob” if your work is set in ancient Rome. Pick a villainous name that makes sense for the time period and setting of your work. [7] X Research source For example, if your villain lives in Colonial-era New England, a name like “Malcolm Smith” is perfectly acceptable. If your villain is an evil Roman general living around 400 A.D., name them something like “Augustus Malimus.”"

      "content": "This helps your villain’s name roll off the tongue. Give them at least two names that start with the same letter and/or sound. Say the names out loud to make sure they are clear and sound good together. [8] X Research source For example, name your villain something like “Samuel Snakeson” or “Kyle Killton.”"

      "content": "Hey, at the end of the day, a name is just a name. Your villain can be called anything you want! Choose a regular name that makes sense for the setting and time period of your work, or mash up several names into one to come up with something unique. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re writing a noir detective novel set in New York in the 1920s, your villain could be of Irish descent and be called something normal like “Conor O’Regan.” A mashup of names could be something like “Johvid,” a combination of “John” and “David.”"

      "content": "This helps avoid embarrassing mistakes before your work is published. For example, if your villain is Japanese and you give them what you think is a Japanese last name, look it up to make sure it’s not actually from another Asian country. Or, if you think part of your villain’s name means “snake” in German, look it up to be sure before you go any further. [10] X Research source For example, you might think “Kwon” sounds Japanese, but it’s actually Korean. The word “schlange” is German for snake, but it could be easy to confuse with “schlang,” which means “noosed” or “looped.”"
