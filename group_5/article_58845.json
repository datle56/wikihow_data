      "content": "Choose your dominant, or active, hand to read palms. When you start your reading, check the hand you use most often since it's considered your active hand . Your non-dominant hand is your passive hand, and it is usually not examined since the lines may not be as prominent during the reading. Hold your hand out in front of you with your palm is face-up so you can easily read the lines. Compare your active and passive hands to see if there are any differences.
