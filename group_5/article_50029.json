The man responds by bringing a friend of his own to try to pair with her friend, sometimes hoping to better his chances of sex after the date. [1] X Research source “She’s bringing a friend to the bar, wanna make it a 2 man?” “Yeah, he 2-manned the date and brought his buddy. My friend and I weren’t feeling it, so we bounced.”"

      "content": "Use “2 Man” to let your date know you’re bringing a friend. It’s only polite to give your date a heads-up if you’re bringing company. Let them know ahead of time, and ask them how they feel about it or if that’d make them uncomfortable. Don’t do anything to make your date uneasy, like show up with a group of friends. “Hey, you mind if we 2-manned this movie tonight?” “Since you’re bringing a friend, I was hoping to make this a 2-man to even things out.” “I’m bringing my friend, just for safety–no offense! You can bring someone to make this a 2-man if you want.”"

      "content": "Use “2 Man” to suggest the possibility of a hookup. It’s sometimes understood that a 2 man isn’t just a double date—either the men or the women (or both) are looking for a hookup. Drop the term into your conversation to make your intentions clear. “Is this a 2-man situation? My friend is free.” “Are you gonna link with Amy? Does she have a friend for a 2-man?” “Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a 2-man. We’re just hanging out.”"

      "content": "Let your friend know the date is a 2-man scenario. Bringing a friend along on a date is a great way to watch out for each other or avoid awkward or uncomfortable situations. Tell your friend that this is a double date, so they know what they’re getting into. Also, let a third party know where you are, just to be safe. “Of course, he wants a 2-man, he’s hoping it’s more than a date. We’ll play it by ear.” “Amy and I are going on this 2-man, expect me to be home by 11!”"

Outside of slang usage, “two-man” is often used to refer to situations that involve 2 people (regardless of gender), such as a collaboration, a sport, or a physical limitation.
