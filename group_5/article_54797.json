In the second row to the left, there will be two green rocks that you can lift using your mitts. Lift the bottom rock, and a staircase is revealed! When you go down the staircase, there will be 10 pots. Each pot has a blue rupee underneath. This means that every time you come back, you can get 50 rupees. Doing this 20 times will completely fill your rupee pouch."

      "content": "Get rupees from the fish in the Great Swamp. To do this, go to the southern stone entrance head in the Great Swamp. Enter it. Keep going forward until you see two levers and a bubble. Pull the right lever; did you see the dam open up? Go outside and there will be a single solitary fish flopping around in a shallow puddle. Kill enemies around you so they won't interfere and grab the fish. Now go up one screen until you see deep water. Stand off to the right side of it, turn to your left, and toss the fish in. The fish will reward you with rupees. You can also sell the fish to the bottle salesman, but all you get is a bomb or two and about 5 rupees. Besides, it's very hard to carry a fish all the way to Kakariko Village while avoiding enemies."
