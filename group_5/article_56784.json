      "content": "Install an anti-spyware program on your computers and/or network. Spyware programs install themselves onto computers to gather personal information. Anti-spyware programs can stop these harmful programs from corrupting or filling up your computer. Some computer labs choose to download a spyware program purposefully onto their lab computers. These programs are sometimes called \"keyloggers,\" and they can gather data about how the lab computers are being used for the system administrators. Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs are especially important for Windows operating systems. Schedule scans on both programs every week. Apple computers have been less susceptible to viruses in the past; however, they are increasingly under threat."

      "title": "Clean your computer lab regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your computer lab regularly. The following are effective ways to clean a computer lab: Dust computer screens using a thin, soft microfiber cloth. Dedicate 1 cloth to be used only on the screens. If dirt and debris from other surfaces gets caught in the cloth, it can scratch the computer screen. Vacuum the floor every day, if possible, so dirt and debris is less likely to gather around the computers. Dust all surfaces of the computer. If the fans in the Central Processing Unit (CPU) fill with dust, the computer can overheat. Use a thicker microfiber cloth to pull the dust from the surface. Some types of microfiber cloth have been shown to attract and trap dust. Use compressed air to clean out keyboards. You may also choose to use a disinfectant sprayed on a lint-free cloth on the keyboard and mouses, for sanitary purposes."
