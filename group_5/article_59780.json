After all, Spotify uses these two terms interchangeably. If you really need to know if a certain person likes or follows your playlist, there are a few things you can try: Visit your friend's Spotify profile. If they liked or followed your playlist, it will appear among their list of public playlists. Alternatively, you can ask your friend directly."
