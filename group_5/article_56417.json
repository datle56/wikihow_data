Start by looping the yarn around your finger twice and then pull the back loop through the front loop to make a slipknot. [1] X Research source Then, slip the slipknot onto the needle in your non-dominant hand. Loop the yarn around the needle and pull new yarn through it make more cast on stitches. If you are following a pattern, then cast on the number of stitches that the pattern specifies. If you just want to practice the knit stitch, then cast on 10 stitches."

      "content": "Push the tip of the right needle into the first loop on the left needle. Place the needles so that the right needle crosses behind the left needle. Then, insert the tip of your right needle into the back of the first stitch on the left needle. When working the knit stitch, it is important to always go in through the back of the stitch."

If you are left handed, then you will loop the yarn around clockwise."

[4] X Research source Keep the yarn taut after each stitch to keep the loops close to the needle but not so tight that you can't slide the needle into the loops. Be careful as you slid off the cast on stitch. Make sure that only the stitch that you knit into comes off."

      "content": "Show off your work. Once you're skilled at knitting the knit stitch, you will find it becomes second nature and you'll be using it to make garments, accessories and much more. Practice the knit stitch until you feel comfortable using it. If you want to determine the number of stitches to cast on, make a one-inch square practice piece. The number of stitches depends on the size of the yarn. It also depends on the tension, or how tight or loose the stitches are when you knit."
