      "title": "The disposal blades are clogged or jammed.",
      "content": "The disposal blades are clogged or jammed. Humming is the most common sign of a jammed garbage disposal. Your disposal uses impeller arms attached to a flywheel and a shredder ring—when hard objects get caught in the impeller or between the flywheel and the shredder ring, it can cause your disposal to become jammed. [1] X Research source Diagnosing the Issue: Use a flashlight to peek down into the disposal. If there are any large objects caught in the blades, a clog is probably your issue. The Fix: Unjam your garbage disposal , then reset it by pushing the red button underneath the disposal."

      "title": "The disposal needs to be reset.",
      "content": "The disposal needs to be reset. If your disposal is overloaded or overheated, or if you’ve unclogged the disposal and it still isn’t working, its electrical components probably need to be reset. If you have to repeatedly reset the garbage disposal to get it to work, it’s best to call a professional to service or replace it. [2] X Research source Diagnosing the Issue: Shine a flashlight into the disposal and look for a clog, or consider if you’ve been running the disposal for an extended time. The Fix: Press the red button on the bottom of your disposal, then turn on the water and the disposal. If it still doesn’t work, you may have to call a professional to replace it ."

      "title": "The breaker to the disposal has tripped.",
      "content": "The breaker to the disposal has tripped. If your garbage disposal is connected to the same circuit as something else that’s operating (such as a dishwasher or toaster), it can cause your breaker to trip and shut off the power to the blades. [3] X Research source Some residual power may still run to disposal, causing the machine to hum. Diagnosing the Issue: Open the electrical breaker box inside your home and check to see if the circuit that’s connected to your kitchen or to the disposal is flipped off. The Fix: Flip the circuit back to the same position as the others. To prevent this issue from happening again, try using the disposal only when no other appliance is running, or hire an electrician to run additional circuits to your outlets to avoid overloading your breakers."

    {
      "title": "The disposal has overheated or overloaded.",
      "content": "The disposal has overheated or overloaded. If your disposal is used constantly or if a clog prevents it from running smoothly, it can cause the motor to become overheated. When that happens, the reset button on the bottom of the motor stops the flow of electricity to the motor as a safety measure. [4] X Research source Diagnosing the Issue: Shine a flashlight into the disposal and look for a blockage. Think about whether you’ve been running the disposal for an extended period. The Fix: Press the red button on the bottom of the disposal, then run the water and turn on the disposal to see if it works."

    {
      "title": "The motor is broken.",
      "content": "The motor is broken. If there isn’t anything caught in the disposal blades (or you unclogged it yourself) and you pressed the reset button on the bottom of the machine and it still doesn’t work, home improvement specialist Jacob Pischer says that “the motor has likely just gone bad and you need to replace it.” In this case, the humming noise indicates that electricity is being supplied to the motor, but it’s blocked or stuck, preventing it from grinding. [5] X Research source Diagnosing the Issue: Inspect the power cord for damage. Turn on the disposal, kneel down under the sink, and listen to hear if the motor inside is running. If it isn’t, it’s broken. The Fix: Although you may be able to replace the motor inside the disposal yourself, it may be best to call a pro to handle the job for you."

      "content": "Grab any obstructions sticking out of the disposal with tongs or pliers. Unplug your garbage disposal or flip the breaker (or both) to ensure there’s no power going to the machine. Look into the disposal with a flashlight—if you see the issue immediately, use a pair of pliers or tongs to remove the obstruction. [6] X Research source Try to avoid using your hands, even if the disposal is turned off. The blades inside are very sharp and could injure you."

      "content": "Fit a hex key in the hole at the bottom of the disposal and twist it. On the bottom of the outside of the disposal near the center is a small hole for a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) hex-head wrench . [7] X Research source Pischer says to put the correct hex key in the hole and “turn that both clockwise and counterclockwise to break up and loosen whatever happens to be in there.” The Allen wrench or hex key will rotate the flywheel and impeller inside the disposal, freeing the object from the blades. Some garbage disposals come with an Allen wrench, which may also be called a “food waste disposal” wrench. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Rotate a special wrench inside the disposal if it’s still clogged. If your garbage disposal is still jammed, insert a special garbage disposal unjamming wrench into the machine from the top. Once you hit the bottom, gently rotate the wrench until the jaws lock in place. Forcefully turn the wrench counterclockwise and then clockwise until the jam is cleared. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "If necessary, use a broom handle to dislodge the object. If the object isn’t dislodged with the Allen key or special wrench, use a wooden spoon or broom handle to gently push it off the blades. Use the wooden tool to rock the impeller blades at the bottom of the disposal back and forth. [10] X Research source Then, use a pair of pliers or tongs to remove the object. [11] X Research source Make sure there’s no power going to the disposal before attempting to unclog it. Ask another person to hold a flashlight for you so you can see if you’re effectively pushing the object off the blades."

      "content": "Press the button on the bottom of the disposal when the clog is gone. Connect the garbage disposal to power, but make sure it’s not running. Press the red button and make sure that it stays pressed. If it doesn’t, wait 10 to 15 minutes for the motor to cool down, then try again. Run the water and turn on the disposer to see if it works. [12] X Research source This reset button works like a circuit breaker in your home’s electrical panel, protecting the motor if it gets overheated (by a clog or by constant use) or overloaded."

      "content": "Avoid using bleach or drain cleaners to unclog the disposal. Although drain cleaners and other chemicals may seem like a quick and easy way to fix a disposal clog, they can be a huge hazard for homeowners. When you turn on the disposal after, it can cause the cleaner to fly up and possibly splash anyone nearby. [15] X Research source This can be especially dangerous if you’re right above the disposal while running it. The cleaners may fly into your eyes, causing injury."

In general, try to avoid putting anything down the disposal that might gum up the machine or get caught in the blades. Instead, use the disposal to break down ice cubes and soft, cut-up foods only. Here are items to avoid putting down the disposal: [16] X Research source Fat, grease, or oil Pasta, rice, or oats Bones and seafood shells Potatoes, potato peels, chicken skin, and sauerkraut Broken glass, metal, plastic, or paper scraps [17] X Research source Hard fruit pits or nut shells [18] X Research source Fibrous veggies (like celery, rhubarb, kale, onion skins, or asparagus) Medications Coffee grounds"

      "content": "Run your disposal every few days, even when you aren’t using it. Even if you don’t have anything to grind up, running your disposal every couple of days can help keep the blades clean and free of old food that might be stuck to them. It can also help keep the blades from rusting from lack of use. [19] X Research source Additionally, try not to keep any objects inside of your disposal. Run it as soon as you place any food items down the machine."

      "title": "Turn on your sink’s cold water tap while running the disposal.",
      "content": "Turn on your sink’s cold water tap while running the disposal. Running the water while grinding up your table scraps can help move the particles through the P-trap, or the U-shaped pipe underneath your sink. Over time, this practice can help prevent clogs in your drain. [20] X Research source For best results, run the water before turning on the disposal, while it’s grinding up food, and about 7 seconds after you turn it off and hear the grinding stop. [21] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Try not to use hot water on the disposal side of your sink. Hot water can melt fats and starches in the disposal, which makes them harder to grind and can lead to clogs."

      "content": "Clean the disposal with baking soda, vinegar, ice, and salt. To remove grease and grime from your disposal, pour in ½ cup (136 g) of baking soda and let it sit for 1 hour. Pour in 1 c (240 mL) of vinegar, then rinse the disposal with hot water. Add 2 cups (2 g) of ice and 1 cup (300 g) of salt, then run the cold water and turn on the disposal. [22] X Research source Try to clean your disposal using this method once every 2 weeks. Grind up 1 whole lemon peel with cold running water to remove odors from your garbage disposal. Alternatively, put 6 ice cubes in the disposal along with 1 tbsp (17 g) of baking soda, 3 lemon slices, 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of bleach, and 6 more ice cubes. Run cold water and turn on the disposal.
