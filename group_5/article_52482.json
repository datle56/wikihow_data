      "content": "Multiply the number of grams (g) by 1,000 to get milligrams (mg). Multiplying by 1,000 is the same as moving the decimal point 3 spots to the right. [2] X Research source For example, say you have 75 grams. Simply multiply 75 by 1,000, which equals 75,000. So, 75 grams (g) is equal to 75,000 milligrams (mg). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide the number of milligrams (mg) by 1,000 to find the number of grams (g). Keep in mind that there are 1,000 milligrams in every gram. [6] X Research source For instance, if you have 500,000 milligrams, divide 500,000 by 1,000, which equals 500. Therefore, 500,000 milligrams (mg) is equal to 500 grams (g). [7] X Research source"

If you live in the United States or another country that uses the imperial measurement system, you may be unfamiliar with grams and milligrams, since they are metric units. In the U.S., ounces (oz) and pounds (lbs) are usually used to measure weight. [8] X Research source"
