      "title": "Purchase some jump rings.",
      "content": "Purchase some jump rings. You can find jump rings at your local craft store or Walmart. Jump rings are small and made of metal. They usually have a small gap between the two ends of the ring. Jump rings are the best decision if you want your hoop piercings to look as realistic as possible. Buy a large pack of different sizes so you can keep using them for fake piercings, or if you make a mistake and need a back up."

    {
      "title": "Decide where you want your piercing.",
      "content": "Decide where you want your piercing. Where you want your piercing will affect how large or small of a jump ring to use. You will have to make sure the gap in the jump ring is wide enough to fit your skin. Hoop piercings are usually worn on the lip, nose, septum, or eyebrow. If you use the jump ring for a nose piercing the gap is going to be smaller than if you used a jump ring for an eyebrow piercing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pry the jump ring apart with pliers.",
      "content": "Pry the jump ring apart with pliers. Jump ring gaps start very small, so you will not be able to fit your skin inside unless you make the gap wider. The metal is usually not easily pliable, so pliers are the best tool. Use two pairs of flat pliers to grasp both ends. Twist the ends apart until you have your desired gap. Keep checking the jump ring against where you want your piercing to see how much wider the gap needs to be. Make sure the jump ring is snug on your skin."

      "title": "Brush clear nail polish on the ends.",
      "content": "Brush clear nail polish on the ends. Jump ring ends are usually sharp and can be harmful, especially if you are putting a good amount of skin between them. Clear nail polish will make a protective layer on the sharp ends, so they will not cut into your skin. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Apply eyelash glue to the ends.",
      "content": "Apply eyelash glue to the ends. Once the nail polish has dried, apply a small amount of eyelash glue to the ends of the jump ring. Eyelash glue is the best adhesive for fake facial piercings because it is already made for the skin, so it will last the longest and not be harmful. Choose an eyelash glue with a small applicator. Let the glue set on the ends of the jump ring for 20-30 seconds before applying to the skin."

You can go to your local craft store, convenience store, or office depot to find more paper clips if you ran out. [2] X Research source Use different color paper clips to make your hoop piercing more creative. Depending on how thick you want your piercing, you may want to use multiple paper clips. Two paper clip hoops can be placed together to create a thicker hoop."

      "content": "Straighten the paper clip out with pliers. With one pair of flat nose pliers, pull the paper clip out of its original shape. Then use the pliers to help you straighten it out completely by pulling each end flat. [3] X Research source Cut the straightened paper clip using scissors or diagonal cutting pliers, if you want to make it smaller. The length of the straightened paper clip will affect the size of the hoop piercing."

      "content": "Roll it with a cylinder object. The size of the cylinder object depends on how wide you want your hoop piercing. Pens, markers, and highlighters can work for this step. [4] X Research source Take one end of your straightened paper clip and curve it around your cylinder object. Roll the object to make the entire straightened paper clip curved into a hoop. Depending on how long your straightened paper clip was, you may have to gently pull apart the ends of your “hoop” so you have a gap for your skin."

      "content": "Decide where you want your piercing. You may be restricted on where you can draw your piercing if you want to make it look as realistic as possible. Hoop piercings are more difficult to draw on because of the depth perception usually made by the hoop shape. You may not be able to draw a realistic hoop on your eyebrow, but it should work for the nose or lip. Fake septum hoop piercings are not achievable if drawing on the hoop."

You want to be able to make an illusion that the barbell is going through your skin. Cut the barbell closer to each end stud, instead of right down the middle. This will leave you with three parts. The middle piece is the part of the barbell that would have been in your skin. The two end pieces are what you are gluing to your skin to make your fake barbell piercing."
