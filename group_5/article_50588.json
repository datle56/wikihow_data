      "content": "Play a little game of truth or dare that ends with her number. Try a message like, “Truth or dare?” If she picks dare, you can use the line above, no sweat! If she picks truth, simply ask, “What’s your number?” This is a fun and easy way to ask for a girl’s number that shows you can be a little goofy, too. [1] X Research source Or, if you’d rather give out your digits first, you might say, “I dare you to ask me for my number.”"

    {
      "title": "Ask her to solve a witty math problem to get her number.",
      "content": "Ask her to solve a witty math problem to get her number. Start off with something like, “Help! My nephew is doing math homework and he’s stuck on this problem.” She’ll probably respond with something like, “Haha, okay. What is it?” Then, you can send her the message above, and she’ll probably get a good giggle as she types out her number. [2] X Research source Messages like these work best after you’ve had a conversation first. You can try it as your opening line, but you’ll have more success if you’ve done a bit of small talk beforehand."
    },
    {
      "title": "You can use this as an opening line if you’re bold!",
      "content": "You can use this as an opening line if you’re bold! Make her laugh with this silly pickup line, and hopefully get her number if she likes you enough. If she’s into it, she’ll probably send you a laughing emoji along with her digits. [3] X Research source Not everyone appreciates pickup lines, but if her profile makes her seem like she has a good sense of humor, then she just might."
    },
    {
      "title": "Act cocky to make her laugh (and get her contact info).",
      "content": "Act cocky to make her laugh (and get her contact info). If you’re normally a little self-deprecating, play it a different way by pretending you’re the best of the best. Then, ask for her phone number as she chuckles at your opening line. [4] X Research source When you text her for the first time, you could say something like, “It’s me! The smartest, most attractive person on Tinder.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say everything with just a couple of emojis.",
      "content": "Say everything with just a couple of emojis. If you aren’t really a conversationalist, you can get your point across by just sending a phone emoji and a question mark. You might want to start out with a few heart eye emojis, just so she knows you like her. Then, she’ll feel great about sending along her digits. You can even ask a girl out on a date in emojis! Try sending her something like, “🍷🍣🌹❓” to ask her out to a sushi dinner."

    {
      "title": "This goofy line will probably make her smile.",
      "content": "This goofy line will probably make her smile. Make up the fact that you’ve been locked out of your Facebook or Instagram account, and try to make it seem like a huge deal. Then, tell her that the only password hint it gave you is her number, so she has to give it to you! If she appreciates your joke, you’ll have her digits in no time. [5] X Research source Personalize this message even more by including her name in your message. For instance, if you’re chatting with Anna, you’d say, “The only hint is ‘Anna’s number’!”"

    {
      "title": "A lot of people don’t love the fact that they’re on dating apps.",
      "content": "A lot of people don’t love the fact that they’re on dating apps. If you get the vibe that she’s a little fed up with online dating in general, test the waters by telling her if you take it off the app, you could forget this ever happened. You could make it even more funny by sending messages like: [6] X Research source “We could make up a story to tell people if they ask how we met! Maybe we sat next to each other at a monster truck rally, or I spotted you across the aisle at our local butcher shop.” Dating coach Connell Barrett suggests something like, \"This app sucks…. What’s your number?\""

      "content": "Straight to the point, this DM lets her know you want to talk to her more. If you have trouble checking your Tinder messages consistently, you might want to ask for her digits so you two can keep chatting. Try using this one after you’ve had a fun conversation so she’s more motivated to keep talking to you. [7] X Research source You might also say something like, “I’m so bad at checking Tinder. Can I give you my number instead?” Or, “As you can probably tell, I’m not great at responding to these messages, haha. Want to shoot me your digits instead?”"

      "title": "This one feels low-key, since you’re just moving to another app.",
      "content": "This one feels low-key, since you’re just moving to another app. However, WhatsApp does require a phone number, so you’ll have to exchange digits with the girl to keep the convo going. Once you have her contact info, send her a message via WhatsApp telling her who you are. After you’ve had a few WhatsApp convos, try reaching out over text. If you don’t have WhatsApp, you can download it for free on iOS or Android ."

      "title": "Be upfront that you aren’t the biggest fan of Tinder.",
      "content": "Be upfront that you aren’t the biggest fan of Tinder. If you really don’t love Tinder’s messaging feature, let her know, and ask her if she’d like to keep chatting. Chances are, she probably doesn’t like it very much either, and she’ll be grateful that you made the first move to take things off the app. [8] X Research source You might also say something like, “I’m not a huge fan of Tinder. Want to text me?” Or, “I’m so tired of dating apps. Let’s text instead.”"

    {
      "title": "If calling someone is more your style, try this one.",
      "content": "If calling someone is more your style, try this one. Maybe you aren’t the best texter in the world, or maybe she’s told you that she’s a slow texter. You can ask for her number to give her a ring instead—it’s kind of old-fashioned, but some girls really like that! Then, you two can chat over the phone and get to know each other more before setting up a date. [9] X Research source This is a good tactic to use if you’ve already asked her to text you and she’s made an excuse. You could also say, “I’m pretty bad at texting people back. Want to call me sometime?”"

If she’s been enjoying it as much as you have, she’ll probably have no problem giving you her digits so that you two can keep talking. [10] X Research source You could also tell her the first part of a joke and then say, “I’ll give you the punchline over text. What’s your number?”"

      "content": "Going out of town implies that you won’t be on the app for a while. If she knows that you might be unreachable but she still wants to talk to you, she’ll probably give you her number no problem. Then, you can set up an IRL date for whenever you’re back in town. [11] X Research source You could also say something like, “I won’t have internet for the next week or so. Want to give me your number so we can still chat?”"

      "content": "After you’ve set a time and a place, ask for her number. That way, you can text her on the day of your date, or even beforehand if you prefer. Having a way to contact someone outside of a dating app can be a safe backup plan in case the app malfunctions, and plus, it shows that you’re serious about taking her out. [12] X Research source You might also say, “Cool! Can I give you my number, just in case we need to get ahold of each other?” Keep in mind some people prefer to limit conversation to the app until after they’ve met in person, so if she declines, don’t stress about it! She probably just wants to get to know you IRL first."

      "content": "If the idea of a date has been thrown out there, try this line. Maybe you haven’t actually confirmed a time or a place yet, so you can do that over text. This will not only tell her that you’re serious about taking her out, but it also shows that you’re probably going to plan a fun date . This is another one that works best after you’ve had a bit of a rapport going. If you use this line too early, it could sound bossy, which is not a turn-on for most women."
