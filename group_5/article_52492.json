[1] X Research source Although there are different definitions of miles (such as a nautical mile ), this conversion refers to a “statute mile,” sometimes called a \"land mile.\" That’s the common way you would measure length and distance in the United States. Convert mile to meter by using this formula: mi X 1,609.344= m (miles multiplied by 1,609.344 equals meters). To convert meters to mile, use this formula: m/1,609.344=mi (meters divided by 1,609.344 equals miles). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the correct abbreviations. Since both meters and miles start with the letter “m,” it’s important you know which symbol is which before doing mathematical calculations. The symbol for mile is “mi.” The word “mile” derives from the Latin word for 1,000 since the mile originally was said to be 1,000 paces or 2,000 steps. [3] X Research source The letter \"m\" is the symbol for meter. A mile equals 5,280 feet. The other U.S. Customary Units/Imperial Units of Length are inches, feet, and yards. The Metric system also uses millimeters, centimeters, decimeters, hectometers, and kilometers. Be aware that meter is often written as metre, but the measurement is the same (1 metre equals 1 meter). Meters are a unit for measuring length, as are miles. The plural form is metres. [4] X Research source"
