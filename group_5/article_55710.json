      "title": "Lock down your privacy settings.",
      "content": "Lock down your privacy settings. Nearly all social networking sites let you make your profile, posts, and photos private. However, until you customize those settings, everything you do is usually public. Get familiar with your favorite social media platform's privacy settings so you always know who can see what you post. You can also use most social media apps' privacy settings to control who can find you on the app and contact you directly. TikTok – Go to ☰ > Settings and Privacy > Privacy . Instagram – Go to ☰ > Account Privacy . Snapchat – Tap the gear on your profile and scroll to the \"Privacy Controls\" settings.

      "title": "Don't overshare.",
      "content": "Don't overshare. Once you post something on a social networking site, it can be difficult to erase it completely. Even if you delete something you posted, somebody may have taken a screenshot. Don't share any information you wouldn't feel comfortable with a stranger knowing, like your address, phone number, birthday, or vacation plans, as this can lead to identity theft, stalking, cyberbullying, and even blackmail."

    {
      "title": "Keep your location private.",
      "content": "Keep your location private. Some social networking sites allow you to use geotagging to share your location with others on the app. If you've given the app permission to access your location, others may be able to see where you're posting from. Avoid using \"location tagging\" or \"check in\" features on social media so strangers can't find out where you are. When posting pictures on social media, pay attention to what's in the background. For example, if you post a selfie outside your house, someone can do a reverse image search to find your house and thus your address. If you're on Instagram, check out this list of funny locations you can use on posts instead of your actual location."

      "title": "Don't send anyone explicit photos or videos.",
      "content": "Don't send anyone explicit photos or videos. If a stranger asks you for a sexual photo or video of yourself, don't send it—even if they seem like a genuinely nice person. Similarly, don't do anything sexual with people you don't know over video chat. Sgt. Scott Nelson notes that blackmail scams , also known as \"sextortion,\" are growing more common. These situations often begin with a friendly or flirty conversation. Still, when the blackmailer gets a photo or video of you doing something you wouldn't want to be made public, they'll threaten to send it to everyone you know unless you pay them money."

      "content": "Don't meet up with strangers in person. If you don't know somebody in real life, avoid meeting them in person. If you're buying or selling something on Facebook Marketplace and must hand off the item in person, bring somebody with you, and arrange the meeting to occur in front of a police station or other safe location. If you're going on a date with somebody you met on a social networking site, Sgt. Nelson suggests making it a group date so you can both bring a friend the first time you meet—even if it's just for the first portion of the date."

      "content": "Don't click links in private messages. Scammers often use private messaging on social media to find their victims, posing as potential new friends/suitors or people you already know. If you get a message that contains a link, a request for money, or anything else that seems out of the ordinary, don't click it—even if the message appears to come from a friend's account, as it may have been hacked. If you receive a suspicious link, report it . If you think the message may have come from a friend, try contacting your friend another way to make sure the message is really from them."

To prevent this, use a strong, unique password for every social media account. If it's too hard to remember your passwords , try a password manager like 1password, Bitwarden, or Dashlane."

If you're using a computer to access social media, use antivirus and antimalware protection, like Microsoft Defender (which is built into Windows) or AVG . You should also avoid installing unfamiliar apps—especially those claiming they can help you see who \"stalks you on social media,\" as these apps are always scams."
