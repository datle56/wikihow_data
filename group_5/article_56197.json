      "content": "There is always a risk of getting scammed by an individual seller. Etsy is made up of individual sellers, rather than employees. While most Etsy sellers are trustworthy, there is always a risk of getting scammed. It's possible that the product you receive may not match the photo in the item listing, or it may not be as good a quality product as the seller said. It is also possible that the product may not arrive or may arrive damaged. In such cases, you can open a case with Etsy to get your money back."

Check the reviews to make sure people aren't having any issues receiving refunds or returns. Make sure people are actually getting the product they purchased. Scammers will often make fake accounts in order to leave positive reviews. When checking a seller's reviews, check their 5-star reviews for signs they may be fake.
