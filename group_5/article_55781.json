      "content": "Yes, alone time is necessary for a healthy relationship. In the movies, you might see couples who spend 100% of their time together without a break. In real life, though, everyone needs to take some time for themselves. If your partner asks you for alone time or you feel like you want to spend some time on your own, don’t worry—it’s normal to hang out on your own every now and then. [1] X Research source Spending time by yourself lets you focus on your own needs and desires. People who spend more time on their own experience more growth and personal development overall."

      "content": "Experts recommend getting 20-30 minutes of alone time every day. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave the house and go somewhere on your own—you might sit at the table and drink a cup of coffee by yourself, or bring a book to bed and read it on your own. These small moments of comfort will help you relax and come back refreshed. [2] X Research source It can be scary to spend time on your own if you’re not used to it. The best thing you can do is push forward and face your fears. In time, it will get easier. On the flip side, spending the majority of your time alone isn’t healthy, either. Balance is key here—if you feel like you and your partner never spend any quality time together, it’s time for a conversation with them."

      "content": "Aim to spend 70% of your time with your partner and 30% of your time alone. This 70/30 balance is a good way to break up your time without feeling overwhelmed. For instance, you might spend 4 or 5 days a week together with your partner and 2 or 3 days apart. That way, you’re both getting your needs met, and neither one of you feels lonely or stressed out. [3] X Research source Some people also use the 80/20 rule, where 80% of their time is with their partner and 20% of it is on their own."

      "content": "Everybody is different, which means that our alone time needs vary. You might need alone time every other day, while your partner only needs alone time once a week. Make sure you talk with your partner about your needs, and listen to their needs as well. [4] X Research source Start the conversation by saying something like, “Hey honey, I wanted to talk about how much time we spend together. You know I love hanging out with you, but I think I need some alone time, too. It will help me decompress and be less stressed throughout the day.” If your partner is the one asking for alone time, try to hear them out, and don’t take it personally. It’s not that they need time away from you, specifically—they need time away from everyone ."
