      "title": "When gum gets super cold, it hardens and becomes less sticky.",
      "content": "When gum gets super cold, it hardens and becomes less sticky. This makes it much easier to remove. If you’re removing the gum from a small clothing item or blanket, simply fold it and place it in the freezer with the gum facing upward for an hour or two. [1] X Research source If the item is too big to fit in the freezer, hold an ice cube or ice pack to the gum until it hardens (this should take about 10-15 minutes). Once the gum has completely hardened, use your fingers to pick it off of the fabric. You can also use a dull butter knife, spatula, or credit card to gently scrape the gum away. [2] X Research source If there is any remaining gum residue stuck to the fabric, apply a small amount of dry-cleaning fluid to the area, or spray it with a pre-wash treatment , and sponge the area until it’s not sticky anymore. [3] X Research source Finally, place the item in the washing machine or handwash it according to the instructions listed on the care label. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Hairspray hardens the gum in the same way that freezing does. Spray the hairspray directly onto the gum stain, and allow it to harden for a few seconds. You should now be able to simply pop the gum off with your fingers, but you can also pry it off with a blunt butter knife or spatula if you prefer. [5] X Research source Ensure that the hairspray won't damage the fabric by patch testing a small, unnoticeable area before you begin."

      "title": "Vinegar will help dissolve and soften the gum.",
      "content": "Vinegar will help dissolve and soften the gum. Pour some white vinegar into a microwave safe bowl. Heat the vinegar up in the microwave until it’s warm, but not super hot or boiling (this should take about 15-30 seconds). Place the part of the fabric with the gum into the bowl with the vinegar, and let it soak for a few minutes. [6] X Research source You should now be able to easily scrape the gum off with a butter knife or any other blunt edge. If there are any residual pieces of gum on the fabric, rub the area with a soft toothbrush. The clumps will stick to the toothbrush and lift off of the fabric. As soon as you’ve removed the gum, wash the item as you normally would in the washing machine or by hand. If you’re worried about discoloration or damage, patch test the vinegar on a small, unnoticeable area before soaking the fabric. If there’s no noticeable change, you should be good to go!"

      "content": "A quick soak in some lemon juice will make the gum easier to scrape off. Simply pour your lemon juice into a bowl, then dip the part of the fabric with the gum into it. Let the gum soak for a few minutes, then remove it from the lemon juice. Use a blunt edge to scrape the gum off of the fabric, then launder the item as normal according to the instructions on the care label. [7] X Research source The lemon juice shouldn’t cause any discoloration to the fabric, but you should wash the item as soon as you’re done removing the gum, just to be safe. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "It may sound strange, but mayonnaise works wonders on gum stains.",
      "content": "It may sound strange, but mayonnaise works wonders on gum stains. Just pour a small amount of mayo onto the gum, and massage it into the fabric with your fingers. You should now be able to peel the gum off smoothly and easily. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that mayo has a high oil content, and you may have trouble removing oil stains from delicate fabrics. Because of this, it may be best to save this option for a last resort, or only use it on items that can withstand a strong stain-fighting treatment afterwards. If you don’t have mayonnaise, peanut butter should work the same way, since it also has a high oil content."

      "content": "Rubbing alcohol breaks down gum and makes it less sticky. Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and rub it into the gum until it’s thoroughly wet. Let the rubbing alcohol sit on the gum for about 45 seconds, then press a piece of duct tape onto the area. As you remove the duct tape, the gum should lift off of the fabric and stick to the piece of tape. [10] X Research source Keep pressing the duct tape onto the area over and over again until all the gum is lifted off of the fabric. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "The heat from your iron softens the gum, making it easier to remove.",
      "content": "The heat from your iron softens the gum, making it easier to remove. Start by placing a piece of cardboard on your ironing board or another flat surface. Next, lay the item on top of the cardboard with the gum facing down. Set your iron to medium heat, then run it over the garment. Once the heat has softened the gum, gently peel the garment away from the cardboard. The gum should stick to the cardboard, leaving your item clean and gum-free. [12] X Research source Make sure your iron isn’t too hot! The medium setting will be hot enough to soften the gum without melting it (which makes it harder to remove). [13] X Research source Only apply the iron to the area for 15-30 seconds at a time. This also helps prevent the gum from melting and becoming too sticky."

      "title": "Try warming up the gum with steam.",
      "content": "Try warming up the gum with steam. If you have a handheld steamer, simply turn it on and aim the steam at the gum to warm it up. If you don’t have a steamer, heat up some water in a tea kettle and hold the gum-stained area near the spout as it releases steam. The heat should soften the gum and make it easier to scrape off with a blunt edge. [14] X Research source"
