The word for \"zero\" in Spanish sounds somewhat similar to the English word, so it should be pretty easy to remember. [1] X Research source As in English, the number cero stands alone and does not form the base of any other numbers. However, it's still an important number to know. It could come in handy if, for example, you were reading out a phone number or credit card number in Spanish."

Simply say the digit in the ones place followed by the word y , then the name of the tens place number. For example, thirty-one (31) is treinta y uno . Seventy-five (75) is setenta y cinco .

For other hundreds, use the word for the multiplier digit (or a variation thereof) combined with cientos .

Words for numbers in the thousands follow the same pattern or formula you learned to create numbers in the tens and hundreds.

One billion in Spanish is mil millones (meel mee-YOHN-ays), or one thousand million. [11] X Research source This is because the Spanish use what is called the long scale system. This system alternates between a scale word and its thousand when naming large numbers. There is the word un billón in Spanish, which sounds like the word \"billion\" in English. However, this word refers to a million millions, or 1,000,000,000,000."
