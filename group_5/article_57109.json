      "content": "Draw a pattern for the pants or skirt on a piece of paper. Place your teddy bear on top of the piece of paper and mark along the outer and inner edges of the teddy bear’s legs and waist. Add 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to each edge for the seam allowance. Identify how long you want to make your pants or skirt as well, and make another mark where you want the item to begin and end, adding 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to each edge for the seam allowance. Then, finish drawing your outline for the pants or skirt. [1] X Research source For example, if you want the pants to stop about 2 in (5.1 cm) from the bottom of the teddy bear’s foot, then make a mark at this location on the paper. If you want the skirt to come only to the middle of the teddy bear’s legs, then mark this location. If you do not want to make your own pattern, you can buy one in a craft supply store or find a pattern online for the size of the bear you have. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pin the pattern onto a piece of folded fabric. Cut along the edges of the paper pattern using a sharp pair of scissors. Then, fold the fabric in half and pin the paper pattern onto your fabric. Make sure that the paper pattern is inside of the folded edge of the fabric. Insert a pin about every 2 in (5.1 cm) all the way around the edges of the pattern. [3] X Research source Work on a flat surface while you do this to avoid getting wrinkles in your fabric. You may use any type of fabric you like to make your teddy bear clothes."

      "content": "Cut along the edges of the pattern to create 2 pieces. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric along the outer edges of the paper pattern to create 2 identical pieces. Make long, clean cuts to ensure that you don’t end up with any jagged edges. [4] X Research source When you are finished cutting, you will have 2 equal-sized fabric pieces."

Fold 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of the top edge of the pants or skirt over so that the wrong (inner or non-print) sides are facing each other and the raw edges of the fabric will be hidden inside of the item. Insert 2 to 3 pins through the folded fabric to hold it in place. Then, do the same thing for the bottom edges of the pants or skirt. [5] X Research source"

If you are sewing the hem, use a sewing machine or needle and thread to sew a straight stitch 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the folded edge of the fabric. Remove the pins as you sew and do not sew over them. If you are using fabric glue, dispense a line of glue in between the layers of folded fabric. Leave the pins in place until the glue dries (about 8 hours). Repeat this to secure the hem for both pieces. [6] X Research source Make sure to cut the excess thread if you sew to create the seam. Press the fabric layers together if you are securing them with glue."

Place the pants or skirt pieces together so that their right (print or outer) sides are facing each other and the edges are lined up. Then, insert a pin every 2 in (5.1 cm) along the raw edges to secure them. [7] X Research source Do not insert pins along the hem of the fabric! The top and bottom edges need to remain open to get the item onto the bear’s body."

[8] X Research source Position the stitches about 0.25 in (6.3 × 10 15 am) from the raw edges of the item. Remove the pins as you sew.

Lay your teddy bear on the fabric and mark the fabric on both sides of the teddy bear under the armpits and next to its waist.The fabric needs to go at least halfway up the sides of the teddy bear’s waist. Remove the teddy bear and connect these 4 dots with a piece of chalk or fabric marker to form a rectangle. [9] X Research source If you want to create a specific kind of teddy bear shirt, use a pattern instead. You can purchase teddy bear clothing patterns in a craft supply store or find free patterns online. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that getting the right fit may be more complex depending on the shape of the bear’s body. You can use any type of fabric that you want to make a teddy bear shirt."

Depending on the thickness of the straps, the shirt may look like a tank top or a t-shirt. Measure the distance from the top of your teddy bear’s chest, then over the shoulder to the same location on its back. Add 1 in (2.5 cm) for the seam allowance. Cut out 2 straps to the desired length. [15] X Research source Use a soft tape measure to find the desired strap length. You can also substitute ribbon for the shirt straps."
