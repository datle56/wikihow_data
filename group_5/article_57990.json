      "title": "Omniaromantic refers to having no feelings of romantic attraction.",
      "content": "Omniaromantic refers to having no feelings of romantic attraction. Someone who identifies as omniaromantic doesn’t feel a romantic attraction to anyone and has zero interest in engaging in romantic activities. They don’t crave a romantic partnership and are uninterested in romance—they’re non-romantic. They don’t experience crushes or sexual attraction; however, they may still experience platonic or familial love. [1] X Research source Many omniaromantic people are also apothiromantic or romance repulsed, meaning the idea of romance or romantic interactions puts them off. The omniaromantic flag is green, gray, and black, with a green horizontal stripe on the top and bottom, followed by gray stripes and 1 black stripe in the middle."

      "content": "Aromantics can experience love, while omniaromantics don’t. Romantic attraction is a spectrum, and while omniaromantic and aromantic fall in a similar category, they’re not the same. Aromantic is a romantic orientation where it’s very rare for a person to experience romantic feelings or attractions. [2] X Research source Unlike omniaromantics who don’t experience romantic attraction under any circumstances, if the right person were to come into an aromantic’s life, they may start to get feelings for them. Think of it like this: An aromantic may get butterflies around someone they’re slowly growing interested in; meanwhile, an omniaromantic won’t because they don’t get crushes or see people in a romantic light."

      "title": "You may be omniaromantic if you’re not romantically attracted to people.",
      "content": "You may be omniaromantic if you’re not romantically attracted to people. Knowing your romantic or sexual orientation can be an eye-opening experience. If you think you might be omniaromantic, ask yourself these questions. If you answer “no,” you’re likely omniaromantic. Are you attracted to other people? Do you get crushes easily? Do you get excited by the idea of being intimate with someone? Can you see yourself in a romantic, long-term relationship? Do you like the idea of someone calling you their partner, girlfriend, or boyfriend?"

      "content": "Support an omniaromantic by being respectful. The best thing you can do for an omniaromantic is to be understanding and kind. Not everyone has the same romantic orientation or preferences, and that’s okay! The beautiful thing about the world is that there are so many diverse relationships and connections. Avoid pushing relationships on an omniaromantic, and instead, provide them with supportive friendship.

It can be harmful to assume someone is omniaromantic if they’ve never been in a relationship or haven't expressed interest in someone."
