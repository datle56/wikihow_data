      "title": "A novena is a prayer that you perform every day for 9 days.",
      "content": "A novena is a prayer that you perform every day for 9 days. “Novena” stems from the Latin word “novem,” which means 9. Novenas can also last 9 hours, 9 weeks, 9 months. Alternatively, repeat the same prayer 9 times. What’s important is that you pray for 9 of something. Novenas aren’t 9 days of nonstop prayer, but rather a prayer said once a day for 9 days. Many novenas begin on or coincide with certain days, like feast days or church holidays, but you can pray a novena at any time. [1] X Research source The novena is different from an octave, which is an 8-day set of prayers with a generally more festive feeling than a novena, usually before Christmas or Easter.

      "content": "A novena is a specific set of prayers for a specific intention. There are many different novenas you can pray, and each one focuses on a different petition. Each novena has a different set of prayers to help you focus on your intention, and each novena might fall into one of 4 general types: [3] X Research source Mourning novenas for a deceased person, in the hopes their soul will reach heaven. Preparation novenas for an important day or occasion, like receiving a sacrament. Petition novenas ask God for something, like courage, grace, or hope. Penance novenas ask forgiveness for a wrongdoing after going to Confession ."

      "content": "The novena began with the apostles at Pentecost. After Jesus ascended into heaven, he told his apostles to pray together. The apostles gathered and prayed for 9 days, and on the ninth day they experienced the miracle of Pentecost, in which the Holy Spirit descended as tongues of flame. This was the first novena, and was where the tradition began."

      "content": "Identify your intention and select a corresponding novena. Think about what you’re praying for—asking God for something, praying for someone, celebrating a holy day, etc.—and choose a novena that corresponds with your intention. Visit a website like EWTN to browse a list of novenas, and choose one that appeals to you and is relevant to your intention."

      "title": "Dedicate your time and keep up with the schedule.",
      "content": "Dedicate your time and keep up with the schedule. The novena you select will have a suggested schedule for your prayer, often with a specific prayer for each of the 9 days of the novena. [4] X Research source Set an alarm or a reminder so that you don’t forget to pray each day, week, month, or however long you’ve chosen to perform the novena. You don’t have to pray at the same time each day, but it’s helpful to stay consistent and place yourself in a meditative state of mind. Pray a novena once every hour over the course of 9 hours for a shorter, more concentrated alternative. Choose a 9-hour period where you will be free at the same time every hour to say your prayer. [5] X Research source If you miss a day or a prayer, don’t worry! Your novena is still meaningful and valid. Simply perform the missed prayer to catch up, move the missed prayer to the end, or say an extra prayer to make up for it."

      "title": "Pray privately or with a group at your church.",
      "content": "Pray privately or with a group at your church. Oftentimes, novenas are prayed alone and in private. When a particular intention concerns a larger group of people, though, you may choose to pray the novena together. Public novenas are usually organized by a church. They can be spoken for specific purposes or in preparation of specific feast days. [6] X Research source Your church may ask you to come to church each day, or pray the novena at home at the same time as other congregants."

Some novenas include attending mass as part of their prescribed prayers, but you can incorporate mass attendance, confession, acts of charity, and other pious acts into any novena. [7] X Research source Your novena is a time to immerse yourself in prayer, and supplementing your prayers with other holy activities can help you to better focus yourself on God."

      "content": "Remember that a novena doesn’t guarantee results. At least, not necessarily the results you expect. Many people become disappointed if it appears their novena prayers went unanswered, but a novena isn’t a shortcut to getting what you want. Instead, it’s a way to make your wants, needs, and intentions known to God, and to trust that he’ll do what’s needed, whatever that looks like. [8] X Research source"
