      "title": "Use advanced prompts.",
      "content": "Use advanced prompts. When crafting a prompt be specific about what you want. You can ask ChatGPT to write in a specific tone or style. You can also ask ChatGPT to revise its responses to produce better content."
    },

      "title": "Add context to your prompts.",
      "content": "Add context to your prompts. When creating prompts, add as much context as possible. Be sure to include any insights, and nuances that are important. Include who your target audience is in your prompts and how you want the responses to sound. [1] X Research source Technology expert Tyrone Showers says of using ChatGPT to write SEOO article titles, \"I give context on how to write it. Be specific, no hyperbole. Avoid as many adjectives but elicit some type of emotion in the title that makes people want to dive into the article. So by giving it specific instructions, you can actually get the result required. Another example is if you're writing something and you see a lot of these superlatives that ChatGPT has generated in the article. Just use simple plain language. Eliminate all the adjectives and ask it to write in a conversational tone, so it doesn't look like it's perfectly formatted.\""

      "title": "Make sure the language is varied.",
      "content": "Make sure the language is varied. While editing the text or revising your prompts, check for repeating words and phrases and use alternatives.

      "title": "Make sure the information is factually accurate.",
      "content": "Make sure the information is factually accurate. When asking ChatGPT specific questions, do some research to fact-check the information it provides. ChatGPT is trained on common patterns rather than accurate information. These patterns can be influenced by outside sources, especially if you are using the free ChatGPT model."

    {
      "title": "Limit your response time in live chats.",
      "content": "Limit your response time in live chats. One way to detect an AI chatbot is through the response time. Humans type about 40 to 60 words per minute on average. Humans will also pause when they stop to think and comprehend. Add a delay when using ChatGPT to generate responses. You can try manually copying the text or reduce the time it takes you to copy and paste the text from ChatGPT."
    },
    {
      "title": "Manually edit the text.",
      "content": "Manually edit the text. One of the best ways to make ChatGPT undetectable is to edit the content it produces and add a more human touch. You can add some jokes, personal anecdotes, and colloquialisms to the text. Edit the language to make it feel more human. You can even introduce minor errors that are normal for human writers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Upgrade the language model.",
      "content": "Upgrade the language model. Free accounts get access to ChatGPT 3.5. If you subscribe to ChatGPT Plus , you get access to the ChatGPT 4 model. This language model is trained on a larger dataset and has access to the internet. It is more likely to produce accurate responses that sound more natural."

    {
      "title": "Use an AI text humanizer.",
      "content": "Use an AI text humanizer. There are many tools out there that claim to be able to rewrite AI-generated text to make it sound more human. Humanize AI Text is one such application. AI Text Converter is another. Open AI also has an AI text humanizer that is available with a ChatGPT Plus subscription."

      "title": "Test your AI-generated text.",
      "content": "Test your AI-generated text. Before you submit, publish, or turn in AI-generated text, run it through an AI detector to see if it passes. You can use AI detectors such as QuillBot or TurnItIn . Other AI text detectors include GPTZero , scribbr , and undetectable AI ."

      "title": "AI-generated text has predictable patterns.",
      "content": "AI-generated text has predictable patterns. Chatbots like ChatGPT are trained on datasets. This produces language patterns that commonly show up in AI-generated text. This may be overuse of certain words or phrases, as well as sentence structure. AI detectors look for these patterns. Also, AI-generated text tends to be unnaturally consistent and lack emotions and random thoughts that human writing has. [3] X Research source"
