Scrub vigorously with a cleaning solution. Several popular mixtures can be used as a cleaning solution. One method is to mix one part white vinegar with one part hot water in a spray bottle. Spray a good deal of the solution on the stain before scrubbing it. [1] X Research source A similar solution is made by combining two cups of warm water and 1 tbsp of table salt. After the salt dissolves mix in ½ cup of white vinegar, 1 tbsp of laundry detergent, and 2 tbsp of rubbing alcohol. ”Totally Toddler” is a solution created for cleaning vomit. It can be used the same way any of the other solutions would be used. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source If you have used detergent in your solution, be sure to perform this step twice. Dirt clings to detergent, so you will have problems in the future if you don't get it out of your carpet. If you use a towel to clean the area, place the towel on the ground and walk around on it."
