      "content": "Unlock and play the Ketchcrash activity to earn Map Fragments. Getting Map Fragments in Destiny 2 is pretty straightforward since there’s only one way to do it: by completing an activity called Ketchcrash. The activity contains 3 phases; in the first phase, you must bombard and board the Ketch. Then, in the second phase, you must defeat all enemies and destroy the security system. In the third (and final) phase, you’ll defeat the ship's captain. [1] X Research source After defeating the final boss, a chest (filled with rewards) will appear. This usually includes around 10 Map Fragments! Keep in mind that your Guardian can only hold 50 Map Fragments at a time—so it’s essential to make sure you have space before doing Ketchcrash. To unlock Ketchcrash, simply progress through the Ahoy and Aweigh quest until it becomes available. You can launch it from the H.E.L.M. section of your directory. While playing Ketchcrash on Master difficulty grants 2 or 3 times the usual fragments, it also takes much longer to complete. So, earning fragments this way is technically no faster than playing Ketchcrash on an easier difficulty."

      "content": "Get extra Map Fragments from the game’s premium Season Pass. If you have the premium Season of Plunder Pass (as opposed to the free version), you can also a single additional map fragment as a reward for reaching levels 12, 32, and 52, plus 5 extra fragments for reaching level 92. However, since the game’s primary source of Map Fragments is still the Ketchcrash activity, you don’t necessarily need to buy the Season Pass. [2] X Research source Season Pass rewards can grant more than just Map Fragments; for example, leveling up through the Season Pass can also help you earn Legendary Shards or get Upgrade Modules ."

      "title": "Play any seasonal activity to earn Treasure Coordinates.",
      "content": "Play any seasonal activity to earn Treasure Coordinates. Treasure Coordinates can be used with Map Fragments to make complete Treasure Maps—which is why it’s a good idea to collect Treasure Coordinates alongside the fragments. The good news is that coordinates are awarded at the end of most activities, including Crucible, Gambit, Strikes, Weekly story missions, Public events, Ketchcrash, and Lost Sector. [3] X Research source Not all activities award the same amount of Treasure Coordinates. However, Public Events typically take half the time to complete as activities like Strikes or the Crucible, so they’re usually better for collecting coordinates. Participating in activities has other uses, too. For example, you can acquire the Strange Key quest by completing Strikes, Bounties, and Public Events, and get the Darkness in the Light quest by doing Gambit."

      "content": "Hire Halsiks the Sniper for seasonal missions. Halsiks works for the House of Spider crime syndicate—and unlocking a perk for the Navigator aboard the H.E.L.M. lets you hire him, ensuring that Halsiks joins you during Ketchcrash and Expedia missions. Hiring Halsiks also makes enemies occasionally drop Treasure Coordinates when they die—meaning having him around increases the number of coordinates your Guardian can find. [4] X Research source If you keep upgrading Halsiks at the Navigator, you’ll unlock the Under One Banner Perk, which increases the number of Treasure Coordinates you earn. Try equipping seasonal armor with the Plunderer’s Trappings perk. Each piece of armor with the perk grants a 5% bonus on Treasure Coordinates (to a maximum of 20%). There’s also a bundle of 50 Treasure Coordinates available at level 70 of the Season Pass. Remember that your Guardian can carry a maximum of 352 Treasure Coordinates—so if you have enough Map Fragments and coordinates to make a Treasure Map, go for it! That way, you can also clear up some inventory space."

Treasure Maps are special consumable items; when you have completed Treasure Maps, you’ll get extra loot at the end of Expedition activities. Although the material costs for crafting Treasure Maps vary, the base cost is 5 Map Fragments and 50 Treasure Coordinates—so you’ll need both to get the additional treasure. [5] X Research source Once you have enough fragments and coordinates, select the Captains’ Atlas (in the Quest tab of the main menu). From there, enter the “details” screen and select a Treasure Map to craft it."
