      "title": "Hard on themselves",
      "content": "Hard on themselves They hold themselves to very high standards, which sometimes leads to an excess of self-criticism. When Type 1 makes a mistake, they tend to beat themselves up over it, rather than giving themselves grace. To overcome this : Make an effort to be kinder to yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s impossible to be perfect 100% of the time! Try reciting positive affirmations to cultivate a healthier attitude toward yourself and build self-love. For example, you could recite, “My worth is not dependent on my achievements,” or “I am worthy and capable, even when I make a mistake.” [5] X Research source"

Nevertheless, Type 1s exacting standards can be too harsh and sometimes unattainable, causing tensions and stress in their relationships. To overcome this : Work on building empathy toward the people around you. This will help you be more understanding and meet others where they’re at. When you're feeling critical or judgmental, pause and ask yourself what challenges or difficult circumstances this person may be facing. Think about how you might feel in their position, and let this feeling of sympathy grow. Use it to fuel kindness and understanding toward them. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Rigid or inflexible",
      "content": "Rigid or inflexible Type 1’s intense commitment to following rules and adhering to plans can make them a bit of a stickler. When this quality is left unchecked, Type 1 can develop an overly controlling personality, and they may struggle to adapt to unexpected circumstances. [7] X Research source To overcome this : Push yourself to become more flexible. It’s okay to love rules and structure, but it's also important to be able to adapt when life throws a wrench in your plans! Start by challenge your thought process. For example, at first you might think, “This isn’t the right way to do things. It’s all going to go wrong.” Push back against this, and instead tell yourself: “This is different from what I’m used to, but that’s okay. It may be an opportunity to learn something new.” [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Self-repressed",
      "content": "Self-repressed Because Type 1s are so focused on being blameless and in-control, they tend to squash down complicated emotions. When Type 1s feel angry, for example, they tend to deny and repress this feeling because they think anger isn’t virtuous. Left to stew and fester, Type 1’s anger can boil over and blow up. [9] X Research source To overcome this : Allow yourself to freely express your emotions . There’s nothing wrong with being angry, frustrated, or overwhelmed sometimes! These feelings are completely natural, but when you suppress them, they actually end up growing and becoming more volatile.
