      "title": "Feet ÷ 3 = yards",
      "content": "Feet ÷ 3 = yards One yard is 3 feet long, so all you have to do is divide the number of feet by 3 to get the total number of yards for your measurement. Let’s say your existing measurement is 21 feet—by dividing this number by 3, you’d get a conversion of 7 yards. [1] X Research source A 20-ft-long closet would be 6.66 yards long ( 20 ÷ 3 equals 6.66 ). A 260-ft-long parking lot would be 86.66 yards long ( 260 ÷ 3 is 86.66 )."
    },
    {
      "title": "Yards x 3 = feet",
      "content": "Yards x 3 = feet Since there are 3 feet in a single yard, you need to multiply the total number of yards by 3 to convert the measurement to feet . For instance, a wall that measures 20 yards long would actually be 60 feet long, since 20 multiplied by 3 is 60. [2] X Research source A 25-yard-long pasture would be 75 feet long ( 25 x 3 = 75 ). A 410-yard-long road converts to 1,230 feet long ( 410 x 3 = 1,230 )."

      "title": "Meters x 1.0936 = yards",
      "content": "Meters x 1.0936 = yards A single meter is equal to 1.0936 yards. Since yards are smaller than meters, multiply 1.0936 by the total number of meters to convert the measurement to yards . [3] X Research source For example, 5 meters converts to 5.468 yards ( 5 x 1.0936 = 5.468 ). To convert yards to meters , simply invert the formula and divide the total number of yards by 1.0936. For instance, 10 yards would convert to 9.144 meters ( 10 ÷ 1.0936 = 9.144 )."

    {
      "title": "Feet x 0.3048 = meters",
      "content": "Feet x 0.3048 = meters Exactly 0.3048 meters fit into a single foot—so, multiplying your total number of feet by this number will give you an exact metric conversion to meters. [4] X Research source For instance, 12 feet would convert to 3.65 meters ( 12 x 0.3048 = 3.65 ). To convert meters to feet, just flip the formula around and divide the total number of meters by 0.3048. For example, 4.5 meters would convert to 14.76 feet ( 4.5 ÷ 0.3048 = 14.76 )."
