      "content": "Clean your dill before freezing it. Rinse the dill off thoroughly, rotating the plant so the fronds get evenly soaked. Hold the rinsed herbs over the sink to let any excess water drip off, and then lay them flat on a paper towel. Pat the dill dry with another paper towel until it’s no longer wet to the touch."

      "content": "Freeze the fronds in freezer-safe bags for 1-2 months. Lay the washed dill fronds out on a baking sheet and freeze them for around 1 hour (or until they’re completely frozen). Then, transfer the frozen dill to a freezer-safe bag or freezer-safe container and use it within 1-2 months. [1] X Research source Canola oil works well for this type of freezing, but olive oil can work in a pinch. Alternative: Cut up the dill into smaller pieces and slip them into a freezer bag, along with enough oil to completely cover the herbs. Seal and flatten the bag down before transferring it to the freezer. Whenever you’d like to add some dill to a recipe, snap off a piece of the frozen oil mixture.

Combine 2 cups (18g) of washed and chopped dill with 1 ⁄ 3 to 1 ⁄ 2 c (79 to 118 mL) of canola oil (or another neutral oil) and pour the mixture into an ice cube tray (or a small jar).

Then, transfer 1 tablespoon of dill into each well of an ice cube tray. Fill the tray with water, freeze it overnight, and transfer the herb cubes into a freezer-safe bag.

[8] X Research source Freezing as a paste: Blend 1 ⁄ 3 c (79 mL) of neutral oil (like canola oil) and 2 cups (18g) of dill together. Then, pour the mixture into an ice cube tray, let it freeze, and transfer the cubes to a freezer-safe bag.

Pour about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water into a big mason jar and transfer the trimmed dill fronds into it. Then, seal the jar and stick it in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Try drying drill if you’d like it to last for up to 3 years.",
      "content": "Try drying drill if you’d like it to last for up to 3 years. Dried herbs don’t actually go bad—they’re only at risk of losing their potency. Dill in particular tends to be freshest within 6 months to 3 years. [12] X Research source Once dried, transfer your dill to a jar or airtight container and keep it in a part of your home that’s cool and dark. [13] X Research source Air-drying (inside): Use a rubber band to tie several bunches of herbs together at the stems. Dangle the herbs upside down with twine and hang them in a space where plenty of air. Wait 1-2 weeks for the dill to dry out, and then freeze the bundle for 2 days to get rid of any bugs or bug eggs. Dehydrator: Check that your dehydrator is set to 95 to 115 °F (35 to 46 °C) and wait 1-4 hours (or whatever time is recommended by your device manufacturer). Oven: Set your oven to an extremely low temperature (like 110 to 130 °F (43 to 54 °C)) and place your dill on a baking sheet. Place the herbs in the oven for 3 to 4 hours total, checking and rotating the dill periodically. This method isn’t officially recommended for dill, but it could still be worth a try. Microwave: Layer your dill between two paper towels and heat them for 30 seconds. Then, inspect and rotate the dill pieces to ensure they’re getting evenly dried—if needed, take out any pieces that are already dried. Don’t heat your herbs for more than 3 minutes total. This method is best with microwaves that are 1000 watts or less. Check the inside of your microwave to confirm what the wattage is. Keep in mind that this method isn’t officially recommended for dill. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect dill seeds and use them within 1 year. If you’re growing dill at home, snip off several plants at the stem when the plant starts looking tan. Then, tie the plants together, flip them over, and hang them in a warm space with plenty of air flow (and not directly next to any light sources). Secure a brown paper bag to the bottom of the dill with a rubber band so the bag collects the seeds. Transfer the seeds you collect into an airtight container for up to 1 year. [15] X Research source Give the seeds time to dry out completely before you store them long-term. Cut some small holes around the bag so air can get in and out."
