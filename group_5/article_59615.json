      "title": "Quality time",
      "content": "Quality time To Sagittarius, it’s out of sight, out of mind. Sag’s life is a wild, exciting whirlwind. If you’re not with them in the eye of the storm, they might…how do I put this? Forget you exist. That’s why, if you want to connect with Sag, it’s essential that you carve out time for them. Sagittarius is the most adaptable sign—they create their own bright, lovely little world wherever they happen to plant their feet. So, keep showing up in Sagittarius’ life; if you do, your bond with them will grow deeper and deeper. My best friend is a Sagittarius, and she wants to be invited to everything—including extremely boring errands (Oh, you’re going to the DMV? Can I come?). And I always let her, because I know that for her, time = closeness. Plus, because she’s a Sagittarius, she makes everything ridiculously fun, too!"

      "title": "Physical touch",
      "content": "Physical touch Sagittarius have an innate kinetic nature to them. They’re extremely energetic—next time you hang out with a Sag, see for yourself. Watch them for more than five minutes, and you’ll notice their knee shaking, fingers tapping, or feet pacing the floor. Movement and touch come naturally to them, so it makes sense that this would be the way they’d prefer to give and receive affection, too. They love to be touched and love to be touchy! Have you ever dated a Sagittarius? If you have, the fact that “physical touch” showed up on our list probably didn’t shock you. A friend of mine’s longtime partner is a Sag, and when he’s upset, he has one rule: I don’t want to talk right away—I just want a hug. So sweet, I know! That’s not to say my friend and her partner never talk things through, because they do. But when he’s overwhelmed, a hug can still mean the world. That is classic Sagittarius energy!"

      "title": "Words of affirmation",
      "content": "Words of affirmation Sagittarius are really intellectual, but people don’t always see that right away. Sag is a big-picture thinker—very deep and philosophical. So Sag doesn’t waste time thinking about silly, boring, or shallow things. They seek a deeper meaning and truth in everything, so when someone offers words of affirmation, that can really speak to their soul. But it’s all about the compliment itself. “I really like you,” might not mean much (especially because Sag is a heartthrob, who doesn’t like them?). But “You teach me new things every day…” Now that’ll get a Sag’s attention. Sagittarius is also all about authenticity, so again: their compliments are usually super honest and meaningful. My best friend, for example, would never just say that someone was “nice” or “cool.” But I did once hear her tell someone that they “had a kind, generous energy.” That’s a textbook example of Sagittarius’ words of affirmation! Once a Sagittarius develops feelings for you, they’ll go out of their way to tell you how amazing you are—and you’ll feel amazing too!

      "content": "Plan an adventure. Any time that you carve out an afternoon for your favorite Sag, it’ll go a long way with them. But if you find a way to enjoy one of their favorite activities, it’ll go even further. Find a hiking trail nearby, with a gorgeous view, pack some food, and go enjoy your time! Or, pick a small nearby town and ask Sag to explore the city with you."

      "title": "Write them a sweet, thought-provoking letter.",
      "content": "Write them a sweet, thought-provoking letter. As I mentioned above, if you can appeal to Sag’s intellect as well as their heart, it’ll pull on their heartstrings. Sit down, take a few minutes to reflect, and get writing. When you’re writing a letter to Sag though, surface-level things won’t do. Instead, try to really dig up your deepest thoughts and feelings. Ask yourself a few of these questions to get started: How do I feel when they walk into a room? What is it that I most appreciate about them? What can I say about my friend/partner that would surprise them? What’s most special about them?"

      "title": "Ask if they want a hug.",
      "content": "Ask if they want a hug. If you catch a Sagittarius by surprise with a hug, it’ll be seriously touching to them. This is especially true if they’ve had a bad day—let your fire sign friend know you’re on their team with a quick bear hug. They’ll appreciate your easy show of affection. Your caring reaction might even mean that in the future, they’ll continue to go to you when they’ve had a bad day, which will deepen your bond even more."
