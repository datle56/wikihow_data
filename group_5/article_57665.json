      "content": "Increase your arch. You can do this by finding a low surface close to the ground. (Such as the bottom of a couch.) etc. [1] X Research source Find something that is close to the ground, somewhere you can put your feet under. Carefully, with your knees bent, slide your toes under the opening. (Make sure to cover half of your foot.) When your foot feels comfortable, slowly unbend your knee. Note: be careful, if you don't feel the stretch, try moving your foot more in, or in a different position. Be very careful and patient. If you feel a stretch, that's okay. However, if you feel a pain of any sort, stop! Go as far down as you can, without feeling bad pain. This will stretch your arch greatly. (Don't push yourself too hard, to prevent injury). Keep your foot under for as long as you can. Watch TV, play on your iPad, or do homework, to entertain yourself while stretching. Take quick breaks, to walk around the room, and let your foot become pain free."

      "content": "Try jogging or rotating your foot by the ankle . Also, try waking up your toes by trying to make them go apart and stretching them. Try doing anything that makes your feet warm enough, and your muscles not as tight, a bit loose, ready for action. (You will feel if your muscles are awake). [3] X Research source Before doing any exercises, such as the splits , ( or any kind of exercise ), its important to warm up. So, when you do stretch, your joints and muscles will be relaxed and ready to improve. When getting warmed up , it's easier to stretch and is more effective. You don't want to hurt yourself, because your muscles might not be awake, and when your joints aren't quite ready, you might sprain yourself, or over-stretch a muscle, which is very dangerous, especially to a ballerina. A slow walk that gradually evolves into a light jog is also a great way to warm up."

      "content": "Buy a foot stretcher. Foot stretchers are expensive, and could be anywhere from 30-70 dollars. You can always create your own! (Or follow Step 3!) The method resembles a foot stretcher. [4] X Research source You can also try doing that without a stretcher. Just sit on the floor with your foot out in front of you. Then, lean forward, making sure that your hip, knee, ankle and toe are aligned."

Be patient, and don't push yourself over the limit, you don't want to outstretch a muscle, or hurt yourself badly. (You can end up in the hospital, or worse, a broken bone!

Make sure you have the proper diet. Eating healthy things, and drinking milk is important, because they strengthen your bones. (make sure you aren't allergic to the food you eat!)"

Make sure your knees are straight, and that your whole leg is straight. Now, arch your foot. If your toes touch the ground (while your leg is straight) then congratulations! You have officially mastered your foot arch! If your toes don't touch the ground, you still have some work to do! But don't worry, you will get there!"
