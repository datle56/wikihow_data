Only those with Alexa devices will be shown, and ensure it doesn't match your own name. Your phone may ask you to import your contacts. This needs to be done for the Amazon system to find out who's got an applicable device who can receive these Alexa messages sent to their devices. You will need to confirm this message and give Amazon/Alexa the ability to keep these contacts in sync. You can't add two separate contacts to a message stream, or separate streams into two or more separate conversations. Tap the \"Type your message\" bar. Type your message. If you need separate lines, you can tap your device's Return key on your keyboard. Continue a prior conversation by tapping the contact's name from the list."
