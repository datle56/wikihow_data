      "content": "Purchase a Visa gift card from an online source. Keep in mind that you can't use the card until it's physically shipped to you. Reputable online sources for Visa gift cards include banks and credit unions such as Chase, Navy Federal Credit Union, PNC Bank and Wells Fargo; card centers such as GiftCards.com, Give Card and Gift Card Mall; and money wiring service providers such as Western Union. Use your Visa gift card anywhere Visa debit and credit cards are accepted. Your Visa gift card allows access to the prepaid funds only and does not represent a line of credit. Because of this, attempts to authorize more than the card's remaining balance will be denied. This can cause problems at merchants, such as gas stations, which may authorize more than the actual purchase being made."
