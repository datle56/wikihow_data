Here’s how to clean each type: For removable dispensers: Fill your sink or a bucket with hot water, then pour in 1 cup (236 mL) of distilled white vinegar. Remove the dispensers from your washer and place them in the vinegar solution to soak for 15 minutes. Afterwards, remove the dispensers and use a toothbrush to scrub away any leftover gunk or residue. Put the dispensers back in their places in your washer. For fixed dispensers: Heat up 1 cup (236 mL) of white vinegar on the stove or in the microwave, then pour the hot vinegar into the dispensers. Allow it to soak for 15 minutes to remove residue. If any gunk remains afterward, use a toothbrush to scrub it off. [6] X Research source"

House cleaning professional Chris Willatt explains that this filter can easily become clogged with lint and old laundry detergent residue, so it’s important to clean it if your machine does have one. Here’s how: Start by removing the filter. It should either be located along the top rim of the tub or inside the center agitator. If you can’t find it in either of these places, check near the water pump or at the end of the drainage hose. [7] X Research source Next, fill your sink or a bucket with hot water and 1 cup (236 mL) of vinegar. Submerge the filter in the vinegar and water solution and allow it to soak for 15 minutes. Scrub the filter with a toothbrush to remove any gunk or residue. If your filter was in the center agitator, dip the toothbrush in the water and vinegar solution and scrub the inside of the agitator as well. Replace the lint filter. Note: Some lint filters may not be removable. If yours isn’t, use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe away trapped dirt and lint, then scrub the mesh with a toothbrush dipped in heated white vinegar.

Wipe all of these areas down with your microfiber cloth.

      "content": "Clean your top loading washing machine twice per year. For most machines that see a regular amount of use, a thorough cleaning once every 6 months should be enough, says Matuska. She explains, however, that there are a few circumstances that would require more frequent cleanings. If you use your machine super often, live in a very humid area, or have hard water, you may want to wash your machine once every 3 months, instead. It’s important to deep clean your washing machine because mildew, laundry detergent residue, dirt, and germs can build up in your machine over time. When this happens, your machine may develop odors, and it won’t clean your clothes as well. Your machine’s lint filter can also get clogged if it isn’t cleaned regularly, which means dirt particles and lint may remain on your clothes after they’re washed. [17] X Research source If your machine is super smelly, try a monthly cleaning with an Affresh tablet (in addition to your regular deep cleanings). They’re made of sodium carbonate (washing soda) and sodium percarbonate (oxygen bleach), and they can keep your machine smelling fresh. [18] X Research source If you live in an area with hard water, follow up your deep cleanings with a wash cycle using vinegar and baking soda to remove mineral residue."

Unfortunately, this can lead to a buildup of gunk and residue in your machine, and it doesn’t actually make your clothes get any cleaner or softer. To keep your machine as fresh as possible between washes, be sure to use only the recommended amount of these products. [19] X Research source"
