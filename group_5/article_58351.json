      "content": "Pick someone to shuffle and deal the cards for the first round. Go Fish is great because it can be played with as few as 2 players and up to as many as 6 players. The dealer could be the person whose birthday is coming up next, the person who won the last game, or someone else you choose. [1] X Research source Try to take turns being the dealer so that one person doesn’t get stuck doing it every time."

      "title": "Have the dealer shuffle and deal the cards out to each player.",
      "content": "Have the dealer shuffle and deal the cards out to each player. If there are 2-3 players, each person should get 7 cards. If there are 4 or more players, each person should get 5 cards. [2] X Research source Remove all the jokers from the deck before you shuffle and deal the cards. It’s okay to look at your cards! Just keep your hand hidden from the other players so they can’t see what you got."

      "title": "Spread the rest of the cards out face-down in the middle of the table.",
      "content": "Spread the rest of the cards out face-down in the middle of the table. This creates the “fishing pond.” Make sure all of the cards stay face-down so that no one can peek. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of room at the table, just stack the cards face-down in the middle. When someone has to “go fish,” they can just pick up the top card from the deck."

      "title": "Start your turn by asking one player if they have a specific card.",
      "content": "Start your turn by asking one player if they have a specific card. Take a look at the cards in your hand and choose to ask about cards you already have multiples of so you can make matches quicker. For example, if you have 2 jacks in your hand, you only need 2 more to make a match. The main thing to remember is that you can only ask one person at a time, and you can only ask about one rank of card at a time. [5] X Research source The “rank of the card” means the number and not the suit. It doesn’t matter if the person has a jack of hearts or a jack of diamonds; if they have any jack at all, they must give it to you. You can only ask for a specific card if you have one or more of them in your hand already. For example, you can’t ask for threes if you don’t have a three in your hand. Keep in mind that once you ask about a specific card, the other players will know that you have that card in your hand. You can all strategize and try to keep track of who has what to give you the advantage in the game."

If you keep getting lucky and finding the cards you need to make matches, you could possibly take several turns in a row before having to “go fish” and pass the turn to the next player. You can ask the same person about a different card, or ask a new person. [7] X Research source Remember that you’re trying to make matches from the cards you have in your own hand."

If the person asked you for all of your queens and you don’t have any, tell them to “go fish.” The turn then passes to the next player. [8] X Research source It can be fun to order people to “go fish,” but remember to do it with a friendly attitude. After all, you’re playing a game with your friends!"

It’ll give you more cards to play with and could help you get more matches. [9] X Research source You have to keep the card you pulled, even if it isn’t one you want. You can’t throw it back and pick another one."

As soon as you get one, you have to lay it down in front of you so that everyone can see it. In many variations of Go Fish, the person who gets rid of all their cards first wins the game, so it’s a good idea to make matches as quickly as possible. [10] X Research source In some variations of the game, 2-card matches can be played instead of 4-of-a-kind matches. Sets of 4 are often called “books.”"

You could always decide that the person with the most matches at that time won the game, or it could just be a draw. [14] X Research source You could also choose to keep playing even after the fishing pond is empty. You’ll just take turns trying to get cards from your opponents without having to “go fish” at the end of your turn."
