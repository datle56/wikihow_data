      "content": "Overall, Scorpio and Aquarius are a fiery, intense match. Since they’re both fixed signs, they’ll bond over their need for stability, and find comfort in the fact that they can rely on each other. Both deeply intelligent, these two will have a lot to learn from each other, which will make their relationship exciting and dramatic at the same time. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Aquarius in particular likes to experiment in the bedroom, and Scorpio is no stranger to trying new things. Their opposite elemental energies create a tension that explodes in the bedroom, and there’s a good chance that the pairing will have a healthy, fulfilling sex life. [2] X Research source Both signs usually accept the other without judgment, which is what makes their sex life so great. They’ll both feel comfortable bringing up new things to try without the fear of being laughed at. Scorpio is co-ruled by Mars and Pluto, the planets of passion and energy."

      "content": "The two signs need to meet each other in the middle when it comes to emotions. Scorpio is a water sign, so they’re very in tune with their feelings (and very good at expressing them, too). On the flip side, Aquarius is an air sign, which can mean they are more aloof and logical. Fortunately, with good communication and a little understanding from both parties, they can solve their differences and meet each other halfway. [3] X Research source Aquarius really needs to work on expressing themselves, and Scorpio needs to learn not to take Aquarius’s silence so personally."

      "title": "This pairing will always find a new topic to talk about.",
      "content": "This pairing will always find a new topic to talk about. Both Scorpio and Aquarius aren’t huge fans of small talk—they’d rather talk about the origins of the universe or their life goals. Ultimately, this is what will hold the couple together, since they’ll never run out of ideas to share or things to discuss. [4] X Research source Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of innovation and technology. They’ll love discussing exciting new things with their Scorpio partner. Problems may arise if they stumble across a topic that they disagree about. Both Scorpio and Aquarius tend to be stubborn, and they aren’t likely to change their ways just because their partner has a different opinion."

      "title": "Scorpio’s communication is emotions-based, while Aquarius’s is more logical.",
      "content": "Scorpio’s communication is emotions-based, while Aquarius’s is more logical. Their communication styles reflect that—Scorpio will be more willing to discuss things right away, while Aquarius might need more time to process. If the two can give each other space and make room for one another, then they can work through any issues and communicate effectively. [5] X Research source Scorpio also needs to be careful not to dominate over the more easygoing, friendly Aquarius. Scorpio has a tendency to take over a conversation, which can make communication feel one-sided."

      "title": "Scorpios can be jealous, which doesn’t mesh with Aquarius’s free spirit.",
      "content": "Scorpios can be jealous, which doesn’t mesh with Aquarius’s free spirit. Although both signs value loyalty, Aquarius tends to hold their personal freedom above that. If the Scorpio tries to control them or hold them back in any way, an Aquarius might just cut ties. [6] X Research source Communication is key here. The Scorpio needs to let the Aquarius know about their boundaries, and the Aquarius needs to tell the Scorpio when they’re feeling smothered. Reader Poll: We asked 485 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios what they value most in a relationship, and 69% of them agreed that loyalty is most important to them. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Neither sign likes to change, which can make difficulties tough to work through. The thing that brings this pairing together can also tear them apart. If the Scorpio-Aquarius match encounters an issue that requires compromise , they’re not going to be happy. Fortunately, they can work on being flexible and meeting each other in the middle to make this partnership work."
