      "content": "Hold the lid lock still, then twist the top of the pump to the left. Use two fingers to tightly grab the lock, which is under the groove on the pump, then firmly grasp the top of the pump with your other hand. Slowly turn the pump counterclockwise while keeping the lock completely still. When it’s unlocked, the pump will spring up. [1] X Research source The pump mechanism has three parts, the bottom (which screws onto the bottle), then the pump and lid lock, which are connected. Be careful to not unscrew the entire mechanism from the bottle while twisting the pump."

      "content": "Remove the pump from the bottle to get a better grip. If you’re having issues opening the lock, take the whole thing out of the bottle, wipe the body wash off with a paper towel, then grab the bottom two parts of the mechanism and twist the pump counterclockwise. [2] X Research source Hold on to the bottom parts with a tissue or paper towel to get an even tighter grip."

      "content": "Grip the top of the tubing while twisting the pump. Some people find that holding the top of the tube (right below where the pump screws onto the bottle) instead of the lower parts of the mechanism can make it easier to open. Squeeze the top of the tubing with your finger and thumb, then turn the top counterclockwise. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap a rubber band around the lock before twisting.",
      "content": "Wrap a rubber band around the lock before twisting. Since the lock is so small, it can be hard to grab onto. Make it easier by wrapping a rubber band around the lock without getting it stuck in the groove (this might take a few tries). Hold the lock steady, and turn the pump counterclockwise.

      "content": "Run the pump under hot water while turning it counterclockwise. Occasionally, body wash can get into the mechanism and cause it to get stuck. If you’re still having trouble, run hot water over the pump while holding the lid lock steady and twisting the top counterclockwise."
