      "content": "Wait until the penis has become fully erect. Just as with someone who is circumcised , you should always wait until the penis is fully erect and ready for sexual activity before attempting to put on the condom. If you try to put a condom on a non-erect penis, it can result in the condom sliding up, down, or off the penis. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a drop of lubricant. Place a small drop of water-based lubricant on the inside of the condom in the reservoir tip before you unroll it. Water-based lubricant can make it easier for you or your partner to roll the condom onto the penis. It can also increase the sensations he feels during sex . [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure you put just a small amount of lube in the reservoir tip. Using more lube could take up too much space in the reservoir tip, and leave little to no room for semen. Use water-based lube only. An oil-based lube can damage the latex condom, and increase the risk for pregnancy and the transmission of STDs."

      "title": "Pull back the foreskin.",
      "content": "Pull back the foreskin. Before you put the condom on, gently pull back the foreskin. Pull it back until the head of the penis is fully exposed. Remember this is a very sensitive area, so be extra gentle. Pulling back the foreskin will make it easier for you to get the condom on properly. Generally the foreskin will remain securely retracted one you have rolled it down off the head of the penis . If it rolls back up again before you get the condom, just roll it down and try again."

      "title": "Pinch the reservoir tip of the condom.",
      "content": "Pinch the reservoir tip of the condom. When you have rolled the foreskin right down the head of the penis it will, in most instances, remain retracted without you having hold it. Once the foreskin is secure below the head you will have both hands free and are ready to put the condom on. Before you roll the condom down the penis, use one hand to pinch the reservoir tip of the condom. This will help remove air from the condom, and prevent air from getting trapped as you roll on the condom."

      "title": "Know what to do if the foreskin doesn't roll down.",
      "content": "Know what to do if the foreskin doesn't roll down. For some men the foreskin is too tight on the head of the penis to be able to roll all the way down the head. Men who are unable to roll the foreskin down may have a condition known as Phimosis. This in itself is nothing to worry about, and if you cannot roll down the foreskin, then you should just roll the condom down your penis and not worry about rolling down the foreskin. Whether or not you are able to pull the foreskin back should not increase the likelihood of the condom breaking or slipping. Slipping is normally only an issue when the man has troubling maintaining an erection . If your Phimosis is causing you difficulty, such as pain during sex, infection or impeding urination, there are some treatments available that you can discuss with your doctor.

      "content": "Roll the condom down his penis. As you pinch the tip of the condom with one hand, use the other hand to roll the condom down to the base of the penis. Your foreskin should remain retracted while you are unrolling the condom. You will be able to release the end of the condom you are pinching as you roll it down the penis."

      "content": "Push the foreskin gently back toward the tip of the penis. Once you have rolled the condom down to the base of the penis you can ease the foreskin back over the head. Hold onto the base of the condom with one hand, to prevent the condom from sliding off, and gently push the foreskin back up towards the head of the penis. This will allow for more free movement of the foreskin during sexual activity, and could even help enhance your partnerâ€™s pleasure. [4] X Research source"
