      "content": "The longer you wait the harder it’ll be. No matter how long you may or may not have been leading a guy on, as soon as you get a sense that he’s interested in being more than just friends, it’s time to have the talk. Don’t put it off or try to ignore it or he could get the wrong impression and continue to pursue you. [1] X Research source Ignoring the problem won’t make it go away! It’s also really unkind to let a guy think he has a chance when he doesn’t. Think of it like a band-aid. The sooner you can rip it off, the better."
