      "title": "Look for blotchy patterns.",
      "content": "Look for blotchy patterns. Classic tabby cats tend to have blotchy patterns across the body, leading some people to colloquially refer to classic tabbies as \"blotched tabbies\". [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for wide stripes.",
      "content": "Look for wide stripes. The stripes on a classic tabby cat tend to be wider and thicker than on other varieties of tabbies. Those thicker lines can contribute to the blotchy pattern that is characteristic of classic tabbies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Observe swirling lines.",
      "content": "Observe swirling lines. The distinct tabby lines appear circular or swirling on classic tabbies. On some cats they may even resemble a bullseye pattern. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the color.",
      "content": "Check the color. Typical tabby cats have black stripes over an otherwise brown coat. Other color variations do occur, but these typically have the qualifying color added before the word tabby, such as a ginger or red tabby (shades of orange and white) or a blue tabby (gray and white)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the spine pattern.",
      "content": "Look at the spine pattern. The most distinct characteristic of mackerel tabbies is the spinal pattern. The stripes that run down the length of the body all extend from a single stripe that covers the cat's spine. Because of the way the cat's body stripes branch off from the spinal stripe, some mackerel tabbies bear a slight resemblance to a fish skeleton, hence the name mackerel. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for thin stripes.",
      "content": "Look for thin stripes. The stripes on a mackerel tabby tend to be very narrow, unlike the wide, swirling stripes of the classic tabby."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notice the unbroken pattern.",
      "content": "Notice the unbroken pattern. Mackerel tabbies typically have unbroken lines that are evenly spaced. These stripes tend to run down both sides of the body in a top-to-bottom formation. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look closely at the hair.",
      "content": "Look closely at the hair. Unlike other tabbies, ticked tabby cats do not typically have body stripes. Instead, each individual hair on a ticked tabby has stripes or bands of color variation. This is the tell-tale sign of a ticked tabby."

    {
      "title": "Look for unmistakable facial patterns.",
      "content": "Look for unmistakable facial patterns. Though ticked tabbies may not look like a typical tabby cat, they still exhibit the same distinct facial patterns. Look for the \"M\" on the forehead and light pencil marks on either side of the face. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Observe the semi-transparent quality of hair.",
      "content": "Observe the semi-transparent quality of hair. Not all ticked tabbies have translucent coats, but some, like those in the Abyssinian breed, do have semi-translucent hair. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Notice the broken lines.",
      "content": "Notice the broken lines. Spotted cats earned their name because of the broken lines in their coat patterns. This \"broken\" coat pattern may cause the lines to appear as spots, though this cat is still very much a tabby."

    {
      "title": "Observe the variance in spots.",
      "content": "Observe the variance in spots. The \"spots\" on the spotted tabby's coat can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They may be large or small, and may appear to be round, ovular, or rose-shaped. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't confuse the spotted tabby and mackerel tabby.",
      "content": "Don't confuse the spotted tabby and mackerel tabby. Though every spotted tabby's coat will be slightly different, some may be easily confused with a mackerel tabby. Certain spotted tabbies may have \"spots\" that extend from a spinal stripe, like the mackerel tabby. The difference is that a spotted tabby will still have a more blotchy or spotted appearance.

      "content": "Notice blended characteristics. Tortoiseshell/patched tabbies typically have tabby markings combined with another type of coat pattern. Tortoiseshell tabbies may exhibit any of the primary four tabby markings as the tabby component of his coat."

      "title": "Look for hints of brown and red tabby combined.",
      "content": "Look for hints of brown and red tabby combined. Your cat is a tortoiseshell tabby if its coat has hair that is definitely ginger in addition to brown tabby spots or stripes. [9] X Research source"
