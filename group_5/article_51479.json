      "content": "Capricorns are often resistant to showing their emotions. In a relationship, they may show their feelings in other ways, like giving gifts, doing favors, and complimenting their partner's work. Since these two signs are so similar, they may be more inclined to open up to each other and get out of their comfort zone. This will help the two of them deepen their relationship and really fall in love. Capricorns are known for their serious nature, so it's important that these two have some fun and remember to share their positive feelings, too."

      "content": "These signs may need to experiment to liven up their sex life. Capricorns sometimes struggle with vulnerability and may not be super romantic or affectionate in the bedroom. A more spontaneous sign might bring out a different side of them, but this may be difficult in a Capricorn/Capricorn relationship. These signs will benefit from talking openly about their desires and thinking out-of-the-box to avoid getting too predictable. [4] X Research source As two cardinal signs, it's possible both partners will want to take the lead in the bedroom. It's important that these signs listen to each other and take turns being in control."

      "content": "These signs are so similar that they may forget to communicate. It's important that these two voice what's on their mind and take a break from their goals to address any relationship issues. Otherwise, their relationship may grow distant. To avoid this fate, both signs will need to voice their thoughts and address any concerns directly. Being honest and direct will help them discover new things about each other and forge a deeper bond. Capricorns can be a little stubborn (they're represented by the persistent sea-goat, after all). If this couple runs into any disagreements, it's important that they listen to one another and avoid making snap judgments.

      "content": "Capricorns are very loyal to each other. These two share a high amount of respect for each other, which will help them trust one another effortlessly. Ruled by Saturn, the planet of rules and boundaries, they'll find it pretty easy to agree on the kind of relationship that they want. Still, it's important that these two talk openly about their expectations. Otherwise, they may start to feel distant and unfamiliar with each other. [6] X Research source Though these partners will likely remain faithful to each other, they might struggle to be totally truthful about their feelings. These two will need to remember that vulnerability and honesty are vital to a healthy relationship."

      "title": "Cons:",
      "content": "Cons: This relationship may get a little dull if they don't work to keep the spark alive. They may get so accustomed to their routine that they forget a relationship is supposed to be fun! To make things more exciting, it's important that they add an element of spontaneity to their day-to-day life together. Whether that's experimenting in the bedroom or taking the day off from work, both partners will be happier if they let loose and relax."
