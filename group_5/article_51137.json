      "content": "The no contact rule is a 30 day period where you don’t talk to your ex. That means absolutely no communication whatsoever—no texting, calling, messaging on social media, visiting, sending letters, and anything else that can get you in contact with your ex! [1] X Research source This is definitely tricky, especially right after a breakup, but the no contact rule is meant to either help you get your ex back or give you time to move on . [2] X Research source If you want to get your ex back, the no contact rule will make your ex miss you. By giving your ex space, they may long for you. This can help you persuade them to take you back. If you want to move on from your ex, the no contact rule lets you experience life without your ex. It’ll give you time to gather your thoughts and process your emotions. You don’t necessarily need your ex’s permission to start the no contact rule, but giving them a heads up never hurts."

      "title": "You want to extend the no-contact agreement.",
      "content": "You want to extend the no-contact agreement. Typically, the no contact rule lasts at least 30 days, but it can go on for as long as you like. You are the one setting the rules, so if you need more time to process things, let your ex know that. [3] X Research source Send them a quick, brief text letting them know that you want to extend your no contact period. “Hey, I wanted to let you know that I’m extending the no contact period for another 30 days. I need more time to think. Thanks for understanding.” “I think it would be best if we extend our no contact rule for another 30 days. I’ll reach out to you when I’m ready to talk.”"

      "title": "You live or work with your ex.",
      "content": "You live or work with your ex. Being in close quarters with your ex may make following the no contact rule difficult. Completely avoiding your ex when you’re in the same space is just not ideal. Limited contact may be an idea if you’re in this situation. Tell your ex how you’re feeling and lay out some ground rules. Try only talking to each other about daily chores or job duties."

      "content": "Break the rule if children are involved and you need to discuss care issues. If you have kids with your ex, following the no contact rule may not be possible. You have a family to look out for, and even if you hate the idea of talking to your ex, you may need help caring for your children. [4] X Research source Maintain boundaries by limiting contact with your ex. Try to only talk to them about your children or care issues."

      "title": "You might need to call your ex if there's an emergency.",
      "content": "You might need to call your ex if there's an emergency. No one can predict the future, and it may be worth breaking the no contact rule if your ex is the only one you can call. Say you are in an accident or need help immediately. If your ex is the only one close enough to get to you in a time of emergency, call them. Your safety is more important than following the no contact rule. If calling your ex would put you in more danger, do not call them. Your well-being is the number one priority."

      "title": "Choose a public place to meet in-person.",
      "content": "Choose a public place to meet in-person. This way there will be no temptation to make-up in any way that is more than friendly or explicitly mean. Talking face-to-face will help you and your ex listen to each other and be aware of each other’s emotions. A public space will also help you both be courteous about what you’re saying, avoiding any potential explosions of rage or affection. [5] X Research source Try meeting up at a coffee shop, local restaurant, or park. Talking while you eat can help calm your nerves and give you something else to focus on if the conversation gets tense."

      "content": "Set ground rules to make for a smooth transition. Let your ex know exactly what you want to talk about before you meet. Making sure everyone is on the same page will make the meeting go smoothly. Tell them how long you want to chat and what you want to work out. Things can go much more smoothly if you’re both on the same page! [6] X Research source Set a time limit for catching up. This way no one will take up more than the time necessary to fill the other person in. Try to avoid dragging out your meeting time. You want to keep things short and simple for your and your ex’s sake. Focus on topics like your relationship moving forward, if you’ll be in contact with each other, and what the next step should be."

      "content": "Be honest with your ex. Honesty is the best policy, especially when it comes to relationships. Tell your ex exactly what’s on your mind—no mind games or false promises. When you’re talking with them, focus on yourself by using “I” statements. It can be easy to point the finger, but frame your language around your wants and needs moving forward. [7] X Research source “I think it would be best if we’re just friends.” “I want to try being in a relationship with you.” “I need some more time to think.” Be clear and concise with what you have to say.

[8] X Research source Actively listen to what your ex has to say by reflecting on what they say and reacting appropriately. If you agree with what they’re saying, nod. If you need them to clarify something, ask. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Let your ex be the first one to break the no contact rule, especially if you’re following it to try and get them back. It’s easy to fall into a pattern of worrying about what other people think, but if reaching out to your ex and breaking the no contact rule is what’s best for you, do it.

[13] X Research source Remember why you started a no contact period. Did you start it to heal? To try and win your ex back? You’re nearing the finishing line—you just gotta keep going!"
