      "content": "The third date can sound intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be! For many people, the idea of a third date scares them; you’ve moved past the awkward stage and now you’re getting to know each other a little more. Take the pressure off yourself by letting go of your expectations—whatever happens will happen. [1] X Research source Dating is all about getting to know someone else and deciding if you two are a good fit. The less pressure you put on yourself to “do well,” the better you’ll do."

      "content": "Focus on the date instead of thinking about the future. When you put a ton of pressure on the third date, you’re bound to be a little anxious. Instead of thinking about what might happen or how things could go wrong, focus on what’s happening in front of you right now. Take a few deep breaths and feel your feet touching the ground below you. When you calm your anxiety, your third date is much more likely to go well. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "You don’t have to get intimate on the third date if you don’t want to.",
      "content": "You don’t have to get intimate on the third date if you don’t want to. If you’ve heard of the “third date rule,” you might be feeling nervous—this rule assumes that everyone wants to have sex on the third date. However, it’s up to you how far you want to go with your date, so set those boundaries for yourself ahead of time. [3] X Research source It’s good to have boundaries in your head so that you can enforce them if you need to. For instance, you might be okay with kissing or making out, but you don’t want to have sex just yet. You could say something like, “I really like making out with you, but I’m just not ready to go any further right now. I hope you understand.”"

    {
      "title": "Go somewhere you and your date can really be yourselves.",
      "content": "Go somewhere you and your date can really be yourselves. Fancy dinners or crowded bars are okay for the first or second dates, but the third date can be a little bit more chill. Head to a food truck, have a picnic outside, or pick a secluded bar where you two can talk freely. [4] X Research source If you’re choosing the date location, pick somewhere that you feel comfortable. That way, you’ll reduce your anxiety and show off your true personality. Try not to get into a routine! Be creative with date ideas, with a little bit of space in between each date."

    {
      "title": "The third date is when you can really start to open up.",
      "content": "The third date is when you can really start to open up. If you were putting on a bit of a façade for your first two dates (let’s be honest—who hasn’t?), now’s the time to drop it. Show your date the real you so that you two can figure out if you’re truly compatible or not. [5] X Research source Love telling puns? Throw a couple at your date to see how they react. Have an outlandish fashion sense? Put on your best outfit that makes you feel cool and confident."

      "title": "This question could make or break your future relationship.",
      "content": "This question could make or break your future relationship. If you two don’t want the same thing, it’s better to find out now than to lead each other on. If you haven’t already, talk about what you’re looking for on this date so that you’re both on the same page. [6] X Research source Try something like, “I’m looking for someone to commit to. How about you?” or, “Are you looking for something serious, or are you trying to do something a little more casual?”"

      "content": "Dive a little deeper into who they are as a person. You’ve probably gotten all of the surface level stuff out of the way on your first two dates. Now it’s time to talk about your families, your childhood, and your visions for the future. Try asking things like: [7] X Research source “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” “Are you close to your family?” “Who’s the most important person in your life?”"

    {
      "title": "Let your date know that you’re interested in them the whole time.",
      "content": "Let your date know that you’re interested in them the whole time. If your date thinks you don’t like them that much, they may give up pursuing you after the third date. Compliment your date, give them lots of eye contact, and break the touch barrier by patting them on the arm or holding their hand. [8] X Research source Use compliments like, “I love your eyes,” or, “Your smile is so beautiful.” Remember that compliments don't always have to be about physical attributes."

      "title": "Let the sparks fly naturally to see if you two are compatible.",
      "content": "Let the sparks fly naturally to see if you two are compatible. This is something that you don’t really have to try hard to do—if you two like each other, the chemistry will be obvious. Take stock of how you two get along and how well the conversation flows. If all is going good, then you’re probably going to make it past the third date. [9] X Research source On the other hand, if things seem a little stilted or your date doesn’t seem that into you, don’t sweat it. It just means that you two aren’t compatible, and that’s okay."

      "title": "Show your date that you’re interested in taking them out again.",
      "content": "Show your date that you’re interested in taking them out again. Talk about events you could go to or places you want to take them to so that they realize you’re serious. You don’t have to do this the whole time, but if it works into the conversation naturally, that’s great! [10] X Research source Maybe you’re talking about the state fair that happens every summer. You could say, “We should totally go to that next month!” Or, if you’re talking about a town you’ve never been to, you might say, “I’d love to take you there.” Reader Poll: We asked 1546 wikiHow readers when is the best time to ask for another date, and 53% of them agreed it's best to ask within a few days to a week after the previous date.

      "content": "If the third date went well, don’t wait to reach out. Texting or calling your date right after shows that you meant what you said about your future plans. Once the third date is over, tell your date how much fun you had, then follow through on making plans to hang out again soon. [11] X Research source You could text them something like, “Hey! I had a lot of fun last night. Let me know if you’re free anytime next week; I’d love to see you again.” Mentioning a nice moment on the date you just had is always an excellent way to finish the night with a great memory for both of you!"
