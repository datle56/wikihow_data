You can only use this method if the expressions you are multiplying have the same base. For example, you can use this method to multiply 5 2 × 5 3 {\\displaystyle 5^{2}\\times 5^{3}} , because they both have the same base (5). On the other hand, you cannot use this method to multiply 5 2 × 2 3 {\\displaystyle 5^{2}\\times 2^{3}} , because they have different bases (5 and 2)."

Calculate the exponent using a calculator or by hand. Remember, an exponent tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself. For example, if you are multiplying 2 3 × 4 5 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}\\times 4^{5}} , you should note that they do not have the same base.
