      "content": "Hyper empathy occurs when you feel empathy too intensely. It means that you likely take on other people’s feelings as if they were your own, to an excessive and often distressing degree. [1] X Research source Empathy, or the ability to sense other people’s emotions and imagine what they’re feeling, is an important part of human relationships, but when you become too in-tune with other people’s emotions, it can cause you anxiety or stress. [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Although many people use the terms “hyper-empathy syndrome” and “empathy disorder” to describe over-empathizing, these are not officially-recognized psychiatric diagnoses."

      "content": "Empaths are more likely to experience hyper-empathy. An “empath” is someone who can feel other people’s emotions and understand their feelings deeply (though this is not an official psychiatric term). [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It can be hard to distinguish between a person who experiences empathy and a full-fledged empath. One difference could be that a person with empathy feels compassion for someone in pain, while an empath feels the other person’s pain as their own. [4] X Research source Based on this definition, empaths are likely more susceptible to hyper-empathy because they naturally take on the feelings of others."

      "content": "Affective Empathy Affective empathy refers to the feelings you experience in response to other people’s emotions. Affective empathy can include mirroring other people’s feelings, or taking on their suffering.

      "title": "Compassionate Empathy",
      "content": "Compassionate Empathy While empathy involves taking on another person’s suffering as your own, compassion involves feeling concerned for another person's suffering, which leads to a desire to help. [7] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Compassionate empathy combines these two things together. When someone is suffering, you empathically feel their pain, but instead of wallowing in the suffering with them, you feel a desire to help alleviate their suffering. This helps you focus on problem-solving and support, rather than your own experience of the other person's pain."

      "content": "You take on other people’s emotions as if they were your own. If you’re hyper-empathetic, you experience the feelings of others to an intense degree. Whether they're experiencing joy, fear, excitement, or sadness, you feel that emotion in your own body. [8] X Research source It can be a good thing to share in others’ positive feelings, but taking on their negative feelings can be draining. It’s important to focus on balancing your own emotions with the emotions of others. If you start feeling another person's distress as if it were your own, pause and take a deep breath. Try to identify your own feelings, and focus on separating them from the other person's feelings. Remind yourself that you’re there to show support and kindness, but not to take on their suffering completely."

[9] X Research source This means that you could experience some of the physical symptoms of stress and anxiety, including nausea, upset stomach, appetite loss, exhaustion, or difficulty sleeping. You might also experience emotional symptoms, such as sadness, depression, or frustration. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you experience physical and emotional symptoms in your own body when a loved one is suffering, don’t forget to take care of yourself, too!

      "content": "You neglect your own needs or feelings to help others. If you experience hyper-empathy, you tend to be so focused on other people’s needs that you compromise your own. [11] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For example, if you have a friend who is going through a difficult breakup, you could stay up all night comforting them and talking through their feelings, leaving you exhausted at work the next day. Consistently prioritizing others’ feelings over your own can lead to difficulties like generalized anxiety or low-level depression.

Because it’s your instinct to understand and empathize with others, you might have trouble asserting yourself in disagreements. You naturally understand where the other person is coming from, and you’re quick to accept that they’re right. In extreme cases, over-empathizing can leave you vulnerable to gaslighting because you deny your own perspective of a situation in favor of the other person’s perspective. [13] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For example, you might immediately believe someone when they say you’re being too sensitive, even if you’re having a perfectly normal reaction to a situation.

Developing self-awareness can take time, especially when you’re naturally inclined to prioritize other people’s emotions. Show yourself some grace and be patient as you’re getting to know your own needs. Try journaling. It can be cathartic to write your feelings down, and it can help you learn more about the way you process things.

Because of this, it’s extra important for you to prioritize self-care and schedule it into your routine.

It could also mean incorporating relaxing activities, like taking a yoga class or going on a walk in nature, into your schedule.

      "content": "Set healthy boundaries. It’s especially important for hyper-empathic people to set boundaries around the amount of time and energy they can give to others. Otherwise, you might keep giving and giving even if you're feeling emotionally depleted or fatigued. [19] X Research source First, decide how much time and energy you feel capable of giving to others while still taking care of your own needs. Once you’ve identified your boundaries, communicate them to your friends and family and do your best to stick to them. For example, you might decide you have enough energy for one social outing per week, or that you always need to be home from social gatherings by midnight. Or, you could decide that you need at least one weekend per month where you don't have any social commitments, so you can focus on self-care."
