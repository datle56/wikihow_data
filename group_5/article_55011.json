      "title": "Do you mainly experience the twitch when you’re nervous?",
      "content": "Do you mainly experience the twitch when you’re nervous? How do things like public speaking, talking to an authority figure, or similar stressful situations affect it? Is it more likely to happen when you’ve got a lot on your plate at work or in response to other anxiety triggers? What about other emotions, such as being amused, excited, or overjoyed? Keep a journal to track when and where the tic happens. Compare your notes on when it happens in the present to when and where you remember it happening in the past. You may want to see a psychiatrist if the cause of your twitch is from stress and anxiety. He/she maybe able to help you with anti-anxiety medication in order to relieve stress."

      "content": "Some deficiencies can lead to twitching. A well-balanced diet can potentially stop a tic within days. [2] X Research source Make sure you're eating enough leafy greens and nuts for magnesium, and bananas for potassium. Consider taking a supplement for these specific minerals, or a general multivitamin. [3] X Research source If you suspect that you’ve got some gaps in your diet, you should first see your primary care physician (PCP) or go to a clinic. A doctor can order a complete blood count and other standard tests to confirm any dietary issues. [4] X Research source Omitting or limiting your sugar and caffeine intake are additional steps you should take to get rid of a nose or mouth twitch. Drinking the recommended amount of water for your body size is also recommended. A good general rule is to drink eight 8 oz glasses of pure water every day. Drinks with caffeine and alcohol in them do not count as part of your daily water consumption."

Use gentle, circular motions with your fingertips. [6] X Research source Put on soothing music and use slow, deliberate breathing exercises to relax yourself.

      "content": "Replace it with a voluntary movement. It might cause discomfort to suppress a tic, but it can be possible to delay the motion. [7] X Research source Work on holding it back if it makes you self-conscious in social situations. Concentrate on refocusing the energy that gives rise to the tic to another part of your body, and release the energy using a different movement. Some therapists try to have you refocus or distract yourself when you are having the tic, such as by diverting your attention onto something else. For example, you might place your feet flat on the ground and pay attention to how this feels, count down from 100, or rub a penny between your fingers."

      "title": "It may go away on its own, especially in children.",
      "content": "It may go away on its own, especially in children. If your child is experiencing a nose or mouth twitch, sometimes the best solution is to ignore it. Calling attention to it might actually trigger it or harm self-esteem. Tics are common in children: up to one in four develop a tic that lasts between one month and one year before puberty. [8] X Research source http:/www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/badhabit.htm#tics Consider your child’s age and when the tic started occurring. If any vocal tics or complex involuntary movements accompany a facial twitch, you should see your child’s pediatrician rather than ignore these symptoms. In combination, they can indicate neurological disorders such as Tourette syndrome. Having a tic may also lead to a lack of socialization and stress for the child."

You should contact your PCP or visit a health clinic if home remedies don't work, or if your symptoms don't go away or worsen over time. You should also see your doctor to confirm a potential cause, such as diet or drug use, prescribed or otherwise.

[11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A facial tic or twitch could indicate Bell's Palsy, a non-specific diagnosis for sudden paralysis, weakness, or other symptoms associated with nerve damage in the face.

      "content": "Ask your PCP for a recommendation. If you suspect anxiety or a related psychological factor is the root of your facial twitch, consult a psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed therapist. Triggers can either be situational, like a break-up or stress at work, or more global in nature, such as a diagnosed mental health disorder. Note any history of such diagnoses with the mental health professional you consult. Remember, no two people have the same emotional and psychological lives. Do not feel shame in seeking help or seeing a therapist. The twitch might go away as soon as you get your stress off your chest. If your nose or mouth tic is related to drug or alcohol abuse you should talk to a mental health or substance abuse professional. Look online for county or state programs that offer free or income-based counseling programs."
