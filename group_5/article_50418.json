You may have heard the phrase, \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" Snapchat offers users a way to skip the small talk and get to know someone through pictures or videos. For people looking for love online, it may be a better tactic than exchanging dry messages back and forth. You can add text to each photo, send cute short videos, bitmojis, or text. An example bio could say, \"Desk worker by day. Partier by night. I like exploring new dive bars and clubs and snapping pictures under the neon lights. If you're looking for a good time, amosc: @neonight123\""
