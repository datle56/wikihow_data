      "content": "Peel the potatoes. Wash the potatoes well in cold water, then peel using a small knife or a vegetable peeler. Russet potatoes, or other potatoes with a high starch content, work best for hash browns."

      "content": "Shred the potatoes. Line a bowl with a clean dishtowel, then shred the potatoes directly into the towel-lined bowl, using a cheese grater."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze out the moisture.",
      "content": "Squeeze out the moisture. You must squeeze out as much moisture as possible from the shredded potatoes. This is the most important step in achieving crispy (rather than mushy) hash browns. To do this, gather the corners of the dishtowel containing the shredded potatoes and twist the neck until you form a tight package. Continue twisting the cloth and squishing the potato in your fist until you've squeezed as much liquid as you can from the potato. Alternatively, you can try squeezing the moisture from the potatoes using a potato ricer. You do not need to force the potatoes through the ricer, simply use it to press out the moisture."

      "title": "Heat the skillet.",
      "content": "Heat the skillet. Heat a large skillet pan (preferably cast iron) over a medium-high heat. Add the butter to the pan and allow to melt. Once the butter has melted, add the dry, shredded potatoes to the pan and toss to coat with butter. Season with salt and pepper. Consider switching out the butter with olive oil as a source of healthy fat."

      "title": "Cook the hash browns.",
      "content": "Cook the hash browns. Once the potato has been coated with butter, flatten it using a spatula to maximize contact with the hot pan. It should be no more than 1/2 an inch thick. Cook for 3-4 minutes on the first side, flip, then cook for 2-3 minutes on the other side. The hash brown potatoes are ready when each side is crisp and golden brown."
    },
    {
      "title": "Serve.",
      "content": "Serve. Slide the hash brown from the pan, or lift using a large spatula. Cut it into halves or quarters, if necessary. Serve on its own, with hot sauce or ketchup, or alongside bacon and eggs for a top notch breakfast. Salt, pepper, and a pinch of paprika can also provide some extra flavor."

      "title": "Cook the potatoes.",
      "content": "Cook the potatoes. Wash your raw potatoes well in cold water. Cook the potatoes, either by baking or boiling. If boiling , place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a boil, then cook potatoes until tender. This should take about 20 minutes. If baking , pierce the skin of the potato with a fork 3-4 times. Wrap the potatoes in aluminum foil or place directly on the middle shelf of an oven, preheated to 350 °F (177 °C). The potato will bake in about an hour. If you already have leftover, cooked potatoes from a previous meal, you can go ahead and use those to make hash browns."

      "title": "Leave to cool, before peeling.",
      "content": "Leave to cool, before peeling. Allow the cooked potatoes to cool. Leave overnight in the refrigerator, if possible. Once the potatoes have cooled, you can peel them using a small knife or vegetable peeler."

      "title": "Shred the potatoes.",
      "content": "Shred the potatoes. Shred the potatoes using a cheese grater. They will shred very easily as they are soft when cooked. At this point, you can either cook them, or freeze them. To freeze them, lay them flat on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Put the cookie sheet into the freezer for a couple of hours or until the potatoes are frozen, then transfer them into freezer bags to use at your convenience."
