[1] X Research source For this reason, it is important to perform a variety of different procedures to be able to escape quickly from your vehicle should it fall off of the ramp. a) Open all windows as far as possible. Ensure that objects do not blow out. The water pressure will be too strong to open your windows underwater. (Although power windows will continue to operate when submerged, the water pressure will be too great for them to function). b) Release all seat belts. Although you should wear your seat belt at all times while riding in a moving vehicle, make sure you are not wearing it now as it may take precious seconds to release it should your vehicle fall into the water. Ignore the seat belt warning if it begins to beep. c) Make sure all doors are unlocked . If the doors of your vehicle lock automatically when you place it in Drive , override this function by pressing the unlock button on the driver's door."
