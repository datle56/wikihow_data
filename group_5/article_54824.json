      "content": "Focus on having a varied team. Throughout the game, there will be many different trainers with many different types of Pokémon. Pokémon types have many strengths and weaknesses, and knowing what these are is just the first step on getting good Pokémon! In Fire Red, the Gym Leaders and the Elite Four will focus on the following types on the list below. So, adding Pokémon that have advantages against these types will help you along your journey through the game. If you focus on one type, you will be at a big disadvantage! Rock (Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel, and Water types will help) Water (Electric and Grass types help here) Electric (Ground types help here) Grass (Bug, Fire, Flying, Ice, and Poison types will help) Poison (Psychic and Ground types will help) Psychic (Bug, Dark, and Ghost types help here) Fire (Water, Ground, and Rock types help here) Ground (Water, Grass, and Ice types will help) Ice (Fighting, Fire, Rock, and Steel types will help) Fighting (Flying and Psychic types help here) Ghost (Dark types and other Ghost types help here) Dragon (Ice types and other Dragon types will help)"

      "content": "Evolve your Pokémon. Evolving a Pokémon makes it stronger, and might help it gain a new type as well. The most common method of evolution is leveling up the Pokémon so it gains a certain level before evolving. However, there are many different methods of evolution as well, such as: Evolutionary Stones (Fire Stone, Water Stone, Thunder Stone, ETC.) Evolutionary Items (doesn't have to be a stone) Happiness Level Having a specific Pokémon in your party Some Pokémon have gender exclusive evolutions Trading (unless you have a copy of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Leaf Green, Emerald, or another copy of Fire Red, at least two Game Boy Advances, and at least one Link Cable). Training Pokémon that evolve with this method, such as Kadabra and Haunter into Alakazam and Gengar respectively, is not recommended. Trading with Fire Red is especially difficult since it was released before Pokémon introduced wireless trade without the requirement of an item to make it possible, and it is very difficult, almost impossible, to find a copy of one of these games and a Link Cable, making trades in this game almost impossible itself."

      "content": "Follow a sample team. While you don't have to use this exact team, here's an example of a good (and possible to form) team in Pokémon Fire Red. Notice how the Pokémon in this team are of various different types, and can be great Pokémon with the right training. Venusaur: a double Grass and Poison type Pokémon, it is the Final Evolution of Bulbasaur, who is one of the three starter Pokémon at the beginning of the game) Pidgeot: a double Normal and Flying type Pokémon, this Pokémon is the Final Evolution to Pidgey, who can be obtained in early routes of the game) Hitmonchan: a Fighting type Pokémon, this Pokémon can be obtained as a choice when you arrive at the Saffron City Dojo, which is next to the gym) Raichu: an Electric type Pokémon, this Pokémon evolves from Pikachu when you use a Thunder Stone on it) Arcanine: a Fire type Pokémon exclusive to Fire Red (in Leaf Green, you can get a Ninetales as a replacement,) this Pokémon evolves from Growlithe, which can be captured on certain routes, the one connecting Lavender Town and Celadon City coming to mind) Vaporeon: a Water type Pokémon, this Pokémon is one of the Kanto Eeveelutions (along with Flareon and Jolteon), which is obtainable using a Water Stone on Eevee, a free one can be found in a certain building in Celadon City"

      "content": "Train your Pokémon. Now that you have a possible plan of your final team, it's time to learn how to train them! Seeing from experience how Fire Red is one of the more difficult games in the series, it's a good idea to grind your way through to a decent level before facing your next Gym Leader or try to foil Team Rocket again. If you try to go with the flow without real training concern, you can easily end up in a tight spot. You can be the most overleveled trainer when you're around gym three, but be horribly underleveled by gym five. Fight every trainer you see (it may not be fun seeking out every trainer in the area, but it will be worth it in the end). Battle as many wild Pokémon as possible (unless you're in a rush, don't be afraid to challenge every single wild Pokémon you run into). If you are able to find items that increase experience points, use them! If there is a certain Pokémon in your party you want to level up, send them out as the lead of your party, and switch them with a stronger Pokémon in your party. Remember that this is the third generation of Pokémon, and not the sixth generation, where you can turn on and off the Experience Share, which will share experience with all of your Pokémon at once, at will."
