      "content": "Both friendships and relationships often begin here. A long, relaxed chat at the pub is the prime way to fit into local culture. Even if you don't have friends or colleagues to go with, sit at the counter and you'll generally find people are happy to talk to you. [1] X Research source If you're looking for a date, it's also common to start with a few casual group visits to the pub before you suggest more formal, one-on-one plans. [2] X Research source It's standard etiquette for each person in a group to take a turn buying a round. Don't feel pressured to accept a drink every time, but definitely offer when it's your turn if you want to make friends. [3] X Research source Smaller, independent pubs tend to be a bit better for meeting strangers than large chain pubs. [4] X Research source Try another place if you're not having any luck—chances are you won't have to walk far."

      "content": "Sports of all kinds are popular across Ireland. It shouldn't be hard to find a local sports club, especially if you're interested in the traditional Irish team sports of Gaelic football, hurling, association football, and rugby. [5] X Research source Ireland's large immigrant population also makes it fairly easy to find people interested in just about any sport, and most of them have national directories online to help you find a place to play.

      "content": "Organize meetups with online resources, or join an existing group. Whether you're looking for friendship or romance, a common interest is a great foundation.

      "content": "Online dating is common for all types of people in Ireland. While this wasn't true even ten years ago, dating apps and websites are now extremely common and no longer carry the stigma they once did. [8] X Research source You can browse through dozens of apps to find one that suits your situation and desired level of seriousness. Bumble, POF, Tinder, and Match.com all have plenty of Irish users. Hinge markets itself toward more serious daters, while Lumen is strictly for the over-50s. [9] X Research source A successful approach to online dating takes honesty about what you're looking for, hard boundaries for your deal-breakers, and maybe a capacity for eye-rolling and moving on."

      "content": "This is one of Europe's largest events for single people. All through September, tens of thousands of people looking for love attend this festival in a small town on Ireland's west coast. [10] X Research source The odds are in your favour with those numbers, if you enjoy finding partners over drinks and dancing. The town will be filled with partiers all month long, but you might need to buy a ticket for some of the weekend concerts. [11] X Research source And since it's a small place, it's probably a good idea to arrange your accommodation well in advance. If you're planning to go in 2021, check the website to keep up to date—the organizers will decide in July whether the festival is on this year. [12] X Research source This festival recently inspired an annual LGBT+ matchmaking festival, The Outing. Its 2022 event starts on the 11th of February in Dromoland. [13] X Research source"
