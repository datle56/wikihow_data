Make your way over to the northern portion of this area, where you’ll pass the Delibird Presents store. There, purchase the Metal Coat item for 3,000 Pokédollars. [1] X Research source If you’re feeling lucky, you might be able to buy a Metal Coat from the Porto Marinada Auction House. Still, visiting Delibird Presents is the most reliable and consistent way to get this item."

Using the “Link Trade” feature, trade your Scyther (now holding Metal Coat) over to your friend. Wait for Scyther to evolve into Scizor, and then ask your friend to trade it back. [3] X Research source Don’t have a friend who owns the game? Using the “Link Trade” feature, some crafty traders have created private trades with the code set to 02600260 (with extra zeros added to complete the 8-digit number). Only trainers aiming to evolve their Scythers will use this code, so both you and the random other person can walk away from the trade with a new Scizor. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Obtain Scizor in a 5- or 6-star Tera Raid Battle. Unfortunately, Scyther can only be evolved by trading with a friend—but there are other ways to catch Scizor. As you continue on your journey in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, seek out any light pillars you find near your location, as these commence a Tera Raid Battle. Some 5- or 6-star battles feature Scizor, allowing you to catch him directly. [5] X Research source You might also find Scizor in 4-star raid battles. [6] X Research source This method requires a bit of patience and persistence. There are many Pokémon who can appear in a 5- or 6-star raid battle, so it may take some time before you encounter Scizor."

The game’s official Pokédex notes that Scyther “lives in bamboo groves.” [7] X Research source With this in mind, Casseroya Lake is a popular hangout for Scyther, as well as North Province Area Two and South Province Areas Four and Six. [8] X Research source Scyther can also pop up in Wild Spawn Biomes, specifically in the forested and grassy areas."

Whether you’re playing a classic like Pokémon Gold or a 2000s game like Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, Scyther’s evolution process remains the same—it needs to be traded while holding a Metal Coat. [11] X Research source If you're on the hunt for a Metal Coat in an older game, there’s a 2-5% chance of certain Steel-type Pokémon holding this item when you catch them, like: Magnemite, Magneton, and Magnezone Bronzor and Bronzong Metang and Metagross Skarmony Beldum [12] X Research source"
