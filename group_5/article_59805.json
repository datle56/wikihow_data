[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There’s no question about it—posture correctors will absolutely pull your shoulders back and remind you to stand and sit up straight. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, you really don’t want to rely on them as anything other than a simple reminder to stop slouching. [4] X Research source While a posture corrector can show you how to sit and stand up straight if you wear it for a few minutes, they aren’t a good long term solution if you really want to fix the way you sit and stand since they won’t fix the underlying issue. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. If you have some kind of medical condition impacting your movement, a posture corrector may relieve some of the painful symptoms temporarily, but they aren’t going to help you permanently recover.

[8] X Research source If you rely on a posture corrector to stand or sit up straight, your muscles aren’t doing any of the work to prop you up. So while your posture corrector may help you keep a neutral spine while you wear it, the corrector will make your muscles weaker over time. This can actually make your posture problems worse if you wear the brace for too long. [9] X Research source Some posture correctors are intended to only be worn for 20 minutes a day. Follow the instructions that come with your posture corrector if you’ve already purchased one. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "No, most doctors tend to think they do more harm than good. There haven’t been a lot of medical studies on the long-term use of posture correctors since they’re a relatively recent trend. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Still, it seems medical professionals aren’t confident that they’re helpful as a long-term solution. Many doctors believe that posture correctors can even be bad for your back in the long run since they keep your muscles from developing in a way that makes it easy to maintain a good posture. [12] X Research source [13] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. If you see a doctor and ask them how you can improve your posture, they’re probably going to recommend regular exercise, stretching, and avoiding prolonged periods of sitting. This is a proven formula for success when it comes to fixing bad posture. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Some researchers think a corrector may make you more aware of your posture. If there is any benefit to a posture corrector, it’s probably that they make you pay attention to the way you sit and stand. This can make you more likely to correct yourself, since you’re wearing a device that sits on your shoulders and back. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you use a posture corrector for a few minutes a day and you look at the device as a reminder, there probably isn’t much harm in it. [16] X Research source [17] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. To put it another way, you probably aren’t going to hurt anything if you wear the posture corrector for 5-10 minutes every other day or so to remind yourself what proper posture looks like. But if you wear the brace for 6 hours a day, you may end up doing more harm than good as your muscles atrophy."

[18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source In order to have good posture, you need to strengthen your core, back, and shoulders. [19] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source However, the amount of time that it takes to strengthen these muscles will differ from person to person. If you exercise regularly and you start sitting and standing up straight, you can fix your posture problems in as little as a month or two! Just as a reminder, you want your neck to curve forward a little, your upper back to stick back a bit, and your lower back to curve forward. Your spin should look kind of like the letter S. Keep your chin up and keep your spine perfectly vertical whenever you can. Planks, bridges, pull-ups, and back extensions are all great callisthenic exercises if you’re looking to strengthen the muscles you rely on for proper posture.

If you spend most of your day hunched over a computer screen, slouching in a chair, or staring at your phone, it’s going to be really difficult to fix your posture. [22] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try to avoid spending all day seated or lying down. Take frequent breaks, look up when you walk, and don’t stare at your phone while you’re on the bus or getting a ride somewhere. If you are forced to sit every day for work, roll a towel up and slide it behind your shoulders. Focus on sitting up straight so that the towel stays pinched against the back of the chair. [23] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source This is basically the same thing as a posture corrector, except your muscles will get stronger as you improve your posture! If you spend a lot of time at the computer, tape a note to your computer screen to sit up straight. This will help remind you to maintain good posture if you tend to get caught up in what you’re doing and slump forward or back while you sit."
