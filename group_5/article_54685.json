      "content": "Communicate openly and honestly about your anxiety. While it may be difficult to open up to your friends about how you’re feeling, it’s one of the best ways to confront your anxiety. Telling your friends about your feelings helps build trust in the friendship and provides them with space to reassure you. You never know—your friends could also be experiencing friendship anxiety, and this is a great way for you both to tackle it together. [7] X Research source Remember, when it comes to anxiety, the worries you have are often based on internal feelings rather than the actual situation. It’s unlikely your friend will be upset if you tell them how you feel. They’ll likely do what they can to help you. Your friends like you, even if your brain is telling you otherwise. They want you to trust them and they want to get to know you better. They’ll likely be flattered and grateful if and when you choose to open up to them."

It’s possible you’re experiencing friendship anxiety because you’re trying to get too much fulfillment from your friendships. Be realistic about what you want from your friendships and what they can actually provide and look for other ways you can be emotionally fulfilled. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re often bored when you’re alone, try taking up a new hobby you can enjoy without your friends. Learn to be more comfortable doing things alone , as well. For example, if you want to go to a concert none of your friends are interested in, go by yourself! While everyone needs reassurance now and then, trust your friend to tell you if something’s bothering them. If they haven’t told you they’re upset about something, it’s likely just your anxiety."

If anything, it’ll just make them like you more. By letting them see the real you, you can begin building trust and overcoming your anxiety . [10] X Research source"

Sometimes, people with friendship anxiety worry about whether or not they have enough friends and constantly try to make new connections. However, this often leads to more stress. It’s better to have one or two friends who truly care about you than a group of “friends” you’re not actually that close to. Choose friends who have your back and want the best for you.

It’s natural to want to get along with your friends and avoid confrontation, but remember that no relationship is perfect. If you spend enough time with someone, you’re bound to get into an argument eventually. Think of all the friendships and relationships that have survived for years. If one argument didn’t cause them to break up, odds are, you and your friend can move past it. If you do need to confront your friend about something, remember to use “I feel” statements. This way, you’ll avoid accidentally placing blame on them, which could make your anxiety worse."

When it comes to friendships, you may see people posting all the fun things they do with their huge group of friends, or maybe you see your own friends hanging out with other people. These situations may make you feel insecure about your own relationships, which can increase friendship anxiety.

It can be really scary to open up to someone about anxiety, so show your friend you truly care about what they have to say by practicing active listening .

If you suspect or know your friend has anxiety, check up on them now and again to ask how they’re feeling. Don’t push them if they don’t feel like talking, but let them know you’re there for them.

While you want to be there for your friend, it isn’t healthy to care for them 24/7 and doing so may eventually harm your relationship. Set boundaries with your friend so you have time for yourself, your hobbies, and your other friends and loved ones. [22] X Research source It can be difficult to say no to someone you know is struggling, but there are ways to let them know you still care about them. For example, if they want to talk but you’re busy, say something like “I can’t talk right now, but I’m free at 4:00 and would love to see you then,” or “I’m busy today, but we can hang out this Saturday if you’re available.”"
