      "content": "Find your TV's audio output slots. Look for at least one of the following outputs on the back or side of the TV: RCA — This output has a red circular port and a white circular port. RCA is an older audio format that delivers audio in an analog format. Optical (Toslink) — This output has a square (sometimes hexagonal) port. This slightly newer audio format allows you to experience audio in digital format. Headphone — The standard 3.5 millimeter or 1/8 inch jack used for most headphones. You'll usually see an image of headphones above this port. HDMI — Some stereo receivers connect via HDMI. This is typically used for combined audio and video. It has a rectangle-shaped port with notched corners. Look for a port labeled \"HDMI OUT\" or \"Audio Out\" or similar. HDMI ARC — If your TV has an HDMI port labeled \"ARC\" or \"eARC,\" this is the port you want to use to connect to your stereo or surround sound system. Not only will it provide better quality audio, it generally allows you to control your stereo or surround sound system with your TV remote instead of having to use a separate remote for your sound system and your TV.

      "content": "Check your speakers' input type. Your speakers may connect to your stereo or surround sound in many ways. They may connect using RCA cables or speaker wire. Speaker wire may be connected in a few different ways: RCA — RCA inputs will usually have a red and black circular port on the back of your receiver corresponding to the left and right speakers Spring clips — Many speakers use speaker wire, which is color-coded black or red with exposed wire on the end of the wire. Spring clips have a lever you press down, which allows you to insert the speaker wire. Binding Posts — Binding posts have red and black posts that stick out on the back of the receiver. They have a cap that unscrews and allows you to insert the speaker wire."

If you are using a soundbar or computer speakers, the inputs will be on the back of the sound bar or subwoofer. Your audio system should have at least one RCA, Optical, or HDMI input."

Use one of the following steps to connect your speakers to your sound system: RCA Cables — RCA cables can be inserted by simply plugging the metal prong into the small hole in the port and pressing down. Make sure you plug the correct speaker into the correct color-coded or labeled port. Spring Clips — Press down on the lever to open the port. Insert the exposed speaker wire end into the port and release the clip. Make sure you insert the colored-coded wire into the port that matches the wire color. Binding Posts — Unscrew the cap of the binding post to loosen it. Insert the exposed speaker wire into the top opening of the binding post or wrap it around the exposed metal inside it. Screw the cap back down to tighten it. Banana Plugs: — Banana plugs can be attached to the end of speaker wire . They are then inserted into the left or right speaker port or into the hole on the top of the binding posts."
