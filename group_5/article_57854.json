      "content": "If texting is getting boring, a phone call can be a nice way to switch things up. Hearing someone’s voice makes them more “real,” so the person you’re texting might start thinking about meeting up with you more than if you just stick to SMS messages. [4] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. Plus, if you’ve never met this person before, it’s a good idea to call them before meeting up in person, just to make sure they are who they say they are. You can suggest a phone call by saying something like, “Do you have time to chat on the phone tonight?” or, “Wanna FaceTime later?”"

      "title": "Try not to text for weeks on end without moving things forward.",
      "content": "Try not to text for weeks on end without moving things forward. Set a texting limit, like only texting with someone for a few hours (or days). Texting is fine, but texting someone for too long can often lead to the relationship fizzling out. Instead, make sure you try to set up an in-person date as soon as possible to move from texting to dating much faster. [5] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. There’s no set rules for how quick you should do this, but most people recommend texting for a few days at most before setting up a date."

      "title": "If you chat too much beforehand, you may not have much to say on a date.",
      "content": "If you chat too much beforehand, you may not have much to say on a date. Reserve some of the “ get to know you” questions for when you meet up in real life. Otherwise, you could get to the date and realize that you’ve talked about everything there is to talk about—and that can lead to some awkward silences. [6] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. In general, it’s fine to ask someone via text what they do for work or what they get up to on the weekends. However, you should save the deeper stuff, like questions about their family or what their long-term goals are, for a real conversation."

      "content": "Texting back right away can make you seem too available. If you’re out and about and you’re busy, don’t feel pressured to reply to the person you’re texting. This will signal that you’re a busy person, and it will let them know that you’re probably not down to text 24/7. [7] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. Make an effort to match their response times, too. If they take an hour to reply, it’s okay to wait 45 minutes or so before responding."

      "content": "This is a subtle way to get them thinking about a date with you. If you want to start out slow, simply ask them what they’re up to this weekend or if they’re doing anything fun next week. If they aren’t, you can segue into asking them about their free time and when the two of you should meet up. Try something like: [8] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. “So, any fun plans for this long weekend?” “I’m hanging with friends on Saturday, but I’m totally free on Sunday. What about you?”"

      "content": "A specific activity might seem more appealing than vague plans. Sometimes, people get nervous about meeting up in person because they’re worried about not having enough to talk about. You can suggest a casual activity, like mini golfing, bowling, or taking a walk in the park to put them at ease and get them to meet up. [9] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. You might say something like, “I heard there’s a new mini golf course downtown. Want to try that out?” Or, “I was thinking of going to that new hiking trail if you want to tag along.”"

      "content": "Hopefully, this can get your texting partner to commit to plans. Instead of saying “We should hang soon!” or, “Let’s get together sometime!” try throwing out a time, date, and place that you want to meet up. If that doesn’t work for them, they can suggest a different time and place so you two can actually meet up. [10] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019.

      "content": "This is another casual way to meet up in real life. Keep in mind that not everyone likes spontaneous plans, but if the person you’re texting does, it can be a fun way to meet up with them IRL. Invite them to the bar where you and your friends are, or have them meet you for coffee near your house. [11] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 28 September 2021. You can suggest it by saying something like, “I’m out at a bar downtown, and my friends are about to go home. Want to join me for one more drink?” Or, “In the mood for some coffee? I’m at the cafe near my house getting some work done, but I could use a distraction.”"

      "content": "Unfortunately, sexting probably won’t land you an IRL date. You can absolutely sext the person if you just want a sexual relationship with them, but more often than not, it won’t lead to serious dating or a relationship. If the messages start to go that way or you’re getting a more seductive vibe, set some boundaries and let them know that you aren’t ready for that right now. [12] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 28 September 2021. Say something like, “I’d rather we meet up in person before sending more explicit messages like that. It’s just a boundary that I’ve set for myself, I hope you understand.”"

      "content": "Some people just want to stick to texting, and that’s okay. If you’ve suggested a few times and places to meet and they’re dragging their feet, they might just not want to go on an actual date. Chalk it up to a good learning experience, then move onto someone who’s fully interested and invested in you—you deserve it. [13] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. Some people find it helpful to set a texting timeline to know when they should move on . For instance, yours might be texting someone for 1 week before either meeting up or deleting their number. Remember that when someone’s not interested in you, it’s usually not your fault. It has more to do with them than it does with you, so don’t take it personally. [14] X Expert Source Judith Gottesman, MSW Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 19 October 2021."
