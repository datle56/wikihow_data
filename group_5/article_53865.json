      "content": "Give the avocado a gentle squeeze to determine whether it’s ripe. The perfect avocado will yield slightly to light pressure and should feel similar to the skin between your thumb and forefinger when it’s outstretched. If it feels hard to the touch (like a rock rather than a fruit), it’s definitely not ripe yet and, although it’s still safe to eat, won’t have the same taste or consistency of a ripe avocado. If, on the other hand, it’s super mushy, then the avocado is likely overripe and won’t taste very good. [1] X Research source Another way to determine the ripeness of an avocado is to pull back the stem. If the skin under the stem looks healthy and green, the avocado is ready to eat. If the stem doesn’t come off easily, it’s probably not ripe yet and if the flesh under the stem is brown, the avocado is likely overripe. [2] X Research source Ripe avocados generally have dark green or nearly black skin that will be a bit bumpy. [3] X Research source If your avocado isn't quite ripe yet, try sealing it in a paper bag with a banana, apple, or other fruit in order to ripen it more quickly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the avocado in half lengthwise. Hold the avocado steady on a cutting board using your non-dominant hand. Take a sharp chef’s knife in your other hand and use it to slice the avocado lengthwise (from the stem towards the larger bottom of the fruit). Once you feel the knife hit the pit, keep the knife steady and rotate the avocado until you’ve cut around the entire circumference of the fruit. If the avocado doesn’t break into two pieces on its own after it’s cut, use your hands to twist the two halves of the avocado in opposite directions until they pull apart."

      "content": "Remove the pit by whacking into it with your knife. Hold the half of the avocado with the pit cut-side-out on the cutting board. Then aim your knife at the pit and use a short, controlled swinging motion to whack into it. Be sure to use enough force to drive your knife into the pit without slipping off it’s smooth exterior. Pull the pit out by twisting the knife. Use a large chef's knife instead of a small paring knife. The latter will not have enough power to stick into the pit. Discard the pit after you remove it. While there is some ongoing research into the safety of eating avocado pits, it’s generally not recommended. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the flesh of the avocado without piercing the skin for an easy dice. If you want diced avocado, use your knife to cut the avocado into slices lengthwise and widthwise, creating squares. Be careful not to pierce the skin of the avocado as you cut. Then use a large spoon to scoop the squared pieces out. Diced avocado can be used to top salads, eggs, nachos, and other dishes."

      "content": "Scoop the flesh out with a spoon if you’d like to slice or mash the avocado. Use a spoon to loosen the skin all the way around the avocado half and then scoop the flesh out whole. You can mash the flesh with a fork or place it flat-side down on a cutting board and cut it into neat slices using the tip of your knife. The flesh of very ripe avocados may not come out of their skin as neatly and may require a few scoops. If you want neat-looking slices, try using a slightly underripe fruit."

Mashed avocado makes a great addition to toast, sandwiches, bagels, burgers, and anywhere else you would traditionally use a creamy spread like mayonnaise. Simply remove the avocado flesh from the skin and use a fork to mash it into a smooth consistency. For a bit of added flavor, add salt, pepper, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. For a twist on traditional ranch, mash 2 avocados with 1 packet of ranch dressing mix, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of fresh lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of mayonnaise. Chill for 1 hour before serving the mixture on top of burgers, sandwiches or fried chicken. [6] X Research source"

Bake them in a 400 °F (204 °C) oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges start to turn a little golden. Remove from the oven and eat warm on top of a grain-based salad. [10] X Research source If you want your avocado wedges to be a little crispier, you can let them cook for up to 25 minutes before taking them out. Keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t burn."

After you cut your avocados in half and remove the pit, brush both cut-sides with a bit of oil and toss them (face down) onto a very hot grill for about 30 seconds. Then remove the avocados from the grill and let them cool before using a spoon to remove the skins and cutting then into slices. Fold the charred slices into tortillas and top with a tomato or fruit salsa, fresh sprigs of cilantro, and crumbled queso fresco. [11] X Research source No grill?

If the hole left by the pit is smaller than your egg, use a spoon to scoop a bit of extra flesh out from each avocado half. Then place the avocado halves into a baking dish and crack an egg into each hole. Bake for 12 minutes or until the whites of the eggs have fully set. [12] X Research source If you have trouble getting the avocado halves to balance in the baking dish, try building small “nests” for them out of tin foil.

This will help keep the air from oxidizing the avocado flesh for at least a day in the fridge.

Simply sprinkle the juice on top of an avocado half, diced pieces, or mash before you wrap it in plastic. Other acidic agents, like vinegar, will also do the trick. [19] X Research source Tomatoes and onions are also acidic and can help keep avocado from turning brown. If you're making guacamole ahead of time, be sure to mix in the tomato and onion before storing the dip."
