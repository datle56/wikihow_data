      "content": "Déjà rêvé is the feeling you’ve already seen something in a dream. “Déjà rêvé” literally means “already dreamed” in French. It’s that uncanny sensation where you feel as though you already dreamed something that happened in real life. [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source You might have déjà rêvé about certain sights, sounds, emotions, or situations that seem oddly familiar as you encounter them. Researchers have identified a few different “types” of déjà rêvé, each of which may come with their own sensations: [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source “Episodic” déjà rêvé is the recollection of a specific dream after the fact. “Familiar” déjà rêvé is the general feeling that you’ve already dreamed something, like an emotion or vague situation, but can’t link it back to a specific dream. “Dreamy state” déjà rêvé is when you feel like you’re currently dreaming something, even while awake."

      "content": "Déjà vu is the feeling that you’ve already done something before. Where déjà rêvé is the feeling that something you’re experiencing already happened in a dream, déjà vu is when you feel like it’s already happened in your waking life. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A subtle distinction, but no less disorienting. Researchers believe déjà vu may be caused by temporarily scrambled connections between parts of the brain responsible for memory and feelings of familiarity. Neither are to be confused with lucid dreaming , which is the sensation of being aware of or controlling your own dreams while asleep."

      "content": "Déjà rêvé may be your brain recollecting memories or past dreams. Research is still ongoing, but experts think that déjà rêvé may have something to do with the way our brains “store” dreams, recalling them when we encounter something in our waking life that resembles those dream-memories. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Researchers in a study in 2018 were able to trigger déjà rêvé in epilepsy patients by delivering an electric brain stimulation, suggesting that the brain can recall specific dreams under certain conditions. Researchers suggest that the brain’s left hemisphere might “encode” or store and interpret dreams, while the right hemisphere contains the actual “materials” of the dreams."

      "content": "Déjà rêvé may be caused by overlapping thoughts or feelings. A study in 2010 suggests that déjà experiences may be more common in people with “thin” boundaries between mental states, or for whom thoughts, memories, feelings, and dreams tend to crowd or overlap, making it more difficult to distinguish each. [5] X Research source The study suggests that déjà experiences may occur because of crossed wires (so to speak) between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, which are each responsible for different functions."

      "content": "Déjà rêvé may simply be a memory of a dream. As the 2018 study suggests, you may have déjà rêvé simply because you’ve encountered a situation that reminds your brain of a dream it had. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source It could be nothing more than your brain associating waking feelings with feelings you had while you were asleep."

      "content": "Some say déjà rêvé moments are echoes of a past life. Psychic medium Mari Cartagenova says that déjà experiences may be “harkening back to whatever happened in your past life.” Some interpret déjà moments as moments you lived in another lifetime, resurfacing in this lifetime. These moments may be resurfacing because you have unsolved troubles from a past life that you may need to overcome or better understand in this life."

      "title": "Ask yourself how your déjà rêvé makes you feel and why.",
      "content": "Ask yourself how your déjà rêvé makes you feel and why. Take a moment to self-reflect on those feelings or that moment. Maybe it resurfaced because it’s important to you, or bothers you in some way. Psychic medium Mari Cartagenova suggests thinking about how the experience makes you feel and asking yourself if it suggests something you might need to work on now. For example, if you have déjà rêvé of a frightening car accident, ask yourself if you have an anxiety surrounding driving, where that came from, and how you might face that fear ."
