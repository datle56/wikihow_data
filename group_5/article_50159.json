      "content": "Your instructor will usually cover test material during class time, so pay close attention to what they’re saying. Get a good notebook that you’ll only use for that class, and jot down important dates or facts your teacher mentions by hand. If your teacher repeats something, writes it on the board, or gives a subject special emphasis, be sure to put it in your notes since it’s going to be important to remember. [2] X Research source Use bullet points and symbols to help take notes faster so you don’t miss any information, and write as neatly as you can. You don't want to struggle to read your own writing later on! Try writing your notes in a flowchart or concept map so you can keep similar ideas and subjects together. [3] X Research source If you miss something in your notes, ask another classmate or your instructor after class to go over what you missed."

      "content": "If you still aren’t sure what you the test covers, wait until after class and talk to your teacher. Let them know that you’re a little confused and ask what topics you should study. You can also ask what types of questions will be on the test so you can find similar practice questions. Your teacher wants to see you succeed in class, so they’ll point you in the right direction. [4] X Research source Your teacher may even hand out study guides or practice exams so you can see questions that are similar to the ones on the actual test."

      "title": "While it may seem like overkill, you’ll retain a lot more information if you study every day.",
      "content": "While it may seem like overkill, you’ll retain a lot more information if you study every day. Set aside time where you won’t get distracted so you can organize your notes and go over the test material. Read through your class notes so you can refresh your memory on key terms or formulas. If you have required readings, take notes on the text so you remember it better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look through your notes and write down everything you’re still confused by on a different piece of paper.",
      "content": "Look through your notes and write down everything you’re still confused by on a different piece of paper. As you’re studying, skim through your textbook or lectures to find the information on the topics that you’re the least familiar with. As you find the topics, be sure to write down dates, names, and other important concepts that could appear on your test. Write down all the exam topics on flashcards and go through them every day. When you get confused by a topic, put the cards on the top of the stack so you know you need to focus on those areas first. As you get more familiar with a topic, try taking a 1- to 2-day break from reviewing it. When you come back to it, see if you still remember all of the information."

      "title": "Your teacher may already give you practice tests, but if not, you’re bound to find some online.",
      "content": "Your teacher may already give you practice tests, but if not, you’re bound to find some online. Treat the practice test as if it were the real thing. Don’t use your notes and set a timer so you can get used to answering the questions. After you finish the practice test, check your answers to see what you got incorrect. Review your notes for any topics or questions you struggled with. Practice exams are a great way to eliminate stress from the actual test since you’ll get used to the time crunch and topics covered. If you can’t find a practice exam, make one of your own. Check your textbook for questions at the end of the chapter and write your own questions based on your notes or class discussions."

      "title": "Rewriting helps you think critically and remember information better.",
      "content": "Rewriting helps you think critically and remember information better. Choose a topic from your notes or textbook and write it on the top of a new page. Take a few minutes writing down all of the information you remember about the topic so you can see how well you understand it. If you struggled coming up with anything, go back to your textbook, lectures, and notes to review the info. [8] X Research source Be sure to check what you wrote for accuracy as well. Even if you think you remember something well, make sure it’s the right information. Try writing the information as if you were teaching it to someone else. That way, you can get a better, more simplified understanding of it as well."

      "content": "Studying in a group lets you compare notes, ask questions, and discuss confusing concepts so you can see what you should focus on. Pick somewhere quiet and free of distractions, such as the library or someone’s home, to host your study session. Talk about what subjects you all are struggling with and prioritize those first while you’re studying. [9] X Research source Make a study guide for the group with sample questions from the book or online. Try taking turns explaining topics to one another so you don’t need to read as much on your own. Take a few 10-minute breaks while you’re studying so you have some time to relax and have fun with your classmates."

      "title": "Your brain needs rest before a big test, and sleep can even help you remember the concepts you just studied.",
      "content": "Your brain needs rest before a big test, and sleep can even help you remember the concepts you just studied. Try to avoid eating or having caffeine right before you go to bed so you have an easier time falling asleep. Limit using your phone or other electronics since bright screens could keep you awake. Make your room as dark as possible before climbing into bed and getting some rest. [10] X Research source If you still have a lot on your mind before you go to bed, try meditating or reading a book to help calm down and feel relaxed."

      "content": "You may have heard it called the most important meal of the day, but it’s even more so when you have a test to focus on. Try having some oatmeal since it can help give you the mental energy to get through the morning. You can also try almonds, yogurt, and fruit to keep you energized. Even just an apple 30 minutes before your test can help you stay alert and ready for the exam. Eat a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables since it can help you pay better attention while you’re taking the test. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "If you keep telling yourself that you won’t do well on the test, you can put yourself in a negative mindset. Instead, say things like “I prepared a lot for this test and I’m going to do well on it,” or, “I know I’m smart and I’ll be able to pass this.” By building yourself up, you’ll feel more confident and won’t be as nervous while you’re taking the test. [13] X Research source Try to avoid talking negatively to other students as well. For example, don’t tell your classmates that you’re nervous or that you don’t think you studied enough."

      "content": "You may not know how to budget your time for each question if you don’t know what’s on the test. Scan through all of the material on the test so you can see the types of questions and subjects it covers. Make note of any essay or free-writing questions since they’ll take up more time. Once you get an idea of how long the test is, you’ll know where to focus your attention. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you have a full understanding of the question so you don’t accidentally misread it and make a mistake. Once you read the question, guess what you think the answer might be before looking at any options. Then look at your choices to see if any of them align with what you think the answer may be. [15] X Research source If you’re confused by a question on the test, ask your teacher for clarification. Chances are another one of your classmates might also be confused."

      "content": "Look for keywords or terms in the questions and answers to see if you’re familiar with the concept. If you see any that you positively know, fill in the answer right away so you don’t have to come back to it later. If you get confused or you don’t know the answer, don’t worry. Just skip the question for now and come back to it at the end when you have more time to focus on it. The right answers on a multiple-choice exam are usually grammatically correct or have similar words as the question. Words like “no,” “never,” “always,” and “only” in true-or-false questions are usually false."

Once you’ve completed your test, go back through your answers if you have time to make sure they still look correct. If you notice a mistake or something incorrect, fix it before handing the test in. When you think you’ve answered everything correctly, then turn your test in. Even if you don’t get the right answer, you may still get partial credit if you show your work and thought process."
