      "title": "\"Sorry, I don’t have your number in my phone—who is this?\"",
      "content": "\"Sorry, I don’t have your number in my phone—who is this?\" Maybe your phone accidentally cleared away some of your old contacts, or you forgot to add someone’s contact info to your phone. If you think you might know the sender, a quick “who is this” text will get to the bottom of things. Here are a few sample responses you could send, depending on what the original sender says: Someone you know: “Hey Andrew! So sorry about that–my phone’s contact list is super out of sync, so I didn’t have your number saved.” Someone you don’t know: “Sorry, but I don’t know anyone by that name. Hope you’re able to find who you’re looking for!” Only reply if the text seems like it came from a real person. Leave the text unanswered if you suspect that it could be spam."

      "title": "\"Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.\"",
      "content": "\"Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.\" This tried-and-true response leaves no room for confusion. There’s no point in wasting the other person’s time–or your own, for that matter. Just shoot this quick text over to resolve the matter right away, so the unknown sender doesn’t keep blowing up your phone with more texts. If their message is clearly directed to someone else, you might say: “Hey! Sorry, this isn’t Kelsey; I think you texted the wrong number.” “You might be a few digits off–this isn’t John.” “Sorry, this isn’t Angelica. Hope you’re able to get in touch with her, though!”"

      "content": "Be straightforward instead of playing games with the sender. Sure, it might be funny to reply to the person’s original message and troll them with fake or goofy responses. Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes, though: how would you feel if someone wasted your time with BS replies? Show the other person the same level of respect and courtesy that you’d like to be treated with. If you do reply to an unknown number, stick to texts instead of sending selfies. Never send pictures of yourself to someone you don't know. [1] X Research source"

A suspicious text may ask you to claim a random prize, offer you a free gift card, “alert” you to an issue with your bank account, and so on. Trash any messages that look fishy and don’t bother replying.
