Signs of this element tend to have great emotional depth."

      "content": "Scorpio’s intuition and Virgo’s compassion complement each other. Scorpio feels emotions intensely but doesn’t express vulnerability often. Meanwhile, logic-driven Virgo is happy to talk but may not understand their own feelings. When this well-matched pair works together, intuitive Scorpio can help Virgo identify their feelings, and compassionate Virgo can pick up on Scorpio’s needs, encouraging them to be more open. Scorpio, remember to show gratitude when your Virgo helps you—especially for highly emotional matters. Let Virgo know how she helped you, and thank her for being such an understanding partner. Virgo, you’re one of the few signs that really enjoys a puzzle—and your mysterious Scorpio is the perfect riddle. With time and patience, you can get your Scorpio to open up to you more. Another great way to encourage Scorpio to be more open is to share a secret with him. Lead by example, and your trustworthy Scorpio will see that he can speak freely with you."

      "content": "Scorpio and Virgo have great chemistry when they take things slowly. Virgo is generally more reserved in the bedroom than Scorpio, but they both crave passion and intimacy at the end of the day. Intuitive Scorpio can easily figure out how to please Virgo, and because both are looking for an emotional connection in the bedroom, they’ll enjoy their time together greatly. [2] X Research source Scorpio, you can have a dominant, sometimes rough approach to sex; be aware that might be too much for Virgo at first. Be gentle, take it slow, and show her your tender side in bed. Virgo, you tend to be more submissive in bed, but that doesn’t mean you can’t tell Scorpio what you need from him. If you’re looking for an experience that is as loving and emotional as it is physical, let him know."

[3] X Research source Scorpio, for all your intensity, you’re also patient and empathetic, and this will help your Virgo feel comfortable with you.

      "content": "Sincere and thought-provoking exchanges define this relationship. Virgo is a deeply intellectual sign, as demonstrated by their ruling planet, Mercury (the planet of the mind and communication). Scorpio will admire this quality greatly, as they tend to look for a partner who is their intellectual equal. Scorpio loves a challenge, and Virgo loves good conversation; in each other, they’ll finally find a like-minded partner. [5] X Research source Scorpio, appeal to your Virgo by engaging with her intellectually. Mental stimulation is a must for her, so talk to her about the topics she finds most fascinating.

      "content": "This pair is as comfortable with silence as they are speaking. Scorpio is infamous for their mysterious and brooding nature; they tend to be introverted and like thinking things through. Despite the fact that Virgo is ruled by the planet of communication, they also tend to be introverted and quiet, much like Scorpio. While these signs can talk for hours together, they can also sit in close, peaceful silence. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Both signs should try to face conflict head-on rather than avoid it.",
      "content": "Both signs should try to face conflict head-on rather than avoid it. Independent Scorpio rarely takes the time to address conflict or disagreement; they’re more likely to hide their feelings and beat around the bush, while logical Virgo doesn’t always take the time to sort out their emotions or acknowledge how they feel. This can lead to miscommunication and escalate a conflict between them. Scorpio, keep using that honesty you value so deeply, and tell Virgo how you feel when sometime upsets you. The sooner you address a conflict, the faster you can resolve it. Virgo, remember that emotional depth is important to Scorpio—and odds are, he’ll be willing to help you sort out your feelings. Try to be a little more open with him to resolve conflicts faster."

      "title": "Virgo and Scorpio are both practical, valuing tidiness and financial smarts.",
      "content": "Virgo and Scorpio are both practical, valuing tidiness and financial smarts. They have a solid grasp of personal finances; each is more prone to saving it for the future rather than spending extravagantly, so they’ll often be in agreement. Furthermore, both signs tend to prioritize cleanliness and organization at home; they’ll build a neat and comfortable household together. [7] X Research source Virgo, your home life may be affected if you give into your tendency to collect (or hoard) things. Try being selective about what you keep and throw away since Scorpio will like keeping things neat. Scorpio, you may end up placing sentimental value on unusual things that your partner might find off-putting. Try to check in with Virgo before making any decisions to ensure both of you are happy with the decor."

      "content": "Scorpio and Virgo may clash over their careers and ambitions. While both signs are driven and generally strive for success, they may find themselves out of sync when it comes to their careers. For Scorpio, work is all about getting ahead and being a star. Virgo is more concerned with solving problems and doing as much as possible; essentially, they’re both ambitious, but it manifests differently. Virgo, your Scorpio guy is most likely looking for some praise at the end of the day. He loves attention, especially from you. Congratulate him on his achievements and let him know how proud you are to be his partner! Scorpio, remember that Virgo’s achievements are valid, even if they don’t prioritize the same things you do. Virgo loves recognition as well, so try to appreciate all the good things Virgo does and the hard work they put into their career. If both of you work together and play to your strengths (rather than clashing over your careers), you could become quite the power couple!"

      "title": "Virgo’s critical side can cause friction with a stubborn Scorpio.",
      "content": "Virgo’s critical side can cause friction with a stubborn Scorpio. Virgo is a pro at giving out practical advice, but sometimes that advice can come off as unsolicited criticism —and Scorpio isn’t the type to bend when they think they’re right. If Scorpio doesn’t take Virgo’s advice, then Virgo may feel hurt, and the pair can fall into a vicious cycle of criticism and stubbornness. Thankfully, this doesn’t have to sink a Virgo-Scorpio relationship. Scorpio is well aware that perfection is unrealistic and can help Virgo see that as well since Virgo values Scorpio’s input so highly. Scorpio, try to compromise with Virgo when possible. Take their advice when it makes sense to, but don’t hesitate to (gently) draw the line if they get pushy. Virgo, try to give Scorpio advice only when they’re asking for it. Tell them that you like it when they come to you for help and support; Scorpio tends to be solitary, but they’ll make an effort when they care for you."

      "title": "Scorpio’s mood swings and jealousy can overwhelm Virgo.",
      "content": "Scorpio’s mood swings and jealousy can overwhelm Virgo. Scorpio is an intense sign with an all-or-nothing attitude, and this can lead to some extreme mood shifts. If they ever feel like Virgo has feelings for another person, Scorpio can fly into a fury—and even-tempered Virgo rarely has the patience to deal with drama. They’d rather walk away than address a fit of temper. Scorpio, learn to manage your jealousy and talk to Virgo if you’re ever feeling paranoid or insecure about her affections. Virgo is a loyal sign and can gladly set your mind at ease. Virgo, remember that your Scorpio guy may need some reassurance from time to time. He loves deeply and intensely, so reminding him how much you care will mean a lot to him."

      "content": "Together, Scorpio and Virgo can create a solid long-term partnership. Despite some potential friction between Virgo’s critical tendencies and Scorpio’s jealousy, this pair has a high level of compatibility overall. They connect especially well when it comes to trust since both signs value honesty and loyalty, and communication will flow easily between them because they’ll admire and respect one another’s intellectual nature. All in all, a Virgo woman and Scorpio man pairing can build a relationship filled with love and affection so long as they continue to treat one another with patience, compassion, and respect. A Virgo-Scorpio friendship is also hard to beat! Virgo and Scorpio will always have one another’s back and instinctively understand each other—a truly loyal and kindhearted pair of friends."
