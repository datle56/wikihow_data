If something happens, such as a glitch or a file being corrupted, restarting can help you get past that. First attempt to restart your Roblox app, and if that doesn't work restart your entire device. Anecdotally, some Roblox users noticed that shutting down their computer overnight and trying to launch Roblox again the next day resolved the issue. [1] X Research source"

If your internet connection isn't stable, try another connection if you're able. Otherwise, try connecting an ethernet cable if you're using Wi-Fi. While it is a bit more advanced, you can also try flushing your DNS cache . On Windows, run the command ipconfig /flushdns in Command Prompt. On Mac Big Sur or later, run the command sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder in the Terminal."

A cache is a group of temporary files that allow websites and applications to work faster, but sometimes these files can become corrupt, which leads to errors. This will not delete your Roblox progress, as that is stored in Roblox's servers. On Windows, open your File Explorer and type %localappdata% in the path bar near the top of the window. Open the Roblox folder and delete everything inside. Restart your computer and check to see if you still get error 268. On Mac, open your Finder and select Go > Go to Folder…, then type ~/Library/Caches/ and click the \"Go\" button. Open the Roblox folder and delete everything inside. Restart your computer and check to see if you still get error 268. On Android, the location may vary depending on your phone's model, but look in your Settings for a Storage option, then select Apps.

If you're using Windows' built-in antivirus, search for \"Security in your task bar's search bar, then click on Virus & threat protection settings > Manage Settings. Toggle off \"Real-time protection.\" If you're using Mac's built-in antivirus, go to the Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General. You'll have to enter your password, and then you can toggle the Firewall off. If you're using a third-party antivirus software, how to disable it will vary depending on what software it is. However, most antivirus software should have a clearly marked button or menu item to turn it off."
