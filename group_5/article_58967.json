      "content": "Open the lid of the Zippo and remove the inside unit from the case. Firmly grip both sides of the flint wheel with your thumb and index finger. Hold the bottom of the Zippo lighter with your other hand and pull up on the metal to remove the unit from its case. [1] X Research source The flint wheel is the grooved circle that you turn with your thumb to create a flame. The metal box should come out fairly easily, but if it’s never been removed before, you may have to pull a bit harder the first time to get it out. If it’s stuck, put a piece of wire through a hole in the chimney and pull it up."

      "title": "Turn the inside unit over and remove the felt bottom.",
      "content": "Turn the inside unit over and remove the felt bottom. The bottom of the unit has a small hole in the middle and the words “Lift to Fuel” written across it. Lift up the bottom by putting something small into the hole and prying it open. If you’re using Zippo lighter fluid, you can use the nozzle to open the felt pad. [2] X Research source There will also be a small flathead screw on the side of the pad, which you don’t need to remove. You can open the bottom with a small screwdriver or an unbent paperclip."

      "title": "Insert the lighter fluid can nozzle and slowly fill the cotton.",
      "content": "Insert the lighter fluid can nozzle and slowly fill the cotton. Put the nozzle in the “Open” position and rest it on the cotton. Squeeze the fluid in for 3 to 5 seconds, then take out the nozzle and wait 10 seconds to let it soak in. [3] X Research source If you have a large lighter fluid canister, you may want to transfer some to a smaller squirt bottle to control how much fluid you release into the lighter. You can buy lighter fluid at most drug stores and home improvement stores. Use high-quality lighter fluid to protect your lighter—methylated spirits and F-gasoline can damage it. Generally, using Zippo brand lighter fluid is recommended. Fill your Zippo over a sink for easy cleanup. Don’t refill your Zippo lighter over finished wood surfaces or other surfaces that could be damaged by contact with lighter fluid."

      "title": "Stop filling the lighter when the fluid reaches the top of the material.",
      "content": "Stop filling the lighter when the fluid reaches the top of the material. Once the top of the cotton packing material starts getting darker, stop adding lighter fluid to the unit. The longer you’ve gone without refilling your Zippo lighter, the more fuel you’ll need to add before it’s full. [4] X Research source Never use running water to clean off your Zippo, or you could flood the cotton and damage the moving parts. Zippo lighters can hold about 5 ml of fuel."

      "content": "Wait 1-2 minutes, then strike the flint wheel to light the zippo. Let the Zippo sit and absorb the lighter fluid for 1 to 2 minutes. Then, try lighting the Zippo to see if it’s completely refilled. If it doesn’t light on the first three tries, go back and add more lighter fluid. [6] X Research source Wash your hands and put away your lighter fluid before trying to light the Zippo."

If it doesn’t come up easily, try threading an unbent paperclip through the holes on the chimney and pulling from there. [7] X Research source The flint wheel is the wheel you use to light the lighter, the chimney is where the flame comes out."

The screw is under tension, so be careful that it doesn’t shoot away when you unscrew it. Take out the screw, then turn the lighter over again and gently tap it to get the old flint out. [8] X Research source The flint is a small cylinder that’s unattached from the flint spring. The top of the flint spring has a small brass section that can easily be confused with the flint. If something gets stuck, clean out the inside of the flint tube with an unbent paper clip."

If you can’t move it forward, use your thumb to circle it backward a few cycles. If you have extra flint, consider storing them under the felt pad for future use. [9] X Research source"

If your wick isn’t lighting anymore, use tweezers or needle nose pliers to grasp the base of the wick, then pull it up until the white part reaches the top of the chimney.

To put in a new wick, take the lighter out of its casing, unscrew the flathead screw at the bottom of the felt pad, then take out the spring, flint, felt pad, cotton, and old wick. [10] X Research source Zippo wicks are roughly 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long, so they need to be replaced after about 3 trimmings. Use tweezers or pliers to take out the cotton."

After you put a layer of cotton in, push the wick down and to the side so it crosses the inside of the lighter. Put down more cotton and then push the wick in the other direction, until all the cotton is replaced and the wick is woven through it. [12] X Research source Think of it as making an “S” shape with the wick through the lighter."
