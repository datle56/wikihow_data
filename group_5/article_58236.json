      "content": "Stretch well. It's important to stretch out your body, especially your back, before you do a full twisting layout. Remember that, if you want to complete the full twisting layout, then you have to be able to do a round off, a back handspring, a back tuck, and a back layout. When you stretch, you should focus on your back and your wrists, though you should stretch your arms, neck, and legs as well. Here are some stretches you can do: Do a simple backbend to stretch your back. Curl up into a ball on the floor and roll up and down on your back, to roll it out. Stretch your wrists and ankles by holding onto them and rolling them clockwise five times, and then rolling them in the opposite direction another five times."

      "title": "Do a round-off",
      "content": "Do a round-off into a back handspring . Back and front layouts are typically done after another skill that helps build momentum; to complete the full twisting layout most effectively, you should do a round off and then begin to do a back handspring, so that you generate enough speed and momentum to propel your body into the air for long enough to do a full twisting layout. Here's what you have to do: To do a round off, here's what you need to do: Hurtle forward with your arms up by your ears. Place your hands down on the ground together. Swing your feet over your head. Keep your feet together until you plant them down on the other side of your hands. Land facing the opposite direction where you started from, with your arms up over your head, near your ears. To do a back handspring immediately afterwards, you need to use the momentum of the roundoff to help you generate even more speed. Here's what you do: Get in a seated position with your arms swinging up over your head. Push through your toes to lift your arms up even more. Fall backwards, taking care not to arch your back too much. Plant your hands on the floor, with your fingers facing away from you. Swing your legs over your hands, so you're in a hand stand for a second. Keep your feet together as you plant them on the floor. Pop up with your hands above your head."

      "content": "Bring your arms up to your ears and set high into the air. After you pound off the floor from your back handspring, your arms should pop up over your head. This is called the set, the move that helps you transition into the full twisting layout with the best form and speed possible."

      "title": "Keep your toes pointed and initiate a flip in a hollowed-out position.",
      "content": "Keep your toes pointed and initiate a flip in a hollowed-out position. In the hollowed-out position, your arms should be at your sides and your toes should be pointed. Remember that, just as in doing a regular back layout, you need to focus on achieving as much height as possible so you have time to complete the skill with your legs straight."

      "title": "Keep your arms to either side of your face.",
      "content": "Keep your arms to either side of your face. This will help you maintain your balance as you begin to twist. Your core (abdominal area) should be tight throughout this process."

      "title": "Begin to wrap.",
      "content": "Begin to wrap. Right when you start to see the ceiling, you should take your lead arm (whichever arm you're twisting towards), and drop it behind you, as if you were elbowing a person behind you. Take your other arm and bring it toward that arm, following the same direction you're twisting towards, as if you were passing a heavy ball you were holding with both hands to the person to the left of you. This will help your entire body complete the turn."

      "content": "Keep your arms in this position until you start you see the ground. Then, open and lift your arms, remembering to keep your entire body straight. Extend your knees and ankles and continue to keep your core tight."

      "title": "Stick your landing.",
      "content": "Stick your landing. Once you have completed the rotation and are turned in the direction that you began the twist from, land on both feet and lift your arms up to complete the full-twisting layout. If you're not quite there and have only made it halfway around, then you can land in the opposite direction that you started from, doing the half twisting layout instead. If you're having trouble reaching this point, you can work on improving your half-twist, even turning your body halfway after you land to get used to the sensation of making a full turn in the air."
