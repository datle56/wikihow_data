      "content": "Relationship dissatisfaction Feeling like your relationship is lacking in some way can lead to feelings of loneliness and increased distance between you and your partner. You may have gone into your relationship with certain expectations for how things would turn out and how your partner would act. But if these expectations aren’t met, you may start to feel like you’re alone in your relationship. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, you might have expected your relationship to reach certain milestones at certain times. Maybe you wanted to move in with your partner after 3 years and were hoping they’d propose soon after. If your relationship doesn’t live up to these expectations, it’s not uncommon to feel disappointment and sadness, both of which can transform into loneliness."

      "title": "Lack of intimacy",
      "content": "Lack of intimacy When you begin sharing less and less intimate moments with your partner, both emotional and physical, you may start to feel like you’re alone in your relationship. For example, no longer saying “I love you” to each other or being less sexually intimate are both things that can contribute to feelings of loneliness. [2] X Research source A lack of intimacy can make you feel like your partner no longer desires you and can lead to a drop in self-esteem, both of which can cause loneliness. This can also lead to feelings of jealousy within your relationship and a lack of self-confidence. If lack of intimacy seems to be a major issue in your relationship, try discussing the issue with your partner and seeing if you can find a way to meet each other's sexual needs. Reader Poll: We asked 286 wikiHow readers about how they’d handle a lack of sex in their relationship, and 59% of them agreed that they’d openly communicate about their needs and find a compromise .

      "title": "Emotional distance",
      "content": "Emotional distance It’s more than possible to feel lonely if you feel like your partner isn’t being attentive to your emotional needs. Showing little or no interest in what you have to say, not being there to comfort you during difficult times, and not reacting appropriately when you confide in them are all signs your partner may be emotionally distant. [3] X Research source For example, an emotionally distant or unavailable partner might offer very little comfort when you go to them with a problem. They might just say something like, “That’s tough” or “What do you want me to do about it?” instead of giving support."

      "title": "Physical distance",
      "content": "Physical distance It’s more than natural to feel lonely when you’re not able to have your partner right by your side. When you’re separated, it becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy each other’s needs, and they may not always be there right when you need them to provide comfort and support. [4] X Research source Distance can also mean an absence of physical intimacy, which can make these feelings of loneliness even more obvious. It’s not unnatural to feel lonely when you’re separated from your partner, especially if you’re pursuing something like a long-distance relationship. It’s important to be aware that just because you miss your partner and feel a bit lonely doesn’t mean there’s necessarily anything wrong with your relationship."

      "content": "Lack of communication Good communication skills are an extremely important part of any healthy relationship. If you and your partner haven’t yet found a way to communicate your wants and needs to each other in an effective way, you can be left feeling dissatisfied and lonely. You may feel like you can’t express your honest feelings with your partner, which can make you feel even more isolated and alone. [5] X Research source For example, if your partner doesn’t confide in you even if it’s obvious they’re going through something, you might feel especially lonely within your relationship."

      "content": "Distrust Feeling like you can’t rely on your partner can be extremely isolating. Relationships are all about mutual support and being there for one another, but if you feel like you can’t trust your partner to be there for you, you may start feeling lonely and like you can only rely on yourself. [6] X Research source You may not trust your partner because they tend to be overly critical of anything you choose to share with them. A partner who’s been unfaithful can also be extremely hard to trust, and their past actions may have left you feeling even more distant from them."

      "title": "Lack of quality time",
      "content": "Lack of quality time Even if you spend time with your partner, you can still feel lonely if that time together doesn’t feel meaningful. When you spend quality time with one another, it means you give each other your undivided attention and take the time to really get to know each other on a deeper level. If your time together is full of surface-level conversations and your partner seems distracted the entire time, it’s natural to begin feeling lonely. [7] X Research source For example, your partner spends more time on their phone than actually talking to you when you’re together, you’re not actually spending quality time together. It’s completely normal to feel lonely even if you do make an effort to spend quality time together. Sometimes feelings of disconnect can crop up even when you’re physically together, but that doesn’t always insinuate there’s an issue with your relationship."

Spending a lot of time on social media can make you start comparing your relationship to others, and you might unconsciously begin fixating on the “shortcomings” of your relationship. Focusing too much on these negatives (whether they’re true or not) can lead to feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction.

Even when they’re right there, you may feel like they don’t actually hear or see you. If you feel like they’re always distracted or don’t acknowledge your presence fully, it’s likely that you’re experiencing loneliness because of their actions. [13] X Research source For example, even when you’re eating dinner together, they might not make any effort to start a conversation or ask you about your day, leaving you feeling very alone and unseen. If they’re constantly distracted by their phone, you might feel like their social media and electronics are a bigger priority than you."

For example, they may no longer be the first person you want to share exciting news with. Or, you may choose to talk to your friends and family about problems you’re having instead of going to your partner for help. [14] X Research source You may choose to stop confiding in your partner if you know that they’ll just be overly critical of your opinion or won’t actually offer any support or comfort.

Whatever their reason may be, it’s possible that you’re feeling lonely and a bit neglected if it seems like they no longer have any time to be together with you.

While you and your partner don’t necessarily have to share everything in common, feeling like you have no shared interests can make you feel very lonely and disconnected. As this loneliness continues to grow, these differences might become even more obvious. [17] X Research source If you realize you don’t have any common interests, finding things to talk about and do together might become more difficult and make you feel even more alone.

You may have noticed that you and your partner aren’t nearly as sexually active as you may once have been. Or, it might be that your partner is actively avoiding having sex and making up excuses not to. [18] X Research source Aside from sex, your relationship might also be lacking other forms of physical intimacy, such as hugging, cuddling, or kissing.

If you feel dissatisfied with your relationship in some way, then it’s certainly possible that your relationship and/or partner is causing you to feel lonely. However, there could also be outside factors causing these feelings. [19] X Research source To pinpoint the exact cause, think about how you felt before and after you started your relationship. Did you still feel lonely even before being with your partner? If so, something else might be causing these lonely feelings. Other causes of loneliness include dramatic changes in your life, such as a career change or the death of a loved one, low self-esteem, and personality or mental health disorders, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) or depression. If your partner can pinpoint specific examples of when they made an effort to make you feel satisfied and happy but you’re still feeling lonely, it’s possible that your relationship isn’t necessarily the problem. However, if you can point out specific things that dissatisfy you in your relationship, or if your partner also feels lonely, it might be your relationship causing these feelings."

If you can pinpoint a specific behavior of your partner that’s causing these lonely feelings, it can be extremely helpful in figuring out what steps to take next.

When you talk to them, speak honestly about your feelings and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable with them. Avoid placing any blame and just speak about your personal experiences and emotions. [21] X Research source Use “I” statements to help avoid sounding like you’re blaming them and keep the focus on your emotions and perspective. For example, instead of saying, “You make me feel terrible because you don’t want to spend time together,” say, “I’ve been feeling really lonely lately, and it seems like we don’t spend as much time together as we used to.” Be sure to also listen to your partner’s side of the story.

When you hold a grudge, you end up creating an even bigger distance between you and your partner. However, choosing to forgive your partner can bring you closer and help heal wounds much quicker. [24] X Research source Forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting. In fact, it’s important to remember how they hurt you so that you can work together to make sure they don’t repeat their mistake again.
