      "content": "Decide whether to use a signature generator. If you're not skilled with HTML and/or want to customize a template instead of starting from scratch, an HTML signature generator is best. A generator makes it so you don't have to write the code yourself or scour the web for images and icons. Although most HTML signature generators cost money, HubSpot's signature generator is free. You can start with one of 6 templates and add your own info and images. For professional templates and more advanced features, try a paid signature generator like MySignature ,or Newoldstamp , or Si.gnatu.re . If you do know HTML, compose your signature in a WYSIWYG editor like this online editor . You won't be able to just copy the raw HTML code and paste it into Gmail—you'll actually have to copy and paste the signature itself, which will automatically embed any images you added in the editor."

      "title": "Download icons or images for your signature.",
      "content": "Download icons or images for your signature. If you aren't using a signature generator's built-in icons, you'll want to find royalty-free icons to use. For example, if you want to include social media links in your signature, you'll want to use icons instead of long ugly links. Check out Uxwing and Flaticon for thousands of free icons. When downloading an icon, save it in the PNG format for the best quality-to-size ratio and compatibility."

    {
      "title": "Reduce the size of your icons and other images.",
      "content": "Reduce the size of your icons and other images. You can skip this if you're not adding your own icons. The standard email signature width is 650 pixels, but you can make it even thinner than that to ensure it will look right in all email clients. This means you'll want your images to be much smaller than that—a 500 px icon will take up the majority of your signature! Reduce the sizes of your images their sizes in an image editor before adding them to your signature. You may have to play around with the sizing a bit until you find one that works with your design, but start with 50 to 100 pixels per icon. Some popular online image resizers are OnlinePNG Tools , Adobe's free resizer and Resize PNG ."

      "content": "Design your signature. If you're using a signature builder, edit the template as described by the editor. If you're using an HTML editor, just write the HTML by hand, or use the style tools built into the WYSIWYG portion of the editor to lay out your signature. Some important things to keep in mind if you're using an HTML editor: Stick to 650 px width or less. Avoid using bullet points, as they may render strangely on different email clients. Using too many (or too large) images can obscure the text."
