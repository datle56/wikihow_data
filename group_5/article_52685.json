      "content": "Show her affection. Relationships thrive when both partners prioritize non-sexual touch. Make time for hugging, hand-holding, or cuddling.

Non-sexual touches can help de-escalate arguments and stress in a relationship. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Be open to new experiences. If you find that intimacy in the bedroom has grown stale, address it directly. “It’s definitely a really hard subject to broach, but a really important one,” Psychotherapist Kelli Miller agrees, “It’s okay to voice what you like and what you want.” If you don’t know how to approach the topic, try Miller’s suggestion and say something like, “Oh, hey, I was thinking about it…I’m really excited for the two of us to embark on…doing something different.” Bring up what your fantasies are, and follow up by asking what hers are. If your partner isn’t onboard with a suggestion, that’s okay. “[You’re both] people, it’s a consensual thing,” Miller explains. “You can always…fantasize about it [or find ways] where you can still kind of get the excitement from it all, [without] necessarily doing it.” In healthy relationships, there’s room to compromise. Work together to find something that makes you feel good and excited."

If you think this might be happening, a direct and honest conversation is the best way to solve the issue—but keep in mind that your GF isn’t trying to trick you.
