      "content": "“Honesty is the best policy” is a proverb meaning it’s best to tell the truth. [1] X Research source Even when lying or omitting the truth seems easier or more beneficial, this phrase is a reminder that you’ll be better off in the long run by being honest, even if it’s uncomfortable in the short-term. By being honest, you’ll gain the trust and respect of others and you won’t have to maintain any lies or deceive people you care about. Here's an example of how someone might use this phrase: “You should tell your friends the truth about what happened last night so you don’t have to keep lying, son. Honesty is the best policy, after all.”"

      "title": "Remind yourself that you’ll feel better later on if you’re honest now.",
      "content": "Remind yourself that you’ll feel better later on if you’re honest now. Honesty will repay you better than lies will. [2] X Research source Even if the truth causes some tension or hard feelings at first, eventually, these things will pass. For example, if you no longer want to date your partner, be honest and communicate that to them. It may feel awkward and they might get upset, but you’ll both end up happier because you’ll be free to find someone you really want to be with. You might say: “I can’t believe I scratched my mom’s car! Well, I better rip the band-aid off since she’ll find out about it anyway. Honesty is the best policy, I guess!” “I opened up about my mental health struggles, and it turns out a lot of people can relate! I wished I stopped hiding it sooner. Honesty really is the best policy!”"

      "content": "Use the phrase to offer people advice when they’re in a dilemma. If a friend, family member, or colleague doesn’t know whether to fess up to a mistake they made or say what they’re really thinking, tell them “Honesty is the best policy.” [3] X Research source This will encourage them to open up and look for a real resolution to their problem rather than covering things up with lies or silence. Here are some examples: Them: “I’m really upset with Brad for forgetting my birthday, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it to say something.” You: “Well, I say honesty is the policy. He’ll never know he hurt you if you don’t say something.” Them: “I don’t know what to do! I accidentally printed the wrong version of those reports for the Board meeting today.” You: “Well, I’d let the Board know there was a mix-up and that you’re working on getting the right reports. Honesty is the best policy, and it’s better that they know you’re working on a solution than to have them think you didn’t catch it at all.”"

      "title": "The idea of “Honesty is the best policy” has roots in multiple cultures.",
      "content": "The idea of “Honesty is the best policy” has roots in multiple cultures. One early example comes from an ancient Greek tale about a woodcutter who lost his rusty old ax. When the god Mercury presented him with a golden ax and asked if it was his, the woodcutter replied honestly and said it wasn’t. For his honesty, Mercury awarded the woodcutter both the golden ax and his own rusty ax, too. [4] X Research source One of the earliest recordings of the actual phrase in English comes from 1605. In his Europae Speculum , English politician Sir Edwin Sandys wrote, “Our grosse conceipts, who think honestie the best policie.” Many famous American politicians and Founding Fathers have also popularized, written, or used the phrase in speeches, including Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and more. The 1st President of the United States, George Washington, used the phrase in his farewell speech to the nation: “I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy.\""

      "content": "Lying less is linked to better physical and mental health. In one study, a group of people was asked to intentionally lie less over a 10-week period. When they reduced both white lies and major lies, the participants reported fewer mental health complaints, like feeling tense or melancholy, as well as fewer physical ailments, like sore throats or back pain.

      "content": "Telling the truth builds stronger relationships. When you drop white lies and fabrications, you start to tell the truth about your accomplishments, exaggerate less, and stop making false excuses for things like being late. This openness and authenticity affect your daily interactions—your personal relationships improve, and your social interactions generally go more smoothly when you’re truthful. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Being honest and transparent is key to a good relationship. People that love and care about you are likely very attuned to you and can sense when your words lack harmony with your feelings or actions."

      "title": "You’ll feel and appear more authentic.",
      "content": "You’ll feel and appear more authentic. When you lie to others, you often end up lying to yourself, as well. However, when you acknowledge your shortcomings or wrongdoings and evaluate yourself honestly , your sense of authenticity increases. You’ll notice it in yourself, and those around you will too. [7] X Research source A solid sense of authenticity is linked to increased happiness and life satisfaction, too."

      "title": "You’ll feel more secure in your abilities.",
      "content": "You’ll feel more secure in your abilities. When you cheat or lie to succeed or win something (like copying answers during a math test), you tend to forget about the dishonesty later on and assume credit for your success. This can cause an inflated sense of your own abilities, and when you’re confronted with a challenge, you may suddenly feel insecure or like you don’t have the skills to overcome it. [8] X Research source When you're honest and accept failures, though, you fully understand what your abilities are and can put in the time and effort to improve them, which increases your confidence and security."

      "content": "Honesty makes you a more effective and trusted leader. People who tell the truth are seen as reliable and consistent—both great qualities for leaders! When you're honest with yourself and others and hold yourself accountable for your decisions, your colleagues are more likely to trust you and follow your lead. [9] X Research source Honesty also helps you be more comfortable being yourself at work, which improves your relationships with colleagues and the people you manage."

      "content": "People trust you more. If people are aware of your dishonesty, people will be more guarded around you and share less information with you. However, if you have a reputation for being honest, those around you will relax and be more authentic in your presence. This leads to more information, opportunities, and valuable relationships coming your way. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "It’s respectful to others to tell the truth.",
      "content": "It’s respectful to others to tell the truth. An occasional white lie may be fine, but constantly lying to or hiding the truth from someone (even just to make them feel better) can be interpreted as a lack of respect toward that person. [11] X Research source It might imply you don’t think they’re emotionally mature enough to handle the truth, or that it’s not worth it to you to bother telling them. There’s always a respectful and polite way to tell the truth when it might hurt someone . However, there are not many instances where it’s respectful to lie."

      "title": "Your opinion has more value to others.",
      "content": "Your opinion has more value to others. When you have a reputation for honesty, your thoughts and feelings about a subject mean more to others because they know you’re being authentic. You’ll also probably only get questions from people who truly want to hear an honest answer, rather than folks fishing for compliments or hoping to manipulate your response. [12] X Research source Most people crave honesty, even when they may not like what they hear. Be empathetic when you tell the truth and try to understand how it may make someone feel. That way, you can choose the kindest words and deliver your message constructively."

      "content": "Lying takes a lot of work and energy. One lie can snowball into an avalanche of deceit—you have to tell a second lie to back up the first lie, and then another, and then another. It’s stressful to have to remember what you’ve said and to who, or to come up with false information on the spot. The truth, on the other hand, takes no effort—you don’t have to make it up or remember what you said, because it was only facts. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Lying can negatively impact other people’s decisions. When someone chooses to do or say something based on a lie you’ve told them, they might be unable to make the choice that benefits them the most. Philosopher Immanuel Kant went so far as to say that interfering with someone’s free decision-making harmed their human dignity and autonomy. [14] X Research source This doesn’t mean that all lies are dangerous to others. For example, if someone chooses not to buy concert tickets because you said they were more expensive than they really were, they may choose not to go to the concert. This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve violated their autonomy, but they probably missed out on a great time!"

      "title": "White lies are usually OK when they spare people from unnecessary hurt.",
      "content": "White lies are usually OK when they spare people from unnecessary hurt. For instance, you might have said “This cake is delicious!” when a friend bakes one for your birthday, even if it was dry and bland. By being empathetic and reciprocating your friend’s love and affection, you’re making them feel good and deepening your bond (even if you were fibbing just a little bit). [15] X Research source On the other hand, telling them “This cake is awful!” would make them upset and wouldn’t benefit them, you, or your relationship (especially because there’s nothing they can do about the cake once it’s baked). Consider if there’s a way to tell the truth without being harsh. In the birthday cake example, you could say “Wow! I’ve never had a flavor quite like this before,” or “I love trying new cakes!” so that you’re not being dishonest. However, white lies can take a small toll on you. For example, if you always say “I’m fine!” when people ask about your recent breakup, you may not feel like you have the support you need while you go through a difficult time because everyone thinks you’re alright."
