Instacart's customer app looks similar but has an orange carrot running diagonally and has no bearing to Instacart shopping."

      "content": "Drive into the zone if you aren't there already. Instacart has a variety of ways to find orders, but both depend on a variety of factors. Full-Service Shopping applies to many regions and zones, stores, and shops. Shoppers can either sign up for scheduled hours and wait for a batch (Instacart calls their orders \"batches\") or some are able to pick up orders during On Demand after completing a few batches on a schedule. Wait for your Instacart Shopper Dashboard to change to become a map. Once on the schedule, you'll see a map that will read \"Looking for orders\" and display a map with the zone's areas mapped out along with a bunch of buttons below. If you didn't receive the map and know that you are on a scheduled shift during this time, tap your menu button in the top right corner and try tapping \"Dashboard\" once more. Dependent on how many orders are out there to be shopped, watch out for red and pink bricked areas on the map. These areas are called hotspots and indicate areas where there are shops that contain batches that need to be shopped. If you tap this hotspot and aren't in the region, you can have Instacart send the regions common shop address to your phone's navigation and you should be receiving an order soon after that. On-Demand batches get queued up in lists. Some zones in some regions begin their life as On Demand only, while others are just getting added to Full-Service Shopping zones where Scheduled shopping is available to some shoppers. Shoppers still pick up batches, but they aren't locked into a certain zone or area but must be within a set driving time (distance) away to make for a successful commute to the store. In-Store Shopping is available only for some stores. With In-Store Shopping, Shoppers apply for a W-2 type position with Instacart and all Shoppers stage orders by picking and paying for the items and placing them in a set location in the front of the store until another Shopper picks them up. Delivery-Only batches happen on occasion in some areas. Independently-contracted Shoppers come in, verify they have the right bags and walk out and begin delivery using their vehicles. Although locked into the stores where In-Store Shopping is currently available, orders from these stores can vary quite a bit and can also be the least-paying."

Below this will be information about the batch including your batch earnings and breakdown of the earnings into Instacart fund and customer tip, along with how these earnings were computed, including total miles to travel between the store and the customer, along with if there are heavy items and it's specific payment amount.

Accept the batch containing the order(s) by tapping this button. If you were on a shift, the countdown timers last for a very long time of 4 minutes. If you don't respond, you will be asked why you didn't take the batch. Although most complain of tip amounts or driving distance between them the shop and the customer, there are a variety of answers that will depend on your exact situation. Most In-Store shoppers have no reason to decline other than they were in the restrooms since they are already at the store. Double Batch (and even Triple Batch shopped the same way) can be tricky to shop and understand if you haven't seen one before. Stay organized and you'll do great with great pay involved too. Just watch who you are sending which notification out to as you move from message to message. Except for On-Demand shopping, on a scheduled shift for Instacart, batches get sent to only one shopper at a time. Shoppers have orders given to them as they come based on the order they signed up for those hours. If there are no other Shoppers and either this first shopper declines or doesn't act, this batch will get sent to On-Demand to be shopped by some other Shopper - but keep in mind that if other shoppers come on, On-Demand batches can remain in On-Demand while the batch can be pushed to shoppers coming back onto the system."

Declining a batch during an On-Demand timeframe does not affect your rates. If you feel like declining batches often, On-Demand shopping may be for you! However, often, shoppers who don't like the earnings or something else, end up sending the order to On Demand for others to pick up and shop and none of these orders may be for you.

However, multi-packs will differ on the product, but their stylings will be the same universally listed way. Watch out for special products such as those that are organic or gluten-free. When the word Organic or Gluten-Free is mentioned in the product name, you'll notice these trigger words become underlined.

With this, you can find other similar products or even go further through the list and refund the item. Often, tapping on products that can't be found can give you either the \"Customer choice\" or a \"Recommendation\" or can even give you various lists of common substitutes (if neither suggestions fit). Avoid using the \"Can't find item\" button unless you can't truly find the item or the item isn't in stock on the shelf with the labeled area. Poorly-worded items along with Customer choices should be shopped last, and may even need a merchant employee's help to decipher where to find this and should be shopped last. Don't despair. Even if your customer still approves a refund for an item, if all of a sudden later in the trip you find the item, you can always go back to unfound items in the In Review or Completed lists and tap them then tap \"Found substitute item\" or \"Scan original item\" and proceed as normal. If the customer feels that you have not made a suitable choice of substitution, customers can still review your change and either request a refund or ask for you to look for another product instead. \"Message (customer name)\" button is a new feature that Instacart is beginning to roll out; it's buggy and clunky when compared to your in-app chat (and holds new messages in in-app chat anyway). This button will allow you to give quick responses to the customer, but often should be avoided in place of your other features onscreen. Quick responses include items that are \"Not available\" (even though you should be looking for substitutes instead), of \"Poor quality\" and to \"Confirm quantity\" (make sure to check your app for this information and check chat for confirmations as you go through the list). Use the in-app chat, find all replies for these messages in in-app chat as well. Using this feature can lead to some confusion over the information provided, it doesn't link to anything and can't be moved into other areas of the message to be sent with the clunky name.

These items often need various pieces of data such as their weight and will need some manual entry using the 10-key keypad on your screen after tapping each block. Most will ask for barcodes first - especially with organic fruit baskets. But don't be surprised if you aren't asked to scan the item after tapping the \"Found item\" button instead of typing the data instead. No barcode for an item that should have one or barcode doesn't work? No problem. Tap the \"Barcode doesn't scan\" and you'll have to use the Force item tool instead.

Watch for items that need a specific weight input. While items from a special cut deli will need to be scanned from the barcoded sticker before typing in the total weight, don't be surprised if those in the butcher block or seafood bar end up asking for manual weight entry after scanning the item's barcode first. However, products in produce may often just need manual entry based on what you've found without scanning the non-barcoded items first. Be careful of customers who place items always found in bunches (bananas are the common issue) and put only a quantity of \"1x\" (1) on their list. Message the customer to let them know what 1 would bring them - one solitary item (not one bunch). However, be kind, as they are learning the ropes too. Tell the system how many are in that bunch when adding the quantity and let it visually tell you that your quantity is more than requested. You can always go back and edit if the customer tells you that one (of the item) is okay too.

At some merchants, these rewards cards will need to be manually entered, while at others this will be in the form of a barcode. Others may have more than one additional barcode after pressing the Next buttons in between, but most likely will be simply scanned by most checkout lanes. Never use your own personal rewards card if Instacart doesn't give you their own rewards card. Personal rewards cards are prohibited during all portions of Instacart shopping trips, and you might even be banned from the store if Instacart finds you violating these terms and agreements."

Instacart will likely accept the entire order and allow you to be on your way. Instacart's cards don't have an RFID chip yet, so no point in trying to find the chip reader. Some stores (such as Aldi) want you to run your card as Debit instead and use the PIN on your screen to be entered into the card terminal. These stores are rather in-frequent, but often get swamped with orders in one get-go. If you forget your card, never use cash. Use your own card and request a reimbursement instead. Instacart doesn't allow cash because it's not trackable. However, at the end of the order, you'll have to go through manual receipt entry to proceed."

Some stores will provide plastic bags but be on the lookout for stores with additional bag fees.At some stores and areas, it's okay to enter bag fees as their own item (if not asked for in the end), but the fee must be described as to who is directing the fee (county, state or business). Some stores - such as Aldi - is known already as a store that it's necessary to buy bags. While customers don't like extra fees, you may be told to enter how many bags into your app and enter them in the last few screens. Customers are told that you are given the green light to buy them these bags, but most customers don't like their shoppers doing so. Never include the customer's receipt in their bags. Not only are you later directed to scan their receipt (in Receipt Check), but it's also advised not to according to Instacart policy. The paper receipts are the property of Instacart, and you must hold onto them at all times thereafter.- Wholesale and membership stores may require you to bring in your four Instacart-purchased bags to shop the order. They can come in handy for keeping temperature-controlled items at their proper temperatures, however, they cost money to buy once you sign-up and are accepted. Let common sense come into play when bagging items. Be careful not to put food and non-food items in the same bag. Chemicals mixed with food will often produce contaminants that may be deadly to humans and there's always the possibility of these products leaking."
