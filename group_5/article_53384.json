      "content": "Use eyeshadow primer first. Unlike traditional primer, eyeshadow primer goes directly on your eyelids, and helps provide a smooth canvas for your eye makeup. Tap a dot of primer over each eyelid, buffing the product onto your skin. Apply the primer from your lashes to your brows, so your eye makeup looks really smooth and consistent. [2] X Research source If you’d like to apply eyeshadow or liner along your lower lid, spread some primer there as well. Feel free to apply the primer with your fingertip, or with a flat eyeshadow brush."

      "content": "Apply your eyeliner before the rest of your eyeshadow. Hooded eyes are a bit smaller than other eye shapes, so it can be tough to strike the right balance with your eyeliner. [3] X Research source Apply a thin line of product along your upper and lower lashlines—this will give your eyes some extra definition without being too over-the-top. [4] X Research source Then, go over the eyeliner with an angled makeup brush to buff out the product. [5] X Research source The “apply liner first” rule works best when you use a pencil or gel liner. If you use liquid liner, apply it after your eyeshadow. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick an eyeliner that dries quickly. Unfortunately, hooded eyes don’t offer a lot of lid space, so there’s a good chance your eyeliner will smudge at some point. [7] X Expert Source Joseph Harwood Beauty, DEI & Social Media Expert Expert Interview. 16 March 2022. Choose an eyeliner with “quick-drying” on the label, like a gel liner, so your makeup looks as fresh and fabulous as possible. [8] X Research source Waterproof products are great for hooded eyes. [9] X Expert Source Joseph Harwood Beauty, DEI & Social Media Expert Expert Interview. 16 March 2022. Think about using a pen eyeliner—these resist the oils that naturally build up on the eyelid, and don't imprint on the hood.

According to makeup experts, copper, gold, and navy liners look great with blue eyes, while plum, olive, and gold liners pair well with hazel eyes. Mahogany, garnet, and amethyst eyeliners are a great option for green eyes, while amber and dark blue liners really complement brown eyes. [11] X Research source Black eyeliner isn’t a great option if you have really light skin. Unfortunately, it can make your eyes look smaller than they actually are. [12] X Research source"

Finish sketching out the wing with your actual eyeliner, filling it in completely. [13] X Research source With hooded eyes, it’s actually easier to draw the wing first. If the wings on your eyeliner aren't as precise as you'd like, dip a cotton swab in a little makeup remover, then use that to clean up the line!

      "content": "Try the “floating eyeliner” makeup hack. For this look, apply the eyeliner around 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) or so above your upper lash line. Your “floating” eyeliner might look a little out of place when your eyes are closed, but it’ll look really sharp and dynamic when your eyes are open. [15] X Research source Always apply your floating eyeliner on top of your existing eyeshadow."

      "content": "Tightlining is a great option. This is a fancy term for applying liner over your inner lashline , instead of creating a wing. Gently pull up your eyelid with 1 hand, so you can easily reach your inner lashline. Then, apply the eyeliner with your pencil, brush, or liquid product of choice. [16] X Research source Tightlining can be tricky at first! Feel free to take it slow as you adjust to the technique. Work quickly as you do this—if your eye starts to water, the product won't set.

      "content": "Create a balanced look on your upper lid with light and dark shades. Spread a light, neutral-toned shade over your eyelid first, which will help your eyes seem a little bigger. Then, blend a medium-toned, glittery shadow along the center of your eyelid. As a finishing touch, blend a darker shade along your outer corners, working toward the upper center of your eye. [18] X Research source You might apply a cream-colored shadow as a base and spread a shimmery blue shadow overtop. Then, you could blend a darker blue on your lid to make a tasteful gradient. Smokey eye looks also work great with hooded eyes."

Spread this color along your lower lid, stopping about halfway through your eye. Then, change to a lighter, highlighting shade, working from the middle of your eye to your inner corner. [19] X Research source When picking a highlight color, you might pick a light, skin-toned shadow, or use a lighter shade of your statement color."

If you already applied mascara to your top lashes, this may smudge the product around your brows. Instead, spread the mascara over your bottom lashes first, and then move onto your upper lashes.
