The following 3 choices are common for homemade dill pickles: If you like whole pickles, many people believe leaving them whole while canning will ensure the crispiest pickle texture. If you like to serve pickles on sandwiches, you may choose to slice them horizontally. They will lay flat easily on bread and can be given in smaller servings. If you like smaller portions and want to serve pickles on the side of meals, then quartering them vertically is a good option. Pickling in spears may sacrifice some crunchiness, but they will be better portions for most people."
