      "title": "Clean out any obvious debris in your microwave first.",
      "content": "Clean out any obvious debris in your microwave first. Grab a soft cloth or sponge and give the inside of your microwave a quick wipe-down. Make sure to clean off each side of the microwave, including the ceiling. Don’t use steel wool or any kind of metal scrubbing sponge to clean your microwave. There’s a chance that small bits of metal could come off the sponge while you clean, which could become a future fire hazard."

      "title": "Heat a bowl of diluted vinegar or lemon juice to create steam.",
      "content": "Heat a bowl of diluted vinegar or lemon juice to create steam. Vinegar and lemon juice are natural deodorizers, and the steam helps soften and remove caked on debris. Fill a microwave-safe bowl with water so it’s about 50% full. Then, stir in 3 to 4 US tbsp (44 to 59 mL) of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar, or one lemon’s worth of juice. Here’s how long you need to heat the bowl for, depending on your microwave’s wattage: 600 watts: 4 minutes 700 watts: 3 minutes 800 watts: 2.5 minutes 1,000 watts: 2 minutes 1,200 watts: 1.5 minutes [1] X Research source Alternative: Don’t have lemon juice or vinegar? Cut up an orange and place the slices in a microwave-safe bowl filled with 2 c (470 mL) of water. Microwave that instead! [2] X Research source You can also microwave a bowl of regular water."

      "title": "Wipe out the steamed microwave.",
      "content": "Wipe out the steamed microwave. Using a sponge or cleaning cloth, clean off all the surfaces again—thanks to the steam, it should be significantly easier to wipe down. Take a moment to clean off any other accessories for your microwave, like the turntable or tray at the bottom. Keep your face away from the microwave as you open it, as the lingering steam may billow out and be hot."

      "content": "Monitor starchy items that you microwave for burning. From a technological perspective, microwaves make food hot by creating vibrations in a given food’s water content. [6] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source With this in mind, drier and starchier foods (foods with lower water content) are more likely to burn; so, it’s important to keep a close eye on anything dry that you put in the microwave. Dry, starchy foods you might microwave include things like popcorn, bread, pasta, or rice."

Simply stir 4 tbsp (68g) of baking soda into 1 US qt (0.95 L) of warm water; then, use this mixture to clean everything off. Once you’re finished, rinse off the baking soda mixture with a clean cloth that's damp with clean water. [8] X Research source"
