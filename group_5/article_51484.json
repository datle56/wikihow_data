      "content": "Understand the limitations. Though similar to game sharing on the PS5 and Xbox , the Nintendo Switch has some limitations that can keep you from sharing your games with others. Be aware of the following: Switch 1 (your Switch) must be made secondary to Switch 2 (a friend's Switch), which is marked as the primary. A primary Switch can access everything in the game library, regardless of online connection. A secondary Switch must have internet access to play anything in the game library and will be booted from a game if it's opened on the primary Switch. Only digital games can be shared. Only one person can play a shared game at a time, regardless of which user account is in use."
