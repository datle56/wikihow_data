      "content": "Test your cleanser of choice. Before you wipe white leather down all over with what you think is a gentle cleanser, test it first. Dampen a washcloth or sponge with water and cleanser, and rub it on the inside of one of the cuffs. After the area dries, check to make sure the soap did not discolor the leather. If the soapy water doesn’t absorb, but beads up quickly, the leather is protected well and you can proceed to clean it. If the water absorbs into the leather readily, be careful. You may want to spot clean your white leather instead."
