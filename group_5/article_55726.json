      "content": "When a Capricorn lady takes the time out of her busy schedule to focus on another person for a few minutes, it’s a pretty big deal. They do not socialize well outside of their few close companions and they love these people dearly and naturally miss them. Since she is a Capricorn, she’ll take a while to open up to you, meaning your interactions might be short-lived or even basic at first, but be patient: keep being available and watch your friendship grow. Since Caps are so reserved, if you want to flirt with a Capricorn , you may have to make the first move. (If your Capricorn approaches you first, it means sparks are flying!) But go slow: Capricorns can be very flirtatious once they feel comfortable, but when you first start talking to your Capricorn crush, keep things friendly and casual rather than flirty. The same rules apply to texting a Capricorn woman —and be sure to text back quickly. If you don’t see your Capricorn regularly, texting might be easier for the ever-busy Cap than face-to-face interaction. Make sure to cut to the chase or be entertaining. Caps love to help and laugh, but they don’t like the mushy stuff. If the texting doesn’t revolve around Capricorn's assistance, or humor, you may get ghosted."

      "title": "The more comfortable your Capricorn is around you, the more you’ll see it in her posture and movements.",
      "content": "The more comfortable your Capricorn is around you, the more you’ll see it in her posture and movements. Her usually rigid posture will begin to loosen, her traditionally constrained hands will animate while she talks, her legs will uncross, and her entire body will just become more open towards you. Pay special attention to how her body movements respond to your own: we tend to mirror the body language of people we like, so if she crosses her arms when you do, or if she runs her hands through her hair when you do, it could be a subconscious sign she is interested in you.

      "content": "This is a big tell, especially for the traditionally reserved Capricorn lady! Capricorn women are hyper-focused on their productivity and can use a laugh more than most signs. So if you want to attract a Capricorn , make her laugh: not only does it mean she likes you, it means you’re bringing some much-needed levity to her daily grind. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "If your Cap lady sets aside time for you, it means you’re a priority.",
      "content": "If your Cap lady sets aside time for you, it means you’re a priority. Capricorn women are so hyper-focused on their careers and ambitions that they hardly have time to socialize, let alone date. So if your Capricorn chooses to spend what little time she has with you, that’s a surefire sign she likes you and wants to prioritize time with you in her chaotic schedule. Keep in mind that the time she is able to devote to you might be very little to start with! A prudent Capricorn woman is far too calculating to jump into a relationship head first, and certainly not at the expense (or perceived expense) of her career. Unfortunately, this means you might need to take things a bit slower than you’d like, but it’s worth it."

      "title": "Caps are all about goals, so her asking you about your passions is more than just simple conversation.",
      "content": "Caps are all about goals, so her asking you about your passions is more than just simple conversation. It means she cares about you and wants to see how well your values and passions align with her own! She will also take steps to support your goals, such as by giving you applicable gifts (think paintbrushes if you’re an artist) or giving you time to devote to your passions. [3] X Research source Return the favor by showing support for her goals and complimenting her on her achievements. Caps don’t like excessive adulation, but they do appreciate recognition for their accomplishments. It can be hard for Capricorns to balance their relationships with their ambitions, so help her maintain the balance: cooking and cleaning for her will save her time and make her feel loved ."

      "content": "As she starts to trust you more, it will show in what she confides in you. Cap gals can talk business ‘til the cows come home, but if she trusts you with more personal subjects like her past, her dreams, her anxieties—then you know you’re someone special to her. When she confides in you, be a good support system—but also confide back! Open up about your own past, dreams, anxieties."

      "content": "Getting a Capricorn woman to go out means she likes you, a lot. Capricorn women aren’t easily persuaded to invest their time and energy in something they don’t see potential in, so her agreeing to go out with you is a big deal: she likely doesn’t see you as “just a fling.” [4] X Research source Wondering where to take your Capricorn lady? Fear not, as she’s probably made the plans already, down to the minute! When planning a date, remember: Caps are all work and no play. If you want to make a Capricorn woman fall for you , plan a date that satisfies her need for both intellectual stimulation and peace. [5] X Research source"

And the more time you two spend together, the more she’ll amp up the physical contact. Ordinarily high-strung and even a little controlling, a Capricorn woman will become more physically lovey-dovey and even submissive with the person she loves—but be patient: it will take time before she feels comfortable showing physical affection. [6] X Research source The physical affection might not extend to PDA, or at least not at first. Capricorn women can be extremely sensual, but they are very conservative and restrained in public."

She’ll become more emotionally vulnerable around you, and you’ll see her exchanging her business casual for sweats or leaving her dishes in the sink.

      "content": "Sounds sexy, right? Actually, for a Capricorn gal, it is. Capricorn women have been called mercenaries, but in reality, they’re just practical. If a Capricorn woman is interested in you as a long-term partner, she’ll want to know the ins-and-outs of your financial situation. Are you a hard worker and good at what you do? Can you keep up with her lifestyle? Can you help her provide for a potential a family? [8] X Research source Your Capricorn may even try to help you with your finances—that’s how organized and committed to self-improvement Caps are! So if she meddles, let her. That being said, Capricorn women are highly independent, and they value independence in their romantic partners. So take her financial advice, but show her you’re self-sufficient by taking responsibility for your affairs yourself. [9] X Research source"

If she wants you to meet the rest of them? Even better sign.

      "content": "If your Cap woman talks about the future with you, that means she sees you in it. Capricorns are efficient and organized, in addition to being straightforward, so if she wants a long-term relationship with you, it will be clear from the way she talks about the future. Talking about the future helps her see if your long-term goals align: Do you want kids? What’s your five-year plan? Respond by showing her you’re future-minded, too. Not only will this show her you’re just as committed as she is, but your organization and foresight will be a huge turn-on for her."

How you go about navigating your relationship with a Capricorn woman will depend at least somewhat on her whole birth chart, as well as your own astrological makeup. Capricorn suns tend to be more compatible with some signs than others, but there’s still hope even if you’re a less-than-traditional match—it just means your relationship might have a little more kick to it. So if you haven’t already, study your birth chart , and if possible, find out your Cap’s exact birth time and explore the rest of her chart too.
