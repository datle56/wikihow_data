After peeling the carrot, use a sharp knife to cut it in half, thirds, or quarters, depending on the size of the carrot. The pieces should be approximately 3-inches (8-cm) long. [1] X Research source You don’t necessarily have to peel the carrots. If you’re using organic carrots, the skin is usually thin enough to eat."

Take each section of carrot, and use a knife that you feel comfortable making precise slices with to cut long, shallow wedges along the entire length the carrot piece to form the flowers’ petals. You’ll want to make 5 to 6 wedges around each piece of carrot. [2] X Research source It helps to hold the carrot piece upright when you’re cutting out the wedges. Balance it against a cutting board with one hand, and use the other to cut."

Once you’ve cut out wedges around the entire piece of carrot, place it horizontally on the cutting board, and use your knife to slice it into coins that are approximately ¼-inch (½-cm) thick. Each coin will be a small flower. [3] X Research source"

Press it into the center of the carrot coin to create a perfectly round circle. If you don’t have a round cookie cutter that’s small enough to fit inside the coins that you’ve cut, you can use a small plastic cap from a bottle or other household item to cut out perfectly round coins. While the round cookie cutter will give a symmetrical circle, you don’t necessarily have to use it. If you’re comfortable with the finished carrot flowers being slightly irregular, you can skip this step."

That will form the petals for the flowers. If you don’t have a diamond-shaped cookie cutter, you can cut out the “V” shapes using a sharp knife."

The notches won’t be as deep as they would be with a knife, so the flowers will have a delicate, frilly look when they’re finished. [4] X Research source For this method, you can’t use a grater or microplane style zester. You need a traditional zester that features a series of sharp holes at the end of a handle."

Turn it to shave off the outer layers of flesh in one continuous strip. Shave the carrot until you have enough shavings to create the size of flower that you want. You can use a traditional vegetable peeler or even a knife to shave off the carrot flesh too. However, it’s more difficult to keep the shavings in a continuous strip with one of those tools, so work slowly and carefully."

When you’ve shaved enough flesh from the carrot, carefully take the shavings off the sharpener, going slow to avoid tearing them. Using your fingers, curl the shavings into a flower shape by wrapping them around themselves. Because of the way the peeler shaves the vegetables, the carrot flesh will naturally curl in on itself, so follow the natural curve to make shaping the flower easier."

After you’ve shaped the carrot shavings into a flower, take a toothpick and push it through the bottom where the ends of the savings overlap. That will help the flower keep its shape, so you can place it on a plate as a garnish without worrying about it coming undone. The toothpick should be able to pierce the shaved carrot flesh on its own, but if it doesn’t go through easily, use a knife to create a small hole that you can push the toothpick through."
