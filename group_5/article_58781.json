      "content": "The Life Path Number is the main number in Pythagorean Numerology. You can think of it almost like your zodiac sign in astrology. [3] X Research source It represents who you are at your core and holds insights into your personality, strengths, weaknesses, and the journey you’re on in life. [4] X Research source Your Life Path Number is derived from reducing the numbers in your birth date. To calculate your Life Path Number, add up the digits in your birth date until you’re left with a single-digit number. [5] X Research source For example, if your birthdate is April 14, 1998, you would add up 4+1+4+1+9+9+8, which equals 36. You would then add 3+6=9 to get a Life Path Number of 9 ."

      "content": "Your Soul Urge Number reveals your inner gifts and desires. Also called the Heart’s Desire Number, it holds insights into who you are on a deep, personal level. [6] X Research source According to Pythagorean numerologists, understanding your Soul Urge Number helps you discover your sincerest desires and seek them out in order to live a fulfilling life. [7] X Research source You can calculate your Soul Urge Number using the vowels in your full name. First, eliminate all the consonants in your full name (including your middle name if you have one), so that you’re only left with the vowels. Assign a number to each of these vowels, using the values below: A=1, E=5, I=9,O=6, U=3, Y=7. Include Y if it is being used as a vowel/making a vowel sound in your name (ex: Emily, Kylie, Terry), but don’t include Y if it is being used as a consonant (ex: Yolanda, Maya). Add these numbers together.Then reduce to get a single digit to get your Soul Urge Number. [8] X Research source Say, for example, that your full name is Emily Ann Brown. First, eliminate all of the consonants, which leaves you with E, I, Y, A, O. Assign the number value to each vowel: E=5, I=9, Y=7, A=1, O=6. Add these numbers together: 5+9+7+1+6=28 Add the digits of 28 together to reduce to a single digit: 2+8=10, 1+0=1 This leaves you with a Soul Urge Number of 1."

[9] X Research source You can calculate your Expression Number using your full name. In Pythagorean Numerology, each letter of the alphabet has a corresponding number. To calculate your Expression Number, first assign the correct number to each letter of your name using the values below: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=1, K=2, L=3, M=4, N=5, O=6, P=7, Q=8, R=9, S=1, T=2, U=3, V=4, W=5, X=6, Y=7, Z=8. [10] X Research source Add up each of these numbers, then reduce the result until you have a single digit number.

Add these numbers together: 5+4+9+3+7+1+5+5+2+9+6+5+5=66 Reduce this number to get a single digit: 6+6=12, then 1+2=3 The Expression Number is 3."

      "content": "Your Personality Number holds the key to your unique personality traits. It reveals the characteristics that make you who you are, and it can even provide insights into your personal style and clothing preferences. There are two ways to find your Personality Number according to those who do numerology . One is subtracting your Soul Urge Number from your Destiny number, and the other is adding the numerological values of the consonants in your name. [11] X Research source For example, if you have a Soul Urge Number of 1 and a Destiny Number of 3: Subtract the Soul Urge Number from the Destiny Number: 3-1=2. Your Personality Number is 2. Or, if you take the name David Jones: Eliminate all of the vowels in the name to get only the consonants: D, V, D, J, N, S Assign number values to each letter based on the same system used for your Expression Number: D=4, V=4, D=4 J=1, N=5 S=1 Add these values together: 4+4+4+1+5+1=19 Reduce to get a single digit: 1+9=10, 1+0=1 The Personality Number is 1."

It’s one of the few numbers in Pythagorean numerology that you don’t need to reduce to a single digit—your Birthday Number is simply the day of the month you were born. [12] X Research source This means that there are unique traits associated with each of the 31 possible Birthday Numbers. For example, if you were born on the 2nd, you likely have an innate talent for finding solutions. Your gift to the world is your ability to intuitively solve tough problems .
