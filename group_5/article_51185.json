      "content": "It’s a specific hug your bf might give you if you pay for all his expenses. If a girl is shopping with her boyfriend, he might lean all his body weight on her back and wrap his arms around her from behind. This is known as the “Broke Boyfriend Hug,” and it typically happens when a guy doesn’t have money but expects his girlfriend to buy him everything. His expenses are usually necessities like groceries and clothing, but they also include games, haircuts, or anything else that isn’t essential. [1] X Research source Oftentimes, a guy will use this move at the cash register when his girlfriend has pulled her card out to pay for him. The “Broke Boyfriend Hug” is not a trend mocking men for being unable to afford things, but rather, highlights the additional work and expectations women experience in a relationship."

      "content": "The “Broke Boyfriend Hug” trend highlights “invisible labor” for women. Women have greater pressures placed on them by society, and this TikTok trend brings awareness to the gender inequalities in cis-hetero relationships. Invisible labor refers to all the work a woman does that isn’t acknowledged by her partner, such as cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, and taking care of the children. The “Broke Boyfriend Hug” represents the additional expectation for a woman to keep her husband happy all the time. [5] X Research source Taking on too much “invisible labor” can harm a woman’s physical and mental health, and in order to have a successful relationship , both partners need to agree on how to split household labor.

      "content": "Some TikTok users believe the “Broke Boyfriend Hug” is a form of gaslighting . Many people have criticized the trend because it represents a subtle form of abuse, or “weaponized incompetence.” This buzzword describes when someone does something poorly on purpose or claims they don’t know how to do it—so they can place the responsibility on someone else. In terms of the “Broke Boyfriend Hug” trend, the man is relying on the woman to pay for everything to avoid getting a job or finding other ways to support their lifestyle. [7] X Research source While the “Broke Boyfriend Hug” is romanticized by some male users, it’s not healthy for one partner to pay for everything in the relationship. Track the expenses you’re covering for your boyfriend, then ask him to contribute more or find other ways he can help out (if he’s struggling to find a job). This might look like running errands for you or cleaning the house. If your boyfriend spends the majority of your income and never covers your bills and expenses, he might be financially abusing you. Stop financial abuse by hiding your money in a secret savings account or leaving it with a trusted family member until you can save enough and leave your partner. [8] X Research source"
