      "content": "Determine which martial art interests you the most. Watch videos online of different martial artists to get an idea of which style you want to learn. If you are looking for practical self-defense tactics, Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Muay Thai , or Krav Maga may be for you. If you want to learn a more traditional martial art that also puts an emphasis on discipline and tradition, Wing Chun Kung Fu , Taekwondo , and Karate are great martial arts to learn. [1] X Research source Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Krav Maga put an emphasis on grappling, ground and pound, and submissions. Krav Maga also covers stand-up striking and weapon defense. Muay Thai is a stand-up discipline from Thailand that emphasizes punches, kicks, elbows, and knees. Wing Chun Kung Fu, Taekwondo, and Karate concentrate on stand-up striking, which includes punches and kicks. You can use all martial arts for self-defense, but Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and Krav Maga use the most practical tactics and concentrate less on ceremony and “set-up” scenarios. Think about your personality. If you don't like hugging people, for instance, you might not want to choose a martial art that focuses mainly on grappling. If you like using your hands, you might not choose a kicking school.

      "content": "Consider visiting the class. If you’re still unsure of whether you want to sign up, many schools allow prospective students to visit a class. You may also be able to get a free first lesson. Call the school or dojo that you are interested in and ask whether you can visit the class before signing up. You can ask by saying something like, “I’m new to martial arts and wanted to watch a class before signing up. Is that possible?” While you're visiting, pay attention to how you feel while you're there. Even if the style is a perfect match for you, if you don't feel comfortable around the instructors and other students, you're a lot less likely to stick with it.
