Keep this is mind before adopting because they often like to play and make noise at night; keep this in mind when considering adopting a pet rodent. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Adopt a mouse if you want a low maintenance pet. You can gently hold and stroke a pet mouse, or leave it to exercise in its cage. In contrast, rats need a bit more attention and will regularly need to be let out of their cage to play. [2] X Research source If you don't want this commitment, get a mouse instead."

      "content": "Pick your pet based on the cage size it needs. How a rat or mouse cage might fit into your home could be an important factor to consider in deciding which animal to adopt. Rats require larger cages than mice due to their larger size. Both mice and rats should have cages where they can be viewed from the front rather than the top, so as to minimize stress. Both rats and mice are social creatures and need to be housed with others of their kind. When choosing either rodent, you'll have to adopt at least two pets and pick your cage size accordingly. However, male mice should not be housed with other mice due to their aggressive nature. [3] X Research source The minimum cage size for 2 adult rats is 1 metre (3.3 ft) x 60 centimetres (24 in) x 60 centimetres (24 in). The minimum cage size for 2 mice is 60 centimetres (24 in) x 30 centimetres (12 in) x 25 centimetres (9.8 in)."

      "title": "Choose a rat for a cleaner pet.",
      "content": "Choose a rat for a cleaner pet. You will have to clean up after both pet mice and pet rats. However, overall rats tend to be cleaner than mice, particularly in terms of their smell and droppings. Pet rats can also be toilet trained whereas pet mice can't. [4] X Research source Rats are similar to cats in this sense, as they clean themselves. While pet mice tend to be a bit smellier than pet rats, female mice are less smelly than their musky male counterparts. [5] X Research source Both rats and mice tend to urinate and defecate in a corner of their cage. You will need to clean this daily and replace the soiled litter. Rat cages need to be washed and/or disinfected once a week. [6] X Research source Mice cages need to be washed and disinfected every 3-4 weeks. Be careful not to disturb their cage unless absolutely necessary, as this can stress them out. If a rat looks dirty or scruffy, it's probably sick. It's not normal, as they spend a lot of time cleaning themselves."

      "content": "Pick a mouse if your budget is tight. Both rats and mice are good pets for those on a budget. However, rats tend to be a bit more expensive as they require larger cages and considerably more food."

      "title": "Buy a mouse if you want more of a short term commitment.",
      "content": "Buy a mouse if you want more of a short term commitment. Rats tend to live slightly longer than mice. If you'd like less of a responsibility in terms of how long your pet will live for, mice could be a good option for you. Rats live for 3-4 years. Mice, on the other hand, live for 2-3 years. Both rats and mice are a commitment and need to be engaged with and attended to for the duration of their lives. You will probably become attached to the rat or mouse, and you need to take that short lifespan in consideration, as it won't be easy to say goodbye to your pet friend."

      "content": "Pick a rat if you want an active, human-loving pet. Rats are a great choice if you prefer a curious and intelligent animal that enjoys human stimulation and companionship. They love to be held and can even be toilet trained and learn basic tricks. [7] X Research source Rats should have an area outside of their cage where they can play regularly. This is especially stimulating for your pet if the space is filled with various toys - and can be quite entertaining for you!"

      "title": "Choose a mouse if you prefer a more independent pet.",
      "content": "Choose a mouse if you prefer a more independent pet. Mice are decidedly more independent than rats. They require less handling and attention and are a good option if you prefer watching your animals to playing with them. Although mice don't enjoy the human touch as much as rats, they still need to be handled daily so as to keep them tame and check on their health. If you like watching your mouse play you can include ladders, ropes and wheels in their cage, or even buy a multi-story cage to allow for sufficient exercise.This is fun for you and also good for your mouse."

      "title": "Consider adopting a pet rat if you have children.",
      "content": "Consider adopting a pet rat if you have children. Pet mice are really small, fragile and often a bit skittish. Because of this they can be a difficult pet to own if you have children, as they donâ€™t respond as well as rats to human touch, making them more likely to bite. A pet rat is hardier and may also be more stimulating for children. Remember that you should socialize your pets gradually. Since they're prey animals, you're big and scary for them. You need to be aware that you're frightening and you first need to make the rat feel at ease, especially if it's a baby one."

      "content": "Consider choosing a rat if you have other family pets. Rats are better able than mice to make friends with other family pets and these relationships can be really enjoyable to watch. Mice are a bit too fragile for this and are usually seen as a snack - especially for cats! [8] X Research source Rats are known to pair particularly well with dogs and cats. [9] X Research source Rats should always be supervised when socialising with other family pets - just to be safe."
