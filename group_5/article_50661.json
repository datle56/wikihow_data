      "content": "Aries men love a challenge, and a strong-willed Leo can give him one. Be a little unavailable at first, so he puts more effort into scoring that first date with you. Keep your social schedule full, and pace yourself when revealing personal information. Let him know you're interested, but maintain enough mystery that he feels he's won the lottery when you do agree to go out with him. End a conversation with, \"It was great talking to you! I've actually got to run and meet some friends now.\" Hint that you've got more to say: \"That's a long story. I think I'll have to save it for the next time we see each other in person!\" While Leo women prefer to take the initiative, take a step back, and enjoy getting to know him instead. Your Aries man loves the thrill of the chase and will eagerly pursue you if you let him."

      "content": "Ruled by Mars (the red planet), an Aries man loves bright shades of red. Entice his fiery personality with form-fitting clothing that emphasizes your femininity. You'll have luck wearing skinny jeans, skirts, and dresses when you spend time with your Aries guy, but anything fresh and youthful that compliments your face will get his attention. Try a sweater dress with a matching scarf in cold weather or a fitted sundress on hot days. Because Aries is athletic, he'll appreciate a simple pair of yoga pants and a fitted tank top. If you don't like red clothing, you can attract your guy by adding smaller pops using makeup or accessories. Apply red lipstick, or wear a necklace with garnet gemstones."

      "content": "Use teasing banter, humor, and physical touch to flirt with Aries. As a Leo lady, flirting comes naturally to you, so use your skills to draw in your Aries man like a moth to a flame. Start with teasing and go from there; flirting builds up the emotional and physical attraction between you. The more you flirt, the more actively he'll pursue you. Say, \"Stop looking so good in every Instagram pic you post. It's killing me!\" Text him a song link and write, \"This reminds me of you!\" To flirt using touch, try brushing your hand against his for a moment, touching his shoulder, sitting close enough to him that your thighs brush together, or hugging him."

      "content": "Aries men love flattery nearly as much as Leo ladies do. An Aries guy may not naturally compliment you as often as you'd like. By flattering him with genuine praise first, you can set the standard in your relationship and feed his fire sign ego at the same time. No need to overthink; an Aries man will love compliments about his looks. \"You look amazing in that shirt,\" or \"I love how toned your arms and chest are. I find it so attractive!\" Compliment another of your Aries' positive traits. \"You're so enthusiastic about everything you do!\" or \"You work harder than anyone I know, and it's inspiring.\""

      "content": "You and your Aries both have big egos and dominant personalities. As a Leo, being the leader and initiator in all of your relationships may feel normalâ€”but an Aries man will also want to take the lead.

For example, in a group hangout with your friends, you can take turns telling funny stories and being the center of attention."
