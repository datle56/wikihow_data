      "title": "Consider a period of no contact with this person.",
      "content": "Consider a period of no contact with this person. Mute, unfollow, or block them on social media, don't text or call them, and hold off on meeting up with them in person. It may be really hard, but in order to forgive and let go, you'll most likely need some time away from them first. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. This will give you a chance to process your feelings on your own and decide if you're really ready to forgive them. Going no contact doesn't mean you'll never reconnect. If you want to be friends with this person down the line, it's still possible after taking some time on your own. In fact, waiting until you're ready may make being friends a lot easier. You may also realize that you like not having this person in your life. Know that it's totally okay to forgive someone without the intention of reconnecting or even telling them!"

      "content": "Embrace the pain, hurt, and anger this person made you feel. If they broke your heart or mistreated you in any way, you've probably got some memories and feelings to process about them. Write down your feelings in a journal, cry when you get the urge, and try not to stifle thoughts about your heartbreak. [3] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Though it may be difficult, you've got to look at how this person made you feel to heal and eventually forgive them. [4] X Research source It may seem easier to suppress how you feel at first, but those feelings will come back to you eventually. To release your hurt and anger, you've got to fully experience it."

      "title": "Use this as an opportunity to say everything you never said.",
      "content": "Use this as an opportunity to say everything you never said. Get all of that out by writing them a letter that you won't necessarily send to them. Write down all of the ways that they hurt you, the reasons you are heartbroken or angry, and even the good feelings you may still have about them. After you're done, try ripping up the letter or throwing it away. This can be a therapeutic way to let go of your feelings and can really help you start to forgive them. [5] X Research source This letter is more for you than for the person that broke your heart. It's not a good idea to lash out and send an angry letter. That may end up making you feel worse, and it won't help you forgive them."

      "title": "Focusing on your own life helps you let go.",
      "content": "Focusing on your own life helps you let go. Learn a new instrument, join a book club, and plan some fun trips with friends. Find distractions that enrich your life. These can help your feelings of heartbreak start to dull. As you begin to feel happier and healthier, your hurt, anger, and resentment may subside. [6] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. This can help you see your experience with the person that broke your heart in a new, more forgiving light.

      "title": "Be grateful for any positive things that came out of your heartbreak.",
      "content": "Be grateful for any positive things that came out of your heartbreak. Though painful, heartbreak can also be a really transformative experience. List the ways your life has changed for the better after going through the experience. Whatever these things may be, say them aloud or write them down on a piece of paper. Looking at the situation from a positive perspective can help you practice forgiveness. [11] X Research source Maybe you started playing guitar every day and are now a virtuoso. You may have also learned a lot about yourself, like what you're looking for in a relationship and how to trust your instincts. Come back to your list anytime you're feeling especially down.

      "content": "This doesn't mean you have to like or support what they did. When you're ready, though, reevaluate the experience from the other person's perspective. Maybe they had a difficult upbringing that makes it really hard for them to be in relationships. Acknowledging their perspective can help you realize that maybe their actions had little to do with you. This can really help you take things less personally and forgive them for what they did. [12] X Research source This can also help you avoid blaming yourself for their actions."

      "content": "Vent to a trusted friend or relative about your heartbreak. They can give you some advice, talk about their own experience with heartbreak, and give you some much-needed perspective. Call your best friend or spend the day with your mom. Reach out to whoever makes you feel loved and supported. Talking about your experience helps you work through the pain and eventually become ready to forgive. [13] X Research source Avoid talking about your feelings with mutual friends of the person that broke your heart. You don't want what you say to get back to your ex, and it could make them feel caught in the middle of things. [14] X Research source"

If you realize you do want to reach out and let them know, consider calling them on the phone or meeting with them to talk. Understand that expressing your forgiveness may not necessarily mean you get an apology.
