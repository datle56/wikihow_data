      "content": "Multiply the base of the parallelogram by the height to find the area. If your problem gives you a measurement of the base and height of a parallelogram, simply multiply them to get your area. For example, if the base is 5, and the height 3, then your area is 15 i n 2 {\\displaystyle 15in^{2}} , since 5 ∗ 3 = 15 {\\displaystyle 5*3=15} . [2] X Research source The base is the length of the long, flat side on the bottom. The height is the distance from the base straight up to its parallel side. Which side is the base and which is height is entirely up to you -- you could rotate any parallelogram to make any side the bottom and still get the same final answer. [3] X Research source"

A parallelogram consists of two sets of parallel lines, and one side is usually presented as the \"bottom,\" making two of your sides appear flat. Measure this flat edge and write it down as the base, or \"B.\" For this example, assume the base has a length of 10cm."

The easiest way to get this is to measure from the bottom corner straight up, using a ruler to line everything up. You do not measure the height by measuring the slanted sides. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Always add \"units squared\" at the end of your problem for the correct answer. In the previous example, you could leave the answer as \"5.\" But this doesn't actually tell you how big the parallelogram is -- inches, miles, centimeters, etc. Since area is a measure of space, you need to tell the reader, teacher, or client how much space you measured. Since the problem above used centimeters, the final answer was \"centimeters squared.\" This means that the parallelogram could fit \"five perfect 1-centimeter squares\" inside of it. [7] X Research source Simply square the units used to measure to get your answer. If you measured base and height in meters, your final answer would be in \"meters squared,\" or \" m 2 {\\displaystyle m^{2}} \" If you have no measurements given, provide your answer in \" u n i t s 2 {\\displaystyle units^{2}} .\" [8] X Research source"

Three-dimensional parallelograms also called \"parallelepipeds,\" are as easy to solve as any other 3D rectangle. Simply find your three measurements-- length (l), height (h), and width (w), and then input them into the following formula: [9] X Research source Lateral Surface Area = 2 ( l h + l w + h w ) {\\displaystyle 2(lh+lw+hw)}"

If you've got a rectangular solid (a math term for a box) where one of the sides is a parallelogram, you can measure the length and height the exact same way as when you measured the length and height for a 2D parallelogram. Remember that these two measurements must be perpendicular, meaning they must form a right-angle, for the measurements to be correct. When done, write down these measurements as length and height. [10] X Research source Remember -- the height is not the length of the diagonal side -- it is the distance between the side you measured for length and its parallel side. For this example, say that l = 6 ; h = 4 {\\displaystyle l=6;h=4} , and that you measured in inches."

Just make sure that you don't re-measure a side that is parallel to your length or height -- the width should be a distinct measurement. You should be able to take all three measurements from the exact same point, with each line perpendicular to each other line. [11] X Research source For this example, say that the width is w = 5 i n {\\displaystyle w=5in} ."

Again, remember that \"148\" means nothing if you don't know if it measures inches, feet, or kilometers. Surface area is obviously another form of area, meaning it requires \"units squared\" even though you're measuring a 3D object. For the example, the prior problem would be in \"inches squared.\" [13] X Research source If you forget which units to use, simply look at the original problem. Remember that 3 2 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}} is really just a way to write out 3 ∗ 3 {\\displaystyle 3*3} . In your problem, you multiply measurements, like A = 3 f t ∗ 3 f t {\\displaystyle A=3ft*3ft} . Just like you could say that the area is 3 2 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}} , you also say the units are f t 2 {\\displaystyle ft^{2}} . [14] X Research source"
