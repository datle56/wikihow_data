      "content": "Open up the door of the dishwasher. Pull the handle or push the button to release the locking mechanism on your dishwasher door. Open it up all of the way so you can find any screws or pieces that you need to remove in order to take the door off.

      "title": "Locate the fixing screws on the side and top of the door.",
      "content": "Locate the fixing screws on the side and top of the door. Many integrated dishwashers have 2 fixing screws located about halfway down the side edge of the door. There may also be 2 fixing screws located at the top edge of the door as well. Check along the side and top edges for any screws that keep the door held in place. The fixing screws may be concealed by a plastic cover that you can lift up to expose them. There may be more than 2 or 4 fixing screws, so look for all of them."

      "title": "Use a screwdriver to remove the fixing screws.",
      "content": "Use a screwdriver to remove the fixing screws. Fit the screwdriver into the slot on top of the screws and turn them counterclockwise, or to the left, to loosen them. Continue to rotate until they’re fully unscrewed and then use your fingers to remove them. Set them aside and keep all of the screws together so you don’t lose them! Fixing screws can sometimes be less durable than other screws, so don’t use a power drill or you could strip them and make them difficult to remove."

      "title": "Pull the decorative door off of the dishwasher.",
      "content": "Pull the decorative door off of the dishwasher. The integrated dishwasher door is also held in place by small rollers that fit into slots on the front of the door and metal connection pieces that look like small brackets that attach to the door. Grab the sides of the integrated door with both of your hands. Pull it straight up to lift it off of the front of the dishwasher. [2] X Research source For some models, you may need to wiggle the door to separate it from the dishwasher. Don’t force or try to snap the door off. Check to make sure that all of the fixing screws have been removed if you’re having trouble removing the door."

      "title": "Choose an integrated door that matches your kitchen.",
      "content": "Choose an integrated door that matches your kitchen. Look for a door that matches the design of your cabinets so it blends in. You could also choose a door that doesn’t match your cabinets but fits with the style of your kitchen. For example, you could use a stainless steel door for a sleek and modern look. Make sure the integrated door fits the parameters of your dishwasher."

      "title": "Line up the fixing plate with the connection sites.",
      "content": "Line up the fixing plate with the connection sites. The fixing plate is the panel between the integrated door and the actual door of the dishwasher that holds the rollers and metal connections to fasten them together. Align the fixing plate with the holes where the rollers and metal connectors need to be attached and mark the locations on the plate. [3] X Research source Use a marker or a pencil to make your markings. There are generally 4 connection pieces that need to be attached to secure the integrated door to the dishwasher."

      "content": "Attach the door rollers and connection pieces. Integrated dishwasher doors use small wheel, or rollers, that fit into slots on the front of the dishwasher and metal connection pieces that that look like small brackets and connect the door to the front of the dishwasher. Screw in the pieces at the locations that you marked so you can line them up and connect them to the front of the dishwasher. [4] X Research source Use a drill or a screwdriver to attach the screws. Make sure you screw each piece in fully so the door is stable and doesn’t shake when the dishwasher is running."

      "content": "Slide the door onto the roller slots and connections. Pick up the door with both hands and line up the small rollers and connection pieces with their slots on the front of the dishwasher. Fit the rollers into the openings that hold them and slide the connection pieces onto their slots. The door will slide into place. [5] X Research source You may need to raise the door to fit it into the slot and push it down to secure it in place."

Some dishwasher doors have 2 fixing screws on the side and some have 2 on the top as well. Use a screwdriver to install all of the fixing screws into their slots. [6] X Research source Make sure the screws are tight so the door doesn’t rattle."
