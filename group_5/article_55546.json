      "title": "Be the first to extend your hand.",
      "content": "Be the first to extend your hand. This makes a strong, lasting impression on the person at the receiving end. It is also about control; by offering your hand first, you are leading the way. This applies to both men and women; don't shy away for reasons of being coy or putting yourself down. The one exception is if you’re visiting someone’s home or office. Wait for them to reach out first when you’re on their home turf. The other time that you should not seek to be so affable as to offer to shake first is where there is an authority structure in place that should be adhered to. For example, if there is a more senior or higher-ranked person in a social gathering, work or business context, follow the lead of the higher ranked person (President, Governor-General, CEO etc.)."

The exception to using the right hand is if you don't have one, if it is paralyzed or otherwise seriously injured."

      "content": "Shake up and down 3 times. Avoid excessive pumping or shaking as it becomes annoying and distracting. Just move your hand up and down a few times. Don't linger for too long. A normal handshake lasts about 3-5 seconds. If you hold someone's hand too long, it can become an embarrassing social faux pas."

      "content": "When giving the handshake, make eye contact and state your usual greetings. Convey confidence in both your handshake and stance. If this is your first time meeting them, this would typically be the first time"
