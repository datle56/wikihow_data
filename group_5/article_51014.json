      "content": "It depends on context, but “bing chilling” may come across as racist. While the phrase is used as a nondescript answer in casual situations, some believe “bing chilling” is used by non-Asian people to make fun of the Chinese language, and to a wider extent, Asian people. On the Internet, the phrase often appears on photos and videos that feature any type of East or Southeast Asian person, even if they are not Chinese.
