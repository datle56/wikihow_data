Click on \"Control Panel.\" In the search box in the upper-right corner, type in \"Network\" and click on the \"Network and Sharing Center\" link when the search results appear.

Right-click on \"Computer\" and select \"Properties.\" Under the section for \"Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings,\" you will see either the word \"Workgroup\" or \"Domain\" followed by its name."
