      "content": "Miss or Mister is appropriate until the nurse introduces themself to you. This is a respectful way to get their attention if you’re not sure how they prefer to be addressed. If you can see their nametag, include their first or last name afterwards. This is appropriate for any type of nurse, including an RN, NP, or CRNA. [1] X Research source For example: “Excuse me, Miss Lauren?” “Thank you, Mister Hill.” “Hi Miss, can you point me in the right direction?”"

      "title": "“Nurse” is a respectful way to address any nurse until they tell you otherwise.",
      "content": "“Nurse” is a respectful way to address any nurse until they tell you otherwise. It’s similar to how you would call a doctor “doctor” when you first meet. It might feel too formal at first, but many nurses will let you know what to call them after you start talking. Some may prefer “nurse” as a matter of privacy. [2] X Research source “Excuse me, nurse?” “Thank you, nurse!” “Good morning, nurse. How would you like to be addressed?” Even though a Nurse Practitioner may serve in a doctor-like role, they should still be addressed as “nurse” rather than “doctor.”"

      "title": "The majority of nurses prefer to be called their first name at work.",
      "content": "The majority of nurses prefer to be called their first name at work. It helps build a comfortable, caring relationship with the patients they’re looking after. Wait to call them by name until they introduce themself this way or you ask if that’s what they prefer. Otherwise, stick with Miss, Mister, or Nurse. [3] X Research source “Thank you, Emily!” “Can you get John for me?” “Sarah, which medication am I supposed to take first?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If you know the nurse's first or last name, use it after the word “nurse.”",
      "content": "If you know the nurse's first or last name, use it after the word “nurse.” This format is a little outdated, but it’s still a respectful way to address a nurse if you're unsure what they prefer or want to be more formal. Check the nurse’s name tag if you’re unsure what to call them (most just have a first name and last initial). [4] X Research source “Hi, I’m looking for Nurse Claire.” “Thank you, Nurse Kyle!” “Where’s Nurse Jones?”"

      "title": "Military nurses are ranked officers, just like soldiers.",
      "content": "Military nurses are ranked officers, just like soldiers. In this case, it’s appropriate to call them by their rank and last name. If they don’t introduce themselves as such, you can gather their rank by their name tag or uniform decoration. [5] X Research source For example: “Good morning, Officer Williams.” “Excuse me, Lieutenant Brown?” “You’ll be working with Captain Schumacher today.”"

    {
      "title": "On the envelope, include their designation after their full name.",
      "content": "On the envelope, include their designation after their full name. This way, there’s no confusion about who the letter or note is for and you don’t have to worry about a prefix. The most common designations are RN (Registered Nurse), APRN (Advanced Practice Registered Nurse), and LVN (Licensed Vocational Nurse). If they’re a Nurse Practitioner, use NP. [6] X Research source For example: “To: Joan Smith, RN” “For Kevin McNamara, NP” “Jack Klein, APRN”"

      "title": "In a letter or email greeting, address them like you'd address an acquaintance.",
      "content": "In a letter or email greeting, address them like you'd address an acquaintance. Use their first name if you’re friendly or close to them, or call them Mister or Miss with their last name to be more formal. You’ll most likely only address them this way if you’re writing a thank you letter or, if you’re very close, inviting them to an event. [7] X Research source For example: “Dear Joanna” “Dear Mr. Weiss” “Dear Miss Andrews”"
