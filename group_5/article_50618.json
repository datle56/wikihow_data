      "content": "This Cusp has a refined palate for new and exotic foods. He’s curious and always wants to try something new, so he’s likely to be a good cook or a connoisseur of fine dining.

      "content": "His Cancer side is a homebody and puts a lot of effort into his space. While the airy Gemini side of him loves to socialize and bounce around the town, the warm home he’s curated is his favorite place to be. He wants to spend lots of time there, and a night of Netflix and chill or a homemade meal at his place is his way of showing he’s into you and wants you around. This Cusp puts effort into cleaning, cooking, or whatever else it takes to make your visit to his place comfortable. Compliment him on his decor choices or snack offerings—it’ll go a long way. If he hasn’t offered you an invite, try asking him to come to your place first. He’ll probably reciprocate with an offer to come over the next time you make plans."

      "title": "Thank Cancer for this Cusp sign’s moodiness.",
      "content": "Thank Cancer for this Cusp sign’s moodiness. His feelings are complicated because of the conflict between Gemini’s cold logic and Cancer’s swirling emotions, and it’s common for him to switch from happy-go-lucky to sulking in just a few seconds. Reassure your Gemini Cancer Cusp man that his mood swings won’t scare you off, and he’ll start to see you as the reliable partner he needs. His mood swings might be unexpected, but they don’t last long. You’ll have your usual, bubbly guy back after a few minutes or so. Gemini Cancer Cusps often feel like no one understands their emotional complexity. Sticking with him through his ups and downs shows that you get him, and he’ll grow to trust you."

      "title": "This Cusp needs just as much alone time as attention from you.",
      "content": "This Cusp needs just as much alone time as attention from you. While his Cancer side wants to spend as much time as possible with you, his Gemini side needs room to go out on his own and explore the world. If his personal agenda or schedule feels infringed upon, he’ll start to pull away from you so he can do his own thing without worrying about someone else’s demands of him. Remember his need for alone time isn’t because of a problem he has with you. He’s flighty by nature and the freedom to wander is important for his mental health. This is one of the most hard-to-understand aspects of this Zodiac combination. Finding the balance of the attention and the space he needs is key to a long lasting relationship."

      "content": "This Cusp needs someone who’s fine on their own. As needy as he can sometimes be, this sign is repelled by any intrusion into his alone time and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to tend to your own life. His Gemini side will be especially curious about your travels and activities, and will want to hear all about your day when he’s ready to interact with the world again. His Cancer side may become jealous or feel neglected if you stray too far from him too often. Check in with him to make sure he feels tended to."

      "title": "It takes time for a Gemini Cancer Cusp to warm up to people.",
      "content": "It takes time for a Gemini Cancer Cusp to warm up to people. The combination of Cancer, which is emotional but slow to trust, and Gemini, which often shuns its own feelings, means it takes a lot of effort for him to get involved with someone emotionally. Prepare yourself for a marathon, not a sprint, to grab this man’s attention and make him yours. [6] X Research source Just because he hasn’t fessed up to his feelings doesn’t mean they aren’t there. Be consistent with your attention and flirting and he will eventually open up to you. He’ll take even longer to open up if he feels pushed. Give him the time he needs and enjoy the journey together rather than racing to the destination."

      "title": "This Cusper takes commitment seriously.",
      "content": "This Cusper takes commitment seriously. He takes forever to decide he’s ready for a relationship because he wants to be sure his partner is the right fit and won’t hurt him. If you back away from him after he’s made up his mind, the moody Cancer in him will feel deeply betrayed and upset. For this communicative man, the best way to assure him is to simply tell him something like, “I’m ready for a relationship with you” or “I’m committed to us.” This is not a Cusp you want to alienate. He may be quick to forgive and move on, but he will never forget."
