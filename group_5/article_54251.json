      "content": "Click the color you want to fill the object with. If you're using either the toolbar on the left or the Swatches menu on the right, you should make sure the colored box is in front of the box with a line through it. Whichever icon is in front shows you which color style is active; so if the colored box is in front, your selected color will fill the object. However, if the box with the line through it is in front, the color you choose will only apply a stroke effect to the object, which acts similarly to an outline. To change which icon is in front and active, click the curved arrow. If you're trying to fill text instead of the space around the text, click the T icon in either the toolbar menu on the left, the Swatches menu on the right, or in the editing area above your project.
