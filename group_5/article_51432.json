Start a timer on your phone, or count “One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand…” Stop counting the moment you hear the thunder, and remember how long it took. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide the time by 5 or 3 to find the distance in miles or kilometers. Sound travels 1 mile every 5 seconds, or 1 kilometer every 3 seconds. So, to find how far away the lightning struck, divide the time it took to hear thunder by 5 to find the distance in miles, or by 3 to find the distance in kilometers. [2] X Research source Example: Say you counted 18 seconds. To find your distance from the lightning in miles, divide 18 by 5 to get 3.6 miles. For kilometers, divide 18 by 3 to get 6 kilometers. Though you won't be able to get a completely accurate result because the weather may vary in temperature and humidity, which will slightly affect the speed of sound, this is a good way to estimate how far you are from the lightning."

      "content": "Multiply the time by 1130 or 340 to find the distance in feet or meters. We can use the same idea to get a more precise estimate. Sound travels at a speed of about 344 meters, or 1,129 feet, per second. So we round 344 down to 340 and multiply the number of seconds by 340 to find distance in meters, or round 1,129 up to 1130 and multiply the number of seconds by 1130 to get distance in feet. [3] X Research source Example: Let's say you counted 3 seconds. Multiply that number by 340 to get your distance in meters. 3 x 340 = 1020 meters. Multiply that number by 1130 to get your distance in feet. 3 x 1130 = 3,390 feet."

      "title": "Thunder is the sound of lightning, and sound takes time to travel.",
      "content": "Thunder is the sound of lightning, and sound takes time to travel. When lightning strikes, it makes a noise! That noise is thunder. The noise actually happens at about the same time as the lightning, but you hear it several seconds after because sound moves slower than light. That means you see the lightning almost immediately because light moves super fast, but you hear the thunder later because sound moves more slowly, so it has to catch up. [4] X Research source That’s why the longer you count between the lightning strike and the thunder, the farther away the lightning was—it took longer for the noise to reach you because it had to travel farther. The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second, while the speed of sound is 343 meters per second."

      "title": "Lightning is caused by electric buildup in thunderclouds.",
      "content": "Lightning is caused by electric buildup in thunderclouds. Inside these clouds, droplets of water travel up, and ice crystals are pushed down. When they meet, tiny electrons (charged particles) are stripped away, separating the air into positively charged particles and negatively charged particles. When these areas of positive and negative get too strong, there’s a big discharge of electricity, causing lightning. [5] X Research source Electricity wants to find the “path of least resistance” to get rid of its charge. That path often leads it down to the earth, though it often travels miles and miles through the air first. Lightning itself travels at about 270,000 mph (430,000 km/h). [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Thunder is the sound of lightning.",
      "content": "Thunder is the sound of lightning. The energy discharged by lightning is hot—about 50,000 °F (27,800 °C), which is 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun! This sudden heat makes the air burst out from the lightning, and then the air contracts super fast, making the “crack” noise we call thunder. [7] X Research source When thunder makes a rumbling noise, that’s caused by the air continuing to vibrate after the first “crack.” If you only hear a rumble, the lightning is farther away."

      "content": "Stay inside during thunderstorms, if possible. If you can hear thunder, it’s dangerous to be outside. Head indoors for protection , and stay there until the storm has passed. You might also shelter in a vehicle or under a pavilion, if you can’t get inside. [8] X Research source Remember the 30-30 rule: Count the time between the lightning and thunder. If it’s less than 30 seconds, go inside immediately, and only come out 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder."

      "title": "Stay away from tall objects when outside.",
      "content": "Stay away from tall objects when outside. If you can’t get inside, head downhill to get off of any hills or mountains to avoid getting struck . Stay away from tall or metal objects like trees or telephone poles. Sit on the ground with your knees tucked and your head down, with your hands over your ears, but never lie flat on the ground—this may attract electric shock through ground currents. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you’re in a forest, take shelter under lower trees. Tell your group to spread out. Lightning is more attracted to large groups. Stay away from bodies of water like lakes or rivers. If you’re in or on the water, get out immediately. If you're in a boat, take shelter under a roof, and stay away from the sides of the boat."
