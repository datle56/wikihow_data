Multiply your average weight in pounds by 0.36. The result is your recommended protein intake in grams. The RDA for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, which is why you should multiply your weight by 0.36. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You can also use online calculators to determine your RDA: https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator For example, a person who weighs 120 pounds should eat 43.2 grams of protein a day (120 x 0.36 = 43.2)."

Depending on your age, gender, state of overall health, activity level and whether you need to lose or gain weight, your protein goal should be about 10 – 25% of your total daily calories. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source While this amount may seem high when figured as a percentage, dietitians remind that RDA is the minimum amount needed to function. Most Americans get 16% of their calories from protein, although they should be getting more."

Proteins are also enzymes, substances that can perform chemical reactions over and over again. In addition, proteins act as antibodies which bind to infectious or foreign particles. Antibodies are one of the body's main lines of defense.

When we eat whole proteins, the groups of amino acids are broken down into individual amino acids then re-sequenced into whichever amino acids our bodies need at that particular moment. The amino acids are linked and folded in different ways. There are twenty types of amino acids found in proteins which fall into three main groups: [11] X Research source Essential amino acids: You must get these from your diet, as they cannot be made by your body. Non-essential amino acids: These are produced by the body. Conditional amino acids: These are ones that we would normally be able to produce in the necessary amount, but during times of stress and illness we need more."
