      "content": "Send a sweet and subtle message if you don’t want to be too forward. If you’re in the early stages of talking to someone, dating and relationship coach Julienne Cantarella says to “let them know that you’re interested…but don’t make yourself too available.” Maintaining a bit of mystery will keep him on his toes and create an exciting conversation. I can’t wait to see you. I could text you all night. Hey, sexy. How’s your day? You looked really hot last night. I hope you have a good day, handsome. To be honest, you’re always on my mind. If you want to make me smile, give me a call. Not going to lie, you’re kind of my dream guy. Are you free to call? I want to hear your voice. You have no idea how much I want to see you. What’s your favorite film? Let’s watch it tonight. We should probably go on another date soon… My dog wanted you to know that he misses you. Every time I get a notification, I’m hoping it’s you. I know no one’s perfect, but you’re pretty darn close. Just heard this new song and it reminded me of you. When can I see you again? Pick a day that ends in “y.” Want to call in sick and spend the whole day together? Has anyone ever told you that you have the best eyes? If I could only take one thing to a desert island, it would be you. I’m sorry I didn’t reply sooner. I was too busy thinking about you. Still can’t believe I met someone who’s funny, smart, and insanely attractive."

Compliment his appearance , tell him that he’s on your mind, or invite him to hang out —making him feel desired is guaranteed to get him hot and bothered! [1] X Research source You make me feel so hot. You. Me. Dinner. Let’s go. Your body is a work of art. Woke up thinking about you. I can’t get you out of my head. Put me on your “to-do list” 😉. I love distracting you from work. My bed feels lonely without you. So…What’s the plan for tonight? I can’t stop thinking about your lips. Show me what you’re wearing to bed. I’m imagining your hands all over my body. So, will you be having beer or wine tonight? Just saw your IG story. Damn, you look good. You looked really sexy in my dreams last night. Flirting with you is one of my favorite things to do. I know I haven’t seen you yet, but you look really good. I’m sooo bored. I bet you could entertain me, though 😏. If you were here right now, we’d be doing a lot less talking… If you want to make a move, now would be the perfect time… I have all this energy and no one to do it with. I mean…nothing to do with it. I still have your hoodie from the other night. If you want it back, come and get it. I’m having drinks with some friends tonight. Stop by so I can show you off."

I need another taste of you. I’d rather be in bed with you right now. Prepare to be really sore tomorrow morning 😉. My roommates are gone this weekend. Just FYI. You’re going to love what I have planned tonight. Nothing turns me on more than the thought of you. Guess what I’m going to do the next time I see you. I was thinking about you in the shower this morning. If you want to stop by later, I’ll make it worth the trip. When you touch me, it feels like I’m in another galaxy. Tell me your fantasies and we can make them realities. Morning! I wish I was having you for breakfast right now… Come meet me. I’m in a hot outfit that you can tear off later. If you can guess the color of my underwear, I’ll let you take it off tonight. I’m wearing that black thing you like…Maybe you’ll get to take it off later. Just thinking about that thing you did last time makes me want to scream. I could text you what I want to do with you, but I’d rather show you in person.

      "content": "Ask him questions to start a steamy conversation. Whether you’re talking to a new guy or someone you’ve been seeing for a while, asking flirty questions is one of the best ways to seduce a man .

In the mood to have some fun? Do you prefer giving or receiving? I’m so turned on right now. Save me? Want to blow off some steam tonight? So…How soon can I touch you again? Do you have any idea how sexy you are? If I was a gift, how would you unwrap me? If I said “come over,” what would you say? How do you manage to turn me on over text? Is this photo too sexy to post on IG? *Send photo Be honest…Have you ever fantasized about me? What’s the dirtiest thought you’ve ever had of me? Can you do me a favor? I’ll give you one in return 😉. My love language is physical touch. Want to see why? I know you already had dinner, but what about dessert? My bed feels a little cold without you…Want to warm me up? I have Netflix but no one to chill with…Can you help a girl out? I need help unzipping my dress. Can you come over and help? Want to skip the gym and have a private workout session together? 😈"

Because I just got lost in your eyes. Are you a keyboard? Because you might just be my type. You must be tired from racing through my thoughts all day. Is your license suspended? Because you’re driving me crazy! I’m learning about important dates in history. Want to be one? When I text you good morning tomorrow, what number should I text? You must be related to Google because you’re everything I’m searching for. You look so familiar…Did we have class together? I swear we had chemistry! I have a phone number, you have a phone number…Think of all the possibilities."
