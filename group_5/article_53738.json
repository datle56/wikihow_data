      "content": "Fitted clothes that accentuate your figure will make you feel sexy and confident. Clothing that’s too tight will feel uncomfortable, and something too loose will hide your figure completely (neither are ideal for a first date). Try stylish pieces like pencil skirts, fitted jeans, or wrap dresses that are easy to accessorize or mix-and-match. [1] X Research source Remember, you get to decide what you feel comfortable and attractive in. Your outfit can be as skin-tight or baggy as you like! Try dark, fitted jeans with a t-shirt and white sneakers for a flattering, casual date night look. Add heels to your wrap dress or a pencil skirt and billowy blouse combo for an elegant, stylish outfit. Simple jewelry, like a pair of metallic hoops and a necklace, adds a nice finishing touch."

      "content": "You can flatter your shape by using colors strategically. In general, lighter colors will accent a part of your body while dark colors can hide or cover areas you’re self-conscious about. Pick 2 complementary colors—a light and a dark—for the top and bottom halves of your outfit and flaunt what you’ve got! [2] X Research source For example, if you want to highlight your legs or behind, try light wash jeans with a dark top to make your assets pop. Alternatively, if you want to accentuate your bust or arms, try dark jeans or a black skirt with a light-colored top."

      "content": "A belt will cinch your waist and add shape to any look. It’s a versatile accessory that will balance your look and flatter your curves. [3] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Try fastening a belt over your dress or wearing a belted coat for an easy and elegant touch. A wider belt usually works better than a narrow one. [4] X Research source You can throw a belt over a wide variety of clothes like peplum tops, tunics, sheaths, or swing dresses (basically anything where you want to create or accent a waistline). Wear the belt just under your waistline and let the shirt material blouse over the top of the buckle for an effortless look. A belt is especially handy in fall and winter when bulky coats and sweaters can hide your shape. Showing off your waist will add proportion to your outfit and avoid a less shapely columned or draped look.

Try your favorite pair of high-waisted jeans or a skirt with a cropped shirt. [7] X Research source The opposite combination is also flattering. Wear a long top or a tunic shirt with lower-rise bottoms for a streamlined, polished look."

      "content": "Plus-size women can work these very successfully. A lot of people think big prints will draw unwanted attention to their size when actually, they’re the only people that can pull them off. Go for your favorite big florals, geometric patterns, or animal prints without fear! They’re a great way to show off your personality and unique sense of style, so have fun with it. [8] X Research source Animal prints like cheetah, zebra, leopard, or snakeskin make a feisty statement. Try an animal print bodycon dress with a black fitted jacket and matching bootie for a fun, sexy, and easy look. Fun patterns like big polka dots or stripes pair well with denim jackets or shackets and white sneakers. Beware of too many prints or patterns at once. You want one print to be the focal point of your outfit, so balance it out with some solid-colored more subdued pieces or accessories.

      "content": "Men generally think red is the sexiest color on a woman. You can wear whatever colors you prefer, but red usually gets a stronger reaction than blues, greens, yellows, or neutrals. Try a red dress or top on your first date to catch your partner’s eyes and stun them. [10] X Research source Black is also universally flattering and sexy on both women and men. Remember, you should wear something sexy because it makes you feel good and not because you’re trying to impress or attract someone."

      "content": "A solid color dress or jumpsuit grabs attention and elongates your body. An outfit like this is pretty flattering on any body type and creates a long, vertical line that makes you seem taller. A bright or unusual color will make a big fashion statement as long as it complements your skin tone (you won’t have much else to balance out this look, so choose a contrasting color). [11] X Research source Try pairing your dress or jumpsuit with heels to make your body look even longer and taller. Heels are also a great way to dress up the look for more formal occasions. A monochromatic dress or jumpsuit looks great with an accent belt around your waist. Try matching your bag and shoes to the belt and voila! You’ll look effortlessly chic. Go for sparkly or shiny shoes and accessories to add some texture and visual interest to this look. The solid color loses some intrigue after a while, so breaking it up with accent colors and accessories is a great way to keep it looking fresh throughout your date."

[13] X Research source [14] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Make a statement with your shoe. A hip sneaker, a sky-high heel, or a cute boot are all great options. Kitten heels or flats won’t pop as much. Jewelry can draw attention to the areas you want to show off. Try a cute ring or bracelet to highlight your hands, or a bright necklace to showcase your neck or chest. If you’re worried you’re wearing too much jewelry, remember Coco Chanel’s wise words: “Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.”"

It’s already a nerve-wracking experience, and the last thing you want to do is tug at your neckline or adjust your skirt the whole night. Choose something comfortable that’s appropriate for the date night destination. [16] X Research source Choose a shoe you’ll be able to move in. High heels might be great for dinner and cocktails, but not so much for a walk through the park. Pick a style that represents you. Dressing like your favorite celeb or influencer might make you feel awkward or ingenuine. In general, go with a timeless look over something trendy. Check the weather before you head out. An outfit with layers is a good idea for changing temperatures or rainfall."

Try adding waves or highlights to draw the eye downward and elongate your face. [17] X Research source Bobs, single layer cuts, short layers, or full curls can balloon around your face and exaggerate a rounder face. Stick to styles that add definition and shape. [18] X Research source It’s best not to get a haircut right before your date in case it doesn’t turn out exactly like you pictured it. Try styling your hair on your own first, or ask a salon tech for advice on products, styles, or potential future cuts. [19] X Research source"

Take a deep breath, stand up tall, and strut your stuff! [20] X Research source Keep these 2 phrases in mind: “Fake it until you make it.” By standing tall, keeping your shoulders relaxed, and making eye contact, your body can trick your brain into relaxing. “It’s not what you wear, but how you wear it.” Your look doesn’t dictate how you feel. Have some fun and let go of your outfit insecurities!"
