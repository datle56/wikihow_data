If you are surprised by your period while at school, take a trip to the school nurse. [2] X Research source The nurse will probably have an extra supply of pads and tampons.

Rinse the stained item in cold water as soon as you can. Use hydrogen peroxide to treat stains on light items, and use a colorfast stain remover on darker items. Agitate the stained fabric by rubbing the fabric together with your fingers. After treating the stain, place the item in the wash on a cold cycle. Repeat if necessary. Never use hot water to remove a blood stain. Heat simply sets the stain and makes it permanent. Always air-dry items you think might be stained. An electric dryer might set the stain."

Many people have a strong preference for the menstrual product they use. Other people combine menstrual products and use several over the course of a period. Try different products whenever you get your period to discover what works best for you and your cycle. Pads are absorbent pads that adhere to your underwear. They come in many different varieties and strengths--from panty-liners for light days to extra long overnight pads for heavier days. They need to be changed every few hours and whenever they are filled. Pads are the easiest products to use and might be the best choice for those who have just started menstruating. You can get disposable and reusable pads. Tampons are absorbent tubes that are inserted into the vagina. They absorb menstrual fluid before it reaches your underwear. This can help you hide the signs of your period. Tampons need to be changed every few hours and whenever they begin to leak. Note that leaving in a tampon for too long--or using a tampon that is too absorbent for your rate of flow--can cause serious problems such as Toxic Shock Syndrome. Be sure that you read all package instructions and follow their recommendations on how to use tampons healthily. [12] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Menstrual cups are small, flexible cups made of silicone, latex, or medical-grade rubber. They are inserted into the vagina just under the cervix and create a liquid-proof seal. Cups are often washable and reusable, but they must be emptied and washed every 10-12 hours. They are a very safe option, but they might be difficult for younger people to use correctly."
