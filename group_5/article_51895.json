      "content": "Check the circuit breaker to see if it's been tripped. If you’ve got too many electronics plugged in and running, you may have overloaded the circuit. This is especially likely if you’ve got a bunch of fans running during a hot summer day. Check your fuse box to see if the circuit breaker is set in the off position and flip it back on. [1] X Research source If everything else shut down at the same time, you may simply be dealing with a power outage."

      "title": "Check the auto settings on your thermostat.",
      "content": "Check the auto settings on your thermostat. If your air conditioner keeps kicking on and off in intervals, look at your thermostat to see if it’s set to “auto” or “automatic.” If it is, this is why your AC keeps shutting off. When it’s set to auto, the AC system will only turn on after the temperature has risen past the number on your thermostat. [2] X Research source It’s much more efficient to keep the thermostat set to “auto” when you’re heating or cooling your home. Still, if it isn’t warm or cool enough for you, feel free to adjust the thermostat!"

      "title": "Replace the thermostat's batteries and see if it comes back on.",
      "content": "Replace the thermostat's batteries and see if it comes back on. Read your instruction manual to see how you take the faceplate off. In most cases, there’s a small lip on the cover and you can just pry it off by hand. Replace the batteries in your thermostat and put the cover back on to see if that resolves the problem. [3] X Research source If there are any electrical issues, you won’t be able to fix those on your own. Call an electrician or HVAC technician to have them take a look at the problem."

      "title": "Change the air filter.",
      "content": "Change the air filter. Your filter needs to be replaced every 3 months or so. During the hot season, you may need to replace it every month. If you’ve got a problem with your AC unit and you haven’t replaced the filter in a while, do that first. If the problem resolves itself, you don’t need to call anyone. If the problem persists, you’ll probably need to call an HVAC technician.

In a ductless system, there’s a reusable filter on the condenser outside. For a window unit, the filter is usually behind the grates on the front. [5] X Research source"

Take a stroll around your home and make sure all of your vents and ducts are clear and open. If necessary, rearrange your furniture to make sure that everything is open.

A dirty filter can mess with an AC unit’s ability to blow out cool air, so try this first to see the problem resolves itself. If you have a reusable filter, clean it thoroughly before replacing it.

      "content": "Inspect the refrigerant line. On a central or split system, go outside and look for the largest pipe leading into your AC’s condenser. If your AC is on and this pipe has ice on it, shut your system off and give this pipe time to thaw before turning it back on. If this problem occurs again, you may be running low on refrigerant.

      "content": "Clean off the condenser coil on the outside unit. Head outside and remove any garbage surrounding the condenser. If anything is stuck in the fins, remove it by hand or with a broom. Then, grab a hose and gently spray down your condenser unit. Keep rinsing it until the water runs clear. Dirty coils can occasionally disrupt the airflow and make it feel like your vents are blowing out warm air. [9] X Research source You can clean the coils on a window unit as well, but you’ll need to take it outside to do this."

      "title": "It sounds oddly simple, but you turn it off and turn it back on again.",
      "content": "It sounds oddly simple, but you turn it off and turn it back on again. Turn your AC off at the thermostat and then use your instruction manual to locate the power button. Press that to shut the AC system down. Then, go to your circuit breaker and flip the breaker for your AC unit off. Wait 1 minute, and turn the breaker back on before restarting your AC unit.

However, if you have to do this frequently, it’s a sign that something may be going on with your system and you should get an HVAC pro to take a look at it."

You still need an HVAC technician to come out and service your AC system at least once a year just to keep minor issues from becoming major problems.

While it’s perfectly fine to take a look to try and find a problem, you really shouldn’t mess around with your AC unit too much.

      "content": "Messing with the electrical components is especially dangerous. AC systems are typically high voltage, and it’s dangerous to toy around or touch any live connections. There are a variety of problems that look like a blown fuse, but aren’t. On top of that, you won’t be able to fix any of these problems yourself, so it’s just going to be more efficient and safe to have a professional take a look.

A professional will be able to check the fuses in 30 seconds anyway, so there isn’t a particularly good reason to check them yourself."
