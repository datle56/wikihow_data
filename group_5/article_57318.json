Be aware that the twine will likely not hold any serious weight, so avoid using this hook to climb. It may be best suited for snagging objects. You could use this to pull a bicycle from a river or dislodge a frisbee from a tree. You will need: A length of thick twine 2 wrenches of roughly the same size 5-7 minutes"

You need to create a loop or ring to attach a rope that is also strong enough to bear your weight. You will need the following: 3 feet of 5/16\" round steel rod ($5.00 Canadian at Home Depot) Hacksaw Clamps or magnets (to secure the pieces while welding) A welding mask, gloves and appropriate clothing Welder A grinder of some sort A length of sturdy rope Eye protection"

One possible solution is to tie knots at various intervals in the rope for grip. Keep in mind that the thicker the rope, the easier it will be to climb, but the harder to throw. Another solution would be sliding handles that use a friction device that slides up the rope and grips once weight is applied through a stirrup (foot hold) on a length of rope."
