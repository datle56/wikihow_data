      "title": "Own what happened and simply apologize.",
      "content": "Own what happened and simply apologize. If you sent a harmless late-night text (maybe one with a winky face or some misspellings), your best bet is to just tell the truth. First, sober up with some water and breakfast. Then, go ahead and let the person know that you had a few too many drinks the night before and are sorry for texting them. Many, many people have sent a drunk text in their lifetime, so the person you texted will probably understand. [1] X Research source \"I had a few too many last night. I'm really sorry ðŸ˜¬\" Sobering up before you send your apology text can help you approach the situation with a clear head."

      "title": "Make light of what happened if your text was pretty innocent.",
      "content": "Make light of what happened if your text was pretty innocent. If all you sent was some ill-advised emojis (and no drunken tirades), then the recipient might've thought it was a little funny. Send a joke to acknowledge the humor in the situation along with an apology. The person you texted will likely understand and respect that you're able to laugh at yourself. \"Someone had too many Manhattans last night! I'm sorry if I woke you up...\""

      "title": "Admitting that you're embarrassed might diffuse the situation.",
      "content": "Admitting that you're embarrassed might diffuse the situation. You sent a drunk text and you're feeling a little vulnerable; it happens! First, re-read the text to see if it's really that bad. Even if it wasn't your proudest moment, it's likely that this person will let it go if you apologize and own up to your feelings. Text the person that you're feeling a little embarrassed and that you're sorry. They'll likely respect your honesty. [2] X Research source \"Oh no, I'm so embarrassed. Sorry about this!\""

      "title": "Sometimes, a white lie might be necessary.",
      "content": "Sometimes, a white lie might be necessary. If you perhaps texted someone you just started seeing and need to do damage control, you might consider fibbing a little to save face. Sure, it's not usually a good idea to lie, but it might be your best bet if you don't know this person well (and want to keep getting to know them). \"Oh no, I forgot my phone in an Uber last night and this happened. Sorry about that!\" Keep in mind that this person may be able to tell that you're lying."

      "title": "Let the person know the text was a mistake (especially if it was an ex).",
      "content": "Let the person know the text was a mistake (especially if it was an ex). Sometimes, drinking can make you feel weepier, lonelier, and more nostalgic than sober you. You might wake up to realize that you're actually happy without your ex, but have to fix the situation now that you're sober. If you don't want them to get the wrong impression, let them know that the text was a mistake and that you're sorry. \"I was drinking last night and I sent this text by mistake. My apologies!\""

      "content": "It's possible that you actually still want to talk to this person. Perhaps you texted your middle school BFF or an ex you've been meaning to reconnect with. If that's the case, apologize but let them know that you've been thinking of them. Try to only contact them when you're sober going forward, and be realistic about your expectations if you were hoping this text would rekindle an old romance or friendship. \"I'm so sorry about last night. How have you been?\""

If you recently broke up with your ex or are in the middle of a no-contact period, try letting them know that you won't contact them in the future. This can help the two of you move on and avoid giving your ex false hope if they liked hearing from you. [3] X Research source \"I'm sorry, I had a lot to drink last night.

      "content": "It's possible drunk you said some unkind things last night. If you said some things you don't stand by now that you're sober, text that person a genuine apology. Let them know that you were drunk (but avoid using that as an excuse) and own up to your behavior. This person may be hurt, but they'll have a bigger chance of forgiving you if you take responsibility for what happened. [4] X Research source \"I'm really sorry about what I texted you. I had a few drinks, and I absolutely didn't mean it.\""

      "content": "Sometimes, an in-person apology might be necessary. You might have sent a really hurtful message or something that requires a little more explanation. If that's the case, apologize and ask the person if they would be available to meet in person. Making the effort to apologize face-to-face might help the situation and let this person know that you're genuine. [5] X Research source \"I can't believe I sent this to you. I'm so sorry. Would you be free to meet sometime today so we can talk about it?\" You might also try calling them to apologize."

In that case, you might try your best to forget about it and move forward. Sending a follow-up text might make the situation worse, even. Make a promise to yourself to avoid drunk texting again, delete this person's number, and consider blocking them if you're concerned about their reply."

Take the steps you need to feel better (own up to it, apologize, delete their number, etc.) and then move forward. Sending multiple apology texts in a row or replaying what you said over and over again will only make the situation worse. [6] X Research source Call up a friend for some advice and reassurance. They can help you remember that everyone makes mistakes, and you might even laugh about this down the line."
