      "title": "The most likely cause of your forearm pain is tendonitis.",
      "content": "The most likely cause of your forearm pain is tendonitis. Tendons are cords of tissue that connect your muscles to your bones, and if they get inflamed, it can be really painful. If your forearm is hurting you, it could be because your tendons are inflamed. The location of the pain can help you determine what form of tendonitis you have. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Lateral epicondylitis, a.k.a. tennis elbow, causes pain in the backside of your elbow and forearm. It’s usually caused by damage to the tendons that bend your wrist back and away from your palm. Medial epicondylitis, often called golfer’s or baseball elbow, causes pain from your elbow to your wrist on the palm side of your forearm. The pain is caused by damage to the tendons that bend your wrist toward your palm. You may also have pain over the front part of your arm from your wrist to your elbow due to repetitive activities, such as gardening or typing on a computer. You can also have tendonitis in the tendons that connect to your bicep and triceps, which is why you may be feeling pain when you exercise or lift weights."

      "title": "Your pain could be caused by tenosynovitis.",
      "content": "Your pain could be caused by tenosynovitis. This is a condition caused by inflammation of the lining around your tendons. Usually, if you have tenosynovitis, you also have tendonitis at the same time. The best way to tell whether or not your pain is caused by tenosynovitis is by identifying the location of your pain. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For instance, DeQuervain's tenosynovitis causes swelling in the lining of the tendons of your thumb. Trigger finger, also known as trigger thumb, is a type of tenosynovitis that makes it hard for you to extend or flex a finger or thumb."

      "title": "You could have tendonitis in both arms.",
      "content": "You could have tendonitis in both arms. Because tendonitis is often caused by repetitive motions, if you use both of your arms to perform a specific motion, such as bicep curls or rowing, it could lead to inflammation in the tendons of both of your arms. However, experiencing pain in both forearms is pretty uncommon, so see your doctor to make sure there isn’t something more serious going on. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For instance, compressed or damaged nerves, or a wrist injury can sometimes cause pain in your forearms. Additionally, pain in both of your forearms could be caused by a traumatic injury. See your doctor if you recently suffered an injury and both of your forearms are bothering you."

      "content": "You could have medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer’s elbow. Medial epicondylitis is a form of tendonitis that causes pain on the underside of your forearm where the tendons of your forearm connect to the bony bump on the inside of your elbow. The classic symptoms of golfer’s elbow are pain and tenderness on the inner side of your elbow and inner arm, stiffness, and numbness or tingling. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the inflammation is severe enough, the pain can even extend down into your forearm and wrist. Tennis elbow is another form of tendonitis that occurs on the outside of your elbow."

      "title": "You can have pain at the top of your forearm and outside of your elbow.",
      "content": "You can have pain at the top of your forearm and outside of your elbow. People with radial tunnel syndrome sometimes describe the dull, aching pain it causes as “cutting, piercing, or stabbing.” The condition can also cause you to feel pain down to the back of your hand as well. Usually, the pain occurs whenever you straighten your wrist or fingers. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Radial tunnel syndrome is caused by the radial nerve that runs the length of your arm being pinched somewhere. The tunnel at your elbow is one of the most common places for the nerve to be pinched."

      "content": "You can also have weakness in your forearm muscles and wrist. Radial tunnel syndrome doesn’t affect your nerves, so you won’t feel any tingling or numbness. However, the muscles of your forearm can feel really fatigued. Your wrist can also feel unusually weak and tired.

      "content": "Rest your forearm and avoid activities that cause pain. Think of the acronym RICE, which stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Avoid activities that strain your forearms and apply ice or a cold pack for 20 minutes at a time 3-4 times a day to numb the area and relieve your pain. You can also wrap your forearm with a compression bandage for swelling, and keep your forearm above the level of your heart when you lie down to reduce swelling.

      "content": "Take pain relievers to relieve discomfort and help with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin can help temporarily ease your pain. They also help reduce inflammation. You can also apply topical creams that contain anti-inflammatory medication to your forearms to help relieve your pain.

They’ll examine you to make sure there isn’t a more serious problem, and they may decide to inject a steroid shot directly into your tendon to reduce inflammation.

      "content": "Use wrist flexion and extension to stretch and exercise your forearms. Hold your arm out in front of you and point your fingers down to perform a wrist flexion. Keep your arm extended and raise your hand so your fingers are pointing up to do a wrist extension. Use these movements to gently exercise your forearms, which can help improve mobility and reduce your pain levels. [11] X Research source Gently pull on the top of your hand during a wrist flexion or on your palm during a wrist extension to add more of a stretch."

Hold it in the center with 1 hand and gently make a figure-8 motion as you twirl the stick to exercise your forearm and improve your range of motion, which can help with any forearm pain you’re dealing with. [12] X Research source If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop the exercise immediately. Gently work your way up to it if it’s too painful."

Bend your hand down and gently pull it toward your body with your other hand until you feel tension. Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds and repeat it on your other arm. Then, try the same stretch with your palm facing up and repeat the stretch on both arms. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Improve blood flow to your hands by making fists and extending both arms in front of you. Rotate your wrists outward, then inward in a circular motion for a gentle stretch. Always keep your stretches gentle. If you feel pain, you’re stretching too far. Shake your arms out to relieve tension in your wrists and forearms when you’re doing a lot of work with your hands."

Pour 1½ cups (300 g) of Epsom salt into your bathtub while it’s running so it mixes in thoroughly. Sit and soak in the tub for at least 15 minutes to help with the tension and pain you’re feeling. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate, which naturally helps relax muscles.

Medial epicondylitis, otherwise known as golfer’s elbow, is a form of tendonitis that’s usually caused by repetitive motions (such as swinging a golf club). The good news is that most of the time it’ll heal on its own. The bad news is you have to actually give your tendons the time it needs to heal. Don’t return to your normal activities until you’re completely pain-free.
