      "title": "You can use any kind of pea for this, but yellow split peas are ideal.",
      "content": "You can use any kind of pea for this, but yellow split peas are ideal. Yellow split peas are much higher in iron and protein than their green cousins. They also happen to have a much milder taste than green peas, which is perfect if you’re adding the protein to drinks that you don’t want to taste like straight peas. It’s totally okay to use green peas, but you’re probably going to be happier if you stick to the yellow peas. You can use fresh, frozen, or dried peas. If you’re going to use frozen peas, thaw them under cool water first. You can use any amount of peas you’d like for this, but start with roughly 1 cup (225 grams) of dry peas if it’s your first time. This will make roughly 1 cup (225 grams) of dry pea powder. If you’re looking to bulk up, cut back on meat, or add more nutrients to your diet, pea protein is an absolutely phenomenal option!

Make sure that you sort through the peas as you rinse them to weed out any rocks or clumps of dirt. [2] X Research source Even if the peas are bagged or flash frozen, rinsing them is essential! Peas can pick up all kind of bacteria when they’re growing and sitting in storage."

      "content": "Use a bowl or jar to soak the peas in cool water. Place the dried yellow peas into a large glass bowl and cover them with water. Make sure that the water covers the peas entirely. The peas will expand as they soak, so don’t worry if they change size. Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap and leave them alone. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "This will sprout the peas, which makes them easier to digest. Drain your peas with a colander and line a glass bowl with a wet paper towel. Pour the peas over the paper towel. Next, lay another wet paper towel over the peas and then cover the bowl with some plastic wrap. Leave the peas in the bowl for 24-48 hours, or until they start to sprout. [4] X Research source Keep the bowl at room temperature by setting it on a counter."

      "title": "Your peas must be bone dry if you’re going to make protein powder.",
      "content": "Your peas must be bone dry if you’re going to make protein powder. Preheat your oven to the lowest temperature available. Remove the plastic wrap and paper towels from the peas and spread the sprouted peas out on a baking sheet. Leave the peas in the oven for about 9 hours. [5] X Research source If your oven doesn’t go this low, set it to the lowest temperature and crack the door open. Do not leave the room unattended if you do this, though. If you have a food dehydrator, you can use a dehydrator to dry the peas out instead. Handle a few of the peas after they cool. The peas should crumble easily if they’re entirely dry. If they have any give or they feel even slightly wet, dehydrate them in your oven for another hour or two."

      "content": "Turn the peas into a fine powder with a processor or blender. Pour your peas into a dry blender or food processor. Place the lid on the blender or food processor and blend the peas at the highest speed setting available until they reach a powder-like consistency. [6] X Research source If you just want a basic protein powder, then you can transfer the protein powder to a large mason jar and place a lid on it. It is extremely important that the blender or processor is 100% dry. If there is any moisture in the container, it can turn your powder into a thick paste."

      "content": "Grind up some chia or flax seeds for a bigger protein boost. Want to make your pea protein even healthier than it already is? Add a few teaspoons of seed to your powder! Chia and flax seeds are a great source of protein, in addition to fiber, calcium, zinc, and phosphorus. Toss the seeds in the blender or processor, grind them up, and mix them into the powder. [7] X Research source Many people find that the seeds add a delightful nutty flavor to the powder as well. Pumpkin, sunflower, and hemp seeds may also be a good option."

      "content": "Improve the flavor of a smoothie or baked good with cocoa or sugar. If the flavor of the pea protein powder isn’t doing it for you, there’s nothing wrong with adding a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder for a chocolatey flavor. Alternatively, you might add a dash of cane sugar to combat that slightly bitter pea flavor. You can also add ground dried fruit to spruce up the flavor. For another healthy alternative to sugar, try Stevia, which is an artificial sweetener. You could add a dash of cinnamon, ginger, cayenne, or nutmeg to the powder if you’re adding it to a soup or something savory. If you use the pea powder and you find yourself wincing from the bitter flavor, you aren’t alone. A lot of people find pea powder kind of unpalatable."

You can use a couple of tablespoons of protein powder in smoothies and other recipes to add some extra protein to your diet. Make sure that you stir well or blend the pea protein powder into your liquid to avoid any lumps in your smoothies or other recipes. You can use pea powder in place of flour in any baked recipe. If you are making a smoothie, then blend the protein powder in with your other ingredients before drinking it . If you are making a soup, then use an immersion blender or a whisk to make sure that your ingredients are well combined."
