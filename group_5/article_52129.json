Carpet brooms (or carpet rakes ) have stiff rubber heads and bristles that help loosen dust and debris while fluffing the carpet and restoring its nap and texture. If you don’t have a carpet broom, sweep the carpet with a regular broom and dustpan.

This will make it easier to get to the caked-in dirt and should ideally be performed twice a week to keep your carpet looking fresh. If the carpet is too delicate to vacuum, continue using your carpet broom to sweep up as much dirt as possible. [2] X Research source Cleaning expert Ashley Matuska recommends Ricar brand vacuums: “They’re kind of pricey, but they’ll last…. The companies that sell them are great about being able to fix any little piece that’s wrong. If something in the motor or the head breaks, you don’t have to replace half the vacuum. You can just replace that one little part. I think Ricars are definitely my favorite.”"

      "content": "Prepare and apply your cleaning solution. There are several products you can use to clean a carpet, including commercial carpet cleaners and DIY solutions . Whatever you choose, test it in an inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn’t damage your carpet. Then, scrub the solution into the carpet with a scrub brush or sponge, working in small areas at a time. Scrub in all directions to ensure the mixture really gets into the fibers. Here are some popular cleaning solutions to try: [3] X Research source Carpet shampoo : Put a few drops of carpet shampoo in a spray bottle and fill the rest with warm water. Lightly mist the carpet and use your brush or sponge to deep clean the fibers. Baking soda and salt: Combine equal parts baking soda and salt in a bowl, and evenly spread the mixture out over your carpet. Mist the carpet with cold water, then scrub the baking soda solution into the fibers with a carpet brush. Vinegar and water: Mix equal parts of vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the carpet and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, scrub the carpet with your brush. Dish soap and water: Fill a bowl or bucket with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap. Dip your brush or sponge into the solution, wring it out, and scrub the carpet. Be careful not to completely soak or saturate the carpet when applying the solution. Excess moisture can lead to mold . Check the carpet’s manufacturer label to see what material it’s made from. Certain fabrics, like wool , are sensitive to cleaning solutions while others, like nylon, can withstand stronger cleaners."
