      "content": "Turn off the water supply if you don’t know where the problem is. Locate the shutoff valve in the back of the toilet, below the tank. It’ll usually be connected to a pipe coming out of the wall, although it may feed into the floor. Turn this valve clockwise as far as you can to turn the water off. [1] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. You can skip this process entirely if you know where the water is leaking from."

      "content": "Mark the water level in the tank with a marker. Put the mark at the highest point where the water sits in the interior wall of the tank. This will help you identify if the water in the tank rises or falls over time. [2] X Research source For best results, use a permanent marker. If you use a pencil, rising water levels may wash away the mark away."

      "title": "Add coloring or food dye to the water and wait 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Add coloring or food dye to the water and wait 10 minutes. Add a dye tablet or a few drops of food coloring to the water in the tank. Dyeing the water will help you follow where the water is going so that you can identify the leak. [3] X Research source Wait for the dye to spread a few minutes before doing anything."

      "title": "Check the water in the toilet bowl to see if it’s dyed.",
      "content": "Check the water in the toilet bowl to see if it’s dyed. If the water in the bowl has any trace of the dye you put in the tank, the water in the tank has leaked into the bowl. This means the cause of your leak is a faulty flush valve . [4] X Research source If you have a damaged flush valve, replace it ."

      "content": "Look to see if the water level in the tank has gone up or down. If the water has risen, this means there’s probably something wrong with the fill valve. If the water has gone down, there’s probably a leak in your flush valve . [5] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. If the water level has gone up, check to see if there’s any water in the overflow tube (you’ll hear it draining normally). This indicates that the fill valve is leaking ."

      "content": "Check if the dyed water from the tank has leaked onto the floor. If dyed water has seeped out from the bottom of the tank and onto the floor, this probably means you’ve got a leaky gasket. If dyed water has come out of the body of the tank, the tank itself may be cracked . [6] X Research source Unfortunately, if the tank is cracked, it will have to be completely replaced. If you're not sure exactly what part of the toilet assembly you need to replace, just buy a kit with all new parts and replace everything. They're pretty inexpensive and it will save you a lot of time. [7] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021."

If you want to avoid water getting on the floor, put some towels down and place the tank on top of these. [10] X Research source Placing the tank upside down will give you direct access to the flush valve on the bottom of the tank."

Once you’ve unscrewed the spud washer, simply push on the flush valve to pop it out. [11] X Research source The spud washer is normally the culprit when it comes to a leaky flush valve. Unfortunately, you can’t normally replace the spud washer alone. You need a whole new valve with a perfectly-fitting washer. If you’re encountering a lot of trouble, use a plumber’s wrench to unscrew the locknut."

Once the tank has been reattached, turn the water supply back on and refill the tank. [14] X Research source Once the installation is complete, flush the tank to ensure that the leak is fully gone. If it isn’t gone, check to make sure the leak isn’t coming from somewhere else. If water is still leaking into the toilet bowl, go back and make sure you’ve fully tightened the bolts attached to the flush valve."

[17] X Research source Depending on your toilet model, the supply line will either be a long, rigid pipe or a short tube connected to the water supply shutoff valve. Put a towel or bucket under the supply line if you want to keep your floor dry. There’s probably a little water left in your supply line."
