However, if they give more general advice, you can try asking more specific follow-up questions to guide them to mentioning their employer. For example, you can ask, “What is the most important thing you’ve learned while working?” or “What is something important to know about the industry?” or “What would you say are essential soft and hard skills to have at your company?” Even if you don’t work in the same industry or have the same interests, getting career advice or even general tips can be really valuable. You may be able to use the advice to structure your own goals. [5] X Research source"
