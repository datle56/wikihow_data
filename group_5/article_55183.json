      "content": "Think of someone you might want to be your partner. Most of the kissing that happens in middle school happens either between kids who are dating, or kids who are playing kissing games. To find a partner: Think about people you already know that you might have some special feelings for. Telltale signs that you like someone include being nervous or shy around them, getting excited when you think about that person or see them in the halls, and wanting to spend lots of time together. [1] X Research source Sometimes people don’t find love interests among their friends, and if this happens to you, be open to trying new activities where you might meet new people, such as after-school activities, youth programs, and camps. If somebody asks you out, don’t be afraid to say yes, even if you aren't sure you like the person. Sometimes it just takes getting to know somebody to find you have a real connection."

It will also make it a lot easier to ask someone out if you think they like you too. If somebody likes you, that person might: [2] X Research source Act nervous around you Show off in front of you Find common interests with you Like lots of things you do on Facebook and Twitter Message and text you often Steal glances at you in class, in the halls, or when you're out together"

      "content": "Ask the person out. You can't always wait around for love to find you, and sometimes you have to go out and grab it by the horns. If the person you're interested in doesn’t happen to ask you out, take the initiative and do the asking. This can be a really scary thing to do, but sometimes putting yourself out there is the only way you'll get what you want. Chew some gum or pop a mint in your mouth before you ask so that your breath is minty and fresh. Find a time to ask the person when you two have a moment alone together, and that way neither of you will feel pressure from friends. Keep it casual, don’t be nervous, and don’t make a big deal about it. Say something like, “Hey, I was wondering if you would like to see a movie together sometime?” Or, “I was thinking that maybe if your free we could possibly hangout?!” Make sure you ask in person: don’t send a note, and don’t make a friend ask for you.

      "content": "Start slow. Getting a partner can be as easy as saying yes when someone asks you out or asking someone out who says yes. But once you get together with somebody, it’s important to start out slow. This means: Taking time to talk and learn new things about each other. Holding hands sometimes. Doing things together a couple times a week, like going bowling, playing together at recess, or having lunch or dinner together."

      "content": "Muster your courage. Kissing somebody can make you really nervous, but it’s important to stay as calm as you can, in order to avoid sweating excessively, throwing up, or getting too scared and not going through with it. Ways you can keep calm are: Have a plan about when and where you're going to do it. Don’t rush yourself. If you aren't actually ready, you might feel extremely nervous before a kiss, and this could be your brain’s way of saying you aren't ready. Don’t make too big a deal out of it. When you're going to do something that scares you, it can be easy to make it seem like a much bigger deal than it is, and this can make you even more nervous! Have your plan ready and then keep your mind off the kiss until you're ready to do it."

To avoid making a mistake, simply ask your partner before going in for the kiss. You can say something like, “May I kiss you?” or “How about we kiss now?” Don’t worry about thinking that asking might ruin the mood. Your partner will appreciate that you're being respectful and considerate, and that you want the moment to be special for you both."

Pucker your lips slightly, and with your mouth closed, press your lips against your partner’s gently but firmly.

This method also works if you're trying to get a kiss from a crush that you don’t think feels the same way about you. To play spin the bottle: Gather a group of at least four to six people, and get everyone to sit in a circle. Place an empty bottle in the center of the circle. [8] X Research source Draw straws, pick the oldest person, or find some other way to determine who goes first. The person who goes first will spin the bottle. When the bottle stops the tip will be pointing at someone, and the spinner has to kiss that person. The person who got kissed spins next, and so the game continues."

To play this game: [9] X Research source Sit all the players in a circle. Usually, players arrange themselves in a boy-girl-boy-girl pattern. Take a small piece of paper, such as a business card. The player who starts will press the paper up to his or her mouth, suck air in through the mouth to hold the paper in place, and remove the hands. The player with the paper then turns to the person on the left, and presses the paper onto the mouth of that person. As they connect, the person passing the paper exhales to release the paper, and the person who’s accepting the paper sucks air in to secure the paper to the mouth. The paper gets passed around the circle in this way, and the idea is that when the paper gets dropped by accident, the two people passing it will end up kissing."
