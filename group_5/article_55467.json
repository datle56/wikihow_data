      "title": "Purchase anchors rated for the weight you want to hang.",
      "content": "Purchase anchors rated for the weight you want to hang. Set the object on a scale and record its weight. Purchase anchors that are rated for things at least this weight, and preferably above. For instance, if you are hanging a framed picture that weighs 7 pounds (3,200 g), then purchase anchors that are approved for 10 pounds (4,500 g). You can find anchors suitable for brick at any hardware store. If you are hanging a large or heavy item, you can try using multiple anchors. For instance, you can try hanging a 10 pounds (4,500 g) framed picture using 2 anchors rated for at least 5 pounds (2,300 g)."

      "content": "Get a drill and set of masonry bits that match your screw size. Look for these at a hardware store if you don’t already have them. Use a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the width of the screws you are using, to ensure a snug fit. [1] X Research source For instance, if you are using anchors with screws that are 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) wide, then use a drill bit that is only 3 ⁄ 16 inch (0.48 cm) wide. Packages of anchors will list the width of the screws."

    {
      "title": "Choose whether to drill into brick or mortar.",
      "content": "Choose whether to drill into brick or mortar. If possible, choose the mortar between the bricks, since it is softer than brick and easier to drill into. You can drill directly into the bricks themselves, it will just take a little more time and effort. [2] X Research source It is also preferable to drill into mortar since bricks are often hollow and will not create as secure of a support."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mark where you will drill holes.",
      "content": "Mark where you will drill holes. Use a marker or pencil to plot out each hole you need to drill. Make sure that the holes are at least several times the width of a screw apart from each other. If you drill holes that are too close together, the mortar or brick can become weakened and crack. If you are hanging a fairly light object, just plan to have one anchor in the middle. You can place one anchor on each side of a larger object to provide more support. Measure the height of each screw location before drilling the holes. Place a level on the line between the 2 marks to make sure that they are even."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drive the drill bit into each mark.",
      "content": "Drive the drill bit into each mark. Keep the drill bit at a right angle to the wall, and work slowly. Remember to use a bit that is narrower than the screw you want to use. [3] X Research source Drill slightly deeper than your screws/anchors are long. For instance, if your screws are 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) long, drill about 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) deep. Reverse the drill bit when you’re done to get the debris out of the hole. You can also insert a pipe cleaner into the hole and use it to pull the dust out."

    {
      "title": "Insert a screw into the anchor’s plate.",
      "content": "Insert a screw into the anchor’s plate. Your anchor should be a hook on a plate with a hole in it. Use a screwdriver attachment on your drill. Drive the screw through the hole in the plate, and into the hole you predrilled into the wall. [4] X Research source Some anchors also include a washer to put between the screw and the anchor plate."

    {
      "title": "Screw in hooks, alternatively.",
      "content": "Screw in hooks, alternatively. Other anchors are basically screws with hooks at the end. In this case, just turn the hook’s screw into the hole you predrilled in the wall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tighten everything by hand.",
      "content": "Tighten everything by hand. If you used anchors with plates, take a screwdriver and give each screw a few turns by hand just to double check it’s secure. The screw should not jiggle. If you used screw-in hook anchors, make sure that the hook on each is facing upright and is tightly attached to the wall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang the item on the brick wall.",
      "content": "Hang the item on the brick wall. If you are hanging something like a framed picture, it may have a wire that you can catch on the anchor hooks. Other objects will have a hole, hanger, eyelet, or something else that you can fit the end of the anchor hook into. If your object has nothing to help it hang on a hook, take a trip to the hardware store. You should be able to find a variety of hangers you can attach to your object."

    {
      "title": "Use “pinch” hangers.",
      "content": "Use “pinch” hangers. This variety of hanger is sized to fit just over the height of an average brick. The back of these anchors have clamps you can set on the top and bottom of a brick on the narrow space where it sticks out past the mortar. Squeeze the clamps, and the anchor will stay on the brick. Since these anchors aren’t fastened securely into the brick or mortar, however, they’re not meant to hold heavy items."

    {
      "title": "Stick adhesive hooks to brick.",
      "content": "Stick adhesive hooks to brick. Remove the backing from the hanger to reveal its sticky surface. Push this firmly onto the brick to fasten it in place. [5] X Research source Use adhesive hooks that are labeled “heavy duty” to ensure they stick well to the brick. Don’t hang anything on these hooks that is heavier than they are rated for."

      "title": "Apply pieces of double-sided tape to the wall.",
      "content": "Apply pieces of double-sided tape to the wall. Use industrial strength double-sided tape to ensure it can stick well to brick. Remove the backing from 1 side and press the sticky surface firmly to the brick. Take off the backing from the other side and press the object you want to hang on top. Even industrial strength double-sided tape is best only for light objects, like pictures in cardboard frames."
