      "content": "Expose your crystal to moonlight or sunlight.

The light penetrates the crystal and fills it with positive energy. [1] X Research source Allow your crystal to be exposed to light for about 24 hours. Consider leaving your crystal in place for a couple of days or nights to ensure it’s fully charged. Charging a crystal in sunlight helps fill it with passionate energy while placing it in moonlight brings reflecting and healing energy.

      "content": "Place your crystals near or around sound. Sounds—such as chanting, humming, singing bowls, and bells—have been thought to purify objects, people, and places. Because of this, putting your crystals in a singing bowl or singing directly to them can help cleanse and charge their energy. So, gently place your crystal in a singing bowl and stroke the outer rim with a mallet, or hold your crystal up to your mouth and softly hum or sing a favorite song. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use incense to charge crystals with smoke. In many cultures, sage, santo palo, and cedar plants are thought to have purifying powers. Bathing your crystal with smoke from these plants can help cleanse the crystal of negative energy while welcoming positive energy. Burn a sage stick or incense and hold your crystal above the smoke. Let the smoke surround the crystal for a few minutes to purify it. [5] X Research source Try using a bird feather to fan the smoke around your crystal to add elements of air and earth to your cleanse."

      "content": "Visualize your energy charging the crystal. What you say and think can impact your crystal’s energy—they can be charged with your intentions alone. [6] X Expert Source Emily Christensen Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja Expert Interview. 8 July 2020. Whether you’re happy or sad, your crystal will feed into this spiritual energy and charge itself with it—you’re truly that powerful! Hold the crystal and imagine your prana or energy flowing into it. Chant a mantra like “I am strong” or “I am healed” while doing this to create positive vibes. [7] X Research source Close your eyes and imagine the crystal filling with light. Then, visualize the crystal becoming so bright and full of light that you can’t even look at it. Pray for the crystal to become charged with the power to heal. You can pray to God, the earth, or whatever you believe is the guiding force in your life. If you have a spirit guide, consider asking them for help through this process. You can visualize them in their animal form or chant their name over the crystal."

      "content": "Put other crystals around the crystal you want to use. The energy from other crystals can help refuel the crystal you want to charge. So, if you have more than one crystal lying around, form a circle of crystals around the crystal you want to charge. Leave the crystal in the circle's center for at least 24 hours. [8] X Research source Surround your crystal with healing energetic crystals, such as clear quartz, jasper, amethyst, citrine, jade, and ruby."

      "content": "Cast a spell over your crystals. Magical spells can be a good way to charge a crystal with healing properties. Try making up your own spell by visualizing what you want your crystal to do. Then, think about how you can convey this intention (perhaps through a song or rhyme scheme). Lastly, speak your spell out loud while holding the crystal, or place the crystal in a circle of lit candles and recite your spell. [9] X Research source To charge your crystal with healing properties, you might use a spell like, “Clear and strong, full of light, may this crystal increase my might.”"

      "title": "Cover or surround your crystal with salt to cleanse it.",
      "content": "Cover or surround your crystal with salt to cleanse it. Purifying crystals help remove negative energy. Try washing your crystal with salty water, placing it in a circle of salt, or burying it in salt. These techniques can help purify and recharge your crystal’s energy. [10] X Research source To use salt water, dissolve about a teaspoon of salt in lukewarm water and place your crystal in the water. Allow the crystal to sit fully submerged in the water for 1 to 24 hours (the longer it sits, the stronger the charge), then remove it, rinse with non-salty water, and dry with a towel. To use a salt circle, lay your crystal on a cloth, plate, or other non-permeable surface. Take a canister of salt and pour salt around your crystal to create a circle. Allow the crystal to sit in the circle for an hour or more. To bury your crystal in salt, place your crystal into a bowl and cover the crystal in salt completely. Allow the crystal to remain buried in the salt for an hour or more. To cleanse your crystal with the element of æther, place it in the moonlight in a circle of salt to cleanse, charge, and infuse it.

      "content": "Remove negative energy from crystals with holy water. Pouring holy water over your crystal can help it recharge and fill with clean energy. Simply place your crystal in a small bowl and pour a small amount of holy water over it. There’s no need to immerse your crystal in the water—trickling a little over it is just enough! Once it’s wet, remove the crystal from the bowl and dry it off with a clean towel. [13] X Research source Many Catholic churches have holy water available to those visiting the church. Especially in churches that are tourist attractions, it is often possible to bring a modestly sized container to fill with water."

      "title": "Charge crystals to cleanse and restore their spiritual energy.",
      "content": "Charge crystals to cleanse and restore their spiritual energy. Crystals store and release energy. Think of them like a phone: the longer you use a crystal, the less power it’ll have. Charging a crystal gives it an energetic boost, allowing its energetic benefits to be on full blast. Along with this, crystals can store negative energy. Let’s say you had a bad day, but you go to bed and wake up happy the next morning—the same thing happens to a crystal when it’s charged. Charging a crystal balances its spiritual energy, cleansing it of negative influences so it can best serve you. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Charge your crystals whenever you deem fit. There’s no set rule on how often you should charge or cleanse your crystals. Some spiritual experts recommend cleansing them every day, while others suggest charging them after so many uses. [15] X Research source Ultimately, do what’s best for you! Think of it like when you take a shower. You may choose to shower twice a day if you do strenuous activity, or you may not shower at all if you lounge around. The same works for crystals. Use personal discretion to determine when you should charge them. While there are no set-in-stone rules for charging crystals daily, experts highly recommend cleansing new crystals before using them. This ensures the energy is clean and fresh before you use it for the first time. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a crystal with visual and spiritual benefits that speak to you.",
      "content": "Pick a crystal with visual and spiritual benefits that speak to you. Every crystal has a specific look and energetic property. Because of this, it’s believed that different kinds of crystals can help you in different ways; therefore, the best way to choose a crystal is to gravitate toward which one speaks to you emotionally and spiritually. For instance, quartz stones are the most common healing crystal and come in many varieties (amethyst, citrine, rose quartz, etc.) and hues. Lapis can help bring calm energies your way. [17] X Research source Jasper might help balance your aura and promote peace. [18] X Research source Turquoise may help clear your mind and ease worries. Malachite might help protect you against electromagnetic pollution. [19] X Research source Purchase crystals from trustworthy sources with credibility to their name instead of buying them off large commercial sites (such as Amazon). Crystals can easily be faked, and a fake crystal won’t have the same energetic properties as the real deal."
