      "title": "Choose a date for the tournament by process of elimination.",
      "content": "Choose a date for the tournament by process of elimination. Tournaments are generally planned around weekends, so look at the yearly calendar and pick several weekends that could work. As you call venues and equipment rental companies, use the process of elimination to decide which option will be the most convenient and have the most availability. Avoid planning a tournament on holidays, 3-day weekends, and times when bad weather could be a problem."

      "content": "Find sponsors for the event. Approach some local businesses and the town Visitor’s Board and ask them if they’re interested in donating money or prizes for the winning teams in return for advertising. Oftentimes, Visitor’s Boards will donate at least $1,000 for larger tournaments that will draw in people from out of town."

      "title": "Hire referees to officiate the games.",
      "content": "Hire referees to officiate the games. You’ll need 2 qualified referees to officiate each game. To make this process easier, you can delegate this job and hire a head official to gather and coordinate a team of referees. If the tournament is an informal event with a lower budget, you can also ask each team to provide their own referees."

    {
      "title": "Ask for volunteers to help with scorekeeping.",
      "content": "Ask for volunteers to help with scorekeeping. You’ll need to teach the volunteers how to keep score prior to the tournament, so you may want to meet up with them ahead of time. They’ll need to learn how to keep track of points, sub players in and out, and track libero players. You should also show them how to use the scorekeeping device they’ll be using, whether a flipboard or an electronic system."

    {
      "title": "Decide whether or not you want to charge an entrance fee.",
      "content": "Decide whether or not you want to charge an entrance fee. If you need help covering the cost of the venue and equipment, you may need to charge a fee to break even. You could also make the tournament based around a charity and donate the collected fees to a specific cause. [1] X Research source You could charge the teams for entrance, or the spectators a small admission fee, or both."

    {
      "title": "Set the registration deadline 1-2 weeks before the event.",
      "content": "Set the registration deadline 1-2 weeks before the event. This way, you’ll have all the information you’ll need to create divisions. Make sure that the coaches and teams know about the deadline. If they’ve expressed interest but haven’t signed up yet, send regular reminders up until the cut-off date."

      "title": "Add divisions if you’ll be hosting a wide variety of teams.",
      "content": "Add divisions if you’ll be hosting a wide variety of teams. To keep the competition fair and fun, it’s important to put similar teams together. If your tournament is open to the community, you’ll probably need to create some divisions based on the teams who will be participating. Look at the age, gender, and experience of all of the teams to decide how you’ll group them. For example, it wouldn’t be fair to put a middle school team against a team in their 30s. If there’s a wide age range among the teams, you may want to create age divisions such as middle school, high school, and adult teams. If there are co-ed and single-sex teams, you may want to create divisions for those teams as well. [2] X Research source If you’re hosting a specific tournament, such as a high school girls’ team event, then you likely won’t need divisions."

      "title": "Create brackets for the tournament to follow.",
      "content": "Create brackets for the tournament to follow. Choose between single or double elimination and use a bracket template or generator to easily create the order of the games. Single elimination means that if a team loses 1 game, they’re out of the tournament. Double elimination is a tournament style that lets teams lose 2 games before they’re eliminated, giving them more playing time. For several bracket options, enter the number of teams playing on https://www.printyourbrackets.com/volleyballbrackets.html . For informal, day-long tournaments, you could just use a round-robin format. Round-robin play lets all of the teams play each other, as opposed to an elimination-style tournament."

      "content": "Make a schedule based on the brackets. Note the location and time of each game, as well as who will be playing in each game.

      "content": "Find a venue that will suit the tournament’s size needs. You’ll need at least 1 full-sized volleyball court, though 2 or more may be preferable depending on the size of the tournament. Check local school, church, and community center gyms for availability, then reserve the venue for the weekend you’ve settled on. [3] X Research source You’ll also want to make sure the venue has access to enough bathrooms and drinking water for your anticipated attendance numbers."

      "title": "Set up all of the courts with lines and seating.",
      "content": "Set up all of the courts with lines and seating. Before the tournament starts, you’ll need to tape off the courts if the lines aren’t clear or present. You’ll also need to set up seating for spectators and teams along the sides of the courts, whether folding chairs or bleachers. If the venue doesn’t have bleachers, you can rent or borrow them from a local school or an event seating rental company."

      "content": "Check the net heights to make sure they follow code. Arrive to the tournament location 60-90 minutes early and do 1 last check. Use a measuring tape to confirm the net heights are set according to the age and gender of the teams. Have someone help you adjust any nets that aren’t set at their required height. Men’s nets need to be 2.43 metres (8.0 ft), while women’s nets should be set at 2.24 metres (7.3 ft). For youth divisions, the net should be 6.5 feet (2.0 m)."
