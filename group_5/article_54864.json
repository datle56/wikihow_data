      "content": "Blot the stain gently with the cleaning agent and a cloth. Choose a cleaning agent that works best for your type of mascara. For instance, dish soap easily lifts off waterproof, oil-based mascara while makeup remover is great for both oil and water-based mascaras. Then, apply the cleaning agent onto the stain and dab at it with a clean, microfiber cloth . [2] X Research source Most mascara tubes list whether they’re oil or water-based, so simply look at your tube to determine which it is. Waterproof mascaras are typically oil-based. Do not rub the cleaning agent into the stain, as this can cause the mascara to spread further into your clothes. For heavier garments and fabrics, like thick coats and wool, gently scrub the cleaning agent into the stain with a toothbrush or another soft-bristled brush. Patch test your cleaning agent on an inconspicuous part of your clothes before applying it to the stain. This ensures that the cleaner doesn’t stain your clothes."

      "content": "Wash the garment and hang it to air dry. Look at your garment’s care instructions and choose the appropriate temperature and washing cycle on your washing machine. When your clothes are done, take them out of the washer and inspect the stain. If the stain is gone, air dry your clothes by placing them on a drying rack or hanging them on a laundry line outside. [3] X Research source Use the coolest water as possible when washing your clothes, as hot water can cause the mascara stain to set into your clothes. Placing your clothes in a hot dryer can also set the mascara stain into your clothes. If you still see mascara on your garment after washing it, treat it with a cleaning agent for stubborn stains, like stain remover or bleach."

      "title": "Use dish soap for oil-based mascara stains.",
      "content": "Use dish soap for oil-based mascara stains. Dish soap is a degreaser that lifts off oil and gunk from your cookware and also removes waxy, waterproof mascara on your clothes. Simply apply a drop of dish soap onto the wet or dried stain, dab it with a cloth or your fingers, and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, wash your clothes. [4] X Research source Dish soap also removes mascara stains from pillowcases, towels, carpets, and upholstery (as long as it’s water-safe). Just mix ¼ teaspoon (1.2 ml) of dish soap with 1 cup (237 ml) of cool water. Then, wet a clean cloth with the soapy water and blot it into the stain until it disappears."

      "title": "Dab the mascara with makeup remover or makeup remover wipes.",
      "content": "Dab the mascara with makeup remover or makeup remover wipes. Makeup removers and makeup wipes dissolve both oil and water-based mascaras from your lashes as well as your clothes. To prevent the mascara from transferring or spreading, place the stain face down on a paper towel. Then, wet a cotton swab with makeup remover or grab a makeup wipe and dab the back of the stain. This pushes the mascara stain out of your clothes and onto the paper towel. [5] X Research source Keep blotting the stain until it is completely gone from your garment, then throw it in the wash. If your stain is from an oil-based mascara, use an oil-based makeup remover or wipe that works on waterproof makeup. Using makeup remover as a mascara stain remover generally works best on thinner fabrics like cotton, linen, and silk."

      "content": "Apply a stain remover onto the mascara stain. Gel and spray stain removers contain gentle acids and chemicals that lift off fresh as well as tough, dried-on mascara stains from your clothes, pillowcases, or towels. Dab a dollop of remover onto the mascara and let it sit according to the directions on the packaging. Then, wash your garment in your washing machine. [6] X Research source For most stain removers, let it soak into the stain for at least 15 minutes."

Simply pour your regular detergent directly onto the stain and gently pat it in with a cloth or your fingers. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then wash your clothes. [7] X Research source If you use powdered laundry detergent, mix it with a bit of cool water to create a paste. Then, layer it over the stain."

      "content": "Blot mascara stains on cotton fabrics with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol is an excellent stain remover that dissolves oily, waxy mascara right out of your clothes, linens, and towels. Just place a paper towel over the fresh or old stain and soak a cotton swab or cloth with rubbing alcohol. Then, dab at the back of the stain to push the mascara out of your garment and into the paper towel. [8] X Research source Continue dabbing the stain until the mascara is gone. Then, wash your garment. Do not use rubbing alcohol on more delicate fabrics like silk, rayon, and wool. The harsh chemicals can dissolve these fabric’s fibers. [9] X Research source"

Simply soak a cotton ball or cloth with peroxide and dab it onto the stain. Then, let the stain sit for about 10 minutes. Blot it with more hydrogen peroxide until the mascara is gone, rinse your garment with cool water, and then throw your clothes in the laundry. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Coat the stain with baking soda and vinegar for a natural option. Baking soda and white vinegar lift up oily debris, like mascara, from fabric. Sprinkle a bit of baking soda directly onto the wet or dried mascara stain and then pour on several drops of vinegar. The solution will bubble up and work its way through the stain. Then, grab a soft brush, like a toothbrush, to gently scrub out the stain. [11] X Research source Place your garment in the washing machine when the stain is completely gone. Avoid using this method on more delicate fabrics like silk and satin, as the scrubbing action can damage their fibers."

      "content": "Treat stubborn mascara stains on white fabrics with bleach. If your crisp white t-shirt or fluffy towels are covered in mascara stains and the other cleaning agents aren’t getting rid of them, soak your clothes in bleach . Just mix equal parts bleach and cool water in a bucket or your sink. Place your garment inside the bleach solution and let it soak for 5 to 15 minutes. Then, rinse it with cool water and wash it in your machine. [12] X Research source Check your garment’s care tag to ensure it’s safe to use bleach on it. Wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area when using bleach. Do not mix bleach with other cleaning agents, as the combination can produce toxic gasses and fumes. If your clothes, linens, or towels are colored, pour color-safe, oxygen bleach into your washing machine when you wash your stained garment. Just follow your machine's instructions on where to pour the bleach and how much to use."

To prevent clumps and messy accidents when you put on mascara , gently rub your mascara wand against the opening of the tube to remove excess product. Then, grip the base of the wand tightly as you place the brush at the base of your lashes. Simply wiggle the wand back and forth as you brush up your lashes to thicken and lengthen them. [13] X Research source For an extra bold look, curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler before you apply mascara. To prevent your mascara and other eye makeup products from smudging as you apply them, place an eyeshadow shield under your eye."

Mascara you applied during the day can transfer onto your pajamas, pillowcases, and sheets if you don’t remove your makeup when you head off to bed. Just wet a cotton round with makeup remover and gently wipe down your lashes with your eyes closed. [14] X Research source Rinse off the rest of your eye and face makeup with the remover to prevent eyeshadow, foundation, and lipstick stains. Then, cleanse your skin with a gentle face wash .

Most mascaras are made out of different pigments, like carbon black and iron oxides, to darken and define your lashes. Waxes and oils like beeswax, carnauba wax, and castor oil thicken your lashes and protect them against water and smudging. These same ingredients are also responsible for dirtying and staining your clothes. [16] X Research source"
