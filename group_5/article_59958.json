      "content": "Most of the time, shadows appear because of a damaged screen. For example, if you dropped your laptop, you may have bent the casing enough that it puts pressure on the backlighting of your screen, which causes shadows. If you're confident, you might be able to fix it yourself, but if the components are too badly damaged, you'll need to buy a new laptop. Check around the edges of the screen to see if there are any dents or extra space between the screen and the case. Inspect the screen from the side when the laptop is open to look for bowing or uneven surfaces. If you're able to open your laptop without voiding your warranty, you can do so to check for damaged wires or loose connections inside. Some laptops have faulty screens, so replacing them with the same make and model could result in the same vertical dark shadows on the screen."
