Typically, cutting out about 500 calories daily will result in a 1-2 pound weight loss per week. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, if you’re aiming to lose 5 pounds in 5 days, you may need to cut out more calories. Most health professionals recommend not limiting calories to less than 1200 daily. When you consume less than this amount is difficult to get adequate amounts of the required nutrients you need each day.

Typical side effects of very low-calorie diets (diets that are about 800 – 1,000 calories daily) include tiredness, fatigue, headache, mental fogginess, and lack of energy. Always consult your physician first. Do not start a very low-calorie diet without medical supervision."

Although this is not recommended as a long-term diet, following this plan for five days should be safe. A low-carb diet is one that limits or restricts foods that contain carbohydrates.

      "content": "Make your meals lean and green. For fast weight loss, limit carbs and make most of your meals “lean and green.” This means focusing mostly on lean proteins and green or non-starchy vegetables. Include a serving or two of lean protein at every meal. One serving is typically about 3 – 4 oz or the size of a deck of cards. [9] X Trustworthy Source USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion U.S. agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research Go to source Lean protein foods include eggs, poultry, lean beef, pork, nuts, and seafood. Low-fat dairy products and legumes can also count as lean protein, but you may be limiting these due to their carb content. The other half of your meal should be a non-starchy vegetable. Aim for one to two servings at each meal. One serving is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.

      "content": "Drink adequate fluids. It’s very important to stay adequately hydrated – especially when you’re trying to lose weight quickly. The myth is that dehydrating the body is a good way to lose water weight, but limiting salty foods and cleansing out the body with plain water is what can help reduce excess \"water weight.\" Hydration plays a very important role in your overall health. It helps maintain your body temperature, protect your organs and even lubricates your joints. Most health professionals suggest consuming about eight to 13 glasses of water or other hydrating fluids daily. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This amount will vary depending on your age, gender and activity level. In addition to maintaining adequate hydration status, drinking fluids can also aid in weight loss. It’s been suggested to drink one to two glasses of water before a meal to help cut down on your portions or if you’re feeling hungry. [12] X Research source Aim to only consume no-calorie, hydrating beverages like water, flavored water, unsweetened coffee and tea. Pass on drinks like juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, sodas, and alcohol."

Although this doesn’t necessarily account for weight loss on the scale, limiting these foods can help you feel slimmer. When digested, some foods create excess gas.

Gas-forming foods include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, beans, lentils, garlic, and onions. Chewing gum or drinking carbonated beverages can cause also unwanted gas or bloating."
