      "content": "Mix together hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and dish detergent. In a small bowl, combine 8 fl oz (240 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide, 3 US tablespoons (43.2 g) of baking soda, and 2 drops of liquid dish soap. Then, use a spoon to mix the ingredients thoroughly. [1] X Research source Mix the ingredients in a spray bottle, if you prefer. Hydrogen peroxide is effective at disinfecting surfaces and lifting off stains. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Note : Hydrogen peroxide can bleach fabrics. Apply a bit of it on a hidden part of the mattress to see if it bleaches the fabric before applying it all over. Use the solution immediately, as hydrogen peroxide breaks down fast. If you have a solution older than 1 to 2 hours, prepare a new one. This solution is also effective on blood stains."

Then, repeatedly dab the stain to soak it with the solution. Allow the hydrogen peroxide to work through the stain for 15 to 20 minutes. [3] X Research source Alternatively, spray the stain with the mixture until the spot is damp. Do not completely saturate the mattress with the hydrogen peroxide solution, as this can cause it to take longer to dry. Put on a pair of cleaning gloves to protect your skin as you clean. Use a white cleaning cloth instead of a colorful one to prevent dye from transferring and staining your mattress."

      "content": "Blot the stain with a clean cloth and apply more cleaner, if needed. Use a clean white cloth to dab at the stain, which helps lift up the urine and remove excess moisture. If the stain is still visible, apply more of the hydrogen peroxide mixture, let it sit for 15 minutes, and dab at it again. [4] X Research source Keep repeating this step until the stain is completely gone."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda on top of the stain and let it sit for 8 hours. Baking soda is an excellent deodorizer that also helps soak up moisture. Just cover the stain with a thick layer of baking soda. Then, leave it to sit for at least 8 hours. [5] X Research source Note : Pet urine can be more difficult to clean. If your mattress still smells, spray the spot with an enzyme cleaner . This cleaner is specifically made to tackle urine stains and odors."

If the stained spot still isn’t dry, let your mattress air dry before putting on sheets and covers. Turn on an overhead fan, open your windows, or place fans on the mattress. [6] X Research source Wait to make the bed until it is completely dry. Putting on sheets and covers when the mattress is still damp can trap moisture and potentially lead to mold and bacteria growing."

If you have a removable and washable mattress cover, put it in the wash, too. [7] X Research source Wash your bedding using the hottest water that’s safe for your sheets and covers. This helps remove germs and odors. Look at the care labels on your bedding to find out what water temperature and wash cycle is recommended for them. If your bedding is super smelly, get rid of the urine odor by adding 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar into the wash or by using an enzyme-based detergent ."

It's okay to spray pure white vinegar onto the mattress. Add a few drops of laundry detergent or dish soap for an extra cleaning boost.

Then, leave it to soak into the urine stain for at least 5 minutes. [11] X Research source The baking soda might bubble and fizz when you spray on the vinegar. This is a natural reaction when baking soda and vinegar mix together. Make sure the entire stain is covered with the white vinegar. You may need to make more if there isn't enough to cover the whole stain. If you have some white vinegar solution leftover, leave it in the spray bottle to use another time."

[13] X Research source If your mattress is still stained or still smells like urine after 18 hours, apply more vinegar solution and baking soda. Or, try the hydrogen peroxide method for dried stains. Do not make the bed until the mattress is dry. If the mattress doesn’t have enough time to dry, mold, mildew, and bacteria can grow. It might take slightly longer or shorter for the mattress to dry depending on the temperature and humidity."
