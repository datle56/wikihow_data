      "content": "AirTags can update their location every one to two minutes. However, how often the location is updated depends on how many iPhones in the Find My network are nearby. AirTags are not real-time trackers. They don't broadcast their location, but instead send out Bluetooth signals that are detected by other iPhones that have Find My iPhone switched on in their settings. This information is relayed to you via the Find My app on your phone. [1] X Research source If your AirTag is in a busy area surrounded by other iPhones, its location can be updated every one to two minutes. However, if your AirTag is in a secluded area without much foot traffic, its location may never update due to lack of nearby iPhones."

      "content": "AirTags don't have their own range, but work within Bluetooth range. As long as your AirTag is in Bluetooth range of any iPhone or Apple device in the Find My network, it will passively communicate with you. Bluetooth range varies, but an iPhone's range is about 33 feet (10 meters). This distance may be impacted if there's something blocking the device, such as a wall.

      "content": "No, AirTags do not keep a history of their location. You can only see the location your AirTag is currently in, or the location where it was when it last pinged a nearby iPhone or Apple device. This is a security measure to ensure AirTags cannot be used as a tracking device."
