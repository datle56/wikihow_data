      "content": "Enter another world while you stay comfy. \"Raven Method\" shifting is named after the starfish position you make while you lie down to shift⁠—your arms will look like a raven's wings spread out, and your legs will look like a raven's tail feathers. Since you'll usually use the Raven Method right before you go to bed, you can \" shift reality \"⁠—travel to an alternate dimension, also known as your Desired Reality⁠—in your sleep.

      "content": "Set up an inspiring environment that’ll make your imagination soar. Go to an area that’s your perfect retreat, like your bedroom. Draw the curtains, dim the lights, and close the door to avoid any distractions. Add some special touches to make a sanctuary that supports shifting. For example, light a candle with a woodsy scent that reminds you of a library in Hogwarts. [2] X Research source While it’s not required, decorating your room in a special way or creating a relaxing atmosphere can help you focus on your Desired Reality. Play special sound effects to ignite your imagination. For example, listen to audio of ocean waves if you’d like to transport yourself to a pirate ship or enjoy the sounds of rustling leaves if you hope to walk through a forest. Pull out comic books, novels, or posters as extra inspiration. Play clips from your favorite show or read lines from a book you absolutely adore to get you in the right state of mind."

      "content": "Outline who and where you’ll be for the ideal trip to another reality. Describe how you’ll look as well as any special abilities you’ll have when you shift. Then, write about where you’d like to travel—maybe you’d like to spirit yourself away to the MCU. On the other hand, you might want to journey to your own unique dream world. [3] X Research source Take out a shifting journal or bring up a word doc and create a bio for yourself. Draw a self-portrait or generate one with a service like Artbreeder . Make a vision board or a Pinterest board to help you picture your ideal world. Create a list of the friends and relatives who will be your allies."

      "content": "Clear your mind, calm your heart, and concentrate on an alternate world. Sit down anywhere you can meditate —this might be on the edge of your bed, at your desk, or in front of an altar. Ground and center yourself so you’re ready to shift. Focus on deep breathing and raising your vibration in order to access a higher state of consciousness. [4] X Research source Picture a bright light or magical energy flowing through you to raise your vibrations. When you're in an elevated state of consciousness, you can access other planes of reality. Place a raven figurine on your altar in honor of the Raven Method. As you look at it, you can meditate on how you'll fly away from this world and travel to a new one."

      "content": "Hypnotize yourself with messages that mentally prepare you to shift. Turn on a playlist with subliminal messages or one long guided meditation that will lift your spirits and reassure you that you’re capable of shifting your reality. Choose subliminals with beats that put you in a sleepy state and comments that give you hope. [5] X Research source There are tons of subliminals for reality shifting on YouTube. For example, you can wind down and listen to one that helps you shift to your DR overnight. One subliminal might tell you, “You are a divine being that can transcend this plane of existence.” Try guided meditations that incorporate \"binaural beats,\" or two tones with different frequencies—these are known to trigger hypnotic states. You can find many meditations with binaural beats on YouTube. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Keep your legs and arms spread out so you'll enter a dreamlike state. Lie down on your back, then spread out your arms and legs. Also fan out your fingers and relax all your muscles—once you do this, you should feel almost like you’re floating. While you’re in this position, you’ll practice the “Raven Method,” a technique many travelers rave about. [7] X Research source When you lie on your back and stay relaxed, it'll be a lot easier to mentally drift away from this world and begin to manifest another. If you get into the starfish position when you're already sleepy, you may shift reality even more quickly."

      "content": "Declare that it's your destiny to access your alternate reality. After you say or think about the number “1,” recite an affirmation that gets you excited about your journey into a new world. For instance, you can say to yourself, “I am on my way to an adventure that will transform me.” As you count from 1 to 100, announce an affirmation after each number. Either repeat the same message or announce a different one, like, “I am nearly at my destination.” [8] X Research source If you're feeling extra ambitious, you can list out 100 affirmations in advance, record yourself reciting them, and play this audio clip while you count in bed. All of these magical sayings can amplify your ability to shift reality."

      "content": "Imagine all the finer details and you'll \"teleport\" to the perfect DR. While you count up to 100 and say your affirmations, free your imagination and let it roam wherever it likes to. Let random images of your Desired Reality flash in your mind’s eye. Maybe you’ll visualize emerald green ivy creeping up the side of a castle or the way your superhero lover’s cape ripples in the wind. You don't need to think too hard during this step. Just go with the flow and daydream about whatever comes to mind. If you get a lot of different visions all at once, then it's a good sign that you're really close to entering a new reality."

      "content": "Think about how all 5 senses will be triggered during your adventure. As you get closer to 100 or after you’ve finished counting, transition from just visualizing what your DR will look like to what it’ll feel like to wander around in it. For instance, imagine the heat between your palms as you conjure a fireball or the amazing scents of a victory feast after defeating vicious monsters. [9] X Research source Think about supernatural senses that are unique to your DR, too. For example, maybe you can hear the thoughts of all your spellcasting classmates or see auras . Reflect deeply on the relationships you're craving in your DR. Maybe you'll picture embracing an attractive royal you rescued from almost certain danger."

      "content": "Once you feel some telltale signs, you'll leave your CR—Current Reality. When you put all your focus into your affirmations and visualization exercises, you’ll access your DR. As you phase out of this world and into an alternate one, you may feel a series of “symptoms”—signs of shifting—like a quicker heartbeat or a bit of dizziness. [10] X Research source All shifters are unique and have reported all different kinds of symptoms. While one shifter might experience a falling sensation, you might see an angel number , like 1212. While the symptoms might feel unusual at first, you'll become more familiar with them as you continue to shift."

      "content": "Soon, you'll find yourself in a fantasy of your own creation. If your eyes are shut, you’ll either stay in a subliminal state or enter an alternate reality right as you fall asleep. Before you know it, you’ll notice you’re in a totally new environment that’s exactly what you hoped for. Whether you scripted a DR with medieval magic or cutting edge tech, you’ll know you’re in the right place. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "After your adventure, you should come back refreshed. Though reality shifting is a fun escape, it's important to focus on your Current Reality. Take full advantage of all the thrilling opportunities available to you in your Desired Reality, then live life to the fullest in your CR. Practice self-care and prioritize your responsibilities so you can enjoy yourself and reach your goals. [12] X Research source To have a good night's sleep , use the Raven Method right before bed. You'll be able to drift off, experience a wonderful dream, and wake up with beautiful memories of your DR. If you want to try the Raven Method while you're awake and just in a subliminal state, create a special window of time for reality shifting. Just make sure it doesn't conflict with your commitments in your CR!"
