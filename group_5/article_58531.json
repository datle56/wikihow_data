      "content": "Slice through the peel to learn how to make better surgical cuts. Take a fresh scalpel and cut through just the outer peel of the orange. Avoid slicing open the segments of the fruit beneath the peel to simulate cutting skin without damaging the muscles beneath it. [1] X Research source The peel of an orange is pretty similar to human skin and it’s a great way to get a feel for how hard you need to press the scalpel blade when making your incisions.

      "title": "Use the peel to practice blunt dissection techniques.",
      "content": "Use the peel to practice blunt dissection techniques. Dissection scissors are specially designed surgical tools used for cutting and dissecting tissue. Make 2 parallel incisions in the peel of an orange with a scalpel, then take a pair of dissection scissors and insert them into the opening. Gently open the scissors to spread the peel without damaging the fruit. Then, lift up the section of peel to expose the segments beneath it. [3] X Research source This is a technique known as “blunt dissection.” [4] X Research source You can also use this for practicing the initial incisions involved in deep tissue surgery. The exposed segment of the fruit is like the muscle and tissue you’ll need to penetrate."

      "content": "Practice suturing surgical incision back together. Attach surgical thread to a surgical needle. Align the peel as closely as you can and push the needle into the 1 side of the incision and out through the other side. Gently pull on the thread to tighten it and connect the 2 sides of the incision. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make at least 3 knots to practice hand-tying sutures.",
      "content": "Make at least 3 knots to practice hand-tying sutures. Make a simple square knot by taking both sides of the thread, looping them around each other, making another loop on top, and pulling 1 thread through the opening. Repeat the process at least 3 times and gently pull the thread to make a tight knot. [6] X Research source While you may likely use a knot-tying surgical device in the operating room, it’s still good practice to know how to tie a suture by hand!"

      "content": "Practice puncturing a joint to drain fluid. Take a surgical needle and press it into the peel of an orange until you pierce the fruit segment beneath. Use this technique to get used to the pressure you need to apply whenever you’re penetrating a patient’s joint to drain fluid or check for compartment syndrome, a condition where pressure builds up in a confined space.

      "content": "Simulate cutting delicate skin. Skin is thinner and more delicate in certain areas of the body, such as the face. A grape is a great fruit to use to simulate thin, fragile skin. Take a pair of small surgical scissors and make an incision in the skin of the grape without piercing the soft flesh beneath it. [8] X Research source > Grapes are also great because if you make a mistake, it’s no problem! Just grab another one and try again."

      "content": "Work on your fine suture skills. After making an incision in a grape with a pair of surgical scissors or scalpel, gently insert a surgical needle and thread into 1 side of the incision and out of the other. Carefully sew it back together to practice delicate cutting and stitching. [9] X Research source Grape skin tears and rips easily, so take your time and go slowly."

      "content": "Stitch the peel back together to practice sutures. Banana skin is also remarkably similar to human skin, and they’re a cheap and simple way to practice sutures. Make a cut in the banana with a scalpel or a knife, then use a surgical needle and thread and sew the skin back together. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove them with tweezers to practice removing splinters.",
      "content": "Remove them with tweezers to practice removing splinters. Removing splinters are technically a minor surgical operation, and doing it right can help reduce pain and minimize the risk of infection. Take some toothpicks, break them in half, and push them deep into a tomato. Take a pair of tweezers, grip the end of the toothpick, and gently remove the splinter. Pull the toothpick out in the same direction it was pushed in to minimize tissue damage. [11] X Research source Use a cotton pad or gauze to dab up any tomato juice, just like you would with blood from a deep splinter wound."

      "content": "Simulate delicate surgical operations. For a more complicated challenge, cut holes into the top of an opaque box and place a clementine inside. Use scissors and a grasper to remove the peel and the pith (the white membrane beneath). Then, use a surgical needle and thread to suture the peel closed. [12] X Research source You could also insert a camera into the box and perform the “operation” while watching the video to simulate internal surgery."
