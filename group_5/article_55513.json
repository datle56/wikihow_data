      "content": "Tell your dad a joke. Jokes are a great way to have fun in a short amount of time, and laughing puts everyone in a happier, more relaxed mood. Learn some funny dad-appropriate jokes and tell him one at the breakfast table, when he gets home from work, or whenever he looks like he needs a laugh. Then ask him to tell you one of his favorite jokes in return. If you don’t know any good jokes, there are lots of great joke books for kids at the library, and many websites full of funny jokes. Search for “jokes for kids” and get ready to start laughing. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"

Invite your dad to play Minecraft or another video game you like. Show him how the controls work and explain what the point of the game is. Then give him a little while to get into it before you start killing him or blowing up his stuff. [3] X Research source It can get pretty silly when non-gamer parents first try to play video games. Go easy on your dad, and don't be too upset if he doesn’t enjoy your game as much as you do, OR if he turns out to be a lot better at it than you! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Offer to help your dad around the house. Doing chores may not sound like a lot of fun, but you might be surprised how much fun it can be to help your dad cook dinner, or do the grocery shopping, or help him with yard work. If your dad is really busy, or you have a lot of siblings, this might be your best chance for getting some one-on-one time with your dad. He will be pleased that you offered to help, and it will give you a chance to spend some quality time together. Plus, if your dad gets finished doing chores early, he might have time for a more fun activity afterwards. Make chores more fun by turning them into a competition. For example, if you are raking leaves, challenge your dad to see who can finish his half of the yard first. Not only does this make the work more fun, you might finish early and have time to do go get ice cream afterwards."

It will also remind your dad of what it was like to be your age, which might help the two of you feel more connected. Better yet, ask him if he has any pictures from his childhood he can show you. You can both share a laugh about how goofy everyone’s hair was, or how much you and your dad look alike."

      "content": "Be patient with your dad. One of the best ways to have fun with your dad every day is to not get too upset about the dad things that he does. For example, if your dad tells you to pick up your socks, don’t get mad and argue about it, just pick up your socks. If your dad seems tired and grumpy in the evening, realize that he probably had a hard day at work and give him a break. Remember that being a parent is hard work, and dads are people, too."

Remember to check the weather, and have a backup plan in mind, in case it’s too stormy or cold to go out. Here are some ideas for outdoor activities you could do with your dad: Go on a fishing trip. Be sure to get any licenses you need first, and pay attention to your dad’s instructions about safety and being quiet. Go for a hike.. Find a trail near your home that is good for families. Be sure to bring snacks and water. Go to a baseball/football/soccer game. Fly a kite. You can have even more fun if you build the kite together first. [6] X Research source Go to the zoo! It’s probably been ages since your dad has been to the zoo. Be sure to ask him what his favorite animal is, and to tell you about any that he’s seen in real life, or his favorite trip to the zoo when he was a kid. Try playing disc golf. Disc golf is a great sport that dads and kids can play together. It doesn’t require much equipment, anyone can play, and there are courses all over the world. See if there is one near you!

You can make your own checkerboard (an extra activity, too!) or use one you already have. Solve some puzzles. Do a craft project. Some dads love to do arts and crafts. [8] X Research source Ask your dad if he’d be interested in doing some painting or making some homemade modeling dough. Listen to music. Ask your dad to play you his favorite album, or take turns sharing music you like with each other. Have a Lego-building competition. Get out all of your building blocks, dump them in the pile, and challenge your dad to see who can build the best spaceship or house. Build a fort. Get out blankets and pillows and drape them over chairs, and build a fort with your dad. Have a tickle fight or a wrestling match. A bit of friendly roughhousing is a great way to bond with your dad.

If you’re not sure what your dad is good at, or what he likes to do with his spare time, ask him! If your dad likes to build stuff, ask him to teach you to use tools and help you build something in the garage. A birdhouse is always a fun project for dads and kids to do together. [10] X Research source If you are old enough to learn to drive, ask your dad to give you lessons. If your dad is great at fixing cars, ask him to show you how to change the oil, or rebuild an engine.

At some point, you will discover that you and your dad are no longer “child” and “adult” but two adults. This can be an uncomfortable transition for both of you, but it means that you and your dad can start enjoying fun activities together as peers. Invite your dad out for a beer (after you reach the legal drinking age where you live). If you are having friends over to watch the game, be sure to invite your dad. Think of other activities that you like to do with your friends, and consider including your dad in some of them, or inviting him to do similar activities, just the two of you. Observe what your dad likes to do with his friends, and ask if he would include you sometime. Plan an adult vacation with your dad. He took you to Disneyland when you were a kid, now you can take him to Las Vegas, or Ireland, or somewhere else that he’s always wanted to go."
