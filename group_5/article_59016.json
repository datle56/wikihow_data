      "content": "Pet and massage your dog’s abdomen to reduce her stress. Perhaps the best thing you can do is just let your dog know you’re there to help her through the heat cycle . This is a natural process, and your dog’s body is equipped to handle it on its own, but help soothe her anxiety by sitting near her and offering a comforting pat when you can. [1] X Research source Petting and massaging have the added benefit of soothing muscle pain, which aids with the cramps. Gently but firmly make small circles with your fingertips or knuckles on her belly. Pay attention to her body language, though! If she growls or shows her teeth, leave her be. Or, if your dog is down for it, take her to a canine acupuncturist. While not medically proven, many dog owners swear by acupuncture to alleviate canine cramping."

      "content": "Offer your dog a heat pad to comfort her. Place a doggie heat pad near your dog’s bed to give her the option of a warm and soothing surface. A heat pad reduces her stiffness and spasms, and helps promote blood flow, minimizing cramps. [2] X Research source Use a pad made for dogs, which tends to maintain more comfortable temperatures than those made for humans. Make the heat pad optional, and never try to force it on your dog. If it helps, she’ll naturally gravitate toward it."

      "content": "Give your dog a small amount of ginger to reduce inflammation. Measure out 1/16 tsp (0.125 g) of fresh ginger per pound of your dog’s body weight. Then mince it and sprinkle it over her food. Ginger is a safe and natural anti-inflammatory that can reduce your pup’s muscle pain.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source It also contains antioxidants, stimulates blood flow, and reduces bloating, so it’s a great way to help your dog manage discomfort caused by heat cycles. Give small dogs no more than ¼ tsp (0.5 g) of ginger, and large dogs no more than ¾ tsp (1.5 g). Ginger is safe for dogs in any form. If you don’t have fresh ginger on hand, use the same amount of powdered or even juiced ginger. Don’t give your dog other popular, natural remedies like licorice root, comfrey, or turmeric. These often contain compounds that are toxic to your pet. [4] X Research source"

Consult your vet about a CBD treatment, then offer your dog a treat with a couple of drops of liquid canine CBD oil on it (or the dosage described on the packaging). Afterward, keep a close eye on your pup for a few hours to monitor her condition.

      "content": "Spay your dog to avoid future heat cycles. Most dogs are spayed or neutered at around 4 to 6 months old, but this varies from dog to dog and breed to breed. Many professionals recommend spaying female dogs to sidestep problematic behaviors caused by the estrous cycle (the canine fertility cycle), and also to cut down on the stray dog population. Ask your vet if spaying your dog is the best option for you. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure she has a comfy bed and plenty of food and water. The most important thing to do for a dog in heat is make sure she’s comfortable and that her needs are provided for. Set her bed near you so that you can monitor them—and so that she knows you’re nearby. Fill up her water bowl (heat cycles tend to cause dehydration) and continue to feed them on-schedule to keep her energy up. [8] X Research source In addition, keep her away from small children, other dogs, loud noises, or other disturbances. A dog in heat may be easily agitated or become dangerous."

      "content": "Keep her away from carpets or use dog diapers to contain any mess. Canine estrous is accompanied by bleeding from the vulva, as well as other discharge. Save your carpets by keeping your dog in a room with floors that are easier to clean, like hardwood or tile. Or, put a disposable diaper on your dog and replace it every few hours to keep your home tidy. [9] X Research source Get your dog used to the diapers by laying them on the floor next to treats. Then, offer her treats every time you put her into a diaper to make it a more positive experience."

She’s also probably a bit anxious, so bathe your stubborn or finicky pup using lukewarm water, dog shampoo, and plenty of soothing words.

      "title": "Take her on an extra walk to help her vent some anxiety.",
      "content": "Take her on an extra walk to help her vent some anxiety. Exercise helps your pup get some frustration out of her system and go about her day calmer and more rested. It also gives her an opportunity to urinate out of the house, rather than in a diaper. Let her out into a fenced, isolated yard every hour or so, or go on a light stroll to let her do her thing. When walking, always use a leash, and keep your dog away from other dogs, since she may act unpredictably while in estrous. [11] X Research source Walking also helps her vent some anxiety and distract her from discomfort. Of course, don’t force her to walk if she doesn’t seem up to it."

      "content": "Give her a chew toy to distract her. A sturdy chew toy or a treat puzzle does wonders in taking your dog’s mind off of her discomfort. It also averts negative behaviors that accompany her heat cycle like aggression, mounting, excessive licking, or general anxiety. [12] X Research source If your dog does act up, avoid scolding or punishment—redirect the behavior with commands like “sit,” or offer other stimulation like treats. Use a soft dog cone or other barrier to prevent your dog from excessively licking her rear, which may cause rashes."

      "content": "Whining Often, dogs entering or undergoing estrous appear bothered or frustrated, especially when experiencing cramps. This usually comes in the form of whining or crying more than usual, but might also include trembling, pacing, excessive panting, trying to escape, or other restless behavior. [13] X Research source Whining or crying isn’t always a sign of pain—it might also simply be your dog’s way of telling other dogs that she’s in heat."

      "content": "Lethargy Dogs that are in heat are prone to mood swings. She may seem playful and chipper one moment, and totally subdued the next. [14] X Research source This sudden lethargy may be a sign that your dog is experiencing cramps and needs a little while to calm down until the discomfort passes. In addition, your dog may lie with her back arched, or her belly may appear slightly swollen (caused by fluid retention during her cycle), both of which are signs of physical discomfort."

      "content": "Bleeding from the vulva During “proestrus,” or the early stage of heat, you’ll find some red discharge on her rear. It’s totally normal, will typically subside in about 18-21 days, and will reduce in volume and lighten in color as your dog enters estrous. [15] X Research source If the discharge continues beyond 2-3 weeks, or if you’re concerned about the volume of discharge, consult a vet to have your pup checked for other health issues."

      "content": "Increased urination A dog in heat is prone to peeing more than usual. This is due in part to drinking more to stave off dehydration, but also largely because the dog is marking to attract mates.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show.

      "content": "Mounting As female dogs enter heat, she starts to become preoccupied with trying to find a mate. She’ll become unusually friendly or excited around other dogs, particularly male dogs. While excited, she’ll often attempt to mount other dogs to signal that she’s on the market. [17] X Research source In addition, dogs in heat will raise their tails to one side, which is known as “flagging” and indicates fertility."
