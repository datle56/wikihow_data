      "content": "Gather at least 2 blocks of wool. Use shears to harvest wool from sheep, or kill the sheep outright to collect it. Killing sheep will only get you 1 block of wool, while shearing a sheep can get you up to 3 blocks."

      "content": "Dye the wool if you’d like your carpet to be a different color. Place the wool on the crafting table next to dye of your choice. You can also dye carpet after you’ve crafted it by pairing it with your desired dye color on a crafting table. For an endless supply of colored wool, use dye to recolor a sheep. Each time you shear it, you’ll get colored wool."

      "content": "Place 2 wool blocks next to each other on a crafting table. Go to your crafting table and place wool blocks in the bottom-left and bottom-center slots. Then, transfer the carpet to your inventory. You can also make carpet using the 2x2 crafting grid in your inventory."

      "content": "Use it to calm the bees (Java Edition only). In Java Edition, it’s possible to place a campfire beneath a beehive to help the bees chill out. Sticking a carpet square between the hive and fire helps protect the bees from damage while still allowing the calming effect of the smoke. [1] X Research source Placing a carpet above the campfire in Bedrock cancels out the effect of the smoke."

      "content": "Use double layers of carpet to deter mobs. Place a carpet on top of the one you placed on the ground. It’ll look like there’s a block of air between the carpet tiles, but this actually acts a barrier for mobs (including hostile ones)."

Then, mount the llama and open up its inventory—there will be a slot to place a carpet, which will decorate your llama in a cool new outfit. You’ll see hearts once you’ve successfully tamed a llama."
