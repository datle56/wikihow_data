      "title": "Dark gray or charcoal",
      "content": "Dark gray or charcoal Capricorn is a sign full of ambition, responsibility, discipline, and structure. It makes sense that dark gray is your primary power color—it represents the stability and practicality you often crave, and it’s neutral and muted enough not to draw too much attention (something hardworking Capricorns usually don’t want too much of outside of their accomplishments). [1] X Research source When you’re wearing or surrounded by gray, your natural abilities to focus on work and persevere through challenges are intensified. It’s also a professional color you can easily wear to work. Gray is a combination of black and white, which reflects your clearly outlined “right or wrong” approach to life. [2] X Research source A zodiac sign’s power colors enhance their best qualities, natural strengths, and help them stay true to themselves during times of adversity."

      "title": "Brown (especially dark brown)",
      "content": "Brown (especially dark brown) Brown is an assertive, trustworthy, and reliable color—perfect for helping your ambitious self get what you want at work and in your personal life. It’s a grounding color associated with earth (Capricorn’s element) that helps you feel at home and energized to tackle your goals. Darker shades of brown also help balance out the influences of bright colors when you feel overstimulated. [3] X Research source Brown might seem dull or boring to others, similar to how one might view a Capricorn if they didn’t know them well. However, brown radiates quiet confidence and subtle power—two qualities that define Capricorn. Like dark gray, browns are muted neutrals that can blend in anywhere and are perfect for formal or professional occasions."

      "content": "Dark or emerald green Dark green represents growth and determination, reflecting your persistence when working toward your goals . It’s another earthy shade that speaks to your need to make a comfortable home for yourself and your loved ones and create a stable foundation on which to build a successful life. Even dark or emerald greens are brighter than grays and browns, so these colors give you a bit more energy and verve when you need to boost your motivation. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Black and white",
      "content": "Black and white Any dark color that borders on black is beneficial for you. When you feel unfocused or overstimulated, black can ground you and help you get back to work. White serves a similar purpose—when you’re being too serious (which can happen easily for this workaholic sign), a dash of white can perk you up and help you enjoy the lighter side of life. [5] X Research source Warmer, neutral shades of white like ivory or cream are usually easier to accept and benefit from than pure, bright white. Black and white are also the root colors of your primary power color, dark gray (largely black but with some white mixed in)."

      "title": "Yellow-brown",
      "content": "Yellow-brown Yellow-brown is the color of your ruling planet, Saturn. Saturn is the planet of authority, discipline, and time, and it greatly influences your goal-oriented personality. Yellow is usually too bright and cheery by itself, but when blended with a grounding brown, it imparts a Saturn-like energy to you that’s comforting, motivating, and protective. Like other power and lucky colors for the Goat, yellow-brown is fairly muted and can work as both a cozy interior decor color or as a clothing color in the office."

      "content": "Incorporate dark greens, browns, and grays into your wardrobe. Whether it’s a casual, everyday outfit or you’re dressing up for work or a special event, wearing your Capricorn power colors can boost your confidence , focus, and motivation. Try working in classic staples like a brown leather jacket , gray sweaters and trousers, or green tweeds , shirts, and accessories. [6] X Research source Go for pieces that look polished and professional to express your ambition and determination. Add a small pop of color, like a bright tie or sparkling jewelry, to balance out the subdued, neutral tones that make up the bulk of your zodiacal color palette. Blues and purples, like periwinkle or turquoise, are light-colored options that aren’t as aggressive as reds or yellows."

      "title": "Decorate your home or office with your power colors.",
      "content": "Decorate your home or office with your power colors. If you need more energy or focus in a certain room to help you achieve your goals (like in a home gym, the kitchen, or your office), paint the walls gray, brown, or dark green (or choose one wall to be an accent wall in one of your power colors). Or, try incorporating furniture or other decor in these colors. [7] X Research source Dark green plants in brown pots are an easy, earthy addition to your home, and gray upholstered or brown wooden furniture are a timeless, clean, classic look. Leave yourself some room to add dashes of brighter colors too, or you may become too hardworking and serious. Colorful knick-knacks and artwork are easy ways to brighten up your space while keeping a refined, sophisticated atmosphere. Not sure which color palette to start with? Try choosing 3 shades from your power or lucky colors. For example, dark brown, emerald green, and a lighter yellow-brown work great together."

      "title": "Wear gemstone jewelry in your power or birthstone colors.",
      "content": "Wear gemstone jewelry in your power or birthstone colors. [8] X Research source Neutral gems may be more rare than brightly colored ones, but you have options. Smoky quartz and jasper often appear brown to black, and moonstone , hematite, and silver make great choices for gray. Dark green is easier—go for emeralds, peridot, or mysterious moldavite . Counterintuitively, Capricorn’s birthstone is ruby or red garnet . While deep reds don’t bode well for the Goat in large amounts, a small birthstone ring or necklace can be just the fiery kick you need to tackle your mighty ambitions."

      "title": "Steer clear of bright reds, yellows, and other loud or neon colors.",
      "content": "Steer clear of bright reds, yellows, and other loud or neon colors. Super vibrant colors contradict most aspects of your Capricorn personality. [9] X Research source They’re highly energetic, attention-grabbing, and impractical—qualities that you usually love to avoid. Reds might inspire you to become overly aggressive, especially when it comes to succeeding at work or competing against someone else. Yellow is peppy and optimistic, but might actually cause you to become more critical of others in large doses. Other unlucky colors to avoid include light or pastel shades of pink, yellow, red, orange, or purple. Pastels may cause you to get lost in your spiritual side and neglect the hard work and earthly practicality that are so important to you. This doesn’t mean you can never wear or be around these colors—just use them in moderation. If you feel yourself becoming untethered around them, use breathing exercises or meditate for a few minutes to ground yourself again."
