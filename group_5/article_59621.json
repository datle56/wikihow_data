Check the water line, which is a small plastic or copper tube that connects from the water faucet to the water valve on the back of the refrigerator. Check the line for leaks, kinks, or clogs. Water leaking inside the freezer could be a sign of a water line leak. Also check to make sure the faucet the water line is connected to is turned on and that there is no leak where the hose connects to the faucet. Some Samsung refrigerators have two water lines for different purposes. If these water lines get cross-connected, the ice maker will not work properly. Check to make sure the proper water line is connect to the correct connector. [1] X Research source"

The water pressure from the valve needs to be at least 20 psi for it to function properly. If the valve is leaky, the ice mold may overfill. If it is damaged, it may not open to allow water to flow. Replace the water valve if need be. [2] X Research source To replace a water valve, you will need to turn off the water and disconnect the water line. Then remove the back panel from your refrigerator and remove the valve mounting bracket. Remove the wire harness and the valve assembly. Attach a new assembly to the wire harness and mount the new valve assembly. Reattach the back panel, along with the water line, and turn the water back on. [3] X Research source"

Check the documentation that came with your refrigerator to learn where the water filter is located and how to change it. Some after-market filters may not work as well as the ones that came with your refrigerator. Make sure you get a water filter that is right for your refrigerator model."
