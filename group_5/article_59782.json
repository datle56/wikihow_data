If you have a personal Instagram account , you won't be able to see Instagram insights. If you're interested in analyzing statistics like profile visits and sharing stats, you can switch to a professional account, such as a business or creator account. While switching to a professional account won't show you who shared your existing and past posts, you will be able to see this information for future posts.
