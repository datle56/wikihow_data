      "content": "Since fridges are so large, you usually can’t put one out for regular collection. Not every waste collection service offers this service, so call and ask them if they’ll make an appointment to pick up bulky items. If they can, schedule a time for the pick-up and listen carefully to their instructions. On the day of your appointment, move your fridge to the curb around the scheduled time so someone can pick it up. [1] X Research source Making an appointment is usually free, but it may vary from area to area. Waste collection services might throw your fridge into a landfill, so it’s not the most environmentally-friendly option. Have a friend or two help you move the fridge to the curb. That way, you’re less likely to get injured. You’ll typically have to remove the doors, hinges, and locks from the fridge before someone can dispose of it. Contact your waste collection service ahead of time to find out what rules you need to follow. [2] X Expert Source Aaron Beth Appliance Technician Expert Interview. 14 July 2020."

      "content": "Some areas have scheduled days where they collect large appliances. Call your waste collection service or visit your city’s website to see if they offer a monthly or yearly bulk pick-up. If your area offers the service, move your refrigerator to the curb up to 3 days before the pick-up. On the scheduled day, waste collection will take your refrigerator so they can safely throw it away. [3] X Research source Your city might not have bulk collection days, but you can usually still schedule an appointment for waste collection to pick it up. Call your waste management company ahead of time to let them know that you’re throwing away a fridge. That way, they can properly dispose of the freon, which is the chemical refrigerant that keeps your fridge cold."

      "content": "You could earn a rebate if you’re getting rid of an old inefficient fridge. Reach out to your electric company and ask them if they participate in an appliance buy-back program. Schedule an appointment for when they can come over and pick up your fridge. You may have to move your fridge outside so it’s easier, but some services will pick it up inside. After a few weeks, expect a small rebate from your electric company. [4] X Research source Rather than getting a check, you may instead get credit off of your electric bill. Some electric companies will only buy back functioning refrigerators, so you may need to plug yours in the night before to prove that it’s working."

When the store delivers and installs your new fridge, they may take the old one away so you don’t have to worry about it. That way, the store can either refurbish or recycle your old fridge properly.

Be sure to take clear pictures and post as much information about the fridge as you can, including the size and brand. Choose a price that's similar to other fridges on the site that are in the same condition. If you have an interested buyer, schedule a time where they can pick it up or you can deliver it.

Let them know the type of fridge you have and how large it is to see if it’s something that they can use. You can schedule a time for the organization to come pick it up from your home, or they may give you instructions on how you can deliver it to them. [9] X Research source Avoid donating a fridge that’s in poor condition. Even if it still works, other people may not be able to get a lot of use from it."
