      "title": "Get the necessary items first.",
      "content": "Get the necessary items first. You'll need a splash potion of weakness and a golden apple. You can make the weakness potion with a fermented spider eye and bottle of water with a brewing stand, and the golden apples can either be found or crafted with one apple and eight gold ingots. As an alternative to this, you can instead make arrows of weakness to be more efficient. (if you are in java edition, you need lingering potions to do this, but in bedrock you only need a cauldron).

      "title": "Trap the villager.",
      "content": "Trap the villager. Make sure it can't escape. If your villagers are in compartments, then it is already trapped and this step is safe to skip. Keep the villager out of any direct sunlight; if it gets into the sunlight, it will burn. At this point you should also keep it away from iron golems, as they will attack and kill it."

      "title": "Right click on the villager with the golden apple.",
      "content": "Right click on the villager with the golden apple. Make sure to do this quickly, before the weakness effect wears off. If you are on mobile, hold down on the villager with your finger or aim the camera at them and press the \"cure\" button that appears. [2] X Research source"
