If you're looking to try out a desert popcorn, sprinkle 2-3 teaspoons of sugar over your popcorn instead of salt, or try out the following combinations: 1/2 cup chocolate chips, added while the popcorn is still hot. Stir to coat in chocolate. 1 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg, and 3 teaspoons brown sugar. Melt equal parts honey and peanut butter together on the stove and drizzle over the popcorn."

Make sure you leave room for the popcorn-- it will expand as it cooks."

      "content": "Do not try to cook \"unpopped\" kernels for too long. Popcorn kernels have a small amount of moisture in them that literally explodes when it gets hot enough, creating popcorn. However, if the popcorn is heated slowly then the moisture simply escapes through the kernel, making it impossible to pop. If you've cooked the kernels for 3-4 minutes and they still don't pop, stop and throw them away."
