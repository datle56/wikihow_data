[3] X Research source Professional spiritualist and seer Jennifer McVey, Cht says that black tourmaline (and by extension, all black stones) “soak everything up….They draw [negative energy] out of you or away from you, thereby protecting you.”"

      "title": "Blocks electromagnetic waves",
      "content": "Blocks electromagnetic waves Some black tourmaline users suggest the crystal can block low levels of electromagnetic radiation (also called electromagnetic fields, or EMFs) from technology like cell phones, computers, or TVs, which has a positive effect on your health. [6] X Research source However, there has been little scientific research on this and more studies are needed to confirm how much truth there is to this. That doesn’t mean black tourmaline doesn’t react to electromagnetism at all , though. Tourmaline becomes electrically charged when heated (the pyroelectric effect) and when it’s put under high pressure (the piezoelectric effect). [7] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source Tourmaline is sometimes called “the electric stone” because of these unique properties."

Remember that while crystal healing may be beneficial or soothing, it doesn’t replace qualified medical advice for treating illness or injury."

      "content": "Wear black tourmaline jewelry or carry it in your pocket or purse. The easiest way to enjoy the benefits of black tourmaline is to simply have it on you! Wear necklaces, earrings, or other black tourmaline jewelry to surround yourself in its protective energy throughout the day.

      "content": "Keep black tourmaline in your home or office for protection. If you sense negativity in a particular location, place black tourmaline in the room to set up a protective bubble. You might place a large crystal on your mantle, for example, or place smaller crystals in the corners of your bedroom for a nighttime shield against psychic trespassing. Black tourmaline users also recommend keeping the crystal near technology (like next to your work computer) to block EMFs, although the jury’s still out on whether this is effective. If you have a crystal grid at home, black tourmaline is a great addition; it can help clear the room (and even other crystals) of unwanted energy."

      "content": "Cleanse black tourmaline weekly with water, sunlight, or incense. Even though black tourmaline transmutes negative energy, regular cleansing still helps it protect you the best it can. It’s especially important to cleanse black tourmaline as soon as you first get it to activate and clear it of any preexisting energy. To cleanse: [12] X Research source Place the crystal under running water for about a minute. A natural running water source, like a river, is preferred (but a faucet will work too). Or, set the tourmaline on a windowsill or porch in direct sunlight for at least a few minutes, or up to 2 hours. Leaving it out longer may cause discoloration. Light cleansing incense or burn sage , then waft the tourmaline through the smoke to clear away negativity. Open a window if you perform this ritual indoors."

      "content": "Westerners “discovered” black tourmaline around 1400 AD in Germany. They called it schorl, after the village in Saxony it was found near (today, the village is called Zschorlau). Other colors were discovered in later centuries. In 1552, Spanish conquistadors discovered green tourmaline in Brazil and mistook it for emerald, while Dutch traders found multiple colors of tourmaline in Sri Lanka in the early 1700s. [16] X Research source It wasn’t until the 19th century that mineralogists discovered that all of these differently colored gems were their own type of mineral."

      "content": "The modern commercial history of tourmaline began in 1876. The mineralogist George Kunz sold green tourmaline from Maine to Tiffany and Co., which caused a huge spike in the stone’s popularity. By the 1890s, the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi liked pink tourmaline so much that China became the world’s biggest tourmaline market. When the Chinese government collapsed in 1912, so did the tourmaline industry. [17] X Research source Much later in the 1980s and 90s, incredibly vibrant hues of tourmaline were discovered in Brazil, reigniting the world’s appreciation for this beautiful crystal."

      "title": "Check the stone’s color, cut, and clarity.",
      "content": "Check the stone’s color, cut, and clarity. Black tourmaline will be primarily black or very dark brown, but it may appear slightly yellowish-brown or olive green at one end (the color is not often uniform all the way through). Rectangular cuts are most common and maximize the crystal’s strength (although it can be cut into nearly any shape). Tourmaline typically also has inclusions of aluminum, lithium, and magnesium. [18] X Research source Professional spiritualist and seer Jennifer McVey, Cht advises to “check with your intuition” when you hold a tourmaline to check if it’s real. “The energy would feel different…It wouldn’t oppose [you], and you’d feel more empathy.” If you’re shopping online, research the vendor and look at other customer reviews to determine if the shop (and their crystals) are legit."
