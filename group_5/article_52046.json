      "content": "Vacuum the bricks with a soft brush attachment. Use the brush attachment on your vacuum and go over all of your bricks. Vacuum as much loose dust, debris, and soot as you can so the bricks are easier to clean later."

      "title": "Scrub your fireplace with dishwashing detergent to remove light stains.",
      "content": "Scrub your fireplace with dishwashing detergent to remove light stains. Combine 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of dish detergent with 4 cups (950 mL) of water in a spray bottle and shake. Then, spray this solution onto your bricks and scrub them with your differently-sized scrub brushes. Rinse the bricks with warm water after they’re clean and dry them with a clean, dry cloth. [1] X Research source Dish detergent is the easiest and quickest cleaning method for fireplace bricks, so it should be the first method you should try if the bricks don’t look too bad. Dishwashing detergent is relatively harmless, so this is also the best method to use on older bricks."

      "title": "Go with borax to both clean and disinfect fireplace bricks.",
      "content": "Go with borax to both clean and disinfect fireplace bricks. Mix 2 tablespoons (34 grams) of borax with 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap in a spray bottle. Shake the mixture together, then spray it onto the bricks. Scrub the sprayed bricks with your brush in a circular motion, then use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away the grime after they’re clean. [2] X Research source You can also make this cleaning solution in a bucket and apply it to the bricks with a paintbrush or sponge if you don’t have a spray bottle."

      "title": "Clean newer, sturdier bricks with ammonia and detergent.",
      "content": "Clean newer, sturdier bricks with ammonia and detergent. Combine 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of ammonia, 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of dishwashing detergent, and 4 cups (950 mL) of hot water in a spray bottle, swirling the bottle to mix the ingredients together. Spray this solution onto your bricks and scrub them with your scrub brush to clean them. Once they’re clean, wipe them off with a damp cloth to remove the cleaning solution. [3] X Research source Ammonia can be harmful on brickwork, so don’t use this method on especially old or fragile bricks. Be sure to wear rubber gloves and safety goggles when working with ammonia."

      "title": "Use trisodium phosphate (TSP) on the toughest stains and grease.",
      "content": "Use trisodium phosphate (TSP) on the toughest stains and grease. Swirl together 1 ⁄ 8 cup (30 mL) of TSP with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water in a tall bucket. Then, dip your brush into the cleaning solution and use it to scrub your bricks clean. Finally, rinse off the bricks with warm water. [4] X Research source Only try using TSP if dish soap and water doesn’t work. TSP is a very strong cleaning solution, so make sure you don’t handle it without wearing rubber gloves and safety goggles. Avoid getting the solution on your skin, your clothes, or the carpet. TSP can be purchased at most home improvement stores and some grocery stores."

      "title": "Use baking soda and soap for a convenient cleaning method.",
      "content": "Use baking soda and soap for a convenient cleaning method. Combine about 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of dish soap with ½ cup (5 ounces) of baking soda to make a cleaning paste. Then, dip your scrub brush into the paste and use it to scrub the bricks using small, circular motions. Let the paste sit on the bricks for about 5 minutes, then rinse it off with warm water. [5] X Research source Work from the bottom up when scrubbing the bricks, to avoid leaving streaks."

      "title": "Spray your bricks with vinegar and water if they aren’t too old.",
      "content": "Spray your bricks with vinegar and water if they aren’t too old. Mix equal parts of vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle and spray the bricks with this solution. Spray the bricks again after a few minutes, then scrub them in a circular motion with a scrub brush. Rinse the bricks with warm water once you’re done. [6] X Research source Because the acidity of vinegar makes it a tad abrasive, you may not want to use this method on bricks that are more than 20 years old. To avoid streaking, work from the bottom of the fireplace up when scrubbing the bricks. You may want to apply a mixture of baking soda and water to the bricks after you’re done, to cancel out the acidity of the vinegar you just sprayed on them. However, this isn’t strictly necessary."

      "content": "Make a paste out of cream of tartar and use that to clean your bricks. To make your paste, combine 2 tablespoons (20 grams) of cream of tartar with a small amount of water. Then, use an old toothbrush to apply a layer of the thin paste to a sooty area of brick and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Finally, rinse the paste off with warm water. [7] X Research source Unless you have a lot of cream of tartar on hand, this method is best used for spot cleaning relatively small areas of soot."

      "title": "Try bathroom cleaner or oven cleaner if that’s all you have.",
      "content": "Try bathroom cleaner or oven cleaner if that’s all you have. People have sometimes had success cleaning fireplace bricks with bathroom cleaning spray or oven cleaner. Spray the cleaner onto your bricks and let it sit for 20-30 minutes. Then, scrub the bricks with your brush and use a sponge dipped in water to wipe off any residue left over. [8] X Research source Using bathroom cleaner or oven cleaner isn’t an effective method for cleaning bricks 100% of the time, so you should only consider using them if you have no other way to clean your fireplace bricks. You can acquire bathroom cleaning spray and oven cleaner at any grocery store that sells home cleaning supplies."
