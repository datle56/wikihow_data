      "title": "Hedonism is the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain.",
      "content": "Hedonism is the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word hedone , which means “pleasure.” The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristippus was the first person to propose the idea of hedonism, stating that pleasure is the ultimate goal of the human experience and that all people should pursue immediate pleasure. Later, the philosopher Epicurus went on to argue that hedonism is more of a pursuit of tranquility rather than the pursuit of immediate gratification from things like bodily pleasure and material wealth. [1] X Research source Many interpretations of hedonism have arisen since the time of the Ancient Greek philosophers, but the common theme among all of these theories is a person’s desire to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. The terms hedonic and hedonistic carry slightly different meanings. Hedonic is an adjective that describes the action of seeking out activities that’ll maximize a person’s happiness, such as eating a good meal or traveling. Hedonistic is an adjective that describes the action of prioritizing one’s pleasure above all else. It’s usually associated with activities like engaging in risky behaviors, ignoring responsibilities, and acting compulsively."

      "title": "Hedonists make happiness their ultimate goal.",
      "content": "Hedonists make happiness their ultimate goal. Someone living a hedonic lifestyle makes the pursuit of pleasure their end goal while doing everything they can to avoid pain, unhappiness, and discomfort. They prioritize people, objects, and activities that bring them happiness, which can look different for each person depending on how they define happiness. [2] X Research source For example, choosing to listen to music, watch a movie, or eat good food are all examples of hedonistic behavior since you’re choosing to do something that makes you happy. Or, despite not earning a lot of money, a hedonist might choose to pursue a career that they actually enjoy as opposed to one that pays a lot. Living a hedonic lifestyle often comes with the implication that the person living that way gets happiness from debauchery, which involves things like sex, alcohol, and drugs. However, this isn’t a strict definition by any means."

      "content": "People living a hedonic lifestyle enjoy consumerism and luxury. Some hedonists gain pleasure from buying things and experiences. Someone who lives a hedonic lifestyle might not have any reservations about spontaneously dropping a bit of cash on something expensive since they know it’ll bring them pleasure and make them happy, For example: [3] X Research source A hedonist might indulge in buying luxury goods, such as clothes from a high-end brand or a fancy sports car. They might also pursue a life of luxury by eating at fancy restaurants, going on vacations regularly, and choosing to live in a wealthy area. If someone was born into a family that valued luxury, they may be more likely to prioritize those things as well and pursue a hedonic lifestyle."

      "content": "Hedonists may be choosey about who they’re friends with. Some hedonists may approach friendships and other relationships with the mindset of finding the people who will benefit them the most and bring them the most happiness. Therefore, they may be more picky about who they’re friends with. [4] X Research source For example, they might only choose to be friends with people who they know will agree with them and share the same opinions as them. Or, they may only want to be friends with people who possess a similar amount of wealth so they can do fun activities together. In a hedonistic romantic relationship, the person may value things like sex and having fun with their partner over things like an emotional connection or shared interests."

      "content": "Hedonists tend to be optimistic and carefree. A hedonist’s outlook on life tends to be more on the positive side, and they tend to have a fair amount of confidence in themselves when faced with challenges. This is likely largely due to their pursuit of pleasure since they can experience a lot of happiness and satisfaction from pursuing the things they genuinely enjoy. For example, hedonists might: [5] X Research source Enjoy taking risks Seek out new experiences and keep an open mind about trying new things Try and find the silver lining in any situation Be spontaneous and just act without worrying too much about the consequences Focusing on pleasurable experiences can help reduce stress and improve your well-being. Finding small pleasantries in activities like eating healthy foods and exercising can also motivate you to live a healthier lifestyle.

      "title": "Someone living a hedonic lifestyle lives in the present moment.",
      "content": "Someone living a hedonic lifestyle lives in the present moment. Hedonism is all about maximizing the pleasure a person feels in the present, so hedonists tend to enjoy living in the moment rather than worrying about the past or future. They can be very spontaneous and might prioritize things that’ll make them happy now rather than waiting to get that gratitude in the future. [7] X Research source For example, rather than living by the rule of working hard now and saving up so that they can enjoy retirement, a hedonist might instead choose to spend their money now and enjoy experiences while they’re still young. In this sense, hedonism can be beneficial, as it allows you to savor the pleasures of the present and immerse yourself in the moment."

      "title": "Overindulgence",
      "content": "Overindulgence Just as the saying goes, too much of anything can be bad, even pleasure. For example, eating too much of your favorite unhealthy food can lead to health problems, and spending too much on luxury goods can lead to financial strain. If a hedonist finds pleasure in things like alcohol or drugs, they risk becoming addicted to these substances and harming their physical health. [8] X Research source This overindulgence in the present can lead to instability in the future. For example, if someone spends a lot of money now instead of saving it for future expenses, they may find themselves in a tough financial situation down the road."

      "title": "Perpetual dissatisfaction",
      "content": "Perpetual dissatisfaction There’s something known as the hedonic treadmill, which is an idea that states that a person’s happiness, after rising or falling due to a certain experience, will always revert back to the level it was before that experience. For example, if you were really happy to move to a new city, that happiness will eventually level out and fade over time. This can make it hard to stay satisfied, and a hedonist might exhaust themselves trying to maintain those high levels of happiness. [9] X Research source For example, the happiness a person feels after going on a fun vacation is sure to fade a couple of days or weeks after they get back. So to make up for it, they might book another trip for just a couple of months later. Constantly trying to make up for these dips in pleasure and happiness can strain a hedonist’s finances, physical health, and mental health."

      "content": "Strained relationships. Some hedonists don’t find it difficult to let go of friends or romantic partners once they stop benefiting from their relationship. If they’re not receiving pleasure from their relationship, it might not be something they want to keep in their life. However, the problem here is that it can become really hard to maintain long-lasting relationships. [10] X Research source A lack of such long-term relationships and friendships can leave a hedonist lacking the support they may need when things get difficult."

      "content": "Find your true calling in life. Your calling is the thing that makes you feel fulfilled. Working to find your true calling or purpose in life and pursue it can potentially leave you feeling much more satisfied and happy in the long term as opposed to things that only make you happy for a short amount of time. Finding this calling may take time, but you can help yourself by trying new things, talking to new people, and learning new things. [11] X Research source Do some self-reflection and take some time to ask yourself what brings you happiness. Ask yourself things like, “What do I value most in the world?” “When do I feel happiest?” and “What kind of person do I want to be?” You might also find meaning and purpose in helping others , whether it’s through volunteering in your community, helping a friend through a hard time, or just being kind to everyone around you."

Focus on the small things in your life that bring you happiness and really let yourself indulge in those moments. When you can find happiness even in the mundane things, every day becomes that much more enjoyable and precious. Some examples of small happiness include: [12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Rather than focusing on the things you want, spend some time each day reminding yourself of all the wonderful things you already have and how happy they make you. With hedonism, it can be easy to get swept up in the pursuit of maximizing your pleasure, but practicing gratitude can help ground you and let you see just how great your life already is.

Express your gratitude to others by giving them sincere compliments or writing them a heartfelt note telling them just how much you appreciate them."
