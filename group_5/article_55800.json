      "content": "Approach your crush and ask to hug them. Smile and say caring words or compliments to make sure they're expecting a hug. It can be awkward if you come up and hug someone out of the blue, especially if they may be unaware that you’re approaching. [1] X Research source Ask permission before you hug them. Some people are uncomfortable receiving hugs until they’re closer to a person. Respecting their wishes might even make them like you more. Hugs often happen at celebratory events like birthday parties, graduations, or when two people are reunited after a long absence. Giving someone a nice hug may be more acceptable during a celebration than at an everyday meeting. It’s also appropriate to hug someone when you greet them or say goodbye. Barrett recommends greeting them and saying goodbye by giving them a warm hug."

      "content": "Lean forward and put your arms around your crush. Press the person you’re hugging warmly but gently toward you. If they resist, give them a pat or a quick, casual shoulder squeeze and move back. It’s sometimes hard to know if it’s okay to hug someone , but paying attention to how they react may help you pick up on clues like a rigid posture or a pained expression. If you’re taller, bend down so the shorter person can put their arms around your neck. Wrap your arms under theirs. Keep them in that position for no more than a couple of seconds, and let go as soon as they do. Look them in the eyes when you separate and continue the conversation naturally. [2] X Research source If you’re shorter, try standing on your tiptoes and putting your arms under the taller person's arms. Let go as soon as they do. [3] X Research source Hugging a crush is different than hugging your girlfriend or boyfriend. Barrett advises letting your hug be warm and friendly without allowing it to linger too long."

      "content": "Smile and put your arms around your friend. Give your friend a genuine smile . Let them know you’re going to hug them by stretching out your arms as you approach them or saying something like, “Come here and give me a hug!” Keep your hug to the upper torso and shoulders, especially when hugging a friend of the opposite gender. Give their upper back or shoulders a quick, superficial rub with your hands. [4] X Research source Taller people: Bend down to meet a shorter friend. Close your eyes and think about how much you love your friend when hugging. Firmer pressure generally signals a closer connection, so hold them more loosely than you would a romantic companion. You could gently pat them, but try to avoid clapping them on the shoulders. Shorter people: Stand on your tiptoes and embrace them strongly. Pat them gently on the back. If you're having an emotional moment, hold the hug for a brief moment, but avoid patting their back."

These hugs are usually more about love than desire, but they can also be a little flirtatious. [5] X Research source The experience is just as romantic, no matter who initiates it."

      "content": "Pull them closer and fully embrace them tightly. A romantic hug often happens mutually, with the couple seeming to fall into each other. Jbara tells us that more intimate hugs come with a tighter squeeze and a stronger grip: “You’re doing it because you want to be closer to the person.” Hug the person you love for as long as you want to. Hugging at least 20 seconds can be especially good for you with effects like reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, and promoting heart health. [6] X Research source Taller people: Carefully slide your hands down from the other person’s shoulders, put them on their waist, and then slide them around their lower back. Put your head on their shoulder and press them towards you for as long as you like. Shorter people: Extend your arms toward your partner and wrap them around their neck and shoulders. Lean as close as possible and press your torso against theirs. If you're very close to each other, you could interlock your leg in theirs. If you want to, give them a small massage with your hands. Another option is to lift them in the air if you’re able and shift their weight towards you. When you separate, look into your lover's eyes, smile genuinely, and, if the situation is fitting, kiss them like you mean it."
