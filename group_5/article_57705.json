      "title": "Stand straight on bare feet with your back against a wall.",
      "content": "Stand straight on bare feet with your back against a wall. Shoes have different heel heights, so an inseam that works for one may be too long for another. Measuring with bare feet lets you get an inseam measurement for your actual height. Standing up straight against a wall helps you maintain good posture and avoid slouching, which throws your inseam measurement off. [4] X Research source If you plan on wearing your new pants with high heels, measure your inseam while wearing your heels to get the right length. However, if you wear the pants with different shoes, the inseam may be a little longer or shorter depending on the heel height."

      "content": "Stand up straight so your entire body is visible in a mirror. Taking your inseam measurement while standing up is tricky because you have to bend over to read the measuring tape.

Then, stand up straight and check the mirror to make sure you’re happy with where the tape hits your ankle. [9] X Research source Read the measurement in the mirror where the tape touches your ankle. If you can’t read the numbers, bend down, keeping your legs as straight as possible, and pinch the tape between your thumb and finger to mark the number. Then lift the tape to read the measurement. Be super careful while you’re doing this. If you accidentally move your fingers in either direction, your inseam measurement could be off."

Manufacturers use precise measurements for inseams, so you don’t need to add or subtract length to find the best-fitting pairs of pants. [11] X Research source Add .5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) to your inseam if you plan to wear heels or you’re buying pants that usually shrink. For instance, pants made of cotton, linen, or wool may shrink. Since jeans are often made from cotton, expect them to shrink slightly in the wash."
