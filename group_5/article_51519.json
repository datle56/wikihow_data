To get a full refund, you need to cancel within a few minutes of placing the order. Most restaurants accept delivery orders very quickly. If the restaurant cancels your order for any reason, you will get a full refund. If your order is taking longer to arrive than Uber Eats has estimated, you can get a refund. Check the order's estimated arrival time in the app, and if you have not gotten your order by that time you can initiate a refund."

If you are offered a partial refund, the Uber Eats app will outline what will be refunded to you and what won't."
