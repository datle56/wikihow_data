      "content": "Calculate the monthly attrition rate. To calculate the attrition rate for any given month, you need to know the total number of employees at the beginning of the month. Then, you need to know the number of new employees added that month. Finally, determine the number of employees who left. The number of employees who left is the number of attritions. [1] X Research source Plug the numbers into the following formula: Attrition Rate = Number of Attritions/Average Number of Employees *100. For example, suppose a telecommunications company had 150 employees as of April 1, 2015. During that month, 20 employees voluntarily left the company. Also, the company hired 25 new employees. First, calculate the average number of employees. The beginning number was 150. If 20 people left and 25 people were hired, then the ending number was 155. The average number of employees for that month can be calculated with the equation ( 150 + 155 ) / 2 = 152.5 {\\displaystyle (150+155)/2=152.5} . Next calculate the monthly attrition rate. In this month, 20 people left, and the average number of employees was 152.5. The monthly attrition rate can be calculated with the equation ( 20 / 152.5 ) ∗ 100 = .1311 ∗ 100 = 13.11 {\\displaystyle (20/152.5)*100=.1311*100=13.11} The attrition rate for April, 2015 was 13.11 percent."

      "content": "Calculate the quarterly attrition rate. Use the same formula. However, instead of one month of data, you will look at the data for one quarter, which is three months. Suppose the telecommunications company in the above example wants to calculate its attrition rate for the second quarter of the 2015. This would be April, May and June 2015. [2] X Research source The beginning number of employees on April 1, 2015 was 150. Over the course of the quarter, 30 people left and 40 new employees were hired. Therefore, the ending number of employees on June 30, 2015 was 150 − 30 + 40 = 160. {\\displaystyle 150-30+40=160.} The average number of employees for the quarter was ( 150 + 160 ) / 2 = 155 {\\displaystyle (150+160)/2=155} . The attrition for the second quarter of 2015 was ( 30 / 155 ) ∗ 100 = 19.35 {\\displaystyle (30/155)*100=19.35} , or 19.35 percent."

      "title": "Calculate the annual attrition rate.",
      "content": "Calculate the annual attrition rate. For this calculation, you need to know the total number of attritions for the year. Then, you need to calculate the weighted average of employees. Using the weighted average is more mathematically accurate since it smooths the effect of seasonal changes in the number of employees a company has throughout the year. [3] X Research source Suppose the telecommunications company in the above example had a total of 62 attrition for the year. They typically hire 20 percent more employees for the last quarter of the year for their busy season. So, they have an average of 155 employees for the first three quarters, and an average of 186 employees for the last quarter. Knowing that there are four quarters in a year, you could calculate the weighted average with the formula ( ( 155 ∗ .75 ) + ( 186 ∗ .25 ) ) = ( 116.25 + 46.5 ) = 162.75 {\\displaystyle ((155*.75)+(186*.25))=(116.25+46.5)=162.75} . You could also use the number of weeks worked. There are 52 weeks in a year. In the first three quarters, there are 39 weeks, and in the last quarter there are 13 weeks. Use the formula ( ( 155 ∗ 39 ) / 52 ) ) + ( ( 186 ∗ 13 ) / 52 ) ) = 116.25 + 46.5 = 162.75 {\\displaystyle ((155*39)/52))+((186*13)/52))=116.25+46.5=162.75} . Finally, you could use the number of hours worked. In a year, there are 2080 work hours. In the first three quarters, there are 1,560 hours, and in the last quarter there are 520 hours. Use the formula ( ( 155 ∗ 1 , 560 ) / 2080 ) ) + ( ( 186 ∗ 520 ) / 2080 ) ) = 116.25 + 46.5 = 162.75 {\\displaystyle ((155*1,560)/2080))+((186*520)/2080))=116.25+46.5=162.75} The weighted average of employees for this company is 162.75. Calculate the annual attrition rate with the formula ( 62 / 162.75 ) ∗ 100 = 38.09 {\\displaystyle (62/162.75)*100=38.09} , or 38.09 percent."

While it’s valuable to look at the historical attrition rate, businesses need to be able to project the attrition rate to gauge the company’s future performance. The projected attrition rate can be compared to attrition rates in other businesses in the same industry or sector. If an unfavorable attrition rate is projected, businesses can implement strategies now to reduce employee turnover."

On January 1st, the company had 2,050 employees. The number of attrition was 125, and the number of new hires was 122. Therefore, the ending number of employees was 2,047. Calculate the cumulative attrition rate to date. The average number of employees was 2,048.5 ( ( 2 , 050 + 2 , 047 ) / 2 = 2 , 048.5 {\\displaystyle (2,050+2,047)/2=2,048.5} ).

The number of attritions in April and May was 37, and the number of new hires was 35. Therefore, the ending number of employees as of May 31st was 2,047.

The branches with the highest attrition rates tended to be about four times less profitable than those with the lowest attrition rates.

      "content": "Improving employee retention rates can save businesses money. When an employee leaves, a company may spend as much as one-fifth of that employee’s salary to replace that employee. If a business experiences a high rate of attrition, this can represent a significant cost. Productivity losses when someone leaves, the cost of hiring and training a new employee and slower productivity until the new worker learns the job contribute to these costs. Companies can avoid these expenses by implementing policies that improve employee retention. Workplace flexibility, accrued sick time and paid family leave may help reduce loss of employees.
