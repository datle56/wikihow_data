      "content": "Use scissors to snip sprigs of rosemary off the plant. The best time to harvest your rosemary is in the morning, after the sun has dried away any nighttime dew. Your rosemary plant will bush out with vigorous growth from the places where you pinched or snipped it. Try to snip straight sprigs, all about the same length, for easier bundling."

      "content": "Tie the sprigs into bundles, wrapping twine around the bases of the sprigs. Leave a loop on the twine bundle to make hanging your rosemary sprigs easier. Alternatively, you can use rubber bands to secure your rosemary bundles. You can combine up to eight sprigs of rosemary per bundle."

      "title": "Hang the rosemary sprigs in a cool, dry and well-ventilated place to dry.",
      "content": "Hang the rosemary sprigs in a cool, dry and well-ventilated place to dry. Although you can dry your rosemary outdoors, the National Center for Home Food Preservation recommends drying rosemary indoors for the best color and flavor. Your porch, attic, or storage cupboard are all good drying options. You can try hanging the rosemary bundles from a clothes hanger, if this is more convenient. Some people also recommend covering your rosemary with brown paper bags as it dries. This prevents any dust from settling on the rosemary as it dries and also stops any sunlight from bleaching out the color. Just be sure to tear holes in the paper bags to keep the rosemary well ventilated."

      "title": "Turn the drying rosemary sprigs every day or two to ensure even drying.",
      "content": "Turn the drying rosemary sprigs every day or two to ensure even drying. You'll know the rosemary is dry when all traces of pliability are gone from both stems and leaves. This should take approximately two weeks. [1] X Research source You can also spread your rosemary sprigs or bundles on a flat or slanted window screen, elevated on cinder blocks or wooden blocks, for the best air circulation as they dry. You won't be able to hang-dry rosemary sprigs in a humid environment, so you may need to dry your rosemary in the oven or in a food dehydrator."

      "content": "Store the dried rosemary. Once the rosemary has completely dried, place it on a sheet of waxed paper and separate the tough, woody stems from the leaves. Store in an air-tight container in your kitchen cupboard. Use your dried rosemary in recipes such as lamb roasts and stews , garlic and herb bread, and rosemary-infused oil and butter."

      "content": "Spread the rosemary onto dehydrator trays. Run the dehydrator at a low heat setting (between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 and 40.5 degrees Celsius) until the rosemary stems break when bent. Herbs that are more delicate crumble when dry, but rosemary leaves are more likely to break, much like the stems. The exact amount of time it takes to dry rosemary using this method will vary, but on average, it takes about 6 to 8 hours at 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). [4] X Research source"
