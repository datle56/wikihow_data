      "content": "Pull the scrunchy around the ponytail. Depending on how thick your hair is, you will only want to wrap it once or twice. The ponytail needs to be loose so it doesn't indent the curls. Don't worry if it's loose. Note : If you have short curly hair you may want to do two pineapple pigtails instead of one. Otherwise, most of your curls won't make it into the pineapple!"

      "content": "Secure the pineapple (optional). Clip it : If your hair is very long, it is probably flopping around in your face by this point. Take some medium sized claw clips and clip the pony to the top of your head. This will keep the hair from flopping around while you sleep. Wear a sleeping cap : Another option is to just pull a satin sleep cap over your pineapple. This will keep the curls in place and protect your hair from frizz while sleeping. Always wear a satin- or silk-lined bonnetâ€”stay away from cotton and other drying fabrics that absorb moisture because dry, dehydrated hair is prone to frizz."

You may want to spritz with a refresher spray and walk out the door, or spray some water on and use a little light gel to finger curl your hair until it's as you like it. On tighter, type 3 and 4 curls, a light oil can be the best way to refresh your hair. This is also known as a dry refresher."
