    {
      "title": "Do quizzes.",
      "content": "Do quizzes. Quiz yourself on your subject matter as a way of working out what you haven't grasped properly yet. [1] X Research source There are websites that allow you to make a quiz, such as quizlet.com. One approach to using a quiz could be: Make the quiz either online or on paper. Title it. For example, History Midterm (or Final) Exam. Add the date of the test. This helps to visually remind yourself of the approaching test date. Add the vocabulary from the subject or chapters you're studying. Add key information. For example: Who was in office during the Civil war? President Lincoln. Then make another row: What was this president's term in office? 1861-1865. Question yourself deeper in the question so it's easier to understand/remember. If the test book has practice tests, add them to the set too. Add information from your notes and question yourself on these."

      "title": "Use videos to enhance your learning and understanding.",
      "content": "Use videos to enhance your learning and understanding. Watch videos on YouTube based on the same topic that you're learning. While watching videos, aim to picture the concepts and elements in your head. CrashCourse is one good source of videos useful for learning. Take notes of anything you don't understand or didn't remember, so that you can go back over these things after. Add notes from the video to your quiz set."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sit the quiz.",
      "content": "Sit the quiz. Start small, with about 20 questions from 60-100 of the terms and concepts you've added. Use any medium, such as multiple-choice, matching, etc. If using Quizlet, start with flashcards with audio, then scatter the questions and move to testing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the quiz at least four times doing 20/100 of the questions each time.",
      "content": "Repeat the quiz at least four times doing 20/100 of the questions each time. Then move onto doing all 100 questions in a single sitting. Redo until you get 100 percent on the test. The quiz learning should begin 3 to 4 weeks before the real exam or test. Cramming the night before will not work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Study well.",
      "content": "Study well. Make sure you don't study a day before or on the day of exams. [2] X Research source Start studying at least one month before the due date. Choose a location that is quiet, well lit and where you're not going to be interrupted or distracted. Prepare a timetable for that particular month and stick to it. Be regular and consistent with your studies. Take a break every 15 minutes, it refreshes the mind. Remove all distractions while you're studying. Switch your phone off or put it in another room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice.",
      "content": "Practice. Ask for or download copies of the previous year's question papers. Take these tests to see if you can solve them. [3] X Research source Ask your guardian/parent/professors to evaluate it. This will give you more confidence and is a great way to remove any kind of exam fear. You know your stuff now!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take time to fully comprehend the material when you first learn it.",
      "content": "Take time to fully comprehend the material when you first learn it. Rote learning will not get you to score a good percentage; it isn't helpful in most cases because it doesn't encourage you to think and analyze . The latter two skills are important for being able to apply your knowledge to new problems. Write short notes or a summary of what you've studied. Read out loud. This can help to sharpen your understanding, as you are listening as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask yourself open-ended questions to engage with the material.",
      "content": "Ask yourself open-ended questions to engage with the material. Ask yourself questions about the content of the chapter. Did you agree or disagree with it? What would you explain differently and why? What about the work you're studying is confusing or seems at odds with other information you know? [4] X Research source Ask your teachers, lecturers, professors about your doubts. Do some exploration to dig deeper. Such discussions can help cement the concepts deeply in your mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do something specific while you study that you can copy during the exam.",
      "content": "Do something specific while you study that you can copy during the exam. If you can replicate what you were doing when you were studying you will help your brain to remember what it was you were studying. For example, if you were chewing a particular flavor of gum while you were studying, you should chew that same flavor during the exam. One of the best things you can do is actually study in the room, in the desk, where you will take the exam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Study with a friend.",
      "content": "Study with a friend. Studying with friends makes the job seem easier and not so tedious. Just make sure that the friend you study with will actually help you, not just play around and waste your time. If you can, take a little time to explain certain things that you are studying to your friend, or have them quiz you on the things you need to learn. You'll be more likely to cement the facts in your head and recall them for the exam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use mnemonics to help you remember key concepts.",
      "content": "Use mnemonics to help you remember key concepts. Mnemonics are simply memorization techniques that can help you while you're studying. You can use acronyms to help you, chaining ideas together, or keywords (especially helpful for languages). [5] X Research source Acronyms: this is basically a combination of letters, each of which stands for an idea that you will need to remember. For example, the FOIL method in algebra stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, designating how you're supposed to do an algebraic problem. Chaining creates a story where each word or idea you have to remember cues the next idea that you have to remember. Keywords: for each foreign word you have to remember, pick an English word that sounds like it. Then you'd visualize an image that has both the English word and the foreign word in it. For example: \"cabina\" is the Spanish word for phone booth. Imagine a cab trying to fit inside a phone booth. You'll be able to recall the image, which will lead you to \"cabina.\""

      "title": "Stay positive!",
      "content": "Stay positive! If you visualize a successful outcome, you'll be more likely to actually have a successful outcome, than if you're neutral or negative in what you say about how well you're going to do on the exam. Tell yourself that you will do great. Be confident and don't lose hope. If you get a lower grade than expected on a test, try to understand why you did not get a good score. If you can understand those issues, you can address them. [6] X Expert Source Bryce Warwick, JD Test Prep Tutor, Warwick Strategies Expert Interview. 5 November 2019.
