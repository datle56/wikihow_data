      "content": "Using another knitting needle, screwdriver, or other long, thin tool, pull up the next loop in the carpet so that the snagged loop is pulled back down. This may take some force. Leave the original snagged loop just slightly larger than the surrounding loops of carpet, so that the newly pulled-out loop is slightly smaller than the original snag."

Eventually you can work the snag back into the fabric of the carpet. The amount of time and number of loops this will take depends on how big the original snag is."

      "content": "Either way, use a new, sharp utility knife and cut out the backing of the area that needs repairing. Cut close to the good rows of yarn without cutting into them. Take your donor carpet and match the pattern to the repair area. Cut a patch to fit the repair area, test fit, remove, put blob of hot glue in area of repair, place piece back into repair. Make sure repaired section is level with surrounding berber. If small snags are noted anywhere in berber, use sharp tool and gently press snag to where it is level with surrounding yarn."
