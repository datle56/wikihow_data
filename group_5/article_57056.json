      "content": "Find a small, lightweight object that is flat on one side. You can turn almost anything you want into a magnet. Look for something that is between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide/tall and not too heavy. Make sure that the bottom or back of the object is flat. Here are some ideas to get you started: Legos Small stones Seashells and starfish Large rhinestones Small, plastic animals Colorful buttons [1] X Research source Brooches [2] X Research source Scrapbooking embellishments (plastic flowers, cabochons, etc)"

      "title": "Find a magnet that fits your object.",
      "content": "Find a magnet that fits your object. You should not be able to see the magnet from behind your object. You can use a round button magnet. You can also cut a rectangle out of a thin, magnetic sheet. Keep in mind that the flat, sheet magnets tend to be weaker than the thicker, button magnets. It is best to save those weaker magnets for light objects. If your object is large, consider gluing two small button magnets to the back: one at the top, and one at the bottom."

      "title": "Consider cleaning the back of your object with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Consider cleaning the back of your object with rubbing alcohol. If your object is very dirty, the glue may not stick to it. Simply soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, and wipe the back of the object with it."

      "title": "Place a swirl of glue on top of the magnet.",
      "content": "Place a swirl of glue on top of the magnet. The entire top surface of the magnet should be coated with glue. You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue. Hot glue will be suitable for items made out of wood, foam, paper, and lightweight plastic. An industrial strength glue will be best for heavier objects, and anything made from plastic, metal, or glass. Even if the magnet has a sticky back, it might be a good idea to use some glue. The adhesives on these types of magnets usually are not very strong or long-lasting."

      "content": "Let the glue dry before using your magnet. This can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to several hours. For example, hot glue will set within minutes, but an industrial strength glue may require up to a day in order to cure properly. If you are using an industrial strength glue, double-check the label to see how much time you need for it to dry and cure."

You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Paint your clothespin using a small paintbrush and acrylic paint. You can paint it all one color, or many colors. Simple designs, such as stripes, will work best on the clothespin. Glue a thin, flat wooden shape, such as a cat or dog, to the top of the clothespin. The wooden shape should be about the same length as the clothespin. You can find the wooden shapes in the wood section of an arts and crafts store. Glue down some buttons down the center of your clothespin. Play around with different shapes, colors, and patterns, just make sure that the buttons are the same width as the clothespin."
