      "content": "A labret (LAY-bret) piercing goes in your bottom lip. Some people prefer to get this piercing in the very center of their lower lip. [1] X Research source Others prefer an off-center placement, and may get this piercing closer to the corner of the lip (or another location that isn’t perfectly centered). Labret piercings typically go just beneath the bottom lip, rather than inside the lip itself. [2] X Research source Alternative types of labret piercings include: Vertical lip piercing: A piercing that goes directly through the lip (also known as an “Ashley” piercing). [3] X Research source Horizontal labret piercing: A type of surface piercing that extends horizontally across the surface of your lower lip. [4] X Research source Snake bite piercings: A pair of labret piercings spaced evenly beneath your lip. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Visit a reputable piercer to get a labret piercing done. Look for a piercer who has extensive training, and who works at a clean studio with proper sterilization practices (like using an autoclave). A trustworthy, well-qualified piercer should also have accessible spore tests for their workspace to prove how clean and sterile it truly is. [6] X Research source Pro tip: Look for a piercer or piercing studio that’s endorsed by the Association of Professional Piercers (APP). Click or tap here to find APP-certified piercing professionals near you. According to professional piercer Roger Rodríguez, “You’re either going to a studio that is fully disposable or one that sterilizes the equipment in-house. At a disposable studio, the needle always gets thrown away no matter what. Alternatively, the tools are put in a tray after every procedure where they’re stored; from that tray, they’re put into a cleaning process.” Never try to pierce yourself at home—it’s super important to work with a pro who knows what they’re doing.

This process involves using a hollow needle to create the piercing, after which the jewelry is placed. [8] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Your piercer will likely use a clamp to hold your lip in place so they can make the piercing cleanly and easily. [9] X Research source The gauge size of the needle depends on different factors, including the type of jewelry you’re getting (though many professionals advise getting a post as your initial jewelry). Your piercer will know the best option for you—feel free to ask them to walk you through it! [10] X Research source A potential con of getting a labret piercing can be gum erosion (if the piercing is placed too low). However, an experienced piercer will understand these risks and place your piercing accordingly. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Your piercer switches out the jewelry after 3–4 weeks. During the initial piercing appointment, your piercer will insert a long piece of post-style jewelry into the piercing site—this is to factor in for the extra swelling that your piercing will experience at first. After 3 to 4 weeks, you’ll go back to your piercer and have the jewelry switched out for something smaller. [12] X Research source You might have seen TikToks of people with new labret piercings complaining about how long and unwieldy the initial piece of jewelry is. This is a normal (albeit frustrating) part of the process!"

      "content": "A labret piercing can heal in just 2-3 months. A big pro of oral piercings (e.g., labret piercing, tongue piercing, etc.) is that they heal more quickly and efficiently than piercings in other locations. In just a few months, your labret piercing should be completely fine. [13] X Research source In some cases, labret piercings can heal in a matter of weeks (like 24 days). [14] X Research source Ultimately, healing times will look a little different depending on the individual."

Additionally, take time twice a day to give your piercing a good rinse with saline. Clear away any crud around your piercing that you can find, and blot the surrounding skin dry with a piece of clean gauze. [16] X Research source While you’re in the shower, Rodríguez suggests “creating a lather of soap while you bathe. Put the soapy suds on your piercing, let the water rinse it, and that’s it.” Go over the jewelry regularly with a clean toothbrush to dislodge any plaque. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid playing with your new piercing. Rodríguez stresses that “you should not twist, turn, rotate, move back and forth, or bend the area around that piercing. Piercings are designed to break the skin and stay still—they’re not supposed to move back and forth.” Rodríguez explains how “the premise behind a piercing is that it’s a cut. When you get a cut, you get a scab. And when you get a scab, it’s eventually going to heal. So, if that jewelry is being twisted, turned, moved, or picked at, you’re picking off a scab. You pick at a scab, and it’s going to bleed, scab over again, and eventually scar.”"

Stick with milder, less spicy foods that are room temperature as your piercing heals, and steer clear of especially sour or salty foods in the meantime. It’s also not a great idea to smoke or vape frequently, chew tobacco, or chew gum during the healing process. You should also avoid: Drinking through straws Drinking alcohol (especially while your piercing is bleeding) Sharing utensils and plates with other people Participating in sexually intimate activities that require use of the mouth Tip: Steer clear of lip makeup while your piercing heals. Whatever makeup or skincare products you typically use, apply them far away from the piercing site."

While you should still expect a small amount of pain, the process definitely won’t be excruciating.

To save a little money, choose a more inexpensive jewelry option that your studio offers. This estimate doesn’t account for tipping your piercer , which can be a nice gesture to thank them for their service."

The front of the piercing (that yourself and everyone else will see) is a ball (or other decoration) that’s attached to this post. [24] X Research source Labret posts are pretty customizable and can feature a lot of different styles, like balls, gemstones, spikes, and more.
