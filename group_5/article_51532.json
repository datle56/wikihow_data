Emailing, texting, or having an employee notify them for you can come off as inconsiderate when you are inconveniencing them with a last-minute change. [2] X Research source"

They may have given up other plans to meet with you, and you may have caused them an inconvenience by canceling. [3] X Research source A brief, simple apology is enough, like “So sorry I can’t make it work this time.” Avoid using vague language or saying that you “might” not be able to make the appointment. It’s better to be straightforward and honest."

      "content": "Explain briefly why you can’t make it. If you have a good reason, like travel problems or sickness, simply let them know that’s why you had to cancel. If you have a less acceptable reason, like you just forgot about the appointment or accidentally double-booked yourself, give a general explanation such as “Something came up that I can’t get out of.” [4] X Research source There’s no need to go into great detail about why you are canceling, even if you’re being honest. Elaborating too much can make it seem like you’re making something up. Never say that “something more important came up” or anything to that effect. Don’t make up excuses. You’ll run the risk of the other person finding out you weren’t honest, which could worsen the situation."
