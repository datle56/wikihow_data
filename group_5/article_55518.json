      "content": "Determine your best option. External drives come in many shapes and sizes to fit any user’s needs. Make sure your computer has a spare port to plug into. Just want to plug and play? Look for a model without an external power supply. Frequently backing up your data? Some models come with automatic backup software. Pay attention to USB speeds! Newer versions of USB will transfer data faster, but your computer must have a corresponding port. Luckily both port and cables are backwards compatible!"

      "content": "Determine if a network drive is right for you. Network drives are great for storing and sharing files with other users on a network. They are also useful if you want to store the drive out of the way, since they can be accessed remotely from anywhere on the network."

      "title": "Connect the drive.",
      "content": "Connect the drive. Network drives can be connected to your network and can be accessed like any other disk as long as you remain on the network. Plug in the network drive to an outlet if it requires external power. Connect the drive to the network. This can be done via the router or modem - usually with an ethernet or USB cable."

      "content": "Purchase a new internal hard drive. If you don’t want to expand externally, but don’t have any extra space inside the computer, you can replace the CD, DVD, or Floppy (AKA Optical Drive). A standard 3.5” internal desktop hard drive is a good way to add lots of space for cheap. Both hard drives and optical drives can utilize either an IDE or SATA interface cable(two alternates to USB). Most hard drives will come bundled with the cables they need, but you may need to purchase them separately as well."

      "title": "Acquire necessary adapters.",
      "content": "Acquire necessary adapters. Most optical drives utilize a 5.25” expansion bay, which is too large for a 3.5” hard drive. You may need mounting brackets or a 5.25” to 3.5” bay adapter. Consult your manufacturer’s specifications to verify the size of your optical drive first. The expansion bay is the space that holds the drive. Both mounting brackets and bay adapters will allow you to fit your smaller hard drive into the larger space."

Different manufacturers use different software to access and modify the BIOS. Consult the manufacturer’s specifications to confirm exactly how to access the BIOS and the hardware section within. Power on the computer, and press the necessary key during the startup screen. Look for a tab named “Hardware”, “Setup” or something similar. Navigate using the keyboard. You should see your newly installed hard drive listed. If not, power off the computer and double check the cable connections. Look for an option labeled “Auto-detect” and make sure it is enabled.

If you plan to use any Windows system files you will need to format to NTFS, but for simply storing data a filesystem like xFAT or FAT32 will be fie. The following steps are for Windows 10, but should work for other versions of Windows as well. Press Windows Key + R to bring up the run menu. Type diskmgmt.msc and press OK. This launches the disk management tool. Right-click the new hard drive in the list and select ‘Format…’ Select your desired filesystem and press OK. Formatting a disk can take some time depending on the storage size of the disk. Once formatting is complete you can use your new hard drive to store data!"
