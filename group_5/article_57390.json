      "title": "Choose soft or distilled water.",
      "content": "Choose soft or distilled water. The most effective water to use for this is soft water. If your tap water is soft, then you can use it to make the soap-based insecticide. Otherwise, use distilled water, which has had the minerals removed. The minerals in hard water can prevent the soap from dissolving, and this will make the spray less effective.

    {
      "title": "Choose a liquid hand or dish soap.",
      "content": "Choose a liquid hand or dish soap. Soaps have long been used to control many insects in the garden. The ideal soap is a liquid soap, such as castile soap, like Dr. Bronner’s, liquid hand soap, or liquid dishwashing soap, such as Dawn. Avoid powders, bar soaps, and detergents. Insects that can be controlled with liquid soap include: [2] X Research source Aphids Japanese beetles Spider mites Mealybugs Boxelder bugs Whiteflies Psyllids Cockroaches Young scales"

      "content": "Combine the soap and water. Pour the water into a large bowl. Pour in the liquid soap and gently stir the mixture to distribute the soap in the water. Don’t stir too vigorously, or you'll cause the soap to create suds. You want to dissolve the soap in the water. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stir in additional ingredients if desired.",
      "content": "Stir in additional ingredients if desired. There are different ingredients you can add to your soap-based insecticide to make it more effective for different bugs and problems. Two of the most popular include neem oil and vinegar. Neem oil is a plant-derived insecticide that’s effective for controlling beetles, cabbage worms, beet armyworms, fungus gnats, and thrips. [4] X Research source The oil will also help the soap residue stick to leaves, insects, and eggs. Apple cider vinegar is effective at killing powdery mildew, which is a fungal disease that can affect many plants. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle. Insert a funnel into the mouth of a spray bottle. Pour the soap mixture into the spray bottle and remove the funnel. Screw on the spray lid. This will make the soap mixture easier to apply directly to the insects on your plants. [6] X Research source To store leftover insecticide, transfer the mixture to an airtight container and store it at room temperature for up to a year."

    {
      "title": "Spray plants in the morning or evening.",
      "content": "Spray plants in the morning or evening. Soap-based insecticides have to be sprayed directly onto the insects in order to work, and this usually means spraying the leaves. Spraying the leaves on a hot day or in the middle of the day can cause the leaves to burn. The best time of day to apply the spray is in the early morning or late evening. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Test the spray on a few leaves. To make sure that the soap spray won’t damage your plants, it’s important to test a small area before applying the solution liberally. Pick a few leaves that are infested with bugs and spray the top and bottom of the leaves to coat the insects. Leave the spray for 2 days and then check the leaves for damage. [9] X Research source If the leaves were damaged by the spray, dilute the solution and test it again. If the leaves are healthy, apply the spray to larger areas."

      "content": "Dilute the soap concentration if necessary. Most soap-based insecticides use a 2 percent soap solution. For plants that reacted badly or were damaged by the soap, try reducing the soap concentration to 1 percent. To make this concentration from scratch, combine 4 cups (940 ml) of water with 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of liquid soap.

Spray the affected plants daily for 4 to 7 days, or until the pests are dead. [13] X Research source If you find you still have bugs after a week, try the mixture with a different soap, or use a commercial insecticide instead."

Process the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, until the garlic is a smooth paste. [14] X Research source Garlic contains sulfur compounds that repel a variety of insects. By adding garlic to your soap-based insecticide, you'll be able to kill bugs and deter others from returning. If you don’t have a blender or food processor, combine the garlic and water in a mason jar and use an immersion blender to puree it.
