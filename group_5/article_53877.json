If you check the box next to \"Fit to music length\" but don't have enough media files to fill, Movavi Video Editor will play your files in the initial order, then repeat them randomly until the video ends. There is also a slider that allows you to control how long or short the video is, but if your project includes video files, the videos may be shortened to fit in the time you selected. Choose how to fill in the black bars around any photos. If the photos have different aspect ratios, they will have black backgrounds by default. You can stretch the images to fit the frame, add different backgrounds, or not fill them at all. Adjust the volume balance. If you have videos with sound and a music track in your project, both will play by default. You can adjust the volume of the video's audio with the top slider (the speaker icon) and the volume of the music track with the bottom slider (the music note icon).
