      "content": "Remove the motherboard connections carefully. The power supple will defiantly be connected to the motherboard, and will probably be connected to at least 2 fans as well. Remove these plugs carefully. Be especially careful when removing it from the motherboard because sometimes the SATA port will just snap off in the process, and you really can’t fix that. If the SATA port does snap make sure you bend the prongs in different directions so they can’t touch each other. This is not the worst thing in the world; you most likely have 3 more of these ports to use."
