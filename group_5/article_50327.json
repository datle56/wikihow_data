      "title": "Add the interested party's name when you initially sign up for the policy.",
      "content": "Add the interested party's name when you initially sign up for the policy. When you complete the initial enrollment process for your renters insurance, you should discuss the possibility of adding an interested party to your policy with the insurance agent. They will be able to discuss the pros and cons with you and answer any questions you may have. [1] X Research source The agent will also be able to officially add an interested party to your policy."

      "content": "Contact your renters insurance company to add an interested party after the fact. Depending on your insurance company, you should be able to add an interested party to your renters insurance policy at any time, not just when you initially sign up. Try calling customer service or visiting the insurance agency in person if you have questions about adding an interested party to your policy."

      "title": "Add an interested party through your online account for added convenience.",
      "content": "Add an interested party through your online account for added convenience. You should also be able to log in to your online account through the company's website and add an interested party directly to your policy yourself. There should be an option when you can enter the interested party's name and add them to your account without official approval from the policy company since adding an interested party doesn't affect your premiums or your coverage. If you have trouble finding the option, you may need to call the company to get assistance making this change."

      "title": "Ask about additional fees.",
      "content": "Ask about additional fees. Most renters insurance companies will add an interested party for no additional fee, but you want to make sure before you sign up. You wouldn't want to be surprised by extra charges on your bill each month. [2] X Research source If your company charges a fee to add an interested party, it might be worth shopping around with a few companies to compare prices. It's very likely that you'll be able to find a company that will add an interested party for free."

    {
      "title": "Recognize that the interested party will be notified if you cancel your policy.",
      "content": "Recognize that the interested party will be notified if you cancel your policy. In the case of cancellation or non-renewal of your renters insurance policy, any interested parties listed on your policy will be notified of these changes. This means that they will be aware of changes you make to your account, even if you don't tell them about the changes yourself. For example, if your landlord requires you to list them as an interested party on your policy, then your landlord will be notified if you cancel or don't renew your policy. This could affect your rental agreement with your landlord if you are required to maintain a renters insurance policy."

      "title": "Know that an interested party is different than an additional insured party.",
      "content": "Know that an interested party is different than an additional insured party. An interested party is just someone who receives a notification when you end your renters insurance policy. They are not included in any insurance payouts, should damage occur. [3] X Research source An additional insured party is someone who will also receive financial benefits if there is a necessary payout during the duration of the policy."

      "title": "Feel confident that an interested party can't make changes to your account.",
      "content": "Feel confident that an interested party can't make changes to your account. An interested party is not able to access your account, make any changes to your policy, or access your personal information in any way. If you add an interested party to your renters insurance policy, they will only be able to receive notifications in the event that you cancel the policy or fail to renew the policy. Nothing more. If an interested party calls the insurance company and requests any information, they will be denied."

    {
      "title": "Avoid adding your landlord as an additional insured.",
      "content": "Avoid adding your landlord as an additional insured. It's always better to add your landlord or property manager as an interested party, rather than as an additional insured party. This is because your landlord won't be able to make claims against your policy if they are also listed as an insured person on the policy. It could also significantly reduce the amount of coverage you are eligible for. If your landlord insists on being listed as an additional insured, try to explain the possible negative consequences to them and ask to list them as an interested party on your policy instead."
