Make sure that you are only wrapping the yarn in a single layer; don't let the yarn overlap. You can also use a knitting needle instead. A size 4, or smaller, would be ideal. [1] X Research source Loosen the first and last loops, then tuck the tails ends under them. Tug on the tail ends to tighten the loops. This will keep the yarn from unraveling. [2] X Research source"

You will get about 4 strands from each piece of yarn. Treat these four strands as a single strand for the rest of this method. [8] X Research source"
