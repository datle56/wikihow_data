      "content": "Only contact him when it’s absolutely necessary. In a perfect world, you’d be able to cut your ex out of your life completely—but even after a divorce, that might not be possible. Try to talk to him as infrequently as you can, and only chat with him about important stuff, like your kids (if you have them) and any loose ends you need to tie up.

Block him everywhere (including social media) and don’t reach out to let him know he’s out of your life for good.

      "content": "It may be easier to communicate via a phone or computer screen. When you need to contact your ex, write it out in an email or a text, then send it to him that way. You can avoid a lot of unnecessary fights and arguments this way, and it gives him a chance to compose himself before he responds. This is a great idea for communication if you are co-parenting with an individual who has narcissist traits."

      "title": "If you get upset or angry, you’ll only feed into what he’s doing.",
      "content": "If you get upset or angry, you’ll only feed into what he’s doing. Your ex might say some upsetting things to you, and your first reaction might be to scream, yell, or cry. Take a few deep breaths and try to keep your feelings in check, then respond in a calm, polite tone. [2] X Research source Your ex-husband may want you to get riled up, so he might say very inflammatory things just to upset you. If this happens, try not to take it personally, and remind yourself that he’s not your husband anymore."

      "title": "Love bombing is a tactic your ex might use to win you back.",
      "content": "Love bombing is a tactic your ex might use to win you back. If your ex-husband suddenly starts being super nice to you or giving you lots of compliments, be very wary of that. Some people with narcissistic qualities may be overly nice and loving to people to win them over before sliding back into toxic or manipulative tendencies. [3] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. Remember who your ex is, and don’t fall for this behavior. You can calmly but firmly ignore his advances by saying something like, “That’s very nice of you. Thank you.” Then, move on ."

      "title": "Pick one topic and stick to it so that there is a clear beginning and end.",
      "content": "Pick one topic and stick to it so that there is a clear beginning and end. If you absolutely have to talk to your ex, go with one subject in mind. Otherwise, you could spend ages talking in circles or debating the history of your relationship. Try not to get sidetracked, even if he attempts to guide you away from the main issue. If he tries to bring up other things, say something like, “That’s not what we’re here to talk about. I’d like to get back to the original issue.”"

      "title": "Keep your tone neutral but strong to keep the conversation focused.",
      "content": "Keep your tone neutral but strong to keep the conversation focused. If your ex has narcissistic tendencies, he may interpret a negative tone as a threat, which could make him lash out. When you talk to your ex, keep your tone of voice solid, and don’t back down if he makes threats against you. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For instance, instead of saying, “I hate when you talk to me like that,” try, “Please don’t speak to me in that tone of voice.” Instead of saying, “You’re acting like a child,” try, “Let’s both try to talk this through like mature adults.”"

      "content": "Boundaries will let your ex know what he can and can’t do to you. If you don’t state your boundaries , your ex might think it’s okay to walk all over you. Tell him that you’re not going to stand for any abuse or manipulation, and feel free to leave the situation if he gets out of line. [5] X Expert Source Adam Dorsay, PsyD Licensed Psychologist & TEDx Speaker Expert Interview. 11 April 2019 For instance, if he starts yelling, you could say, “I’m not going to listen to you if you raise your voice at me. Please lower your voice.” If he insults you, you might say, “I won’t have a conversation with you if you’re going to be nasty. I want to be civil with you, so please treat me with respect.”"

      "title": "Rehashing old issues will only bring up negative feelings.",
      "content": "Rehashing old issues will only bring up negative feelings. If your ex-husband tries to bring up your marriage or what happened in the past, shut him down gently but firmly. Stick to the issue at hand, and only talk about the present or the future. That way, you can avoid starting arguments or fighting about old topics again. Try something like, “I really don’t want to talk about what happened in the past. Could we just move on?” Or, “I’d rather not dive into that right now. Let’s talk about what we came here to talk about.”"

      "content": "Agreeing or disagreeing only adds fuel to the fire. Try to be non-committal, and don’t say you’re in favor (or not in favor) of anything your ex brings up. Agreeing can encourage his behavior, while disagreeing can provoke him into lashing out. [6] X Research source Use phrases like, “Maybe,” “We’ll see,” or, “I’m not sure,” to stay natural without riling him up."

      "content": "People with narcissistic traits often have a need to make others feel inferior. If your ex tries to do this by guilting or gaslighting you, don’t let him—refuse to say you’re sorry for whatever criticism he throws your way, and keep your own self-worth at the forefront of your mind. [7] X Research source Apologizing to him can lead to you softening your boundaries or doing things you don’t actually want to do. Your ex might try to make you feel powerless. The best thing you can do is remind yourself that you do have the power, and he’s not in control of you.

      "content": "You’re divorced now, and whatever he does is on him. It’s easy to take the blame for an ex-partner’s behavior, especially if they’re especially skilled at shaming other people (which people with narcissistic qualities have a tendency to do). [9] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. Keep reminding yourself that you two are done now, and you don’t have to live with him or be in a relationship with him ever again. When you’re having a tough interaction with him, keep thinking about how you get to leave and go home without him.
