You'll need to know your annual interest rate, loan amount (the principal), the duration of your loan (in years), and your monthly payment. These can be found on your loan agreement. Alternately, you can enter your own values for a loan agreement you think you could get. Be sure to research the prevailing interest rate on your loan type for your creditworthiness. You can get the monthly payment amount from there by reading and following the directions at how to calculate loan payments ."

A monthly payment of $1000 would be entered into B3 as -1000. Be sure this is entered as a negative number. This is how Excel recognizes payments.

However, some changes must be made to some of the variables when they are entered. Additionally, they must be entered in the right order. Enter your variables as follows: The prompt \"rate\" is asking for your periodic interest rate. That is, your monthly interest rate. When prompted, after typing \"=FV(\", click on cell B1, where your rate should be. Then, type \"/12\" to divide your annual rate by 12 and find your monthly interest rate. The program will now calculate this for you in your equation. Enter a comma to move on to the next variable. If your payments are quarterly, divide by 4 instead of by 12. For semi-annual payments, divide by 2. Assuming monthly payments, your equation should now look like this: =FV(B1/12, The prompt \"nper\" is asking for the total number of payments. Here, you'll want to multiply the duration of your loan by 12 to find the total number of monthly payments made on the loan. When prompted, click on B2 and then type *12 to multiply it within the equation. Enter a comma to move on to the next variable. Multiply by 4 for quarterly payments or 2 for semi-annual payments. Assuming monthly payments, your equation should now look like this: =FV(B1/12,B2*12, The prompt \"pmt\" is simply asking for your monthly payments as entered in B3. Simply click on B3 when prompted or type it into the equation. Enter a comma to move on to the next variable. Your equation should now look like this: =FV(B1/12,B2*12, B3, The fourth prompt, \"[pv],\" is just asking for the principal, or loan amount. Simply click on B4 when prompted. You can then close off the equation with a closing parenthesis. The last variable, \"[type],\" is unnecessary here.
