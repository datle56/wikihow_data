Blonde hair absorbs chlorine and other chemicals that will give it a green appearance after swimming. Also, blonde hair that is washed in a shower where the water is high in copper or iron will eventually start to look orangy-red or green. In regards to washing blond hair, it is advised to shampoo your hair every three days to keep it looking healthy and toned correctly.
