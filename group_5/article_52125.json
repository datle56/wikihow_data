For a touchscreen printer, either select Ink on the screen, or look for a square symbol with black, yellow, blue, and magenta lines. This is the Ink Indicator.

The printer will take a few minutes to clean old ink out of the print head, resulting in a cleaner print. [2] X Research source If you notice that your print jobs are coming out smudged or sloppy-looking, a cleaning cycle might take care of the problem."

Don't unplug the printer while the cycle is running. [3] X Research source Once the cleaning is done, the printer will automatically go back to the home screen, ready to print."

Make sure to print something in color if you cleaned the color ink or in black and white if you cleaned the black ink. [4] X Research source If the printing still looks off, you may have to run another cleaning cycle or unclog the print head nozzles."

      "content": "Run up to 4 cleaning cycles in a row. Sometimes, you will need to run more than 1 cleaning cycle to get the best results. However, try not to run more than 4 cycles in a row, as the process can actually start to draw ink out of the cartridges, making the cleaning less effective and wasting expensive ink. [5] X Research source If the printing still doesn't look right after several cleaning cycles, try printing 10 pages to see if this clears the nozzles."

The print head is difficult to clean when it is in its default position on the right side of the printer, but the printer needs to be off before you start cleaning it. Wait until the print head moves over and then unplug the printer. The printhead is the square piece of the printer that you see moving when you open the top of the printer."

You can buy plastic tubing at hardware stores and cut it to around 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) using scissors. Buy some in a width slightly larger than the size of the nozzle. Use a short length of plastic tubing to connect the end of the syringe to the nozzle. Then, press gently to slowly inject a small amount of distilled water into the nozzle. Using water that is not distilled can clog the print head even more with minerals. This will flush out any remaining ink. Let the water soak for 5 minutes. [9] X Research source You can also buy cleaning fluids specifically for printers online. If you can't inject any fluid, you may have to replace your printer."

Put the ink cartridges back in the printer. Then, plug in the printer and run a cleaning cycle. [10] X Research source The paper towel will be full of ink. Be careful when you are removing it from the printer, and wear rubber gloves if you want to protect your hands. Once the printer is done priming the heads and running the cleaning cycle, you can print out a test document. Print a document with both color and black and white elements to be sure all of the nozzles were cleaned. Print a small image that takes up about 1/4 of the page if you don't want to waste too much ink."
