      "content": "Cut the avocado and scoop out the pulp. To easily cut your avocado , take your knife and slice the avocado in half vertically. Twist the two sides apart, exposing the pit inside. With a spoon, remove the pit and scoop out all of the inside. For best results, make sure the avocado is ripe . [1] X Research source If you don’t have a ripe avocado on hand, ripen one overnight by placing it in a brown paper bag with a banana or apple. These fruits produce a lot of ethylene gas, which ripens fruit, and the paper bag will help seal the gasses inside so the avocado ripens quickly. [2] X Research source Because avocado juice is so thick, it is sometimes called an avocado smoothie."

      "title": "Add the avocado and your preferred sweetener to a blender.",
      "content": "Add the avocado and your preferred sweetener to a blender. Avocado is a buttery fruit, so you may want to add something to make it a little sweeter. If so, add about 1 tbsp (15 g) of sugar, honey, or a sugar substitute. Molasses also works well, or try ½ cup (118 mL) of sugar-free condensed milk. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Blend in other fruits or vegetables, if desired.",
      "content": "Blend in other fruits or vegetables, if desired. While a standard, creamy avocado juice doesn’t include other fruits or veggies, adding some is an excellent way to boost the flavor and make the juice even healthier. Then, give the blender a quick whirl to combine the flavors and get the juices flowing. [4] X Research source For example, add ingredients like bananas, spinach, kale, blueberries, or apples."

      "title": "Slowly add 1 cup (236 mL) of your preferred milk or water.",
      "content": "Slowly add 1 cup (236 mL) of your preferred milk or water. Any kind of milk will work—whole milk, 2%, oat milk, coconut milk, etc. Milk helps give the juice its creamy texture, though if you prefer not to add it, water also helps thin out the mixture. Start with about a cup, blending in a bit at a time. This way, you can see the avocado juice’s texture change and decide when the consistency is right. If you still want a thinner consistency after adding the cup, go ahead and add more until you get it right. [5] X Research source The thicker and richer your milk, the thicker and richer the final taste will be. For example, whole milk and avocado will be more smoothie-like, while almond milk and avocado will be thinner and have a completely different taste."

      "content": "Finish blending, garnish the juice, and serve it chilled. Once you’ve found the right consistency, blend the avocado juice until everything is combined thoroughly and has a uniform look throughout. Pour the juice into a glass and garnish with whatever your heart desires—maybe a slice of pineapple or a dollop of whipped cream? For best results, serve immediately so the juice doesn’t oxidize and turn brown. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Store avocado juice in an airtight container for up to 12 hours.",
      "content": "Store avocado juice in an airtight container for up to 12 hours. Avocados oxidize quickly, which causes the juice to discolor and go bad faster than other juices or smoothies. [12] X Research source In general, it’s best to consume avocado juice as soon as possible, but if you store leftovers in an airtight container—like a mason jar—it may be possible to preserve it for up to 12 hours. If the color changes and you’re not sure if the juice is still good, use your judgment and give it a quick sniff. If you think it’s bad, it’s probably best just to discard it. Adding a bit of lemon juice can help prevent the avocado juice from changing color due to oxidation."

If you’re concerned about your health, talk to your doctor to determine what course of action will work best for you."
