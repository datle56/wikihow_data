Whether your dog has a tendency to splash water out of their bowl everywhere or your toddler is prone to tipping over their cups, make sure to wipe or mop up any liquid right away. If left on your LVP, it can penetrate the top layer and cause unsightly bulges and bubbles. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove dirt, dust, and crumbs before mopping. Use a broom, dust mop, or a vacuum cleaner to get rid of all the grime. If you opt to vacuum, make sure you’re not using the beater bars, which could scratch your floors. Set your vacuum to the “hard floor” option or use one without those rotating bristles.

Use a soft mop that won’t scratch your floors, and just get it damp, not soaking wet. Mop the floor in long strokes, moving from the farthest corner of the room to the entryway.

Usually, you can use these cleaners to mop the floor as you normally would, but follow the instructions on the product label. [4] X Research source Pine-Sol is also a suitable option for LVP.

They can degrade the protective finish of your floors. [6] X Research source Steer clear of abrasive cleaning products like steel wool, as well, which could scratch your floors.

      "content": "Treating stains and scuffs will keep your floors looking great. Clean up food stains, including ketchup or juice, as well as dye, rust, urine, and feces using a 10:1 ratio of water to liquid bleach. For paint, nail polish, stain, varnish, oil, grease, gum, and other sticky substances, scrape the floor gently with a spoon to remove as much of the material as possible. Then, dip a soft cloth in odorless mineral spirits , rubbing alcohol, or lighter fluid, and scrub away the rest of the gunk. [9] X Research source Remove shoe scuffs by rubbing them with your finger—the friction will take the rubber right off. If needed, wipe the spot with a soft cloth dipped in isopropyl alcohol. If bleach or alcohol doesn’t do the trick, try lemon juice or cream of tarter. Or, try a paste of baking soda and water to gently scrub stains. No matter what method you choose, wipe the floor with a damp cloth, then a dry one when you’re done. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "A soft layer underneath furniture and appliances will protect LVP. Put felt pads on chair legs and the bottoms of appliances and furniture to prevent them from scuffing or scratching your floors. Always avoid pushing heavy items, from couches to fridges, across your floors. If the items are too heavy to lift and carry, attach furniture sliders to the legs before gently sliding them across the floor. [12] X Research source Choose felt pads that are at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter for chairs, and larger ones for bigger furniture or appliances."

Sweeping and mopping are all you need to do to keep your floors looking their best because LVP has a protective finish built in. [13] X Research source"
