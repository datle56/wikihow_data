      "content": "Girlypop is an internet slang term referring to a stereotypically feminine person. A compound of “girly” and “pop,” girlypop is often used to refer to people who are very bubbly, fun, and stereotypically girly and cutesy . [1] X Research source It can be used as a noun to greet someone in a fun way (i.e., “Hey, girlypop!”) or to describe someone who slaying in a feminine, endearing way (i.e., “She’s so girlypop”). [2] X Research source Girlypop is largely considered to be a positive, complimentary term. Like “girly,” however, it may be used sarcastically in certain situations to drag someone who’s perceived as overly feminine or flamboyant, although this meaning isn’t as common. [3] X Research source However, girlypop has varied meanings depending on who you’re talking to. Some people use girlypop to specifically describe men as gay, while others will use it to describe men in the context that they’re someone that their female friends are comfortable with and feel safe around. In other circles, specifically the lesbian community, a “girlypop masc” is a masculine-presenting lesbian who acts in a very feminine way (as popularized by TikToker @whatsuplavren ). However, there’s a lot of controversy within the LGBTQIA+ community about the usage and potential implications of this term. The new slang term “girlypop” may be confused for the similar phrase “girly pop,” which (often derogatorily) refers to female singers who are seen as especially feminine and girly."

      "content": "Girlypop was popularized on TikTok in 2023, but exact origins are unclear. No one knows exactly who invented the slang term “girlypop.” However, the word was seen online as early as 2008 on DeviantArt and Twitter (now X). The slang term was further popularized throughout the 2010s and 2020s by YouTuber Haley Pham (@haleypham) , who frequently refers to her viewers as “ girlypops .” “Girlypop” received its first Urban Dictionary definition in 2018, and the word continued to grow in popularity on TikTok throughout 2022, 2023, and 2024. In 2022, TikToker @ally_yost , who has 2 million followers as of August 2024, started using the term to address her viewers. In January 2023, Twitter (now X) user @thebiggestyee made a post using the term. This tweet amassed over 6,000 likes in two months and was later shared on Instagram by @thatgirlpage_ , where it earned over 11,900 likes in one month."

      "content": "“I love her energy, she is sooo girly pop.” When someone slays really hard or is just so stunning or wonderful that you can’t believe it, you can use girly pop to describe them. While you may use this description to describe someone who looks super girly and feminine, you can use it any time that you’re really feeling someone’s look or attitude. [4] X Research source For example, Twitter (now X) user @SaturnReturnzss posted this tweet , including a picture of Taylor Swift with the caption “she’s so girly pop.”"

      "title": "“Hey, girlypop!",
      "content": "“Hey, girlypop! It’s been too long!” Similar to “Hey, girlie” or the equally-trendy “Hey, Barbie,” you can greet someone as girly pop when you first see or message them. This use of the slang word is usually reserved for female friends, but it doesn’t have to be! A lot of people use this term as a greeting without even thinking about who they’re addressing or what the meaning of the word really is. [5] X Research source For example, Twitter (now X) user @aysiacchanell replied to women’s basketball player KK Arnold’s tweet with this comment : “while you’re here love you girly pop🫶🏽.” KK Arnold ( @KamoreaArnold ) then replied with “Hey Girly Pop! 🫶”"

      "title": "“I feel super comfy with him, he’s kind of girly pop.”",
      "content": "“I feel super comfy with him, he’s kind of girly pop.” Some women lovingly refer to their male friends, family members, and even boyfriends as “girly pop.” In this context, “girly pop” generally means that they feel very safe and comfortable with that man, or their man is doing something to fit into the girly pop vibe—like doing his skincare routine or knowing all the words to a Lana del Rey song. Keep in mind that this usage of girly pop when referring to men does not necessarily mean that someone is commenting on their sexual orientation. For example, TikTok user @ari-rose44 posted this video , which showcased her putting rhinestone gems all over the head of her “bald dad.” She captioned the video “wow he’s a girlypop now🧚🧚🧚🧚.”"

      "content": "“How did you not know he was girly pop??” Some people use girly pop to refer to stereotypically flamboyant gay males. In this context, “girly pop” is essentially a substitute for the word “gay.” [6] X Research source This slang term is used in a supportive and cutesy way, not as a derogatory or offensive term. However, you still may want to avoid using this term with people you’re not particularly close to or to speculate about someone’s sexuality (especially online)."

      "content": "Dress in more feminine and “girly” styles. Although there’s no one true girly pop aesthetic or way to be more “girly pop,” most people would see traditionally feminine styles as the most “girly pop.” Stereotypically, dressing in a more “girly-girl” way would mean wearing shades of pink, bouncy skirts , flowy dresses, or anything with feminine details like bows, ruffles, glitter, and hearts. Think Barbiecore or the soft girl aesthetic! [7] X Research source For tweens and teens, dressing more girly pop may be similar to acting basic or “ preppy .” Being girly pop may entail wearing colorful clothing from brands like Lily Pulitzer, adorning your wrists with friendship bracelets , or sipping on Stanley cups while walking around the mall with your friends or hanging at cheer practice. [8] X Research source However, keep in mind that being and feeling more feminine can mean different things to different people (and being your own version of girly is what girlypop is really about!). To figure out what style feels most feminine and girlypop to you, follow personal stylist Grace Thomas’ advice to “start with a Pinterest board and search words like ‘feminine style’ and see what comes up. You’ll see a range of different things, so try to identify which one stands out to you.” Eventually, continues Thomas, when you “select something that feels like you and femininity, you’ll start to feel comfortable, and you’ll start to feel cute.” If you try to dress in a super girly way that doesn’t align with your style, however, you’ll end up being less girlypop than how you started out."

Being girlypop is all about leaning apologetically into the most fun and silly parts of being a girl—whether you actually identify as a girl or not! Indulge in a weekly everything shower or set aside some self-care time for a nightly skincare routine . Listen to girly pop singers like Olivia Rodrigo, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX, Hilary Duff, Dua Lipa, or whoever you like best! [9] X Research source Invest in quality time with your friends for fun-filled hangouts at the mall, the beach, or slumber parties."

      "content": "Be kind, open-minded, and true to yourself! Most importantly, remember that there’s no one way to be girlypop. Being girlypop may have originally meant to be super feminine, but it’s evolved to describe anyone that feels like a safe and genuine person. So, focus on being the kindest and most positive version of yourself and bringing your take on girlypop to the table! Don’t feel pressure to be super bubbly or positive all of the time, however. You may be a more introverted person, which is completely fine. Plus, it’s equally girly pop to take time to feel and process your feelings , especially when you or your girly pals need support!"
