      "title": "Japonica rice",
      "content": "Japonica rice is the best type of rice for sushi. Measure out 1 cup (195 g) of this short-grain rice—specific varieties like koshihikari , hitomebore , and akitakomachi all have short, rounded shape and nice texture that are ideal for whipping up your own sushi rolls at home. Pour the dry rice into a large mixing bowl, so you have an easier time rinsing it out. [1] X Research source You can find this rice labeled as “sushi rice” at the grocery store. If you can’t find it where you usually shop, see if there’s an international food market or Asian food store in your area. Amylose and amylopectin are two different starches that naturally exist in rice. The more amylopectin a rice has, the softer it becomes after cooking; the more amylose it has, the firmer it becomes. When making sushi rice, your main priority is choosing a rice with a higher amylopectin ratio (like Japonica/sushi rice). Brown rice doesn’t have a lot of amylopectin, so it’s not the best option for making sushi rice. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the starch from the grains by rinsing the rice.",
      "content": "Remove the starch from the grains by rinsing the rice . Fill the bowl with cool water until all of the rice is submerged. Then, agitate the rice with your fingers without dumping out any of the grains. Strain the cloudy water out, pour clean water in, and repeat this process a few more times—your goal is for the rice water to look clear rather than murky. [3] X Research source You can also rinse your rice under running water using a strainer, but it’s trickier to tell when the water is clear versus cloudy. In transit, rice grains undergo a lot of friction, which causes starch to cover the outside of each grain. When left unrinsed, this abundance of starch can make the rice clumpier (and even gummy), which you don’t want."

      "title": "Use 1 cup (235 mL) of water for every 1 cup (195 g) of rice.",
      "content": "Use 1 cup (235 mL) of water for every 1 cup (195 g) of rice. Pour the rice into a large pot—a big, 2 to 3 US qt (1.9 to 2.8 L) pot will do the trick. Rattle the pot a little bit to make sure the rice coats the bottom of the pot in an even layer, and then pour 1 cup (135 mL) of water overtop. [4] X Research source Japanese short-grain rice doesn’t require too much water—a 1:1 ratio is always what you’re looking for."

      "title": "Cook the rice on your stove for 12 minutes and let it sit for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Cook the rice on your stove for 12 minutes and let it sit for 10 minutes. Switch on your stovetop to medium-high heat, waiting for your rice to boil. Once it reaches a boil, place the lid on the pot and set a timer for 12 minutes. Once the rice is completely cooked, transfer the pot to a cooler surface, leaving the lid on—this gives the rice a chance to steam. [5] X Research source Alternatively, use a rice cooker to prepare your sushi rice, if you have one."

      "content": "Make the sushi vinegar with a mixture of sugar, salt, and unseasoned rice vinegar . Fill a saucepan with 1 / 2 cup (120 mL) of unseasoned rice vinegar, 1 / 4 cup and 1 1 / 2 tbsp (73 g) of white sugar, and 2 tbsp (18 g) of kosher salt. [6] X Research source Then, switch your stove to a low heat setting and stir the ingredients together, letting the sugar and salt dissolve. Once everything is incorporated, place the sushi vinegar on a cool surface. [7] X Research source It helps to prep your sushi vinegar while the rice is still on the stove. Alternative: Make your sushi vinegar a day ahead of time by mixing your vinegar, salt, and sugar together before transferring it to an airtight container. Then, add a sheet of kombu (dried seaweed) to the vinegar mixture, seal the container, and let it soak for 1 day at room temperature. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "A roasting or baking dish works well for this. Scoop out the cooked rice with a wooden spoon, transferring it to a wide dish where the rice can be spread out and cool off. [9] X Research source Leave any crusty bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pot, since it’ll mess with the flavor and texture of your sushi rice. [10] X Research source A 9 by 13 in (23 by 33 cm) pan or a traditional sushi oke work well for spreading and cooling your rice."

Keep enfolding the sushi vinegar into the rice until it’s fully incorporated. [11] X Research source Is your rice still piping hot? Plug in your hair dryer, set it to the coolest setting, and fan it over the rice."

Sushi rice is best eaten fresh—if you don’t plan on chowing down immediately, drape a moist towel over the rice and leave it out in a cool corner of your kitchen for up to a day. Avoid sticking it in the fridge, as this dries and hardens it out. [12] X Research source Here are a few recipes you can make using your sushi rice: Sushi Onigiri Poke"
