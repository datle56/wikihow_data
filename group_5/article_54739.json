      "content": "Complete Master and Grandmaster-level Nightfall strikes. This is one of the most effective ways to get Ascendant Shards in Destiny 2 . Simply play through Nightfall strikes (specifically Master or Grandmaster strikes) over and over until you get the desired amount of shards. To get Platinum-tier rewards, ensure all champions are dead by the end of each challenge. [1] X Research source You’ll get twice as many shards if you do this on a week when Nightfall rewards are doubled. If you wait until you can get double Nightfall rewards, you’ll get multiple Ascendant Shards after a single Grandmaster Nightfall strike."

      "content": "Dismantle masterworked exotic armor. If you’re hanging onto any exotic masterwork gear that you don’t plan on using, consider dismantling it instead; you can get at least 1 shard per piece of gear that you dismantle. Since it usually takes 3 shards to create masterwork exotic gear, you won’t get every shard you originally spent back—but you can still get at least some of them. [2] X Research source If you’re in a tight spot and want to store extra Ascendant Shards quickly, you can masterwork some armor (and dismantle it later if you need shards again)."

      "title": "Buy them from vendors at the Tower.",
      "content": "Buy them from vendors at the Tower. Banshee-44 (the gunsmith), Ada-1 (the armor specialist), and Rahool (the cryptarch) all sell Ascendant Shards—although they can be pretty expensive. Still, if you need a reliable way to get Ascendant Shards regularly, you can buy them from any of the above vendors for the price of 50,000 Glimmer and 10 Enhancement Prisms. [3] X Research source You can also purchase other valuable items like upgrade modules from Tower vendors."

    {
      "title": "Reset your rank with certain vendors.",
      "content": "Reset your rank with certain vendors. The first time you reset your rank with Lord Shaxx (Crucible), Commander Zavala (Vanguard), Banshee-44 (Gunsmith), and the Drifter (Gambit), each will reward you with 1 Ascendant Shard. This also works with Saint-14 (Trials of Osiris vendor). Reach the first level with Tower vendors every season so you can reset and reap the rewards! [4] X Research source However, remember that this only works once per vendor; resetting again after that will get you an Exotic engram, not an Ascendant Shard."

      "content": "Unlock shards by getting the game’s Season Pass. If you want (and can afford) the paid version of the Season Pass, you’ll be able to unlock 3 Ascendant Shards from it. Even if you’re using the free Season Pass, you’ll still be able to unlock 1 Ascendant Shard—so, regardless, Destiny 2 ’s Season Pass can net you a small amount of shards. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Win the Trials of Osiris games. The Trials of Osiris is a higher-stakes variant of Crucible, with PvP (player-versus-player) matches that yield some of the game’s best weapons and armor. If you win 7 matches in a row (with no losses whatsoever), you’ll get an Ascendant Shard from the Lighthouse Chest. [6] X Research source None of the recommended steps in this guide will net a ton of shards right away—but by continually doing these things over time, you’ll gain all the shards you need!"

      "content": "Ascendant shards are a type of material in Destiny 2 . In the first Destiny game, Ascendant Shards were used during Year 1 but eventually phased out. In Destiny 2 , they returned as an exotic material typically used in high-quality crafting. Since season 22, players can have no more than 30 Ascendant Shards on their accounts—and can’t have any on their Postmaster. [7] X Research source That means players can’t stockpile as many Ascendant Shards as they could in earlier seasons of the game."

      "content": "Ascendant shards are used to masterwork Legendary and Exotic armor. Exotic armor pieces require 3 shards to successfully masterwork, while legendary armor pieces only need 1. Since Ascendant Shards are rare, it’s a good idea to think carefully about the best ways to spend them—and use them sparingly! You can also use them to: [8] X Research source Purchase exotic weapons from the Tower’s Lost Lights kiosk. Focus exotic gear with Rahool (in the Tower)."
