      "content": "Trace the right side of the dress with your fabric pen. Using a plastic ruler, mark a line on the top and bottom of your shirt material to show the center of the dress pattern. Use this opportunity to change the pattern slightly if you choose. If you want the dress to fit your baby as she grows larger, you can add an inch or 2 (2.5 to 5 cm) to the pattern on the right side. Fabric pen is washable. Use this opportunity to change the silhouette if you would like. Dresses can be changed to be a-line or include a wider skirt. Mark the points on the sides of the dress material where the arm holes will go, if it does not have a large indentation. This will help you to measure your bias tape later on."

To make your own bias tape cut inch-long (2.5 cm) strips of material from a t-shirt or other soft fabric. Make sure that the cloth stretches lengthwise along the strip before you cut it with fabric scissors. You may want to make the tape fabric slightly wider and longer for the neck hole. Iron the fabric in half lengthwise. You can cut off any excess length after you have pinned it in place."

Use a straight edge to mark a line down the back where you will create the closure. Cut down that line. Fold and iron the fabric toward the inside of your dress at approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) on both sides. Sew a square seam around the folded fabric on each side. Attach several small elastic loops on 1 side and sew on several buttons at the same level on the other. You may choose to do this after you have completed the rest of your sewing so that your dress will pass easily through the sewing machine."
