      "content": "These two have different attitudes towards sex. Aries is a fire sign, so they're a passionate lover, while Capricorn is more conservative. Even though these two have different approaches to intimacy, they both like to be in charge! This can lead to some frustration and miscommunication about their love life unless they really work on open communication. Having straightforward talks about sex really strengthens their bond. [2] X Research source Aries tends to be impulsive and bold in the bedroom—they're ready to try new things. However, Capricorn prefers knowing exactly what will happen when they make love.

      "title": "Aries and Capricorn are emotional opposites.",
      "content": "Aries and Capricorn are emotional opposites. Aries is bold and direct with their emotions—they're the sign of the stubborn ram, but Capricorn is cool and reserved. Aries is a fire sign co-ruled by Mars and Pluto, so it's no surprise that they're passionate, aggressive, and transformative. As an earth sign, Capricorn is more stable and level-headed—they'd rather back away than argue when Aries gets upset. If these two acknowledge their different emotional styles, they'll be far more understanding of each other. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn—the planet of wisdom. This might be one reason why they like to reflect before they respond. If you're an Aries, realize that Capricorn sometimes needs space to process things. If you're a Capricorn, learn to listen to Aries' emotional concerns. As a Capricorn, you're the sign of the wise sea goat, and you've got the skills to handle these complex emotions."
