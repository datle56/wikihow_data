      "title": "Most people use dried mugwort since the flavor is more mellow.",
      "content": "Most people use dried mugwort since the flavor is more mellow. Fresh mugwort has a stronger, bitter flavor, but it's completely fine to use fresh leaves in your tea. Gather 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried leaves (1.2 to 2.4 g) or pick a few fresh leaves to make 1 serving of mugwort tea. Mugwort is thought to treat insomnia, nerve disorders, and irregular menstrual cycles although more research is needed. Studies have found that mugwort does have antioxidant and antifungal properties. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Use an infuser basket instead of a tea ball and put it in a mug or teapot. Tea balls pack the leaves too tightly, so the water can't infuse properly. Tea baskets allow for a lot more circulation, so you'll get great-tasting tea every time. Feel free to use large paper filters —these also give the mugwort tea more room to circulate."

      "title": "Add about 1 c (240 ml) of water for each serving of tea.",
      "content": "Add about 1 c (240 ml) of water for each serving of tea. To make a pot of mugwort tea, just increase the amount of water and mugwort leaves. Keep in mind that you can adjust the amount of water depending on your taste—if you like a stronger taste, use half as much water. For the best taste, use freshly boiled water."

      "title": "The amount of time you steep the tea is completely up to you.",
      "content": "The amount of time you steep the tea is completely up to you. If you prefer a mild, delicate flavor, steep the tea for just 5 minutes. For a really strong, robust cup of mugwort tea, let it steep up to 15 minutes. [2] X Research source If you're not sure, taste a spoonful of the tea after 5 minutes. If it seems weak to you, continue to steep and taste the tea every few minutes."

    {
      "title": "Remove the infuser basket or tea filter.",
      "content": "Remove the infuser basket or tea filter. Give the tea a taste and add a little honey, maple syrup, or agave syrup if you'd like it to be a bit sweeter. Mugwort tea has a naturally grassy or bittersweet taste. Throw out the old mugwort leaves or toss them onto your compost pile. For a mugwort latte, stir in warm milk or plant-based milk like oat or soy. Add your favorite spices, too—try a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg for instance."

      "title": "If it's too hot for a cup of mugwort, drink it chilled!",
      "content": "If it's too hot for a cup of mugwort, drink it chilled! Just because it's toasty out doesn't mean you have to forgo the benefits of your mugwort tea. Fill a glass with ice and slowly pour the mugwort tea into it. Add sweeteners if you like and enjoy. Steep a few leaves of peppermint or spearmint with the mugwort if you'd like an extra-cooling flavor. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Mugwort, black tea, and chamomile make a tea that helps you relax. If you're drinking mugwort for its meditative qualities, add an equal amount of chamomile buds to the mugwort. Then, add twice as much black tea to a strainer and steep your mindful mugwort blend for 2 minutes. [4] X Research source Drink your tea in the evening or whenever you need a bit of peace."

      "title": "Mugwort, white tea, chamomile, and spices help you dream.",
      "content": "Mugwort, white tea, chamomile, and spices help you dream. If you're hoping for prophetic dreams, make a tea blend of equal parts white tea and mugwort. Add 1/2 part of chamomile buds along with a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. Then, steep your tea and sip it just before you go to sleep. [5] X Research source Some people place their dream journal right next to their bed, so they can write down prophetic or revealing dreams as soon as they wake."
