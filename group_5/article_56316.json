Zuniga recommends washing your vase with soap and hot water, then allowing it to dry out completely before putting your roses inside.

If you don’t clean your vase between uses, bacteria can accumulate inside it, which can damage your fresh roses and shorten their shelf life.

[5] X Research source If there are leaves underwater, they'll start to rot and cause bacteria to accumulate, which makes the flowers die more quickly. You can leave a few leaves attached toward the top of the stems, but remove anything that would be underwater in the vase."

      "content": "Pick off wilted guard petals with your fingers. When you get your roses, you may see some thicker-looking outer petals. These are called “guard petals,” and they protect the rosebud as it’s growing. If the guard petals on your roses look fresh and healthy, leave them on. However, if they’ve become bruised or wilted, go ahead and remove them. Roses expend a lot of energy to keep themselves alive, and getting rid of the wilting petals will conserve their energy for the fresher petals. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave the thorns on. You may be tempted to remove the prickly thorns from the stems of your roses, but resist this impulse. Cutting the thorns can actually damage the stems of your roses and keep them from hydrating properly, which ends up shortening their life. For the freshest, longest-lasting roses, leave the thorns where they are. If you’re worried about getting pricked by the thorns while handling your roses, try wearing a pair of protective gardening gloves ."

      "content": "Trim 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the stems at a 45-degree angle. Using a pair of clean floral shears or a sharp non-serrated knife, cut the rose stems at 45-degree angle about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. [7] X Research source The slanted cut exposes more surface area to the water, which helps your roses absorb more water and stay more hydrated. [8] X Research source Make sure the cutting tool you use is extremely clean. Hand pruners should be cleaned with hot, soapy water or a mild bleach solution after every use since bacteria can remain on the pruners and affect the next flowers you cut."

      "content": "Put your roses in lukewarm water as soon as possible. As soon as you cut the stems on your roses, place them in a vase filled with lukewarm (not cold!) tap water. It’s important to do this as quickly as possible so that your roses don’t dry out. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Add flower food to the water.",
      "content": "Add flower food to the water. Commercial flower foods provide nutrients the roses need to stay fresh for a longer period of time. They also include chemicals that kill bacteria and fungi, which can cause your roses to wilt more quickly. [10] X Research source Simply pour the flower food into the water, then mix it up until it dissolves. Florists will often include a little packet of flower food with your bouquet, but if you don’t see one, feel free to ask your florist for it. [11] X Research source If you don’t want to use commercial flower food, you can try to make your own DIY flower food by combining 2 tablespoons (30 mL) white vinegar or lemon juice with 1 tbsp (12.5 g) sugar. Pour the mixture into the water and mix until it dissolves. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Change the water and add more flower food daily. The longer your roses sit in the same water, the more bacteria will grow, which can cause them to wilt faster. To prolong the shelf life of your roses, change the water in your vase daily, if possible, or at least every 2-3 days. Pour out the old water and replace it with fresh, lukewarm tap water. Each time you change the water out, add more flower food, as well. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Display your roses in a cool place, away from direct sunlight. Once roses are cut, they’ll last longer in cooler temperatures, while hotter temperatures will cause them to wilt and deteriorate faster. [14] X Research source To help your roses last as long as possible, put the vase in a cool area of your home, away from any radiators or heaters. Don’t place the vase under strong, direct sunlight—this will be too hot and may cause wilting. Instead, find a place that gets gentler, indirect sunlight. [15] X Research source"

[16] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. Cutting about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the stem may give the roses the extra boost they need to rehydrate and perk back up. Zuniga recommends cutting the stems under running water “so that no air gets pulled up into the stem itself.” [17] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. If the roses revive and start to look healthier again, great! Unfortunately, if they continue to look limp and wilted, they may be too far gone, so it’s best to remove and discard them. If any dead leaves or petals fall into the water in your vase, make sure to remove these ASAP as well."

If you're cutting roses from your own rosebush to display indoors, cut them as early as possible in the morning before it gets too hot outside. [18] X Research source Retrieving the roses while it's still cool will help keep them from wilting. Immediately after cutting the roses, put the stems in a clean bucket of fresh water. The night before cutting your roses, water the rosebush. Well-hydrated roses will stay fresher longer than roses cut from a bush that hasn't been recently watered.

[20] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. She explains that local-grown roses are usually picked within a few days of being sold. Roses from further away, on the other hand, usually undergo a longer shipping process. They may not have been stored in water the entire time, which shortens their shelf-life. [21] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. It’s also important to buy from a reputable florist that you trust, preferably one with whom you have a relationship. That way, you'll be able to get your hands on roses that were very recently cut—you can simply ask them for the freshest blooms they have."

To make sure you’re getting fresh, healthy roses at places like the grocery store, Walker recommends checking the stems for damage, bug bites, scrapes, and signs of decay. [22] X Expert Source Jeanne Walker Florist Expert Interview. 15 April 2020. “You want the stem to be bright green,” says Walker. [23] X Expert Source Jeanne Walker Florist Expert Interview. 15 April 2020. And, where the stem is cut, it should be fresh green or white, “not brown or pink, because that’s a sign of molding and rotting.” [24] X Expert Source Jeanne Walker Florist Expert Interview. 15 April 2020. Walker also recommends checking the leaves: “If they’re turning brown or rotting, you don’t want to see that. If the leaves are green, that means they’ve been taking up water all the way through the stem to the leaves and the flower,” which is a good sign.

      "content": "Does sugar keep roses alive longer? Sugar is an important ingredient in flower food, which does, in fact, keep roses alive longer. However, you shouldn’t add sugar by itself to the water in your vase, as this can cause bacterial growth. The sugar needs to be combined with an antibacterial agent, such as white vinegar, to help keep a balanced pH level in the water. [28] X Research source If you’re already adding commercial flower food packets to your water, sugar is likely already an ingredient in the mix you’re using. You don’t need to add any additional sugar to the water."

If you choose to go this route, Walker recommends paying close attention to the sizes of the extra flowers you choose. [31] X Expert Source Jeanne Walker Florist Expert Interview. 15 April 2020. “If the roses are going to be the main show, choose slightly smaller flowers, so the roses are the biggest flower in the bouquet,” she explains.
