Then one person says a rhyme while tapping one foot for each word. Each time the rhyme ends that player removes a foot. The rhyme is repeated until there is one foot left. That person is the ghost. The rhyme could be: “Bubble Gum, bubble gum in a dish. How many pieces do you wish?” Then whoever’s foot is touched says a number. The leader counts out that number and then says “…and you are out.” After the first round, the next ghost is determined by the losing player. This is the player who was last to reach the safe zone. It can also be the first person if you wish."

The storyteller may start the story saying something like \"A group of brave adventurers set out to search the graveyard for a ghost who was guarding a great treasure. Which way did the adventurers head first?\" Then the other players can decide together where to go and look. Once everyone agrees, the storyteller will lead the players to that area. If the ghost is not there, the storyteller can add to the story with something like \"The adventurers came upon an old tombstone. The wind began to howl but upon searching it, they found nothing.\" This will add suspense. The storyteller can even add a clue that will help the players get closer to the ghost."

Alternatively, players can decide that the first two players who reach the home base get to be the ghost and storyteller. If no one is tagged, then everyone will agree on a way to choose the next ghost and storyteller."
