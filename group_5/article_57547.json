Brides that want a double-tier veil often pair the blusher with a longer veil. [1] X Research source Elbow length veil: This 25 inch veil rests at the bride’s elbow. Waist length veil: The bottom of this 30 inch veil sits at the bride’s waist. Mid-hip length veil: The mid-hip veil is 33 inches long.

Retrieve a measuring tape and ask a friend to assist you. Place and hold one end of the measuring tape where you intend to insert the clip or comb. Run the measuring tape down your back until it reaches the appropriate length (to shoulders, elbows, waist, mid-hips, hips, fingertips, top of your knees, ankles, 20 inches beyond your ankles, or 38 inches beyond your ankles).
