      "content": "Check with your school. Apple works with a variety of schools (mostly K-12) through programs like ConnectED. [1] X Research source Through ConnectED and similar programs, Apple donates iPads to students as learning aids. If your school participates in the program, you may qualify for an iPad. Even if you don't get to take it home forever, you can use it at school, and maybe even check it out overnight. Check with someone at your school to find out if a program like this is available. For a full list of ConnectED schools, see https://www.apple.com/connectED/schools ."

      "content": "Look for mobile service sign-up deals. Mobile phone providers often lure in new customers by offering free products. While it's more common to find iPhones and Android tablets as sign-up rewards, you'll occasionally come across a service that offers iPads for free (or at a deep discount). Keep in mind that getting a free phone or tablet from a mobile service provider will require you to sign a contract, which you'll be expected to honor (and pay for)."

      "content": "Trade in your other Apple products. If you have Apple products you're not using, you can trade them in for credit. Depending on what your trade-in device is worth, you may be able to trade in enough products to get yourself a free iPad. Trading in an iPhone Pro Max, for example, can get you up to $500 in Apple credit—enough for many models of iPads. [3] X Research source If you trade in a newer high-end MacBook Pro, you can get up to $1530—that's enough for two or three iPads, depending on which model you want.

      "content": "Buy a used iPad. Okay, this isn't free , but buying a used iPad instead of a brand new one can save you hundreds of dollars. [4] X Research source When buying a used iPad, stick to reliable sellers that fully test iPads before selling them like Gazelle , BackMarket , and Mac of All Trades . It can be risky to buy from sites like eBay, Trade Up, or Amazon, so be careful—if the price seems too good to be true, there may be something wrong with the iPad."
