      "content": "Cut the melon in half. Use a sharp knife to trim the stalks off at either end. Next, slice the melon in half lengthwise to split it. [2] X Research source If you like, you can also use your knife to scrape off the outer peel on the melons. The outer skin is edible, but scraping some of it off helps lessen its roughness."

      "title": "Remove the seeds.",
      "content": "Remove the seeds. When the melon is cut in half, use a spoon to scrape out the seeds and all of the white pith that forms the fibrous flesh inside. Discard the seeds and fibrous core. [3] X Research source The seed and core are actually edible, so you can cook them along with the rest of the melon. However, the texture can be a little tough and chewy, and the pith is usually unpalatably bitter."

Remove it from the pot and drain it before dropping it in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes. Drain the melon again, and use it in your favorite recipe."
