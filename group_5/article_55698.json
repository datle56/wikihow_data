If you have a VGA or a DVI port on your computer and an HDMI or HDMI Component on your TV, you can get a cable for that (there is a picture to the right side) If you have either a VGA or DVI port on your computer and you do not have an HDMI or HDMI Component port on your TV, you will need an adapter cable. There are three kinds of cables you can get an adapter for, the first is RCA Component (Red, yellow, White), the second is HDMI Component (Green, Blue, Red), the third is an HDMI cable adapter. Make sure you choose the right one for your port (VGA or DVI). Then choose the right cable to use according to the inputs on your TV ( RCA or HDMI Component). If you have an S Video port on both your computer and your TV, then you only need an S Video cable. If you have an S Video on your computer but not on your TV, you will have to get an adapter for your computer."
