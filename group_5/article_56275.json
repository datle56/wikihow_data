If you don't have Blathers, you'll need to open the Museum first. You'll need a vaulting pole to leap across rivers. If you want to climb to a higher level on the island, you'll need to use a ladder instead."

      "content": "Press A . This will vault your character across the river. If you're unable to vault, the river may be too wide. In this case, you can walk up or down to find an area that is less wide. You can also build a bridge if you have enough Bells. You can vault as many times as you'd like. Unlike other tools, the vaulting pole will not break. Keep in mind that vaulting next to any fish will scare them away."
