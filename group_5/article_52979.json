      "title": "His spending doesn’t match his income.",
      "content": "His spending doesn’t match his income. If you know what this guy does for work, then you probably know (roughly) how much he makes. Think about his spending habits: do they seem like they fit in with his salary range? If not, he may be over-spending throughout the month. [1] X Research source For instance, maybe he’s constantly taking you out to fancy dinners or he goes shopping all the time at expensive stores, even though you know his salary doesn’t necessarily support that."

      "title": "He’s evasive when you ask him about money.",
      "content": "He’s evasive when you ask him about money. Talking about money is important, even with a new partner. If you try to bring up money, does he answer clearly? Or does he brush the subject under the rug? If he doesn’t want to talk about money at all, it could be a sign that he’s having money problems. [2] X Research source Some people find it uncomfortable to talk about money with their partners at all. Try being open about your income and spending habits to encourage him to open up, too."

      "title": "He asks you to borrow money.",
      "content": "He asks you to borrow money. When a guy asks someone they’re dating for money, it’s a red flag. Usually, this means that he’s got pretty bad spending habits, and his budget isn’t as tight as it needs to be. [3] X Research source In general, it’s not a good idea to loan money to someone that you’re dating, especially if the relationship is new. This can introduce a weird dynamic between you two, especially if he struggles to pay you back. If you’re pursuing a relationship with a sugar daddy, asking for your money can be a sign that he’s lying and not actually financially stable. Reader Poll: We asked 539 wikiHow readers, and 64% of them agreed that constantly asking for financial support would make them doubt if a sugar daddy or momma is wealthy. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "He’s out of money by the end of the month.",
      "content": "He’s out of money by the end of the month. Someone who’s bad at budgeting will often struggle to make ends meet until pay-day. If your guy spends tons of money at the beginning of the month but then is super frugal near the end, it’s likely that he’s living paycheck to paycheck. [5] X Research source There’s nothing inherently wrong with living paycheck to paycheck, especially if he doesn’t have a ton of work experience yet. However, this likely means that he is not putting much money into savings."

      "content": "He struggles with addiction. Any type of substance abuse likely indicates that his spending habits aren’t stellar. If you notice that the guy you’re dating is spending a lot on substances throughout the month, it’s likely eating through his budget. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source People who struggle with addiction can be great partners, but it’s important that he’s open and honest with you about anything he’s going through. Keep in mind that gambling can be an addiction, too. Gambling leads to a ton of money problems, even if you’re rich."

      "content": "He’s in a lot of debt. You might notice that he’s letting bills pile up or that he’s getting a lot of calls from bill collectors. A small amount of debt is normal for most people, but a mountain of it can cause real problems.

      "title": "Talk about money with your partner.",
      "content": "Talk about money with your partner. Have an open, honest conversation about how much money he makes and what kind of debt he’s in. It might not be comfortable, but if you’re going to move forward with this man, you both need to be upfront with each other. [8] X Research source Start the conversation by saying something like, “I know this might be uncomfortable, but I think we should talk about finances. How much do you usually make a year?” Talk about his salary, spending habits, debt, and any financial goals he wants to accomplish."

      "content": "Split the majority of your expenses. When you’re the one who makes more in the relationship, you might find that you default to paying for a lot of stuff (food, outings, vacations, etc.). While it’s totally fine to treat your partner when you’d like to, it’s not fair for you to pay for everything. Talk about splitting expenses in the future so you don’t feel taken advantage of. [9] X Research source You might need to spell this out clearly for him, especially if you’ve already been paying for a lot of things in the relationship. Say something like, “I’d really like it if we could start splitting the check when we go out to eat. It would help me stay within my budget each month.”"

[10] X Research source If he doesn’t want to share that much about his finances with you, consider showing him your own budget as an example instead."

If he’s not financially stable and he shows no signs of changing his habits, take that into account when you’re deciding whether or not to pursue a serious relationship with him. Money problems are one of the biggest things that couples fight about, and it’s totally valid if you want to avoid that stress in the future. [13] X Research source However, if the guy you’re seeing knows he has money issues and has a plan to fix them, then it might not be as big of a deal in the relationship."
