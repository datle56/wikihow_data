If you want to play with more than 4 people, use a double-12 set instead of a double-9 set. [1] X Research source A double-12 set comes with 91 tiles, and a double-9 set comes with 55 tiles. If you need to buy a dominoes set, you can find one here ."

Have one player mix up the tiles so that they are thoroughly shuffled. Let each person draw one tile—the person with the highest double will go first. If a double wasn't drawn, the person with the heaviest tile (the tile with the most pips) will go first. Put the tiles back into the pile and give them another quick shuffle. [2] X Research source Because each game of dominoes involves playing several hands, trade off who shuffles at the beginning of each hand so everyone gets a turn."

Set your 7 dominoes up in front of you so that you can see them, but try to keep them hidden from your neighbors. [3] X Research source Play on a hard surface if you can, as that will make it easier to stand the dominoes on edge in front of you."

      "content": "Place the first tile in the center of the table to begin the round. The person who drew the tile to go first can put down whatever tile they want to get the game started. If this is you, it's generally a good idea to lay down a tile that you know you'd be able to build off of in your next turn. [4] X Research source For example, if you lay down a tile with 3 pips on one side and 1 pip on the other but don't have any other tiles with 3 or 1 pips on a side, you wouldn't be able to take a turn unless someone else lays down a tile you can match."

That tile has to have a side that matches the open end of a domino that is already on the table. Continue taking turns until someone uses up all of their tiles. [5] X Research source If you lay down a tile with a blank side, it can only be matched with another tile that also has a blank side. In some games, people choose to make the blanks “wild,” meaning you can ascribe any value to it. You can choose whichever option you like best!"

[9] X Research source In Mexican Train, the game starts with the highest double-sided tile in the middle of the table. Each hand after that starts with the double-sided tile that is one number less than the one preceding it: the first hand starts with the double-12, the second hand starts with the double-11, the third hand starts with the double-10, and so on."

Follow this breakdown to determine how many tiles each person should take: [11] X Research source Double-12: 2 to 3 players take 16 tiles each; 4 players take 15 tiles each; 5 players take 14 tiles each; 6 players take 12 tiles each; 7 players take 10 tiles each; 8 players take 9 tiles each.

If not, simply place the double-12 or double-9 tile into the center of the playing space. [13] X Research source This starter tile is often referred to as the “engine tile.” Everyone can play off of the engine tile, though each person's personal train coming off of that engine tile isn't fair game to other players unless there is a marker on it, which appears when a player isn't able to take their turn."

For example, if the engine tile is a double-12, then you must lay down a tile that has 12 pips on one side or the other. The 12-pip side needs to be laid down so it is connected to the double-12 engine tile. [14] X Research source The exception to the 1-tile per turn rule is if you lay down a double tile, meaning that the pips on each side of the tile are the same. If you lay down a double tile, take a second turn immediately and lay down an additional tile."

The goal is to have the lowest number at the end of all the rounds. [15] X Research source A set of double-12 dominoes will have 13 rounds, and a set of double-9 dominoes will have 10 rounds. The only other way a round can end is if the entire train yard has been depleted and no one can make a move. In that case, everyone tallies up the pips left in their hand and those figures get added to the score sheet."

The blank double is the last engine you will use before the end of the game (blank tiles can only be matched with tiles that also have a blank side). [16] X Research source The already-used double tiles just get mixed back in with the other tiles when you shuffle between rounds."
