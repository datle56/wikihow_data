      "content": "Purchase a commercial dye from a big box store. All-purpose clothing dyes are available at most big box stores. Rit, one of the most popular brands, is widely available in a large selection of colors. Dylon is another common brand. Craft stores carry a bigger selection of colors than big box stores generally do. [1] X Research source These dyes come in powder or liquid form, and either one will work just fine."

      "content": "Wash the fabric. You need to start with clean fabric, so wash it if you're using something you already have. It's a good idea to wash new fabric as well, just in case it has anything on it that could keep the dye from sticking. Don't dry the fabric, as you'll need it wet to dye it. [2] X Research source Don't use fabric softener."

      "title": "Soak the fabric if it's not saturated with water.",
      "content": "Soak the fabric if it's not saturated with water. The fabric needs to be completely wet so that the dye doesn't create a splotchy effect on the fabric. You can take the fabric out before the spin cycle or soak it in a tub before dyeing it to saturate it."

      "title": "Smooth out the fabric.",
      "content": "Smooth out the fabric. If you put crumpled fabric in dye, you'll end up with a marbling effect. Unless you want a marbled look, use your hand to smooth out your fabric as much as you can before dyeing it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the dye with water and salt.",
      "content": "Mix the dye with water and salt. Before mixing the dye into the bucket or sink, it helps to premix it in less water. Pour the packet or dye into 2 cups (0.47 l) of water in a small container. If you want the dye to be more intense, you can add 1 cup (0.24 l) of salt to some dyes. Read your dye's instructions to see if yours can take salt. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add hot water to the bucket.",
      "content": "Add hot water to the bucket. You'll need to pick a container big enough for the cotton to soak in. Pour in enough hot water to cover the fabric you'll be dyeing. You don't want it boiling, but it should be very hot. Close to boiling should be enough. [5] X Research source Also, read the back of your dye package to make sure you get the concentration correct. For instance, Rit dye is often one packet to 3 gallons (11 l) of water. However, you can use more or less water depending on how concentrated you want the color."

      "title": "Let the fabric soak.",
      "content": "Let the fabric soak. The fabric needs to soak in the dye mixture for at least 10 minutes. However, you can leave it in there longer, depending on how dark you want your fabric. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Start the washing machine on a long wash cycle. Set the washing machine to a washing cycle of 30 minutes or longer with hot water. If your machine doesn't have this option, you'll just need to reset it a few times before it moves on to the rinse cycle, which will require you to babysit the machine a bit. Unless you're dyeing something very large, use the lowest load size on your machine."

      "content": "Pour the dye into the dispenser. Add the dye as you would detergent. You want the water to be running a bit so the dye won't clump and create blotches on your fabric, particularly if you're using powdered dye. Fill the bottle with water and pour it in after the dye. Repeat if you're using two bottles. [12] X Research source You add water to the bottle to make sure you're getting all the dye and to ensure the chute is rinsed out completely."

      "content": "Make a natural dye for an economical dye. You can use items from nature to make a dye. For instance, you can use berries, flowers, bark, leaves, and nuts. Keep in mind that the color of the flower or berry may not be what you end up with as an end result. [14] X Research source For instance, you can get light pink from avocado skin and seeds. Cherries or strawberries will also dye something pink. Blackberries or blueberries will give a bluish purple. Crab apple bark will make a reddish brown, while pokeweed berries will make a red-purple. Artichokes, grass, and foxglove flowers will all give you a shade of green. The possibilities are endless, so try looking up a recipe online to find the color you want and to help you identify appropriate plants. [15] X Research source Cut the plant material into small pieces. Use 1 part plant material to 2 parts water. Boil it together for an hour, and then strain out the plant pieces. To set the dyes, dip the fabric in a mordant before the dye. For berry dyes, you can use 8 cups (1,900 ml) of water and 0.5 cups (120 ml) of salt. For plant dyes, try 1 part vinegar to 4 parts cold water. Simmer the fabric in the mordant for an hour. Rinse it out, and place it in the dye bath and simmer for an hour."

      "title": "Try using acorns to dye fabric a dark purple-black.",
      "content": "Try using acorns to dye fabric a dark purple-black. Start by making an iron solution. Place rusty items (such as nails, bolts, and screws) in 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar. Let it sit in a jar in the sun for 2 weeks until the vinegar is orange, and then strain out the metal. Place 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of acorns in a pot of water large enough for the acorns to move freely. Let the acorns simmer for 2 hours. Strain out the acorns. Keep the acorn mixture warm. Dip your fabric in, leaving it for 30 to 45 minutes. Squeeze out the dye, and dip it into the iron mixture (in a bowl) for 10 minutes. Go back and forth, leaving it in each mixture for 5 minutes until you reach a color you like. Squeeze it out between each dip. At the end, squeeze the fabric again. Let the fabric dry for an hour, and then wash it out in cool water with soap."

      "title": "Use flavored drink packets for a more temporary dye.",
      "content": "Use flavored drink packets for a more temporary dye. To make the dye, mix 4 drink packets into 0.5 cups (120 ml) of white vinegar and 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water. Boil the mixture with presoaked fabric for about 25 minutes, until the water runs clear. Let the mixture come to room temperature, then place the fabric in a bowl of clean room temperature water. Squeeze to release as much dye as you can. You may need to change out the water. When you add new water and it stays clear, squeeze out the fabric, and let it dry. Unsweetened flavored drink packets, such as Kool-Aid or Flavor Aid, will color cotton. However, the color will fade over time."

      "title": "Dye with tea or coffee.",
      "content": "Dye with tea or coffee. Boil enough water to cover the fabric. Add in enough cheap tea bags or instant coffee to change the color of the water. You can try 40 tea bags or 0.5 cups (120 ml) of instant coffee for a medium pot of water. Tea will often create a stronger dye due to the tannins in it. Steep the clothes in the solution for an hour or longer. The longer you soak the fabric, the darker it will be. [16] X Research source When the fabric is as dark as you'd like, squeeze out the dye, and run it under cold water. Soak it in a bit of white vinegar for 10 minutes to help set the color. Rinse out the vinegar and then let the fabric dry. You can also iron it to get out the wrinkles. Tea or coffee can be used to give fabrics a vintage look. You can also use them to hide stains on white towels that have seen better days."
