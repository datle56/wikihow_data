The properties tab on the left-hand side is where you will be able to customize varied materials. The project browser just below allows you to select elevations and floor plans to do different tasks in creating your building. The tabs along the top of the screen organize the tools used in creating the model. They categorize it to help keep the model organized and easy to use."

Keep the elevation heights as listed. Level 1 is at 0’-0” which denotes ground level. Level 2 is 10’ from level 1. Similarly, the Roof is 20’ from level 1 and 10’ from level 2. This is set so that the wall heights are 10’. Though we are not changing the wall heights, for reference, if you were to have different wall heights double click on the numbers and type what height you prefer. The software will automatically adjust the lines to reflect the heights you choose."

From there you will put in the wall dimensions as shown in the video above. To put in the wall dimensions, click and then drag the wall in the desired direction, type in the length (It is expressed in feet), then click Enter. Continue this process following the dimensions in the video until you have the final layout of all the walls. If you make a mistake, click the Escape button on your keyboard to get out of the wall tool. Select Modify in the top left corner, select the wall you wish to delete, and select Delete on your keyboard. Additionally, make sure that the pink box in place of your curser shows when you are extending a new wall off of the end of an already created wall. The pink box makes sure that you are starting the new wall directly at the end of the existing one. If the new wall is not starting at the end of the existing wall, the system will not connect the walls correctly."

Select all four of the outside walls, but make sure the pink lines are along the inside of the walls. You want to make sure the pink lines are along the inside of the walls because that is where the floor will meet up with the walls in the model. If they are not along the inside of the outermost walls, click the symbol of two arrows going in opposite directions that appear in the middle of the line. This flips the line to the other side of the wall. Once all four lines are correct, click the green check at the top of the screen to complete your floor."

The first door you will select is a Single Flush 32”x84” . Once that door type is selected you can place them in a similar place as shown in the video. Do not worry if it is in the correct place yet because you will correct it. The instruction video shows different doors being placed, however the basic Revit program only has the single flush doors, so use them in place of the others. Select the Single Flush 32”84” again and place it in the center of the closet wall. Notice that depending on where your mouse is, it moves what side the door opens on. Make sure that the doors open in the correct direction. Select the Single Flush 32”84” one more time and place it to where the outside entrance would be. Once all of the doors are placed zoom in to the location of the first door and select the door. When selected, dimensions show up. By pressing the blue dots it changes where the dimensions are measuring from. Click the blue dots so that we can specify 6” between the end of the door and the wall on all of the single flush doors. If any of the doors are opening on the wrong side, click the double arrows to ensure the door opens to the side shown in the video. There are also double arrows to flip what room the door opens into."
