      "content": "Gather food for horses. Horses eat very specific foods. Feeding a horse can increase its health, increase a wild horse's temper, and speed up the time it takes a baby horse to grow into an adult. The following are the different food items a horse can eat and the effects they have on the horse: Sugar: Sugar can be crafted from sugar cane using a crafting table . Feeding sugar to a horse increases its health by 1 HP (Â½ a heart), increases its temper by 3 points, and speeds up the time it takes a baby to mature into an adult by 30 seconds. [1] X Research source Wheat: Wheat can be grown from wheat seeds in tilled soil next to a water source. You can also find wheat in village gardens. Wheat increases a horse's health by 2 HP (1 heart), increases its temper by 3 points, and speeds up the time it takes a baby to mature into an adult by 20 seconds. Apple: Oak and dark oak leaves have a 0.5% chance of dropping an apple when broken or decayed. You can also find apples inside chests in villages, igloos, and strongholds. Feeding an apple to a horse increases its health by 3 hearts, increases its temper by 3 points, and speeds up the time it takes a baby to mature into an adult by 1 minute. [2] X Research source Golden Carrot: Golden carrots can be crafted from 1 carrot and 8 gold bars. Carrots can be found in village gardens, and gold bars can be smelted from gold ore in a furnace . Feeding a golden carrot to a horse increases a horse's health by 4 HP (2 hearts), increases its temper by 5 points, and speeds up the time it takes a baby to mature into an adult by 1 minute. Golden carrots also put horses in love mode so that they can breed . [3] X Research source Golden Apple: A golden apple can be crafted from an apple and 8 gold bars using a crafting table. Feeding a golden apple to a horse increases its health by 10 HP (5 hearts), increases its temper by 10 points, and increases the time it takes a baby to mature into an adult by 4 minutes. Golden apples also put horses in love mode so that they can breed . [4] X Research source Hay Bale: Hay bales can be crafted from 9 wheat using a crafting table. Feeding a bale of hay to a horse increases its health by 20 HP (10 hearts), and increases the time it takes a baby horse to mature into an adult by 3 minutes. Hay bales can only be fed to horses that have already been tamed . [5] X Research source"
