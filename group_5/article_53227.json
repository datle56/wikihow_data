      "title": "Teeth",
      "content": "Teeth It’s often easiest to tell your dog’s age by their teeth. Gently lift up their lips to examine their chompers. Puppies have small, emerging teeth at 3 weeks old, and have all their sharp baby teeth at 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, their baby teeth begin to fall out, and their adult teeth (canines and incisors) emerge. By the time they’re 6 months old, they have all their full-sized, adult teeth, with flat molars in the back. [1] X Research source Young dogs often have ridges or bumps on their front teeth, which help with chewing. The ridges are faint at around 3-4 years old, and your dog’s teeth are totally smooth at 7 years old. [2] X Research source Dogs older than 4 develop tartar buildup or yellowing on their teeth, which gets thicker and darker the older your dog is."

      "content": "Eyes Young dogs often have clear, unclouded eyes. Middle-aged to elderly dogs, on the other hand, tend to develop round, gray or bluish clouds in the center of their eyes. This is known as lenticular sclerosis, and happens when the lenses of your dog’s eyes harden with age. It doesn’t affect how well your dog sees, but is a good indicator that they’re at least around the middle of their breed’s lifespan. [3] X Research source Note that lenticular sclerosis is different from cataracts, which are white and opaque, and do affect vision. Cataracts are also common in older dogs, but if you notice them, consult a veterinarian about care."

      "title": "Fur",
      "content": "Fur Fur color often changes as a dog ages, but isn’t the most reliable indicator of age. Generally, younger dogs have less gray or white fur, while older or elderly dogs have much more, especially around the snout. That said, gray fur can develop around the snout as early as 2 years into a dog’s life, and many dogs gray prematurely as a result of high activity, stress, or even just genetics. [4] X Research source It’s best to consider fur alongside other indicators, like your dog’s teeth, eyes, and behavior. If you notice graying in multiple places on your dog, such as the legs, paws, and ears, it’s more likely that your dog is nearing its senior years."

      "title": "Paws",
      "content": "Paws Puppies and younger dogs often have softer paw pads on the bottoms of their feet. In middle-aged to senior dogs, these pads are often much darker, dryer, and even cracked as a result of years of wear. Older dogs also often have dryer, more brittle nails, which may flake.

      "content": "Muscle tone & build Of course, puppies are smaller and leaner than adults of their breed. Adults are in their prime, and, if they’re healthy and active, are sturdy and fairly muscular. As dogs age and become seniors, their backs tend to sag, their bones may become more visible, and their spine becomes more prominent. Also, around middle age, dogs may develop pads of fat on their lower back or hip area.

      "content": "Breed and size While the above characteristics can help you gauge your dog’s age, lifespans vary by breed and size, which makes it difficult to say exactly how old a dog is. You can get a better idea, though, by looking up the typical characteristics of your dog’s breed on a site like American Kennel Club , and comparing those characteristics to those of your dog.

They’re active, playing, and chewing on everything until about 1.5 years of age. [9] X Research source Then, around middle age, your dog’s energy levels subside and even out, becoming more consistent. In old age, your dog may slow down significantly, preferring a snooze over play time.

This may be caused by arthritis, stiffness, or general fatigue."

      "content": "Hearing Most dogs tend to lose some or all of their hearing as they advance into their senior years. It often begins as a loss of middle- to high-pitched sounds. It’s a totally natural part of your dog’s lifespan, but many people confuse it for behavioral problems. [11] X Research source Try saying your dog’s name at a normal volume in the same room as your dog. If their ears perk up, they’ve heard you. If not, they may have hearing loss (or be dozing), and are further along on their path of life."

While conventional wisdom says to multiply a dog's age by 7 to determine human years, developmentally speaking, dogs are well over 7 years old (in human years) by the time they’re 1. In fact, most breeds of dogs are about 15 years old in human years by that time. Likewise, in their second year of life, they develop another 9 human years.

The only way to know your dog's age for sure is to know their birthday. If you don't know much about your dog's history, then you might want to take them to see a veterinarian and have bloodwork done anyway. A blood panel is a good, general indicator of your dog's health, and it can also identify problems before they become serious illnesses."
