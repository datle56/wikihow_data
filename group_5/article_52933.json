      "title": "Wait until your tree is dormant in the winter to make your cuts.",
      "content": "Wait until your tree is dormant in the winter to make your cuts. Pruning your tree when it’s dormant gives it time to heal before threatening pests arrive in the spring and summer. If you have particularly cold winters, wait until the coldest part of the season is over before pruning the tree. [1] X Research source Pruning in the winter will also help your tree grow more during the spring. Avoid pruning your tree during the growing season or you could stunt its growth."

      "title": "Use a chainsaw, bow saw, or hand saw to make your cuts.",
      "content": "Use a chainsaw, bow saw, or hand saw to make your cuts. Using a chainsaw is the quickest and easiest method to chop down a limb. On the other hand, using a hand or bow saw gives you more control over your cuts, though they will take a bit more muscle and time to cut through a thick limb. [2] X Research source When using a hand or bow saw, move the saw back and forth quickly to make clean, straight cuts. Make an initial mark on the tree limb, then go back and saw it off. If using a chainsaw, handle the machine with care and read all safety warnings on the saw before you use it. Make sure to wear protective eyewear and gloves, as well. If the limbs are small (with a diameter of 3 ⁄ 4 in or 20 mm or less), use a pair of pruning shears or loppers to remove them. Small branches can be removed with a single cut at the tree’s branch collar."

      "content": "Make an undercut 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) from the trunk. The best way to cut a tree limb is to use the 3 cut (or triple cut) method. First, make a small notch on the underside of the branch, about ¼ of the way through. This undercut, or notch cut, helps keep the bark from splitting. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make a cut from the top side a little farther down from the notch cut.",
      "content": "Make a cut from the top side a little farther down from the notch cut. Move about .5–1 foot (0.15–0.30 m) away from your first cut, and place your blade on the top side of the limb. This time, cut entirely through the limb so it falls off the tree. This is called your “relief cut,” and it removes the weight of the branch so it will be easier to make your final cut. [4] X Research source If you skip over this cut and go right for your final cut, you might damage the trunk and expose your tree to pests and disease."

    {
      "title": "Make a final cut where the branch collar meets the rest of the tree.",
      "content": "Make a final cut where the branch collar meets the rest of the tree. The branch collar is where the swollen bump of the tree meets the smooth branch section. To make a healthy cut, move your saw along the slant of the branch collar to smoothly remove the remnants of the limb. [5] X Research source Sometimes, the slant of the branch collar can be tricky to reach. Make your cut from the bottom up if it’s easier than going from the top down. Make sure your hands are not in the way of your hand saw or chainsaw."

      "title": "Avoid cutting the limb too short.",
      "content": "Avoid cutting the limb too short. It used to be popular to trim the limb as close to the trunk as possible, but that can actually cause your tree to get sick. Instead of cutting at the tree trunk, cut at the branch collar right before the trunk so the tree can recover easily. [6] X Research source Cutting too close to the trunk can lead to rotten holes and seeping wounds in the trunk."

      "title": "Don’t leave the tree limb too long.",
      "content": "Don’t leave the tree limb too long. The branch collar will heal after the limb is removed, but if the tree limb extends too far past the branch collar, it will heal more slowly. Any remaining branches or stubs will interfere with the healing process. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose the right spot for relief cuts to avoid damaging the tree.",
      "content": "Choose the right spot for relief cuts to avoid damaging the tree. If most of the limb’s weight is removed before trimming the branch itself, your branches may split off. This can cause major damage to your tree. [8] X Research source Your tree can become susceptible to disease or insect infestation if your relief cut is not made properly."

      "title": "Cut off any dead, dying, or diseased limbs.",
      "content": "Cut off any dead, dying, or diseased limbs. One of the most important reasons for pruning a tree is to keep it healthy. Removing broken or damaged branches encourages wounds to heal, so cut off any limbs that have been injured by insects, animals, storms, or disease. Look for discolored leaves and bark to determine which branches need to be removed. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure how to tell if a branch is dead, scrape off a small piece of bark. If the branch is alive, it will be soft and green underneath. If it’s dead, it will be hard and brown. Diseased branches may lack bark or have wilted, spotted leaves. Certain areas may even ooze. These limbs should be cut back at least 6 inches below the diseased area to promote healthy wood growth."

      "title": "Thin out the tree’s crown.",
      "content": "Thin out the tree’s crown. Crown thinning refers to the selective removal of limbs to help increase light penetration and air movement throughout the tree. When thinning, leave branches that are attached with a large “U” shape, and instead cut off limbs that connect with a narrow “V.” These V-shaped limbs (known as lateral or vertical branches) often form “included bark”, which is a section of inward-rolled bark between the limbs. This bark prevents the branches from attaching securely and can lead to cracks and breakage. [10] X Research source When thinning the canopy, remove limbs from the outer edges rather than the tree’s interior. Vertical branches mainly produce vegetative growth and very little fruit compared to horizontal branches. Similarly, remove branches that cross or rub together to promote healthy growth. In most cases, it’s best to remove the branch that is moving toward the other and leave the one that is growing out normally."

      "title": "Don’t cut more than ¼ of the tree’s limbs at once.",
      "content": "Don’t cut more than ¼ of the tree’s limbs at once. If you cut more than a quarter of the tree’s limbs at once, the tree may become stressed and produce excessive amounts of epicormic sprouts (also known as water sprouts or suckers), which can be harmful for the tree’s overall structural health. If you need to cut more than ¼ of the limbs, do so over successive years. [11] X Research source Water sprouts are upright shoots that develop from dormant buds on the tree’s trunk or large branches."
