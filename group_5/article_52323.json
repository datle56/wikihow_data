      "content": "Dervenin wanders around the streets of Solitude. You can usually find him between the Bard’s College and Blue Palace. He’ll request your help when you find him. Ask him, “What do you need?” followed by “How can I find your master?” to accept the quest. After that, he’ll give you Pelagius’ hip bone and direct you to the Blue Palace’s Pelagius wing. [1] X Research source Before getting this quest, you might hear a rumor from an innkeeper about a mad beggar wandering Solitude. You may also hear Dervenin himself saying things like, “Please, take pity on an old madman!” or “You! You’ll help me! You help people, right? That’s what you do?”"

      "content": "Erdi or Una can be convinced to give you a key to the Pelagius Wing. Select “I need to get into the Pelagius wing,” and then say, “Falk asked me to check it out.” You’ll need to pass an easy Speech check, after which either maid will agree to give you the key. Alternatively, if you've already helped Falk Firebeard, you can ask him for a key. [2] X Research source To help Falk Firebeard and get on his good side, you’ll need to complete the quest “The Man Who Cried Wolf.” Talk to Falk and offer to investigate Wolfskull Cave to start The Man Who Cried Wolf quest."

      "content": "Upon reaching a lighted corridor, a loading screen will occur. When you first enter the wing, it’ll be unkempt and in disrepair. Then, when you walk through some cobwebs and into a lighted hallway, you’ll be transported into Pelagius’ mind. There, your character will be wearing a set of Fine Clothes (and you won’t be able to access your inventory to re-equip anything). [3] X Research source All of your normal items will be returned after you complete the quest and exit Pelagius’ mind."

      "content": "Sheogorath is in the middle of a large dining table. In Pelagius’ mind, you’ll see 2 people at the table: one is sitting on a throne (Sheogorath), and the other is Pelagius III. Tell Sheogorath to come back from vacation. He’ll agree to leave if you can escape Pelagius’ mind and give you the Wabbajack, a powerful Daedric Artifact. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Sheogorath will ask you to pass 3 trials to fix Pelagius' mind.",
      "content": "Sheogorath will ask you to pass 3 trials to fix Pelagius' mind. Each trial is located beyond an arch, and they can all be found in the area around the dining table. The Arch of Confidence is southeast, the Arch of Night Terrors is northeast, and the Arch of Paranoia is northwest. See the steps below for a detailed overview of each trial! [5] X Research source Although the trials are numbered here, they can be completed in any order."

      "title": "In this trial, you’ll see Pelagius’ anger battling his confidence.",
      "content": "In this trial, you’ll see Pelagius’ anger battling his confidence. “Anger” will take the form of a large soldier, while “Confidence” will look like a tiny person. Use the Wabbajack on Anger twice until it becomes tiny, then use it on Confidence twice until it’s as big as Anger used to be. This will allow Pelagius’ confidence to overcome his anger! [6] X Research source Try to enlarge Confidence and shrink Anger quickly; Confidence will shrink again every time it gets hit by Anger. You’ll also see two ghostly figures called “Self Doubt” appear, although they’ll only fight one another; you don’t need to worry about them attacking you (or Confidence)."

      "title": "The goal of this trial is to wake a sleeping Pelagius the Tormented.",
      "content": "The goal of this trial is to wake a sleeping Pelagius the Tormented. You’ll see a bed in the forest with Pelagius sleeping on it. Use the Wabbajack on him, and use it on the monster that spawns afterward to transform it into something tamer. Keep repeating this process (shooting Pelagius, then the spawned monster) until Pelagius wakes up. [7] X Research source If you take too long to use the Wabbajack on each monster that appears, you’ll have to start over—so be fast! In order, the monsters that spawn are: A wolf (which turns into a goat) A bandit chief (which turns into a young Pelagius) A hagraven (which turns into a beautiful maiden) A flame atronach (which turns into a bonfire) A dragon priest (which turns into an inaccessible chest) You don’t need to use the Wabbajack on the tamer creatures—only the monsters that spawn initially."

      "title": "This trial features an arena with two fighting storm atronachs.",
      "content": "This trial features an arena with two fighting storm atronachs. On the opposite side of the arena, you’ll see Pelagius the Suspicious sitting with 2 bodyguards. Sheogorath will inform you that your monster must win the fight—but instead of targeting an atronach, shoot Pelagius’ bodyguards with the Wabbajack. They’ll transform into wolves and kill Pelagius. [8] X Research source The atronachs fighting in the arena are just a distraction; you can ignore them. If you shoot them with the Wabbajack a few times, Sheogorath will say, “Methinks your aim is off!”"

      "title": "Sheogorath will allow you to leave when you finish all 3 trials.",
      "content": "Sheogorath will allow you to leave when you finish all 3 trials. Tell him you’ve fixed Pelagius’ mind, and he’ll summon Dervenin. From there, he’ll let you keep the Wabbajack and return to the Shivering Isles (with Dervenin in tow), while your character will magically appear back in the Pelagius Wing with all their items and abilities restored. [9] X Research source Congratulations—the quest is now complete! It should resolve and register as complete in your quest log as well. There’s a copy of the skill book Surfeit of Thieves in the Pelagius Wing, so pick that up before leaving! It’s down the hall, at the bottom of the stairs."
