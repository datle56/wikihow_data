      "content": "The underside of the shrimp is connected. Next time you have a shrimp in hand, flip it over and look at its underside area. You’ll notice a bunch of small slats that fold into each other where the shrimp’s belly is. These slats make the shrimp curl up tightly as it gets cooked. [1] X Research source Some shrimps curl up more than others. Small shrimp are more likely to curl up into themselves than larger shrimp.

      "content": "Make small slits on the underside of each shrimp. Flip the shrimp over and make 2 to 3 shallow cuts with a knife on the inside curve of the shrimp. Press the shrimp flat on a cutting board to open them up before you start cooking. [3] X Research source The cuts that you make will disconnect the underside of the shrimp, making it less likely to curl up so tightly."

If you’re going to boil your frozen shrimp, add about 1 minute onto your cooking time. For any other cooking method, make sure the shrimp turns pink and white to ensure that it’s done. [5] X Research source Use a thermometer to double check that your shrimp is at 145 °F (63 °C) before you eat it."

      "content": "You can, but you don’t have to. Butterflying the shrimp, or cutting it lengthwise from head to tail, can make it less likely to curl and shrink up. However, you can also just keep a close eye on your shrimp as it fries to ensure you don’t overcook it. [6] X Research source Some recipes call specifically for butterflied shrimp. If that’s the case, then you should butterfly it before frying."

Take them off the heat right away to avoid overcooking your shrimp. [8] X Research source The curl should be gentle, like a “C” shape. If your shrimp curls up so much that the head touches the tail, it might be overcooked. [9] X Expert Source Abyssinia Campbell Executive Chef Expert Interview. 31 August 2021."
