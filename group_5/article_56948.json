This is where you will make your next cut. Make the second cut along the edge you marked. Your first piece of wood has been cut. Repeat this process for the rest of the planks. You should end up cutting 15 pieces of wood."

Stand pieces of wood on its side (so the piece looks 3-D) and make a hexagon shape. For best results, start with the honeycomb base and work your way from there. Glue sides together with wood glue when you are completely sure you like the way the shelf looks. Press and hold together for a few minutes. Drill sides together by pre drilling holes first. Then add screws using your electric drill. Start at the base and work your way outward."
