      "title": "Lower your chin and maintain eye contact.",
      "content": "Lower your chin and maintain eye contact. Bend your head forward at a slight, 45-degree angle, as if giving an exaggerated, respectful nod. [1] X Research source Not too far, though; avoid pressing your chin to your chest, or looking at your feet. Maintain this position throughout the curtsy. Perform this curtsy any time you’d like to show respect to someone else in a formal setting, such as before dancing with a partner, or meeting a partner’s parents at a banquet or gala."

      "title": "Hold your skirt if it reaches your ankles.",
      "content": "Hold your skirt if it reaches your ankles. In modern times, it isn't usually necessary to hold your skirt while you curtsy. Instead, simply place your hands at your sides, and a little bit out from your hips if you need to balance. [2] X Research source If the skirt is especially long or voluminous, however, take the edges of your skirt between the thumb and first two fingers on each hand, with the pinkies extended. Gently pull the skirt out to each side. Note that if you don’t need to hold your skirt to prevent it from touching the ground, gathering it in your hands may be perceived as overly theatrical, or even mocking. Best to play it safe and keep your hands at your sides if you’re unsure."

      "title": "Extend your right foot 4–8 inches (10–20 cm) behind the left.",
      "content": "Extend your right foot 4–8 inches (10–20 cm) behind the left. Shift your weight to your left foot. Then, bring your right foot behind the heel of your left, so that the ball of your right foot rests on the ground slightly outside of your left foot. Keep your right foot about 4–8 inches (10–20 cm) from your left—or however far apart you need to keep your balance. When curtsying to royalty, using either foot is generally acceptable. In other contexts, always bring your right foot back."

      "title": "Bend your knees and hold the curtsy position for 1-2 seconds.",
      "content": "Bend your knees and hold the curtsy position for 1-2 seconds. Lower yourself down into a curtsy, bending your knees slightly outward, rather than straight forward. Just a slight bend will do; lower yourself about 4–6 inches (10–15 cm), and remain there for 1-2 seconds. Keep your back straight and avoid leaning forward so as not to stick out your rear. [3] X Research source Curtsy slightly lower and hold it slightly longer to show greater respect."

      "title": "Straighten your knees slowly and return to a standing position.",
      "content": "Straighten your knees slowly and return to a standing position. Slowly and gracefully return to an upright position, lowering your hands back to your sides and raising your head as you do so. [4] X Research source Avoid bobbing or shooting straight back up, which is a bit awkward and puts you at risk of losing your balance. This curtsy is also known as a “British Lady Curtsy,” and a subtle, quick version of it is performed by British royalty. Nowadays, foreigners and members of the British public aren’t expected to curtsy for royalty. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Court curtsy:",
      "content": "Court curtsy: Extend your right foot forward, then draw it in a wide circle behind your left, resting on the ball of the foot. Keeping your back straight and your head lowered, bend your knees outward. Bow your head slightly and keep lowering yourself down until your right knee almost touches the ground. Stay in that position for 1-2 seconds, then slowly raise yourself back to an upright position. [6] X Research source Do this curtsy after performing for an audience, or to thank attendees for coming when hosting a formal event. This is a somewhat antiquated curtsy used to show respect and deference to members of royalty, usually from European countries."

      "title": "Ballet curtsy:",
      "content": "Ballet curtsy: Begin with your heels together and your toes pointed out. Take a step to your right, place your right foot behind your left, and bend your knees with your arms out. Then, step to your left, and perform another curtsy like the first. [7] X Research source Also known as a révérence, this is an elegant curtsy performed at the end of a performance or class to show gratitude to the audience, the pianist, or the instructor. Often, the actual curtsy is preceded by a few theatrics, or a small dance that varies from ballet company to ballet company."

      "title": "Texas dip:",
      "content": "Texas dip: Raise your arms out in front of you at shoulder height, then extend them out to the sides as you cross your left leg behind your right. Keeping your back straight and your arms extended to the sides, bend your knees and lower yourself down into a deep curtsy. When you can go no further, gently drop down onto your behind. [8] X Research source Once sitting, lean forward until your forehead nearly touches the floor. At this point, some debutantes will turn their head to the right to avoid getting lipstick on their gown. Keeping your back bent, raise your head to look at the audience—and don't forget to smile! Finally, grab your escort's hand and slowly and gracefully raise yourself back to a standing position. The \"Texas dip\" is an elaborate curtsy performed by debutantes from the state of Texas during the International Debutante Ball."

      "content": "Stand with your spine straight and chin tucked back. Standing like a lady is all about being as tall as possible. Pretend there’s a string tied to the top of your head, and that it’s gently pulling you upward. Keep your shoulders back to align your spine. [9] X Research source In addition, tense your abs inward to help keep your midsection straight. Hold your hands behind your back, or clasped in front of your with your elbows slightly bent."

      "title": "Walk with long strides, stepping with one foot in front of the other.",
      "content": "Walk with long strides, stepping with one foot in front of the other. To walk like a lady, pretend you’re walking on a balance beam, and keep each stride a little more than the length of 1 foot in front of you. There’s no need for fancy struts, but if you feel up to it, swing your hips just a little bit along with the natural shift of your weight as you walk. [10] X Research source Remember to keep your back straight! A lady is never caught slouching."

      "title": "Sit with your legs together and angled to the side.",
      "content": "Sit with your legs together and angled to the side. To sit like a lady , first brush your skirt down along your rear as you’re sitting, to make sure it falls over the front of your chair. Then, keep your knees together, with one foot resting behind the ankle of the other. Finally, angle your legs so that your feet touch the floor near one of the legs of the chair. If you’re wearing a gown or a short skirt, don’t cross your legs, but do angle them. Otherwise, you might reveal too much skin."
