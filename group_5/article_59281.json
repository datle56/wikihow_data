      "content": "Make sure that the power is switched off. Before replacing a fluorescent light, you should make sure the fixture is not powered on. Do not simply use the wall switch to remove power to the fixture. You can use the fuse box to shut off power to the lamp's circuit. Use a voltage tester to verify that there is no power in the fixture. [1] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021."

      "title": "Rotate the first tube 90 degrees.",
      "content": "Rotate the first tube 90 degrees. Reach up, and gently support the first fluorescent tube with both hands, keeping your hands as close to the ends of the bulb as possible. You will be able to rotate the tube in either direction a quarter-turn until it stops. This action rotates the prongs, that project from each end of the bulb, to a vertical alignment, and so allows you to slide the tube downward and out of the fixture."

      "content": "Lift the new fluorescent tube into place. To install the new light, line its prongs up with the slots in either socket. Push the tube straight up into the sockets, and then rotate it 90 degrees until you feel it lock into place. You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place.

Consider installing LED lighting instead, which uses less energy, lasts longer, and produces a more natural light."

      "content": "Test the new bulb. Flip the fuse box switch back on, then flip your wall switch on. See if the new fluorescent bulbs light up properly, noting that fluorescent lamps take a minute or so to reach full brightness. If the new bulbs do not work properly, you may have a defective component in your light fixture that needs to be replaced.

      "content": "Change out cracked sockets. Cracked sockets are often caused by other objects bumping into the fixture, or too much stress while removing a bulb. First, turn off the power to the light, and remove the bulbs. Keep the wiring order straight as you take out the old socket. It is important to cut only one wire lose at a time. Strip each wire back by 1/2 in., and put the stripped wire end into the terminal slots of the new socket. Do this for each wire. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the ballast.",
      "content": "Inspect the ballast. The ballast controls the amount of incoming voltage that start the light tubes. It also regulates the electricity to give constant light. If you believe that the ballast needs replacement, you may want to consider purchasing a whole new fixture. Ballast replacement may cost the same amount as a new fixture. [7] X Research source A humming sound produced by your fluorescent light fixture usually indicates that the ballast, rather than the bulbs, needs to be replaced."

      "title": "Check for light frames.",
      "content": "Check for light frames. Office lighting is usually behind a bezel lens with a frame. These types of recessed fixtures are holding the light tubes in place to minimize accidents and breakage. They can be very frustrating due to the lack of wiggle room or freedom of movement. The frame is held in place by lever locks or snaps that you have to take out."

Be sure to only do one end at a time to maintain more control over the bulb. [11] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. Once you wiggle the first tube out, the other tubes will come out much more easily.
