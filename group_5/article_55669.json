      "content": "Hold the bat in a loose grip with your fingers for the most control. When you grab onto the bat’s handle, position your non-dominant hand so it’s no more than 2–3 finger-widths from the end of the handle. Put your dominant hand right above your non-dominant hand so your second set of knuckles make a straight line. Keep your grip a little loose near the base of your fingers rather than in your palm, or else you’ll tense your forearms and won’t have a powerful swing. [1] X Research source Try setting your bat on your shoulder and relax your elbows to help get your hands into position. [2] X Research source Avoid gripping the bat any higher on the handle since you won’t get as much power out of your swing."

      "title": "Square up to the plate so you can reach pitches on the outside corners.",
      "content": "Square up to the plate so you can reach pitches on the outside corners. Step into the batter’s box next to the plate so your non-dominant shoulder points toward the pitcher. Spread your feet out slightly wider than your hips so your toes are parallel to the plate. Balance your weight on the balls of your feet evenly. Bend your knees and ankles a little bit to get into a ready position. Keep your spine straight, but hinge forward at the hips so you’re slightly leaning over home plate. [3] X Research source Reach your bat across home plate and see if you can touch the front corner on the other side of home base. If you can’t easily reach it, move closer to the base until you can. You can position your feet slightly wider or narrower depending on what feels the most comfortable for you. While most coaches recommend starting in a square stance, you can also move your front foot further away from the plate to open up and see the ball better. You can also use a closed stance with your front foot closer to the plate. It all depends on what you prefer and feels the most comfortable."

      "title": "Keep your elbows down and your arms bent as you start your stance.",
      "content": "Keep your elbows down and your arms bent as you start your stance. Rest your bat on your back shoulder and relax your elbows so you don’t have any tension. Try to make a triangle or A-shape with your forearms to ensure you’re positioning the bat correctly. Then, lift your arms straight up until your hands are at ear-level and your front elbow makes a 90-degree angle. Then, tilt your bat up so it’s at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Be sure to keep your front shoulder relaxed and pointed toward the pitcher. [4] X Research source Avoid lifting your back elbow up higher than your front elbow because it will throw you off balance while you’re swinging."

      "title": "Look directly at the pitcher so you can follow the ball easier.",
      "content": "Look directly at the pitcher so you can follow the ball easier. Turn your head directly toward the pitcher so you can watch them with both eyes. It might be tempting to recheck your grip or look at the bases, but only focus on the pitcher so you can prepare for the ball. That way, it’s easier to follow the ball and predict where it will land in the strike zone. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Shift your weight to your back foot as the pitcher releases the ball.",
      "content": "Shift your weight to your back foot as the pitcher releases the ball. As soon as the pitcher finishes their wind-up and lets go of the ball, put all of your weight on your back leg since that’s where most of your power comes from. [6] X Expert Source Haley Snyder Softball Player Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Keep your back foot firmly planted on the ground and bend your knee a little more to get even more power from your swing. [7] X Research source Don’t swing the bat just yet. Since you’re shifting your weight backward, trying to move the bat forward will make you feel off-balanced."

      "title": "Step forward with your front foot to swing the bat faster.",
      "content": "Step forward with your front foot to swing the bat faster. Right as you load your weight onto your back foot, lift your front foot off of the ground. Then, plant the ball of your front foot back on the ground so your toes point slightly forward. Some people barely lift their toes off the ground while others take a larger step forward. It all depends on what feels best for you, so try out a few swings to see what works out. You may also hear this called a “toe tap.” This movement helps start up your forward momentum so you can swing faster and get the most power from your hit."

      "title": "Lead your swing with your hands so the bat snaps forward quicker.",
      "content": "Lead your swing with your hands so the bat snaps forward quicker. Lift your back heel and pivot your foot so the toes point forward throughout your swing. Turn your hips toward the ball so you get more power. Point your front elbow toward the pitcher and swing your arms over home plate until the bat points straight back at the catcher. [8] X Research source At this point, your dominant hand, elbow, and back thigh will all line up. [9] X Research source Keep your head completely still while you’re swinging. If you look up or away from where you’re swinging, then you may miss or won’t make good contact with the ball. Dropping your back shoulder so it’s lower than your front shoulder can make it easier to swing. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Hit the ball so your bat is parallel with your shoulder. Try to make contact with the ball just in front of home plate so the path of your swing is parallel to the tops of your shoulders. [11] X Research source Leave a slight bend in your elbows so your arms aren’t fully extended, or else you won’t get as much power from your hit. [12] X Research source Keep your hands ahead of the bat, or else you’ll hit the pitch wide and won’t have as much control."

      "title": "Point the bat toward the pitcher to prolong contact with the ball.",
      "content": "Point the bat toward the pitcher to prolong contact with the ball. Your ball will go further the longer you make contact with the bat. Fully straighten your arms and quickly rotate your wrists in the direction of your swing so the bat whips forward and points back toward the pitcher. If you leave your arms fully extended, you’ll most likely hit ground balls or make bad contact with the ball. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Swing the bat up behind your head to put the most power in your swing. Do not stop putting your strength into your swing when you contact the ball. [14] X Expert Source Haley Snyder Softball Player Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Instead, bring your arms across the front of your body and swing the bat behind you. Try to avoid slapping your back with your bat since it could lead to a weaker hit. [15] X Research source Some players let go of the bat with their back hand at the end of the follow-through. It all depends on what feels best for you. [16] X Research source Complete your swing, extension, and follow-through all in one fluid motion to ensure you hit the ball the furthest and hardest you can."

      "title": "Only swing at balls that cross over home plate within the zone.",
      "content": "Only swing at balls that cross over home plate within the zone. In fast-pitch softball, the strike zone is the area directly over home plate between your armpits and the tops of your knees. If you play slow-pitch, then the strike zone is still right over home plate, but in the area between the top of your back shoulder and your front knee. Avoid swinging at any pitch thrown outside the strike zone since it’ll be called a ball. The size of the strike zone may slightly vary depending on the umpire calling the game. Pay attention to what they’ve called balls and strikes so you can get an idea of where the zone is."
