      "content": "The Bible says you can learn through heartbreak. Outside of the Christian faith, the “cure” for heartbreak is focused on feelings, but God’s “cure” focuses on the heart. God can heal broken hearts, and faith in Him is all that’s required. While this may seem simple, it can be anything but. God has a plan for you, and there’s always a lesson to be learned. Grief and distress can bring you further and closer to your faith, helping you learn more about yourself and your relationship with Christ. [28] X Research source For example, think of Job’s story. Job lost his children, possessions, health, and livelihood all in one day. How did he react? He kneeled down and prayed: “The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised” (Job 1:20-21). [29] X Research source Although Job grieved, he continued to worship the Lord, and his faith helped him learn and find goodness."

      "title": "Be honest with yourself.",
