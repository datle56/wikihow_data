      "content": "A typical “normal” cycle will take around 2 hours. It may take a little longer or shorter depending on your particular brand and model, but most of the “standard” or “normal” cycles out there will run about 2 hours. [1] X Research source In a rush? Skip any pre-wash or sanitization settings. Your dishes will get clean with a normal or quick cycle. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wash times for each cycle are typically listed in the manual if you want to know precisely how long a given cycle will take. Keep in mind, the age of your machine, the type of detergent, and the size of your load will all influence how long a “normal” cycle takes."

      "content": "Custom or heavy-duty cycles can take up to 4 hours. If you run a heavy-duty cycle with an optional “sanitize” and “extra hot wash” adjustments or something along those lines, it can take up to 4 hours depending on your specific model/brand and the options you choose. [3] X Research source Optional settings are typically listed separately from the typical quick/normal/heavy wash settings. Heavy-duty cycles also usually rely on hot water, which takes a long time for your dishwasher to heat up."

      "content": "Yes, but it’s because they’re generally more energy efficient today. Old dishwashers just treated every load identically. Today, modern machines have all kinds of sensors that detect when the dishes are (at least mostly) clean. There are also regulations today surrounding how energy efficient appliances have to be, so modern dishwashers tend to take longer. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Sure, your old dishwasher might have been faster, but you’re better off from a cost and efficiency perspective with a slightly slower modern machine."

      "content": "Eco-wash (2-3 hours) Most dishwashers these days have some kind of eco- or energy-efficient mode designed to use less electricity and water. It usually uses lower temperature water and it’ll take longer than a normal cycle, but it’ll get your dishes clean without wasting energy. [5] X Research source Some dishwashers don’t have a mode like this."

It’s also a great option if you rinsed off the dishes. It’s not a great option if your dishes are super dirty, though.

Your machine won’t run its normal dry cycle. When the wash cycle is done, just open the door and wait a few hours for the dishes to dry.

Most machines these days have an open-door feature where it’ll continue whatever cycle the machine was on when you open the door. However, it’s not available on every single machine. On some machines (especially older models), opening the door will interrupt everything and force you to restart the cycle. [13] X Research source If your primary worry is water, rest assured that you aren’t going to cause a giant flood if you open the door. If you open the machine and you can’t get it to start back up again, press “start” and close the door. If you don’t hear the machine starting back up, it will probably drain and restart the cycle."

Food scraps often build up in there, so reach inside and clear them out to improve water flow. Then, scrub the arms and nozzles that spray water with dish soap and rinse it off—this will get rid of any minerals blocking the water flow. [14] X Research source Use a drain-clearing chemical to break down and food scraps blocking water from draining. A dirty filter and filthy nozzles can make it take a lot longer for your dishes to get clean. If you run any kind of auto-clean cycles, this will extend the time."

On top of that, take off any add-on settings you normally use (like “sanitize”). This will speed up how long it takes for your dishwasher to finish its cycles. [15] X Research source"
