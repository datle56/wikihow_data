      "content": "Look for a steam cleaner with at least a 1 US gal (3.8 L) tank. You can purchase a steamer, but they are often in the range of $800 or more. Rent a steamer from a local hardware store or try to find a used one instead. [1] X Research source Avoid clothing and carpet steaming devices. These do not reach the temperatures needed to kill bed bugs."

      "content": "Attach the triangular nozzle to the hose. Most steam cleaners come with a wide, angular nozzle for steaming upholstery and other surfaces. Place this nozzle on the end of the steamer hose before you turn it on. Do not use a carpet attachment because the bristles may interfere with the nozzle getting close to the item. Do not use a pinpoint or other type of narrow nozzle as this may blow the bed bugs and their eggs around the room."

      "title": "Steam upholstered items and in cracks and crevices.",
      "content": "Steam upholstered items and in cracks and crevices. Fill the tank with plain tap water and then switch on your steamer. Start steaming all of the upholstered and hard surfaces in the room moving from the highest point to the lowest point. This will help to ensure that any bed bugs will be pushed down rather than up and around the room. Bed bugs may hide in soft-surfaced items as well as in cracks and crevices. Some items you may need to steam include: [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Mattresses Box springs Furniture Baseboards Tacking strips on carpet"

      "content": "Move the wand slowly over the surface of items to get good coverage. Aim for a speed of about 12 in (30 cm) every 30 seconds. This will help to ensure that each section of the item gets exposed to enough steam to kill the bed bugs and their eggs. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that steaming can be a slow, tedious process, especially if you have a large area to cover. Take breaks as needed or have someone help you to prevent yourself from rushing through the job. If you come across a live bed bug while cleaning, hold the steamer over it for 30 seconds. This should be enough heat to kill it. [4] X Research source Once the bug is dead, use a paper towel to pick it up and throw it away."

      "title": "Open windows and run a fan in the room when you are done.",
      "content": "Open windows and run a fan in the room when you are done. After you have finished steaming everything, open all of the windows in the room to help the air circulate. Switch on a ceiling fan if available, or turn on a floor fan. This will help to dry off the items and prevent mold and mildew from forming. [5] X Research source Make sure to aim the fan towards the items you steamed, such as towards the ground if you steamed a section of carpet, or upwards if you steamed a chair, mattress, or box springs."

      "content": "Repeat the process 2 to 3 times to ensure that all the bed bugs are dead. It often takes 2 or 3 times for steaming to kill all of the bed bugs since they may move to escape the steam, or you might miss an area. Plan to repeat the steam treatment a few hours later or the following day. [6] X Research source Don’t wait more than a few days to repeat the treatment because bed bugs multiply quickly!"

      "content": "Check for a surface temperature between 160 to 180 °F (71 to 82 °C). This is the ideal temperature for killing bed bugs without damaging the items you are steaming. You can use an infrared thermometer to check the surface temperature of the items you steam. Hold the infrared thermometer about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the surface of an area right after you finish steaming it. [7] X Research source If the temperature is below 160 °F (71 °C), then you may need to adjust your steamer or use a different steamer."

      "content": "Check to ensure that the surface feels damp, but not wet. The surface of the items should not feel wet to the touch after you run the steamer over them. Check for a damp surface, and adjust the settings on your steamer if the item feels wet. [8] X Research source If an item gets too wet, press it with a dry towel to blot up the moisture."

      "content": "Hire a professional to apply an insecticide for extra coverage. Although steam can kill bed bugs, you may not be able to penetrate deep enough to kill all of the bed bugs and their eggs. Using an insecticide along with steam cleaning will help to ensure that the bed bugs are under control. [10] X Research source Since applying insecticides can be dangerous, it is recommended to hire a professional exterminator to do this for you. They have the knowledge to choose the best chemicals for your situation and apply them safely. [11] X Research source"
