      "content": "Applaud a child on a job well done to boost their confidence. Sometimes, the best compliments are the simplest in the moment. Children look to their parents or guardians for praise and approval—moments of pride help them feel more assured of themselves. [5] X Trustworthy Source Child Mind Institute Nonprofit organization providing evidence-based care for children with mental health and learning disorders and their families Go to source So, if a kid has done something good or impressive, don’t hesitate to give them a sincere compliment. Here are some examples: “Great job in class! You’re so smart.” “Fantastic job!” “You put in all your effort, and I’m proud of you.” “Your work is out of this world!” “You always know how to behave. Thank you.” “You are a great example to others.” “That’s an awesome joke!” “You showed courage by volunteering to go first.” “That’s such a thoughtful question.” “That’s a great point!” “I love that you chose to be a helper today.” “Thank you for helping me clean up!” “That was great advice to give.” “I admire your confidence.” “I like how focused you are!” “You set a great example.” “You’re such a good sharer.” “You stayed positive.

      "title": "Center compliments on characteristics, traits, and skills.",
      "content": "Center compliments on characteristics, traits, and skills. Try to avoid compliments about appearances. Complimenting a child on their appearance could backfire, even if you have the best intentions. Kids are like sponges—they absorb everything! If you only focus compliments and praise around how they physically look, they may develop a subconscious belief that they need to look a certain way to receive love and attention. [6] X Research source As a general rule, avoid praising things they can’t control, such as their physical appearance, and focus on what they can control, such as their attitude. For instance, instead of saying, “You have a beautiful smile,” try, “Your laugh is so contagious. I love it!” This isn’t to say you can never compliment your child’s appearance! Just try to focus most of your compliments on their amazing personality to remind them how great they are on the inside."

      "title": "Applaud good behavior.",
      "content": "Applaud good behavior. Kids seek approval—it’s how they know whether they’re doing the right thing. So, make sure to praise and compliment your child when they do something right. Giving them attention when they’re good helps encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior. [7] X Research source Let’s say you see your child cleaning their room. Compliment them by saying, “Well done! I’m so proud of you for cleaning your room.” Be specific. When complimenting your child, be specific about what they’ve done to deserve your praise. This tells them why they’re getting positive attention while also sharing what they should be confident about. [8] X Research source For example, a compliment like, “I’m really impressed by how you’re doing in school. Ms. Smith says you’re doing a great job multiplying” tells a kid you’re proud of their school work and they should keep at it."

      "content": "Show an interest in their interests. There’s no denying that kids can have lots of hobbies and interests. And while you may not be fully intrigued by them, your kid doesn’t have to know that! Meet your child where they are right now. Compliment the things they’re passionate about and interested in. [9] X Research source Try saying something like, “Wow! You put in a lot of effort making this. I like how the colors blend,” or “That’s impressive. Can you tell me more about it?” As licensed clinical psychologist Kim Chronister says, “To make a compliment stand out and be more unique, highlight something you’ve recently learned about their skill set.”"

      "title": "Focus on your child alone, not comparisons.",
      "content": "Focus on your child alone, not comparisons. Comparing your child’s traits, accomplishments, and attributes to another child or person could hinder their self-worth. Rather than comparing your child to others, focus on what makes them amazing on their own. Engage in what they’re doing over what others are doing to instill confidence. [10] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “Your painting is good, but I really do like Tommy’s,” try, “What a fantastic painting! Can you tell me about it?”"
