      "title": "Make sure your X account is public, not protected.",
      "content": "Make sure your X account is public, not protected. That is, anyone should be able to look at your tweets, regardless of whether they have been approved to follow you. If your tweets are protected, no one except your approved followers can see your tweet, even if they have been mentioned."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow your favorite celebrities on X.",
      "content": "Follow your favorite celebrities on X. It's a good idea to find a celeb who usually tweets a lot -- they are more likely to care about who tweets @ them. For example, search for Tom Mcfly, who is one of the singers in the hot British band 'Mcfly'."
    },
    {
      "title": "On the main page you'll receive his or her updates.",
      "content": "On the main page you'll receive his or her updates. To reply to one, mouse over the update and click on the arrow. It will say: \"@tommcfly\". That is okay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Type a message after the @ symbol.",
      "content": "Type a message after the @ symbol. Send your message. Tweet a question or interesting/provocative statement to encourage a response. If you just compliment the celebrity or express your love for them, they'll probably silently appreciate your compliment but not feel the need to respond. You want to give the celebrity some concrete material to respond to. Try to tweet at celebrities when they have just tweeted. This way you know they are online and your tweet will be at the top of their list."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your tweets interesting.",
      "content": "Make your tweets interesting. Celebrities wouldn't want to reply to something boring. Adding pictures to your tweets makes it more interesting and if it is something funny or relevant to them, then they might notice it. If you tweet things like \"I'm your biggest fan!\", then they would most likely not reply to you because they get these kind of tweets all the time. Be unique in your approach and think of things to tweet that no one else tweets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't spam celebrities.",
      "content": "Don't spam celebrities. Don't send the same message a billion times in 5 minutes, or desperately reply to every tweet a celebrity posts. Remember: quality, not quantity, will get you noticed. A bunch of inane, vapid tweets will just be annoying and possibly get you blocked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use hashtags.",
      "content": "Use hashtags. They'll increase visibility for your tweets, especially if you tweet about a trending topic. If you have a good story or picture with your tweet, that's even better -- it's more likely that you'll be retweeted and favorited. If a celebrity uses a hashtag, think of how that hashtag can also apply in your life and use it too. Anytime a celebrity is trying to promote a hashtag, indulge them and join in the fun!"

      "title": "Retweet celebrities.",
      "content": "Retweet celebrities. Everyone appreciates their message spreading across the X-sphere, and there's no better way to show your appreciation for a good tweet than to retweet it in all its glory."
