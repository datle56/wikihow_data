Why is the game not even starting up when I hack it? A. In most cases, it is just the cheats that you have used. A lot of cheats just contradict with other cheats. Q. It won't save any of the cheats as enabled, and won't many people haven't got any of the cheats to work for any game. Just trying to get cheats to work in general."
