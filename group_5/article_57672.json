Recharge gift events give free magic potions for free spins that recharge a certain number of diamonds. This isn't available for free-to-play users. If you are free-to-play, you won't be able to get legendary skins as quickly."

      "content": "Be active in events. MLBB has a lot of events that give free magic wheel potions. For free users, take advantage of them. Some events give truly free magic wheel potions for free spins. For paying users, some events may require spending more to get more additional free potions for spins. Instead of solely spending for the spins, you spend for another in-game item and get spins for free."

      "content": "Purchase a monthly starlight pass. The starlight pass is the most valuable in-game purchase. Standard starlight members get more than 5 magic wheel potions for spins alongside the monthly exclusive skin and other rewards. After purchasing starlight, make sure you are active to maximize the starlight rewards. This is not available for free-to-play users. This only refers to the standard starlight pass. Starlight Member Plus, the pricier starlight tier is not valuable. Avoid purchasing that tier unless you really wish to. The starlight member plus tier is for those who can't be active in the game but can pay for that. This is not recommended."
