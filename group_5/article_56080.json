M.2 SSDs are a small form factor type of SSD that support non-volatile memory express (NVMe). This allows for extremely fast data transfer speeds. The reason PS5 uses an M.2 SSD instead of a more traditional hard drive is the fast transfer speeds allow for very quick loading times. [4] X Research source"
