      "content": "Clothing is the easiest and quickest way to cover a new tattoo at work. Wear loose, breathable garments to hide the tattoo without irritating it. Choose long sleeves and pants to cover ink on your limbs, and high-waisted pants or a tucked-in shirt to cover lower back tattoos. Use turtlenecks or crewnecks to hide upper chest or small neck tattoos. [1] X Research source Add a blazer or cardigan to short sleeves for a professional look. [2] X Research source Make sure the clothes over your tattoo are always clean. Dirty garments that rub the fresh tattoo can make the healing process take longer. If you have to wear tight fitting clothes, wrap the tattoo in breathable cotton or gauze first (no plastic or cling wrap). Make sure to wash your hands and the tat before wrapping!"

      "content": "If you’ve got long hair, wear it down to shield any ink that it can reach. Depending on the length, use your hair to block tattoos on the back of your neck, your upper back, or behind your ears. Drape it in front of your shoulders to cover ink around your collar bones or shoulders, too. [3] X Research source If you have a small tattoo on your upper back or the back of your neck, try a ponytail to change up the style. Since your hair is loose and breathable, it won’t irritate a fresh tattoo. Just make sure to keep your hair clean (for your tat’s health and a professional look). Wearing your hair down will protect tattoos from excess sunlight. This means the tattoo will look fresher and sharper for longer."

      "content": "Scarves make stylish, professional, and effective tattoo covers. While your new tattoo is healing, opt for a scarf, shawl, wrap, or ascot made from a light, thin, breathable material like silk (this will also keep you from getting too hot indoors). [4] X Research source Wait to use thicker or heavier scarves until the tattoo is fully healed."

      "title": "Ankle, calf, and leg tattoos are easily concealed with opaque legwear.",
      "content": "Ankle, calf, and leg tattoos are easily concealed with opaque legwear. Long socks prevent an ankle tattoo from showing when your pant leg rides up. Opaque tights can cover a tattoo anywhere on the leg—if it’s still showing through the fabric, try a patterned tight to distract onlookers from the tattoo. [5] X Research source Tight clothing over a healing tattoo isn’t ideal. If you have to wear socks or tights, choose something made with a breathable fabric like cotton."

      "title": "Bracelets, rings, or watches can cover small tats on your wrists or fingers.",
      "content": "Bracelets, rings, or watches can cover small tats on your wrists or fingers. Opt for thick bands and sleek, professional styles to keep things classy at the office. Double check your employer’s jewelry policy, as some organizations don’t like public-facing workers wearing “distracting” accessories. [6] X Research source Fresh tattoos need to breathe, so wear your watches or bands loosely to let some air circulate around the ink."

      "title": "A healing tattoo is like an open wound, so you can disguise it as one.",
      "content": "A healing tattoo is like an open wound, so you can disguise it as one. Wrap the tattoo loosely in a clean, dry, breathable bandage material like gauze or cotton and remove it as soon as you leave the office (you want the tattoo to get as much air circulation as possible). This works best for tattoos on your limbs or appendages that are difficult to cover by other means. [7] X Research source This method looks conspicuous compared to other subtle covering options like clothing or long hair."

      "title": "Many ankle or riding boots are office-friendly and great at covering tattoos.",
      "content": "Many ankle or riding boots are office-friendly and great at covering tattoos. Choose a pair that goes with most of your work outfits—you may have to invest in a new pair or two if this is your go-to cover up method. Pair with tall socks or tights to prevent the tat from peeking out over the top. [8] X Research source Boots are fine for healed or mostly healed tattoos. Brand new tattoos might get damaged from the boot rubbing against your skin. Try to time your new ink so it can heal before boot season and use breathable bandages, socks, or tights to cover it up in the meantime."

      "title": "Cover-up sleeves are a quick way to hide extensive tattoos on your limbs.",
      "content": "Cover-up sleeves are a quick way to hide extensive tattoos on your limbs. Just pull the elastic sleeve over your arm or leg and ta-da! They come in a variety of colors and designs, with some brands even making skin-toned sleeves to look more subtle. [9] X Research source Cover-up sleeves are stretchy and usually made of spandex or nylon to keep them from slipping off while you move. Keep in mind that cover up sleeves probably look less professional than a long-sleeved shirt or blazer. While your tattoo (or parts of it) is fresh, it’s better to use a loose, long sleeved shirt to cover it. Cover-up sleeves are tight and restrict airflow to the healing tattoo."

      "title": "Makeup is a convincing option for hard-to-cover areas like hands.",
      "content": "Makeup is a convincing option for hard-to-cover areas like hands. First, wash your tattoo and apply a color-correcting, full coverage primer . Choose a color that’s opposite the color of your tat (for example, most black inks have a bluish tone, so go for a red-orange primer). Then apply a loose setting powder , a layer of foundation , another layer of powder, and then a thicker layer of foundation that matches your skin tone. Finish with a final powder layer. [10] X Research source Apply hair spray when you’re finished to make the makeup last longer. The downside to makeup is that it’s time consuming, costly, and not waterproof. Some makeup products marketed for covering tattoos look great on camera or TV, but are more noticeable up close or in person. Do not use makeup on tattoos that are still healing to avoid the risk of irritation or infection."
