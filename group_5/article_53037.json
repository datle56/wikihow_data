      "content": "Adopt a “practice makes perfect” attitude about dating. Treat dating just like any other skill--you will not be perfect every time, it is a skill that can be practiced, and it takes time and effort to be good at it. Consider each date you go on as a chance to practice your skills rather than a \"success or failure\" mentality. If you make a mistake, try to laugh at yourself and remind yourself that it’ll make a great story one day. Dating is a way of seeing if you enjoy and are compatible with your potential love interest. It is not a test of you overall as a person. If the date does not work out, or it is not a good match, that only means that this particular situation is not a long term one. It’s okay if you have setbacks when it comes to dating. When you’re building a skill, you won’t have a steady path of progress. There are always going to be obstacles. Everyone feels nervous on a first date, and it's normal to make mistakes. You're doing just fine!"

      "content": "Focus on making connections with people who interest you. You might be feeling anxious about dating because you feel pressure to fall in love or find a partner. Relieve this pressure by looking at dating as a chance to relate to other people. When you go on a date, get to know the person and search for common interests. It doesn’t matter if it goes farther than a few dates. What’s important is that you’ll have made a connection with them. If it helps, create a list of questions you want to ask them before the date. You might ask, “What are you most excited about?” \"What do you respect most about your mother or father?\" \"What's the most thoughtful gift you've received?\" or \"Tell me about a time that something didn't go as planned but ended up helping you get to where you are now.\""

However, you’re probably going to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a good partner, so take the pressure off yourself.

This will help you approach dating with a relaxed, open mind. For instance, tell yourself things like, “You’re enough,” “You can do this,” and “Your hard work is going to pay off.” If you want something, go out and get it for yourself. As an example, buy yourself nice jewelry or start saving for a house."
