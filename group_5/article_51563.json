      "title": "Bad suspension ball joint",
      "content": "Bad suspension ball joint A faulty suspension joint, or ball joint, is going to make noise when you turn. The suspension joint connects the wheel and tire to your steering and suspension systems. Without this joint, the tire wouldn’t be able to turn. So, if one of those joints cracks or breaks, it will make noise on the tire when you turn. Depending on where that crack is, it may only make noise when you turn in one direction. [1] X Research source What does it sound like? Creaking or popping noises. This will only come from the wheel with the bad ball joint. The fix: See a mechanic to have them remove your tire and replace the ball joint. The cost: Around $100-200."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bad CV joint",
      "content": "Bad CV joint The CV joints connect each wheel on your vehicle to the corresponding axle. They allow each wheel to turn at a slightly different angle so you can make sharper turns. If one of those joints needs to be lubricated or replaced though, it may make noise when you turn right but not left. [2] X Research source What does it sound like? A clunky, crunching sound. You will likely only hear this noise coming from one tire. The fix: The CV joint probably needs to be replaced, so go see a mechanic. The cost: Expect to spend $400-800 on a CV joint repair."

      "title": "Dry or damaged tie rod",
      "content": "Dry or damaged tie rod The tie rods connect your vehicle’s steering rack to the pinion and knuckles on your front axle. If one of the tie rods needs to be lubricated or it’s cracked, your steering wheel might feel “off.” You may also notice noise as that tie rod fights to help the pinion and knuckles turn. [3] X Research source What does it sound like? This will likely result in a clunking, squealing, or thumping sound. The fix: The tie rod needs to be lubricated or replaced by a professional mechanic. The cost: Replacing the tire rod will run $200-300. Lubrication may only run $100 or so."

      "title": "Bad sway bar link",
      "content": "Bad sway bar link The sway link bar connects the suspension system to the chassis of your vehicle. Without a functional sway bar, your vehicle won’t be able to handle all of the bumps on the road. Your vehicle will drive much rougher as a result, and the sway bar may make noise if you turn at a certain angle. [4] X Research source What does it sound like? A sharp knocking sound. The fix: The suspension system and the sway bar need to be examined by a pro, so see a mechanic. The cost: Roughly $100-300."

    {
      "title": "Bad wheel bearing",
      "content": "Bad wheel bearing The wheel bearings sit inside of the wheel and connect the tire to the axle. Basically, they help the tire turn freely. If a bearing is damaged or cracked, the airtight seal opens and allows the grease to be exposed to the air. This causes the bearing to dry out, which will eventually create friction and generate noise. [5] X Research source What does it sound like? A grinding, clicking, or humming noise. This noise will get worse the faster you drive or turn, and you’ll notice it only comes from one tire. The fix: See a mechanic to get the wheel assembly replaced. The cost: One bearing will run about $350. If one bearing has gone bad though, the others may need to be replaced soon, which would be about $1,400"

      "title": "Dry or damaged bushing",
      "content": "Dry or damaged bushing The bushings are rubber cushions that sit between the suspension and steering joints. They help your suspension absorb vibration so that your ride is comfortable. If one of the bushings wears down, your vehicle will feel a little less comfortable than it normally is. It may also make noise when you turn. [6] X Research source What does it sound like? It’ll likely resemble rattling as the suspension creaks and grinds against the steering joint. The fix: Get the bushing replaced. You can replace the bushing yourself if you’re handy, but it’s a fast and easy repair for a mechanic, too. The cost: Roughly $250-300."

      "title": "Faulty strut or shock",
      "content": "Faulty strut or shock The struts and shocks are what most people think of when they hear the word “suspension.” These are the coils and levers that connect each individual wheel to the suspension system. They absorb impacts and ensure your ride is comfortable. If one of them is damaged though, it’ll make noise as you turn and the shock fails to move freely. What does it sound like? It depends. It’ll likely sound like creaking and cracking. It may sound like ticking, though. The fix: See a professional mechanic to have the strut and shock on the problematic wheel replaced. The cost: It really depends on what needs to be replaced. If it’s just a minor repair to a single component, it may only cost $300-400. It could be up to $2,000 for a brand new strut and shock assembly."

      "title": "Power steering pump",
      "content": "Power steering pump The power steering pump keeps all of the fluid in your power steering lines pressurized so that you can turn the wheel without resistance. If that pump has gone bad or it’s slowly dying, your vehicle will likely make noise when you turn. Your steering wheel will also be harder to turn than it normally would be if the pump is bad. [7] X Research source What does it sound like? Your vehicle will probably make a whining or grinding noise when you turn in any direction. The fix: The pump needs to be swapped out. See a mechanic to have the fluid drained and the pump replaced. The cost: About $500."
    },
    {
      "title": "Low power steering fluid",
      "content": "Low power steering fluid If the power steering pump is fine, low fluid levels can trigger similar symptoms. Without pressurized fluid lines, the wheels will struggle to pivot as you drive. This will make it harder to turn the wheel, and it will also cause noise as you turn the wheel. [8] X Research source What does it sound like? Whining, sloshing, or flushing. If the fluid is really low, you’ll likely hear grinding noises, too. The fix: If it has been a long time since your car has been serviced, you may just need to refill the power steering fluid . The odds are high there’s a leak somewhere though, so see a mechanic just in case. The cost: If you just need new fluid, it’ll be around $8. A flush and repair may run up to $300, though."

      "title": "Bad alignment",
      "content": "Bad alignment Your vehicle’s alignment refers to how the tires are lined up relative to the chassis and steering rack. If the alignment is off, your steering wheel won’t be flat and centered when you’re driving straight. If it’s bad enough, your vehicle may even jeer to one side when you let go of the wheel. You may also notice that your wheels make noise when you turn. [9] X Research source What does it sound like? Screeching or grinding. It’s probably going to be a very mild noise unless the alignment is way off. The fix: This is one of the more common vehicle issues people run into. See a mechanic to have the alignment fixed . The cost: Realignment shouldn’t be expensive. It usually runs about $75-150."

      "title": "Damaged steering rack or pinion",
      "content": "Damaged steering rack or pinion The rack and pinion refer to a metal bar and gear next to the front axle. They connect the steering wheel to the front axle and help the tires move as you turn the steering wheel. If something is damaged though, your vehicle will make noises when you turn in either direction. If the rack and pinion fail, you won’t be able to move turn at all. [10] X Research source What does it sound like? This is a gnarly sound. It’ll probably resemble a flittering grinding noise. You may even feel your steering wheel clicking or thumping as you turn. The fix: This repair requires a professional. See a mechanic to have the rack and pinion inspected, repaired, and replaced as needed. The cost: It really depends on your vehicle and how expensive the parts are. It could be as low as $500, or as high as $4,000."

      "title": "If you can steer like normal, it’s ok to drive in the short term.",
      "content": "If you can steer like normal, it’s ok to drive in the short term. This is not the kind of issue you can ignore, and you absolutely cannot drive if your steering is abnormal. However, if your car is handling just fine, you’re probably in the clear to drive for a very short distance. If you have any doubts whatsoever though, get a tow to the mechanic. The problem with holding off on getting this fixed is that the fail-state for a lot of these minor issues can be very severe. A bad wheel bearing or CV joint could easily lead to a broken axle, for example."
