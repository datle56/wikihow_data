    {
      "title": "Wet your head.",
      "content": "Wet your head. As tempting as a dive into the pool might be, take a minute to wet your hair in the shower before you swim. Wet hair is less likely to absorb chlorinated water than dry locks. Soak your hair in the shower until it is entirely saturated. This may feel like your head is heavy. Consider rinsing with cool water if you can. Warm water opens up the hair’s cuticle while cool water helps keep it closed. Using cool water may expose your hair to less chlorine.

      "title": "Rub a protective layer on your locks.",
      "content": "Rub a protective layer on your locks. Your head will likely be in the water all or most of the time you’re in the water. Putting a protective barrier of a hair product or even coconut oil can keep too much chlorine from seeping into your strands. Cover all of your hair with a product such as an oil or silicone-based conditioner. Hair serums also work well. If you prefer a natural product, coconut oil is a great alternative. Recognize that protective layers of hair product or coconut oil will not leave a residue in the water."

      "title": "Wear a swim cap.",
      "content": "Wear a swim cap. They aren’t the most fashionable swim accessories, but swim caps are another easy way to protect your hair from chlorine. A cap won’t keep all water or chlorine off of your hair, but it can minimize how much seeps into your locks. Purchase a latex or silicone swim cap. You can get these at sports stores, large retailers, and swimming stores."

      "title": "Wash out lingering chlorine and product.",
      "content": "Wash out lingering chlorine and product. When you get out of the pool, it’s important to wash your hair. This will remove lingering barrier product and chlorine from you hair. It also prepares your hair for deep conditioning. Rinse your hair for a minute or two to remove the barrier product and any chlorine. This will allow any shampoo and conditioner to better penetrate your hair. You can also try an apple cider vinegar rinse to help get the chlorine out of your hair. After shampooing and rinsing your hair with plain water, rinse it again with a mixture of one part apple cider vinegar and two parts water. Then rinse your hair with plain water again."

    {
      "title": "Condition your hair.",
      "content": "Condition your hair. Rinsing your hair with water and using a protective barrier is a great way to minimize the amount of chlorine your hair absorbs. But these still allow some chlorine to leech into your hair. This can strip it of its oil. Using a conditioner after shampooing can add moisture back to your hair. It may also minimize itchiness or irritation you may experience. [3] X Research source Use a product designed for deep conditioning. You can switch back to regular conditioner on the days you don’t swim. Consider spraying on a leave-in conditioner so that your hair gets the benefits of moisturize throughout the day."

    {
      "title": "Rinse off before you get in the pool.",
      "content": "Rinse off before you get in the pool. Just like your hair, wet skin absorbs less chlorine than dry. When you wet your hair in the shower before you swim, make sure that the water hits your skin—and swimsuit—as well. This can offer some measure of protection against chlorine on your skin. It can also keep the color of your swimsuit fresher for a longer period of time. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid protective barriers on skin.",
      "content": "Avoid protective barriers on skin. Unlike your hair, a protective layer won’t keep chlorine off of your skin. This includes even the heartiest barriers such as petroleum jelly. Protective skin barriers can also react with the water’s chemistry by producing more molecules that can irritate skin and hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shower as soon as possible after you swim.",
      "content": "Shower as soon as possible after you swim. Although you can’t protect your skin against chlorine as well as your hair, you can minimize any potential dryness and irritation. Taking a shower as soon as you get out of the pool can get the chlorine off of your skin. Consider getting a shower gel or wash with vitamin C. This can help further neutralize the chlorine on your skin and get it to wash away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a moisturizer.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizer. Since chlorine strips your skin of its natural oils, preventing further dryness is the best way to protect your skin. Applying a moisturizer after every swim can add oil back to your skin and help keep it moisturized. Moisturizer can also minimize your risk for irritated skin or rashes. Use a moisturizer that is high in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. These are not only very high in moisture, but can further neutralize any lingering chlorine on your skin. Select a moisturizer that is a heavy cream instead of a lotion. Thicker products are generally more moisturizing than thinner ones."
