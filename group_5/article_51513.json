      "content": "Contact your state's health care department. Since Medicaid is administered by individual states, if you want to cancel your Medicaid coverage you need to go through your state's health care department. If you're not familiar with your state's offices, do a search online to find the main website. The website should have a toll-free number as well as a location directory for physical offices. You also may be able to find contact information on your Medicaid card."

    {
      "title": "Select the correct date for your coverage to end.",
      "content": "Select the correct date for your coverage to end. When you cancel your Medicaid, it will end on the last day of the month in which you request that your coverage be terminated. Check the dates carefully, especially if you've gotten other health care coverage, to avoid a gap in coverage. For example, if you request cancellation of your Medicaid on December 7, your coverage will actually end on December 31."

    {
      "title": "Confirm cancellation of your coverage.",
      "content": "Confirm cancellation of your coverage. You will receive a written notification in the mail to inform you that your Medicaid has been cancelled. It will include information on the last effective date of your coverage, and any other steps you need to take."

      "content": "Report changed life circumstances if you no longer qualify for Medicaid. If you qualified for Medicaid because your MAGI was below the threshold set by the federal government, you are responsible for reporting any changes to the information you reported. These changes could result in you no longer being eligible for Medicaid coverage. [3] X Research source If you are no longer eligible, your coverage will be cancelled. This could happen if, for example, you get married, or get a new job that pays more money than your old job. You may also have the option of simply ending your coverage, although typically you have to report changed circumstances as a reason to end your coverage. You can report online, over the phone, or by visiting a local Medicaid office in person."

      "title": "Call or visit your state's Medicaid office.",
      "content": "Call or visit your state's Medicaid office. Going directly to your local Medicaid office often is the easiest way to cancel your coverage.

If you were automatically assigned to an HMO, you only have a brief period of time (typically about 90 days) to disenroll from it or switch to a different plan. [6] X Research source If you wait until after that 90-day period, you won't be able to get out of it unless you have an approved reason for needing to do so.

[9] X Research source If you need your disenrollment processed more quickly, you may be able to have your disenrollment expedited.
