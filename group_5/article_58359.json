When the seeking team is finished counting, they will all run out and search for hiding players on the other team. If they find a hidden player they have to catch them, but the hiding player is allowed to run. In order to catch the hiding player, they have to hold on to the player and say, \"1-2-3 You're My Man\" When caught, the hiding players must walk to jail. The only way for them to get out is to be \"Jail Broken\". In order to be \"Jail Broken\", a player of the hiding team that has not been sent to jail can touch the jail and yell, \"Jail Break!!!\", and everyone in jail is freed. The game is ended when, eventually, every player on the hiding team is caught. the players then switch sides, the hiding team switching to the seeking team and vice versa."
