      "content": "Cite emails in-text only. The APA style guide considers emails as personal communications and, thus, non-recoverable sources. Because non-recoverable sources don't require entries on your References page, you'll only need to cite emails in the text of your paper. These citations should include the sender's name, the words \"personal communication,\" and the day and month on which the email was sent. [3] X Research source Parenthetical in-text citation example: (L. Lane, personal communication, July 18, 2018) Narrative in-text citation example: L. Lane (personal communication, July 18, 2018) If you received multiple emails from the same person over the course of one day, you might also include a timestamp when the email was received. For example: (L. Lane, personal communication, July 18, 2018, 12:40:07 p.m.)"
