If you wish to add a pre-made subject, type a question mark (?) after the user's email address, followed by the word \"subject\" (without the quotation marks), followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the subject inside a pair of quotation marks. [4] X Research source If you want to add this to your command, it should look like this so far: <a href=mailto:<nowiki>agentavery@sample.com?subject=\"subject text\" Try not to use characters that aren't alphanumeric in the subject line . There are ways to work around this so your link doesn't get stumped and thinks it's part of something else\". While most often not used, it is possible to add information to prefill the subject line via the mailto syntax. However, it's more often used when the mail is being sent to a server inside a robot that handles incoming mail so it can be processed later (so it can be filtered). You can add \"body\" as well as a cc or a bcc line using a similar syntax. Just make sure to use a question mark followed by the term \"body\",\"cc\", or \"bcc\" followed by an equals sign followed by the text for that line in a pair of quotation marks."
