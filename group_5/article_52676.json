      "content": "Wood Fence Use 2 sticks and 4 wooden planks of the same type to build your fences. Go to a crafting table to open the build menu. In the left and right columns, place wooden planks in the top 2 boxes. In the middle column, put sticks in the top 2 boxes. You’ll get 3 fence pieces in return. [1] X Research source You may use any type of wood to build fences as long as the 4 planks are all the same kind. The type of wood affects the final color of your fence pieces. For example, oak fences are lighter brown while spruce fences are darker."

      "title": "Nether Brick Fence",
      "content": "Nether Brick Fence These fences require 4 blocks of nether bricks and 2 individual nether bricks. Open a crafting table. In the left and right columns, place a block of nether bricks in the top 2 boxes. In the middle column, place an individual nether brick in the top 2 boxes. You’ll receive 6 fence pieces each time you craft this recipe. [2] X Research source Nether brick fences cannot be set on fire while wooden fences could burn down. If you’re playing Minecraft in Survival Mode, you must first build a Nether portal to reach the materials for crafting this fence."

      "content": "Fence Gate Use 4 sticks and 2 wooden planks of the same type. At a crafting table, place sticks in the top 2 boxes of the left and right columns. Put wooden planks in the top 2 boxes of the center column. The materials will turn into 1 gate. [3] X Research source Gates open and close when you interact with them so you can easily move in and out of fenced areas."

      "title": "",
      "content": "Place your first fence piece on a block for the starting post. Continue the fence on the next block over by placing another piece. Whenever you change directions, the fence will form a corner post. Leave a 1-block opening in your fence so you can place a gate to get in and out. Fence pieces are 1 ½ blocks tall, meaning monsters and animals (except spiders) can't jump over them. Wooden fences do not connect with nether brick fences, so they’ll have a small gap if they’re next to each other. However, a wooden gate connects to nether brick fences. Placing fences on top of other fences creates a taller wall with a grid pattern. Placing a single fence piece creates a post, which is perfect for tying animals to or hanging lanterns for more lighting."

      "content": "If you don’t want to build your own fences, there are many places to find them already built in the world. Use an axe or a pickaxe to break apart any fences you find because they won’t drop any pieces otherwise.
