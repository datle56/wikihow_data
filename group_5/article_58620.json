Make sure that you choose an antivirus from a reputable antivirus company that you recognize, such as Norton, McAfee, Avast, or Bitdefender. Antivirus apps from reputable companies are better at detecting viruses than apps from unknown companies. [1] X Research source For the most part, the iOS software is difficult to hack. However, some versions might have vulnerabilities. The best you can do is update your software as soon as new versions are released and be careful which apps you can install.

Follow the instructions at Apple or Android support to set yours up. To set a passcode for your iPhone, choose a code that consists of six digits, four digits, or an alphanumeric code you set yourself. [4] X Research source Avoid easy unlocking methods. Don't be tricked by fingerprint- or facial recognition. Hackers can copy your fingerprints from drinking glasses or use photographs of you. Don't set your phone to automatically unlock when you're at home or when it's near other smart devices. If someone breaks into your home or gets a hold of your smart watch, your phone will be vulnerable. [5] X Research source For an Android phone, start at the menu button from the home screen. Tap “Settings,” then “Security,” and then “Screen Lock.” The actual words might be different depending on your phone's brand name. Choose between Pattern Unlock, a personal PIN, or an alphanumeric password. After that, choose how long you want your phone to wait before locking. [6] X Research source"
