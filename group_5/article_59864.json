      "content": "Journal about your boundaries before entering a new relationship. Write down what kinds of emotional and physical boundaries you would need to save for a serious relationship, and which boundaries you want to save for marriage. Sometimes, the excitement of meeting someone new can make us relax our boundaries, but by writing them down beforehand, you can make sure you don’t get too carried away. For example, many Christians are comfortable with a kiss on the cheek to show affection, but draw the line at long make-out sessions or anything below the belt. Your boundaries may be different: it’s important that you not compare your boundaries to others, and instead do what feels spiritually right to you. [1] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. The boundaries you journal might look something like this: “I want to save sex for marriage and kissing for a fiance after we’ve been engaged. I want to wait to say “I love you” at least until we’ve already had serious conversations about our future lives together, and wait until marriage before moving in together.” In Biblical times, people didn’t date, and instead marriages were generally pre-arranged. Therefore, the Bible doesn’t explicitly say what acts are acceptable before marriage, but you should draw a line between acts of affection and acts of a sexual nature. Where that line should be depends on you and your own personal understanding of faith."

      "content": "It’s okay to be explicit about what acts cross a boundary for you. It can feel awkward to bring this topic up at the start of a new relationship, but someone who wants to help you honor your commitment to God will understand. Start a conversation by saying something like “Before we get more serious in our relationship, I want us to be on the same page about what kind of intimacy we want to save for marriage.” [2] X Research source It’s okay if you and your partner come into the relationship with different expectations for boundaries, but try to leave this conversation with the same ones. Neither you or your partner should commit to going any farther than either of you feels is comfortable—no one should feel pushed to loosen their boundaries. [3] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. For example, if your partner is okay with spending the night at your place, but you’d rather have a curfew after which you return to your respective homes, the curfew should be the boundary for your relationship."

      "title": "Emotional intimacy can be just as tempting as physical intimacy.",
      "content": "Emotional intimacy can be just as tempting as physical intimacy. Set up emotional boundaries for yourself: for example, there’s no such thing as taking things too slow, so wait to tell your partner you love them until you’re absolutely sure. Instead of quick declarations of love, focus first on building a strong friendship with someone you’re interested in before moving on to a romantic relationship. [4] X Research source Wait until you feel very committed to your partner before deciding to pray together. Praying together can build spiritual intimacy before your relationship is ready—remember that God is interested in our authentic, private selves, not the selves we use to impress potential romantic partners. [5] X Research source Be wary of emotionally depending on your partner. At least until you’re married, you should feel comfortable living your life independent of your partner—your partner’s presence should feel like something enjoyable, not something necessary. As scripture tells us: “Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life” (Proverbs 4:23). Just as Christians are called to guard their hearts against negative influences and evil intentions, they are likewise asked to be judicious about who they give their heart to."

Make a habit of reminding each other of your commitments to God whenever you’re in a situation that could threaten your boundaries. For example, if you’re alone in a room together, open the door, and tell your partner something like, “I love spending time with you, and I’m doing this so that we can feel more relaxed.” [6] X Research source In your married life, sexual desire will come and go—it’s only natural. Dating in a way that is spiritually pure is good practice for showing affection in other ways. [7] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020.

When you’re with someone you’re interested in, try to spend time with them in public—this can help reduce the temptation to break your boundaries. [9] X Research source Remember that all temptations can be overcome. Keep this verse from the Bible in mind: “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it” (1 Cor. 10-13).

      "content": "Modesty is a virtue for both men and women. Think about the Christ-like people in your life, and try to emulate their behavior. There’s no need to show your interest in someone by acting or dressing in a provocative way—instead, focus on building a strong foundation of trust and friendship. [11] X Research source Try to avoid doing things that would make it difficult for you or your partner to stay away from temptation. A good rule of thumb is to dress and act around each other like you would if your grandma was in the room."

For example, if you’re taking a trip with your partner, ask a friend if they can call you at night to make sure you make it back to your own room at a reasonable hour. Scheduling double dates with a friend who is also seeing someone can help keep you both accountable, and also be a lot of fun. [12] X Research source"

Many of them will be more than happy to help you navigate your relationship, and can give you advice about keeping your relationship healthy and in line with God’s plan. [13] X Research source Don’t be afraid to ask a couple about any issues you’re having in your relationship.

      "content": "Once you’ve set boundaries, try not to loosen them. It’s possible that you’ll decide to renegotiate your boundaries, and end up feeling comfortable spiritually and emotionally taking things further with your partner. If you do, make sure it’s not a spur-of-the-moment decision you may later regret. Have this conversation ahead of time, and make sure both of you have thought it through. [14] X Research source Temptation can be a slippery slope—one night you might decide to spend a little too long kissing your partner, and the next night you might end up taking things further."

[15] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. Dating can be fun, but it’s something that has a purpose. Be honest with yourself on whether you see your relationship as one with a future—if not, it may be time to have a difficult conversation. [16] X Research source Initiating a breakup can be extremely hard, and it’s important to have a support system of friends, family, and religious brothers and sisters to help you through it. A breakup can be a drawn-out conversation, but you’ll want to say something like, “Although I’ve really enjoyed spending time with you, I just can’t see a future in our relationship.”"

This could mean limiting the amount of time you spend with each other unsupervised or coming up with new ways to stay accountable. [17] X Research source God is full of forgiveness, and His grace is for everyone who truly repents of falling into temptation.
