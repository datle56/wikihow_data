      "title": "A dominant hand is the hand you use the most for motor skills.",
      "content": "A dominant hand is the hand you use the most for motor skills. Think about the hand you instinctively use when reaching for something, writing something down, or throwing a ball—this is your dominant hand. Most people are right-handed (meaning that their right hand is their dominant hand), whereas 10 to 12% of the population are left-handed. Hand preference develops and solidifies throughout early childhood, and dominance is usually apparent and fixed by the end of infancy. [1] X Research source Some scientists believe that your dominant hand is all up to genetics, while others argue that it’s a product of your environment. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In contrast, your non-dominant hand is the hand you use the least. For instance, if you’re right-handed, your non-dominant hand is your left hand. You may also hear the term “ambidextrous” when talking about dominant hands. An ambidextrous person is someone who can use both of their hands alike—both of their hands are dominant. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold a writing instrument and write a sentence. A stylus, pencil, or pen will do. Write something with a pen or pencil on a piece of paper with one hand. Once finished, write the same sentence using your other hand. Make a note of which hand you were using when you wrote the clearer version of the sentence. People are often forced to choose a specific hand to write with when they’re little, so you may naturally prefer using one hand to write, even if you prefer to do everything else with your other hand."

      "content": "Use eating utensils. Try bringing food to your mouth with a spoon or fork. Make a note of which hand is easier to use and if that preference changes depending on which utensils you use (fork and knife, chopsticks, fork, spoon). [4] X Research source Most utensils don’t have a hand-bias and are simple to operate, but you still might want to repeat the test until a preference is clear."

Color each copy of the picture with a different hand, aiming to stay within the lines. Make a note of which hand was the easiest to use and which picture is the neatest."

Then, use one hand to cut out one shape and the other to cut out the other shape. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Compare how well you cut out each shape with each hand. [6] X Research source Make sure the scissors you use are non-handed, as left- and right-handed scissors can only be used comfortably in the assigned hand."

This is likely your dominant or most preferred hand. The hand you predominantly used in writing and drawing often identifies which handedness you have, as it’s the most socially relevant, apparent, and distinctive activity impacted by handedness."
