      "title": "Look for a large offshoot growing from your main plant.",
      "content": "Look for a large offshoot growing from your main plant. One of the easiest ways to propagate a pilea is to plant the rooted offshoots that spring up around your mother plant. Look for an offshoot that’s about 2 to 3 inches (5-7 cm) tall with several leaves about 1 inch (2 cm) wide. [1] X Research source Unlike the main, mother plant, offshoots have a pink or reddish stalk. Generally, spring is the best time to propagate a pilea. The longer days full of sunlight help your mother plant grow lots of strong, healthy offshoots."

      "title": "Cut the offshoot from the mother plant with a knife.",
      "content": "Cut the offshoot from the mother plant with a knife. Look for the stem in the soil that connects it to the mother plant. Take a clean, sharp knife and cut into the soil between the offshoot and the plant. Once you’ve cut the connecting stem, carefully wiggle the offshoot out of the soil so its roots stay intact. [2] X Research source Don’t cut much deeper than 1 inch (2 cm) into the soil. Cutting deeper can hurt the main plant’s root system. Be careful not to catch any other stems with the knife when you cut the offshoot from the mother plant. While messier, it’s helpful to take the mother plant out of its pot to better see the connecting stem and the offshoot’s roots."

      "title": "Plant the baby offshoot in well-draining soil.",
      "content": "Plant the baby offshoot in well-draining soil . Fill a small pot with well-draining potting soil. Then, poke a hole in the soil with your finger. Shake off any loose dirt from the offshoot’s roots, then gently place it inside the hole. [3] X Research source If the offshoot you chose doesn’t have any roots, don’t worry! Just place it in a glass of water, removing any leaves that rest in the water. After a couple weeks, it’ll start growing roots. Once they’re about 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) long, pot the offshoot in soil. [4] X Research source When choosing a pot for your plant, make sure it has drainage holes at the bottom."

      "title": "Place your offshoot in bright, indirect light and water it thoroughly.",
      "content": "Place your offshoot in bright, indirect light and water it thoroughly. To care for your new pilea plant , set in a warm, sunny area in your home that receives a lot of indirect light. For the first couple of weeks, water it frequently so its soil stays nice and moist. [5] X Research source Once your baby pilea is established after several weeks, water your plant when the top 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) of soil are dry. You’ll know your pilea is established because it’ll start sprouting new leaves!"

      "title": "Cut into your pilea’s stem to take off a healthy leaf.",
      "content": "Cut into your pilea’s stem to take off a healthy leaf. Find a leaf on your plant that’s about 5 to 10 inches (12-25 cm) long. Using a clean, sharp knife, carefully cut into your plant’s stem at the base of the leaf stalk. Don’t cut deep into the stem, just take away a thin layer to remove the leaf from the plant. [6] X Research source To successfully propagate pilea from a leaf, a bit of the stem has to be attached to the leaf stalk. However, cutting too much of the stem off can damage the main plant."

      "content": "Dip the end of the stem in rooting hormone. While this step is optional, it'll help your pilea root more easily. Simply coat the cut part of the stem attached to your leaf in rooting hormone . The hormone will encourage new root growth on your cutting. With rooting hormone, your leaf cutting may sprout roots in as little as 2 weeks, though it could take as long as 2 months."

To pot your plant, fill a small planter full of well-draining soil . Poke a hole in the soil with your finger and place your cutting inside, covering just the base of the stalk with soil. [9] X Research source It’s common for baby plants to sprout at the base of your leaf cutting when it's growing in the water. If you have any babies, plant them above the soil. Once baby pileas start sprouting at the base of your cutting, snip off the original leaf stalk."

For the first few weeks, water it frequently so the soil stays moist. To tell if the soil is dry, just stick your finger about 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) deep into the pot. [10] X Research source Once your pilea is established and growing leaves, cut back to watering it about once a week, or when the soil is dry."

Just fill the glass with water so the bottom half of the cutting is resting in the water. If any leaves are submerged, trim them off the stem. [12] X Research source It usually takes longer, but you can propagate your stem cutting in soil if you prefer. First, coat the bottom of the cutting with a rooting hormone . Then, fill a small pot with a well-draining soil mix and place your cutting inside. Keep the soil moist and you’re good to go!"
