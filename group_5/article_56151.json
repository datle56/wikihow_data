      "title": "Place your hinges in the correct location.",
      "content": "Place your hinges in the correct location. Assuming you're installing a new door, you'll need to find the precise location on the door frame for your hinges. Most doors require a minimum of two hinges: one hinge is located 7-inches from the top of the door frame, and the other hinge is located 11-inches from the bottom of the door frame. Measure this distance and mark the location on the frame, and then do the same on the door that you're hanging. If you have a third hinge (typically used for heavy doors), it will be placed directly in the middle of the other two hinges (this will put it slightly off-center)."

      "title": "Trace around the hinge.",
      "content": "Trace around the hinge. Put your hinge in place on the door and the jamb, and use a carpenters pencil to carefully trace around the hinge. The depth of the hinge on the jam should always be as thick as the hinge is. Double check to make sure that your outlines match the same location on the door and jamb, before moving to the next step. Then, use a utility knife to score the outline; this will make it easier to cut the mortise. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the mortise.",
      "content": "Cut the mortise. The term 'cut the mortise' is the professional term for cutting out the wood in the jamb in the shape of the hinge, so that the hinge will be inset in the jamb and provide more strength and aesthetic appeal. To cut the mortise, you'll need a very sharp chisel and a hammer. While carefully angling the chisel, tap gently into the jamb from the side to remove thin strips of wood. Make sure not to cut the mortise too deep, as this will cause the hinge to become loose over time. Cut out only the outlined area and the marked depth. [2] X Research source Using a dull chisel will make it more difficult to cut the mortise, and cause you to use more pressure with the hammer (which could cause a slip). If you cut the mortise too deep, you can use wood filler or place a thin piece of wood in it before installing the hinge."

      "content": "Mark the location of the screws. Replace the hinge back in the jamb where you cut the mortise. Use your pencil to mark the location of the screws in the jamb. Do the same with the location of the hinge on the door. Remove the hinges when you're done marking. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Drill the pilot holes.",
      "content": "Drill the pilot holes. Use a drill or screwdriver to drill very narrow pilot holes in the location of the screws you marked on the jamb. Tap them lightly in first, to make sure the screws don't accidentally move out of place. Use a screw guide to keep the screws straight as they go into the wood. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Compare the hinges and measure the door. Make sure that your new hinges match the old hinges in size and edge shape. Additionally, use a measuring tape to verify that the current hinges are in the right locations. The hinges should be placed so that one is 7-inches from the top of the door frame, and the other is located 11-inches from the bottom of the door-frame. If these are incorrect, you'll need to go about the aforementioned steps on cutting the mortise and preparing the door jamb for the new hinge."

You may want to plug some of the old holes with a small wood wedge, especially if some of the holes have stripped out. [5] X Research source"

Sand down the wood if necessary, and add a new coat of paint or stain to match the pre-existing wood. [6] X Research source If the replacement hinges are sized differently from the old ones, fill in the mortise holes in both the door and the door frame with wood putty. Use a metal scraper to fill in the screw holes or plug them with a small wood wedge. Allow the putty time to dry, and sand it smooth and flush with the surface. Paint or stain the repair to match the rest of the door and trim."
