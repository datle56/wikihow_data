      "content": "Keep your warm climate in mind. Gardeners from warmer climates should prune Maximillian, swamp ( Helianthus angustifolius ), and willow leafed ( Helianthus salicifolius ) sunflowers to two-thirds of their original height in June.

      "title": "Avoid pruning after the first blooms appear.",
      "content": "Avoid pruning after the first blooms appear. Most perennial sunflower species bloom between mid and late summer. Gardeners should keep an eye on their plants at such times and refrain from pruning them after their buds start forming. [3] X Research source However, the rules are slightly different for late summer blooming varieties. Late summer blooming types should be pruned back when they reach between 1.5 to 2 feet (0.5 to 0.6 m) in height, because they will recover in a few weeks and bloom regardless of the cuts."

      "title": "Prune very tall varieties of sunflowers in June or July.",
      "content": "Prune very tall varieties of sunflowers in June or July. Maximilian sunflowers ( Helianthus maximiliani ) and Mexican sunflowers ( Tithonia diversifolia ) should be trimmed in June or July. This will reduce the sunflowersâ€™ size from their typical height of 9 feet (2.7 m) or greater to a much more manageable 4 feet (1.2 m). [4] X Research source Maximilian sunflowers can also be left standing through the winter months as food for the birds. If you choose to leave your tall sunflowers for the birds, they can be cut to the ground in the early spring to prepare the plant for new growth."
