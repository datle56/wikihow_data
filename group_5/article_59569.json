      "content": "Interferences can cause the Bluetooth pairing between your remote and TV to fail consistently. When the connection fails, the two will reconnect automatically, causing your remote to flash and a battery icon to appear on-screen. To fix this, simply remove any obstructions between your remote and Roku device. If your streaming player is hidden behind your TV or behind a closed door of a cabinet, unhide it. If you have lots of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices in the area, remove them. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Your current Bluetooth pairing can be weak. This troubleshooting step has worked for a few people, so there's no downside to trying this out for yourself! As soon as you see that your remote is acting weird (blinking green and showing the battery icon on screen, like it just paired), go to your TV's pairing section in Settings > Remotes & Devices . Your TV will be in pairing mode as it searches for available devices. Press the pairing button on your remote (it's on the back) for about 5-7 seconds until you see the LED on your remote turn green. You may need to try this process a few times to finally get a good pairing between your remote and TV. If you have a rechargeable remote, you'll need to repeat this pairing process after you recharge the batteries. [2] X Research source"

Anything that might be causing the remote to flash green should be fixed, but it isn't guaranteed to work for everyone. If you have a simple remote without removable batteries, press and hold the \"Reset\" button for about 30 seconds. You can find it on the back of the remote. If you have a voice remote with removable batteries, take them out, then disconnect your connected Roku device or TV from power for about 10 seconds. Press the \"Home\", \"Back\", and \"Pairing\" buttons on your remote at the same time and connect your Roku to power again. When the Roku starts and displays the home screen, release all the buttons on your remote, then reinsert the batteries."
