      "title": "Add a 20% buffer to your budget just to be safe.",
      "content": "Add a 20% buffer to your budget just to be safe. You can spend whatever you’d like, although you’re probably going to need around $300-$500 for a decent, 5- to 10-minute show. This should give you anywhere from 10-50 shells, depending on the ones you choose. Whatever amount you settle on, add 20% on top for additional supplies, backup fireworks, and phantom costs. [1] X Research source So, if you plan to buy $800 worth of fireworks, budget $960 for your show. If you really want to blow your audiences mind with quality, higher end fireworks and 20-minute show, plan on spending $2,000-3,000. Try to vary your show with at least 3-4 different effects, such as a combination of peony bursts, brocades, and waterfalls, with a multi-effect cake for the finale."

    {
      "title": "Choose quality and variety over quantity.",
      "content": "Choose quality and variety over quantity. Fireworks can be expensive, but you’ll have a more impressive show if you focus on a shorter show packed with exciting aerials rather than trying to stretch your budget into the longest show you can make. Choose shells that will make an impact on the crowd and which fire multiple shots rather than buying bottle rockets and Roman candles in bulk. Pro tip: Big professional shows are impressive because something is always going off in the sky to look at and there’s no repetition. Buy a variety of high-quality fireworks and plan to mix things up!"

      "title": "Use the very common peony shell for the most classic firework visual.",
      "content": "Use the very common peony shell for the most classic firework visual. Peonies are the shells most people think about when they imagine a fireworks show. They produce a spherical break of colored stars and are especially striking when several are used in quick succession. [2] X Research source The cost of a set of peony shells will average about $25 USD. [3] X Research source When to use these in your show: Peonies should be used throughout the entirety of your show unless you’re going for a very specific vibe. These are the bread-and-butter of a fireworks show."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use brocade shells for a vibrant and colorful opening to your show.",
      "content": "Use brocade shells for a vibrant and colorful opening to your show. Brocades trail sparks, which slowly cascade down in the shape of an umbrella. Use a combination of brocades and peonies for an eye-catching opening. [4] X Research source A 10-shot brocade shell starts at about $20 but can cost as much as $100 depending on the intensity and duration of the effects. When to use these in your show: Brocades are fun entry points for a show. They’re vibrant and colorful, but not very overwhelming."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use waterfalls for an elegant and subtle waterfall design.",
      "content": "Use waterfalls for an elegant and subtle waterfall design. Waterfall fireworks create, as the name suggests, a waterfall effect after the break. The stars only fall a short distance, but the effect can be breathtaking. [5] X Research source A 10 ft (3.0 m) waterfall firework should cost around $40 USD. When to use these in your show: These are ideal for the early- and mid-show period where you’re developing more elaborate light patterns and building momentum."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use crossettes for an eye-catching zig-zag explosion.",
      "content": "Use crossettes for an eye-catching zig-zag explosion. A crossette shoots several large stars which then break apart into smaller stars. This is accompanied by a loud crackling sound and creates a crisscross or grid pattern. These fireworks (alongside waterfalls) are the perfect way to add texture to your show. [6] X Research source You can find multiple-shot crossettes starting at about $15-$20 USD. When to use these in your show: These are the perfect mid-show option. They’re expressive and impressive but no so loud that they’ll make people think the show is over."

    {
      "title": "Use set pieces to convey a specific image or word.",
      "content": "Use set pieces to convey a specific image or word. Set pieces usually burn for about a minute, and they really impress the crowd. They are available in a wide variety of patterns, shapes, and words, including flags, hearts, or corporate logos. You can use these to catch the audience’s attention at the beginning, or you can incorporate it into your finale. [7] X Research source Since set pieces are usually custom-designed, these can cost several hundred dollars, but the impact is worth it if you have the room in your budget. When to use these in your show: These communicate theme (heart fireworks for a romantic Valentine’s day show, for example), so use them early to establish the show’s identity, then later to close on a meaningful note."

    {
      "title": "Use mortars for an explosive finale.",
      "content": "Use mortars for an explosive finale. Mortars are those extremely deep and loud blasts that usually punctuate the end of a firework show. They’re the loudest fireworks around, so incorporate them whenever you want to wake people up after quieter periods of the shop. Mortars are the most dangerous fireworks around because they’re so explosive, so feel free to skip the mortars if you’re worried about handling them. [8] X Research source A set of mortars will cost $50-150 depending on how big and loud you want to get. When to use these in your show: Mortars are the “big” fireworks. Save them for the end."

      "title": "Use cakes for a dramatic end to your show with multiple explosions at once.",
      "content": "Use cakes for a dramatic end to your show with multiple explosions at once. Cakes can be a great way to create a dramatic grand finale, since they fire multiple shells in a short amount of time. The labels will describe the effects that the cake contains. [9] X Research source Cakes can range in price from $25 to over $150, depending on their size and the effects they produce. When to use these in your show: Cakes are perfect for the end of your show. They might be a little much early on."

      "title": "Scout out your spot so you’ll know how much room you have for the show.",
      "content": "Scout out your spot so you’ll know how much room you have for the show. Fireworks should not come within 25 feet (7.6 m) of any overhead object, and your spectators should be located at least 50 feet (15 m) from your fireworks. [10] X Research source The minimum distance for spectators may vary depending on your location. For instance, in Missouri, the distance is 70 feet per inch (roughly 10 meters for every centimeter) of the internal mortar diameter of the largest shell you will be firing. In this case, a show closing with a mortar that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter would require a spectator distance of 140 feet (43 m) [11] X Research source Make sure you pick a flat, open area that doesn’t have any dry grass, dead leaves, nearby buildings, trees, or other fire hazards.

      "content": "Orient your fireworks so the audience isn’t downwind. The wind is the single biggest factor in the safety and enjoyability of your fireworks show. Use a wind sock or feel the wind to determine where the wind will carry the ash and smoke. Set up the audience so the wind is behind them when they’re facing the show. If the wind is blowing towards the audience, they’ll get smoke in their eyes and lungs which can make enjoying the show impossible. They may also get singed by falling embers."

For the most impact during your show, rotate your fireworks effects and plan for as few gaps as possible. [13] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source Most fireworks effects should be rotated at least every minute or so. Plan to only fire a few shells at a time. If you fire too many, the effects will be lost."

      "title": "Build or purchase a trough to hold your fireworks.",
      "content": "Build or purchase a trough to hold your fireworks. A trough is a structure filled with sand or soft earth in which fireworks can be safely positioned. You can build your trough out of plywood or use large crates. Make sure your sand or dirt is free from any rocks or other items which can become dangerous during an explosion. [14] X Research source Reinforce or brace your trough with brackets or heavy lumber. Secure it with stakes or spikes, or use an A-frame to prevent it from tipping over. If you have a lot of fireworks, you may need more than one trough. Measure the size of your trough, then create a rough drawing of how your fireworks will be spaced out. Use this to determine whether you will need more than one trough. Alternatively, you can build a simple launch pad out of plywood: start with a simple plywood base and use wood screws to drill a few pieces of scrap wood into the plywood to support the fireworks."

      "title": "Place your shells in the order and direction you want them to fire.",
      "content": "Place your shells in the order and direction you want them to fire. Line up your shells in the order you want them to explode and bury them between halfway and two-thirds deep in the sand, lined up in the order you want them to explode. This will help ensure they are stable enough to fire straight from the direction they are pointed. Make sure to leave the fuse uncovered. You may want to bury the shells so that they are slightly angled (about 15°) away from the crowd. You should never fire shells over the crowd’s head, as sparks may fall to the ground and cause injury. [15] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source Read the label on each shell carefully so you will understand how far the fireworks will travel before they explode. Many fireworks have a \"bury line\" that will show you how deep to plant them in the sand."

      "content": "Set up smaller fireworks in front and big items farthest from the audience. Your smaller fireworks will have the most impact if they’re fired closer to your audience, while your larger ones should be given more room so they can be seen well. Make sure you are still allowing the minimum space required by your local laws between the fireworks and the audience."

      "title": "Connect your fireworks with a fuse.",
      "content": "Connect your fireworks with a fuse. Whether you use light your fireworks by hand or with an electric detonator, you should connect your fireworks with long fuses. You can connect several shells to a single fuse, with the length of the fuse creating pauses between firings. You can purchase firework fuses online starting at $5 for a 10 ft (3.0 m) fuse. To determine how much fuse to use between fireworks, cut a 6 in (15 cm) piece of fuse and light one end. (Be sure you're nowhere near your shells when you do this.) Time how long it takes to burn all the way through, then use that as your guideline for spacing your fireworks. [17] X Research source To safely light your fireworks, use a long-handled lighter to ignite the fuse. Light only the very tip, then back away at least 20 feet (6.1 m) and wait until each firework is finished before you light the next one."

      "title": "Use an electric detonator if you don't want to light the fuses by hand.",
      "content": "Use an electric detonator if you don't want to light the fuses by hand. Electric detonators are often used for larger displays as they offer precise control. You can purchase them where you buy high-end fireworks or at a hardware store that sells electrical equipment, and they can cost anywhere from $15 to $60 for a basic model, or as much as $200 for professional-grade detonators. Stand back about 20 feet (6.1 m) when you detonate the fuse."

Having plenty of water will be useful in case of a stray spark or for disposing misfired shells. [18] X Research source To make sure you can quickly reach the water if you need it, keep a large bucket at each corner of your display trough, or have one fire extinguisher on each side. This is even more important to do when you shoot fireworks on hot, dry nights. It is even possible to use a spray mist of cool water on the top of each mortar to cool the shells a little bit to further reduce the risk of a misfire, but be careful not to put your head directly over the mortar when you do this."

      "content": "Purchase the necessary safety and preparation supplies. Lighting fireworks can be fun, but it can also be very dangerous if you don’t take the necessary safety precautions. Make sure to have the following list of specialized safety gear on hand so that you can pull off the show safely. Fire extinguisher : Modern fireworks are unlikely to cause fires, but it’s possible. Better safe than sorry. Fireproof gloves : You’ll be lighting a lot of fireworks and you may accidentally burn yourself if you don’t have the proper gloves. Head lamp (optional) : If your show will take place in the dark, a head lamp will make it easy to see what you’re doing. Blowtorch or punk sticks : You cannot run a professional fireworks show with a normal lighter. It just takes too long to spark. Get a blowtorch or punk sticks (designed specifically for firework shows)."

Wind can cause sparks from fireworks to behave erratically, potentially causing fires to nearby structures or injury to your audience. If the forecast calls for winds higher than 11-16 knots, or 12–18 miles per hour (19–29 km/h), you may want to take larger shells out of the show or reschedule it altogether. You don't have to cancel your show because of light rain as long as you protect your fuses with plastic bags, but you might want to delay the show for the comfort of the crowd."

Since fireworks can present a safety hazard, you might be prohibited from using certain kinds depending on where you live, or you may be required to purchase a permit. [22] X Research source For instance, although most states in the U.S. allow the use of consumer fireworks (also known as Class C or 1.4G), New Jersey prohibits the use of aerial fireworks and firecrackers. [23] X Research source Some cities don't allow any fireworks. You may also be limited on when you can use the fireworks. For instance, in Indiana, fireworks may not be used after 11:00 p.m. or before 9:00 a.m., except on holidays, when the time is extended to midnight."
