      "title": "Leave him a sweet message to start his day.",
      "content": "Leave him a sweet message to start his day. Waking up and heading off to work, school, or errands can be a drag. Help break up your boyfriend’s monotony by leaving a warm reminder that you’re thinking about him. It can be as grand as a poem or as simple as a “good luck today.” If you’re opting for a handwritten message, place your note somewhere you know he’ll look in the morning like his cereal box or car dashboard. “Morning sunshine! I’m smiling just thinking about you!” “Have a great day at work xx” “I just woke up and I miss you already.” “My morning commute is easier with you on my mind.” “Between you and a billion dollars, I’d pick you every time.” “I love you to the rising sun and back.” “Thank you for being you.” “The universe spoiled me when it gave me you. Now go kick butt today!” “Te amo. Te veo esta noche.”"

      "content": "Put a kind thought in his lunchbox. The middle of the day can be tough. You’re tired from working hard and you’ve still got a few hours to go. Make your boyfriend’s lunch a little sweeter by putting a kind message in his sandwich bag or lunch pail. Or, if he goes out to eat, send him a text when you know he takes his lunch break. “This meal was made with love (and a whole lot of butter)!” “I put my heart into this meal. Hope it’s not too messy!” [1] X Research source “You’re all that and this half-eaten bag of chips I found in the pantry.” “I hope your day is as sweet as this cookie I made for you.” “My stomach’s a sanctuary when I see you, because you give me so many butterflies.” “Just saying I love you!” “You make my heart (patty) melt!” “Je t’adore. Bon appetit!” “Enjoy this treat, because you’re mine!” “All I need is you by my side. And all you need is protein. So I made you some turkey.”"

      "content": "Slip some loving words under his pillow. A lovely handwritten note can be just what your boyfriend needs after a long day.

You make my world go round, and I’m dizzy with love for you.” [2] X Research source “Just think: each night’s just one step closer to growing old together.” “I love you more and more each day.” “I can’t wait to see you again tomorrow!” “When I fall asleep, I can’t wait to wake up.

      "title": "Use your wit and humor to make him smile.",
      "content": "Use your wit and humor to make him smile. Who doesn’t love a good laugh? Write a kind, but playful joke or loving but groan-inducing pun about your man and leave it in a place he won’t expect (like in the microwave, or on his rearview mirror). The added element of surprise will only make your note funnier and sweeter. “Nobody is perfect, but you’re pretty darn close.” “I can’t believe how not sick of you I am.” “I love you in more ways than you can count. Unless you can count to 4,972.” “You’re the one I want to text when I’m drunk.” “You’re the reason I get up in the morning.

      "title": "Leave a sensual thought on his bathroom mirror.",
      "content": "Leave a sensual thought on his bathroom mirror. Equally creative, suggestive, and thoughtful, next time your boyfriend takes a shower, ask him to leave the door unlocked. Then, when the mirror is fogged up, quietly come in and write a message to him using your finger. If you need ideas, remember that he’s looking at his own reflection. “Wow! Someone’s been working out.” “Hubba hubba! How did I find such a catch?” “I like this suit on you ;)” “My heart is still skipping a beat thinking about last night.” “You. Me. Your room. Now.” “Mirror mirror on the wall, who’s the hottest of them all? Spoiler alert: it’s you.”"

      "title": "Write one of the many reasons you adore him.",
      "content": "Write one of the many reasons you adore him. “I love you” is an enormously special phrase, but sometimes we take it for granted. Get specific and tell him one unique reason he makes your heart sing. “I love you” messages are best if they’re handwritten, but you can leave them anywhere: his backpack, his drawers, his coat pocket. The choice is yours! “…You make me feel like my best self.” “…Every day feels like an adventure with you.” “…I never feel judged around you.” “…You inspire me.” “…You’re my happily ever after.” “…Of the way you make me feel when you look at me.” “ …You’re always honest with me.” “…You love me even on my bad days.” “…You make me laugh harder than anyone.” “…You helped me find the light in the world.” “…You make me believe in myself. And I believe in you.” “…Even cold days feel warm when I’m with you.” [5] X Research source “…I mean, have you seen you? How could I not?” “…You make me feel understood.” “…You don’t care what other people think of you But spoiler alert: we all like you a lot.”"

      "title": "Send a loving, emoji-filled text.",
      "content": "Send a loving, emoji-filled text. Sometimes words just don’t fully capture our spectrum of emotion and affection. Luckily, smartphones offer plenty of adoring, digital options. Get creative by sending faces and icons that represent the exact wonderful way your boyfriend makes you feel. “You just make me 🥰😍 inside.” “Life without you is like a 🍪 without 🥛.” “You’ve 🔒up my ♥️ and thrown away the 🔑.” “You have 🍕my heart.” “You’re my 👻 thing” “💗💓💕💖”"

      "title": "Use a quote or proverb from a writer you like.",
      "content": "Use a quote or proverb from a writer you like. Your kind words don’t necessarily have to come from you. Find a sweet line in a book or a movie that reminds you of him, write it down, and place the note somewhere you know he’ll read it like his car or his bed. “If I know what love is, it is because of you.” - Herman Hesse “I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.” - Angelita Lim [6] X Research source “I love that you’re the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.” - Nora Ephron [7] X Research source \"To be your friend was all I ever wanted.

      "title": "Show your affection through the words of a song.",
      "content": "Show your affection through the words of a song. As Longfellow wrote, music is the language of love, of the soul. So why not bare your soul by writing out a sweet note from a song your boyfriend likes? Draw in some music notes or instruments to make full use of your paper. Extra points if it’s a song you listened to together! “If it’s wrong to love you, then my heart just won’t let me be right.” - Mariah Carey \"You’re the closest to heaven I’ll ever be.” - Goo Goo Dolls “I was blessed, because I was loved by you.” - Céline Dion “It’s always better when we’re together.” - Jack Johnson “ I hope you don’t mind that I put down in words how wonderful life is when you’re in the world.” - Elton John\""
