      "content": "It has its benefits, but it won’t send you running to the bathroom. Orange juice with pulp (chunks of the fruit) is the most fiber-rich variety—according to certain research, a glass of this particular OJ nets you around 5% of your body’s required fiber intake for the day. Within this small amount of fiber is pectin, a type of soluble fiber found in produce. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So, orange juice definitely won’t give the immediate urge to poop, but it does offer a little bit of fiber (assuming your juice isn’t pulp-free). There are plenty of other reasons to enjoy orange juice besides its fiber content! OJ, for instance, is a great source of nutrients like vitamin C, potassium, and copper. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oranges also have flavinoids (special chemicals) like naringin (and naringenin, by extension), which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities.

      "content": "Prune juice Ironically enough, it’s not just fiber that makes prune juice so effective at clearing your bowels—it’s sorbitol, a type of sugar alcohol. Similar to insoluble fiber, sorbitol stays intact throughout the digestive process, so your body wants to get rid of it promptly. [6] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Prunes are also a good source of sorbitol, but prune juice might be easier to gulp down quickly if you aren’t a fan of the physical fruit. Mixing prune juice and OJ together might make the drink a little tastier if you aren’t a huge a fan of prune juice."

      "content": "Fiber falls into 2 categories: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber breaks down in water, which gives it a gummy-like consistency. When incorporated with your stool, soluble fiber helps soften it up so it passes smoothly. [17] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, doesn’t break down in water but rather gives a little extra bulk and structure to your stool, which makes it easier to pass. [18] X Research source Foods like oatmeal, blueberries, and apples are all great sources of soluble fiber, while whole grain bread products, brown rice, kale, and skin-on fruits are fantastic sources of insoluble fiber. Some foods, like beans and walnuts, are good sources of both fiber types."
