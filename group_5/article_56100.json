      "title": "Mark the amp’s mounting holes on your vehicle’s floor where you want to mount it.",
      "content": "Mark the amp’s mounting holes on your vehicle’s floor where you want to mount it. Choose a place that has flat floors, such as your trunk, in the passenger seat footwell, or under the rear seats. Check underneath your vehicle to make sure there aren’t any wires or pipes on the other side of where you want the amp. Hold the amp still as you mark the locations of the mounting holes in the corners with a marker or pencil. [2] X Research source Avoid mounting amps vertically or to speaker boxes since they may jostle around more and get damaged. Make sure the place where you want the amp has good airflow because the amp will generate heat that could damage the internal electronics if it gets too hot."
