      "title": "Use a hard fruit or vegetable, such as an apple or zucchini.",
      "content": "Use a hard fruit or vegetable, such as an apple or zucchini. Apples tend to be a favorite because they're the right density and readily available. If you don't have a fresh apple sitting around the house, you can usually pick one up pretty cheap at a nearby convenience store. [1] X Research source Away from home? Many hotels have fresh fruit available for free in their lobbies, including apples. If you feel like getting creative, there are plenty of fruits and vegetables that can be converted into a pipe the same way—you might try butternut squash, cantaloupe, eggplant, or a pear. Choose a super fresh, juicy apple if you want to taste some of the sweetness of the apple as you smoke. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Carve a bowl in the top of the fruit.",
      "content": "Carve a bowl in the top of the fruit. The size of this will depend on how much you want to try to pack into a single bowl, but you usually don't need it to be very big. Keep the size of your fruit in mind as well. You can use pretty much any sharp object to cut into the top if you need to hollow it out some more. If you're able to twist the stem of an apple all the way off, you might find that you don't need to cut into the top at all—the natural depression provides enough space for you to pack enough to smoke. If you're able to leave the skin on your fruit or vegetable, you can pack a bowl without needing aluminum foil. Otherwise, the juice of the fruit will dampen your stash and make it hard to light."

      "title": "Cut a hole from one side of the fruit to the other.",
      "content": "Cut a hole from one side of the fruit to the other. A skewer, metal straw, or even a disposable ink pen (just take out the ink first) will work to poke a hole from one side of the apple to the other. Hollow objects such as pens or straws work best because they also capture the debris that's removed from the apple so you don't have to clean up behind yourself later to get a good, clean smoke. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut a hole from the top of the fruit down to the center.",
      "content": "Cut a hole from the top of the fruit down to the center. Starting from the top, where you've carved out a spot for your bowl to be, cut another hole straight down until you meet up with the cross-channel you already created. At this point, you're almost done! [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow through the hole to clear it out.",
      "content": "Blow through the hole to clear it out. You shouldn't have any problem with the hole that goes from one side to the other because you would've pushed the debris all the way through. But there might still be some chunks left from the other channel down from the top. Make sure you can feel your breath coming through both the carb and the hole for the bowl. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Line the bowl with aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Line the bowl with aluminum foil. If you didn't dig out the top of the fruit or vegetable you used so the peel is still mostly intact, this might not be necessary. If you do line the bowl, poke a hole in the aluminum foil at the bottom that matches the hole you made in your \"pipe.\" [6] X Research source Make sure the fruit or vegetable you're using isn't coming into contact with the stuff you're smoking. If your smoking material gets wet, you'll have a hard time lighting it. You can also make a small mouthpiece with aluminum foil to fit into the mouth hole—just tear off a small piece and roll it into a skinny tube. It'll help catch some of the ash and debris when you smoke for a cleaner hit. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pack your bowl and smoke it. Take whatever you've got to smoke and fill the bowl you carved out in the top of your piece of fruit. To smoke, light your bowl while you inhale from the mouthpiece. Keep your thumb over the hole on the side to draw the smoke in, then release your thumb to clear the \"chamber\" inside the fruit.

      "content": "Find a book with thin pages, such as a Bible. Use the blank pages, usually found at the front and back of a book, first. If there aren't any of those, use pages with as little ink as possible just in case the ink is harmful. [9] X Research source A Bible is an easy choice if you happen to be traveling, since most hotel rooms have a free copy of the Bible in them. It doesn't have to be a book! Other types of thin paper work too—and some even work better. For example, if you have access to a cigarette, all you have to do is empty out the tobacco and use that. Thicker paper can work in a pinch, but generally speaking, you want your paper to be as thin as possible so that you're burning less paper and your cigarette burns smoothly and cleanly."

      "title": "Grind",
      "content": "Grind the leaves that you want to smoke. Cigarettes are typically filled with very finely ground material so that they'll smoke cleanly and smoothly. If you don't have a grinder handy, try to break it up as small as you can with your fingers. [10] X Research source Make sure you de-stem, if necessary—stems can poke through the paper. Get rid of any seeds as well, which could pop when lit. This also gives you an idea of how much paper you'll need to roll this up so you can smoke it."

If you want your paper to be about the same size as a standard rolling paper, make it about 2 in (5.1 cm) long and about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) wide. Changing the width of the paper affects how wide your resulting handmade cigarette will be. [11] X Research source Be careful not to make it too thick, or it might be difficult for the paper to hold up as you smoke it. You also want to be mindful of how much you have to fill it with."

Adjust it so that there's room to twist off both ends of the paper when you've rolled it. [12] X Research source Arrange it as evenly as possible. If there's a bulge, your cigarette won't smoke evenly."

Roll the shake down until the front edge of your paper can only go around the shake once. Tuck the front edge in and then continue rolling until you have a tight, even cigarette shape. [13] X Research source Keep your fingertips in the ends so that your shake doesn't fall out while you're rolling and sealing the cigarette."

Your saliva will act as a glue to seal the cigarette so that it holds together while you smoke it. [14] X Research source Be careful not to get the paper too wet, or your cigarette might smoke unevenly or even go out. When it's sealed, twist the ends to close the cigarette entirely so you don't have to hold your fingers in the ends anymore."

Get the ink chamber and spring, which you can go ahead and throw away if you don't plan on using the pen again. [17] X Research source If the pen doesn't have an end that pops off, you might have to find something to cut the end of the pen off. You need the end to be completely open."

      "content": "Place the metal tip back in the pen backwards. Put the narrow end of the metal tip into one end of the barrel of the pen. Push it in as far as possible to create a seal between the pen barrel and the metal tip. [18] X Research source Because of the way the pen is made, the tip might not stay securely. If you want a tighter seal, use a lighter to melt the plastic at the end of the barrel slightly so it will conform to the size of the tip."

      "content": "Use the metal pin tip as a bowl. Fill the bowl with whatever you've got to smoke. Keep in mind this is typically only enough for one or two hits. Tap it in carefully so you don't break the seal between the pen barrel and the tip. [19] X Research source You typically don't want a super fine grind with this kind of pipe or you might suck it through the opening when you smoke it."

      "content": "Inhale through the other end of the pen to smoke. At this point, the pen smokes just like any pipe. Put your mouth around the other end of the pen and inhale as you light the bowl. Keep in mind that depending on the seal and how tight you packed your bowl, you might have to hold the pen practically vertical to keep everything where it's supposed to be. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean out an empty plastic bottle. Any bottle will work for this, including old water bottles or soda bottles. Generally, a smaller bottle will be easier for you to hit—it takes a lot of lung capacity to clear the chamber of a larger bottle. Rinse out the bottle thoroughly and toss the cap (you won't need it). [21] X Research source Smoking out of plastic can be hazardous to your health. Only use this as a last resort if you're in a pinch and have no other options."

This hole is where you'll stick your bowl, so it needs to be a little wide. [22] X Research source You can use the barrel of an empty pen to mount your bowl to the bottle. Then, the barrel would go through this hole straight into the bottle."

Leave a little bit of a funnel of aluminum foil in the center of the bowl so you can stick it down into the bottle. Use a sewing needle or similar object to poke at least one tiny hole in the bottom of your bowl so you can inhale the smoke. [23] X Research source While this can be handy in a pinch, limit smoking in aluminum foil because it can add dangerous chemicals to the smoke that you inhale."

Air will still get through, but not as much. Paper, plastic wrap, or even aluminum will work. You might also need a rubber band to secure the cover over the end. [27] X Research source Depending on how long the tube is, you might want to stuff some toilet paper in the bottom to take up some space and make your pipe easier to hit. [28] X Research source You can also simply cover the end with one hand and hold the pipe that way while you light it with the other hand. [29] X Research source"

Depending on how you want your bowl to sit, you might want to make this hole a little bit bigger. [30] X Research source If you want your bowl to sit up on the surface of the tube, this can be a relatively small hole. Make a larger hole if you're planning on packing the bowl inside the tube."

You might want to twist or fold it around so that it actually looks like a round bowl that sits above the surface of the cardboard. You can also simply use the aluminum foil to cover the hole with a small depression of foil in the hole where your bowl will sit.
