For the sake of the \"ritual,\" make sure that everyone drops the shot in at the same time, and that everyone is ready to drink their Jager Bomb.

Drop the shot into the glass from directly above the rim of the glass. If you drop the shot glass from too high up, you will increase the risk of breaking the glass or spilling the drink."
