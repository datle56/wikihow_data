Shuffle the cards and give each player 3 cards for the first round. [1] X Research source Each of the 5 suits has cards numbered 3–10, a Jack, a Queen, and a King. The 6 Jokers in the deck act as wild cards and count as any suit or value. Additionally, each round has wild cards equal to the number of cards in your hand. For the first round, all 3s are also considered wild. If you want to try playing Five Crowns with more than 7 players, just shuffle together 2 Five Crowns decks. [2] X Research source"

You may use any number of Jokers or the round’s wild cards to fill in empty spaces in a run. [4] X Research source Example: If you’re playing the first round where 3s are wild, then 10♦, 3★, and Q♦ is considered a run."

      "content": "Take turns drawing a card and then discarding a card. The player to the left of the dealer takes the first turn of the game. Choose between taking the top card of the discard pile or the top card of the deck to add to your hand. At the end of your turn, choose a card from your hand to put face-up on top of the discard pile. [6] X Research source After a player takes their turn, the person to their left takes the next turn the same way. Before you take a card, look at what you already have in your hand to see what you need to complete a run or book. For example, if you have 6★, 7★, and 9♦, you may take a 5★ to make a run or a 6♦ to try for a book."

      "content": "Go out for the round if you can play all your cards to runs or books. After discarding a card, check if all of the remaining cards form runs or books. If they can, then you can go out by laying your cards face-up in front of you. [7] X Research source During the first round, you’ll either go out with a single run or a single book. In later rounds when you have more cards, you may split your hand into multiple runs or books. For example, in a round where you have 7 cards, you may go out with a book of 3 cards and a run of 4 cards."

      "title": "Take 1 more turn to play runs and books after someone goes out.",
      "content": "Take 1 more turn to play runs and books after someone goes out. When a player goes out, every other person gets one more chance to draw and discard. If they’re able to form any runs or books, they can immediately lay them face-up. After everyone takes their last turn, the round ends. [8] X Research source While players normally have to wait until they can use all their cards in runs or books to play them, you can play any runs or books you have available on your last turn, even if you have leftover cards in your hand. Strategy Tip: If you have a Joker or wild card in your hand but you’re unable to use it in a run or book (like if you have 6★, 7♣, and a Joker), discard it. Jokers and wild cards make you gain a lot of points at the end of the round, so it’s best to avoid being stuck with one."

Numbered cards are worth their face value, Jacks are 11 points, Queens are 12 points, Kings are 13 points, and Jokers are 50 points. The wild cards for the current round are worth 20 points instead of their face value. Check the cards that are left in each player’s hand and tally up their total for the round on a piece of paper. [9] X Research source Example: In the first round, if a player has a 3★, 7♣, and Q♦, they’ll earn 39 points. The player that goes out during the round earns 0 points because they have no cards left in their hand."
