      "content": "When trading, you will potentially give/get more than one card. This depends on the rarity of the trade. Note that you will be giving/getting multiples of the same card (i.e. if you trade an Epic card, you'll be giving 10 of that card to your trade partner. Likewise, you'll then get 10 copies of the card you traded for). The number of cards you'll get/give are as follows: Common: 250 cards Rare: 50 cards Epic: 10 cards Legendary : 1 card"

      "content": "You can use Trade Tokens to trade cards with your clanmates. To access the Trade screen, tap Request Card then Trade . From this screen you can select a card to request. There are a few things to know when trading with another player: You can only trade for a card rarity that matches your token rarity (for example, if you have a Rare Trade Token you can only trade for a Rare card). After you request a card, you can select up to 4 cards of the same rarity as your Trade Token and requested card to exchange for your requested card. When accepting a trade, you must have a Trade Token plus one of the cards requested by the other user. If you get a card in trade that you already have maxed out (or that you have enough cards to max it out), you'll get Gold from the trade instead."

When initiating an NPC Trader trade, you'll select one of three pre-selected cards to give the Trader. Then you will select one of three pre-selected cards to get from the Trader. You'll need one Trade Token of corresponding rarity to complete a trade with the NPC Trader. You can reroll the three pre-selected cards you can give to or get from the trader for 10 Gems. The Trader will only offer Epic trades on Sundays, and will only offer Legendary trades if you have 2,000 or more Trophies. The Trader's deals reset at midnight local time."
