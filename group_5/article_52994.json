      "content": "Accept that you may feel different than your friends. You can get your period at ages 8-16. You normally would get it at ages 11-14. You may be the first one of your friends to start your period, which can put you in a strange situation. You are still the same age as your friends, but you are dealing with some issues that your friends may not understand. Continue to hang out with friends your age and do the things that you have always enjoyed doing with them. You are still a kid. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If your friends do not understand what you are going through, do not talk with them about your period. Have these conversations with your parents or other female family members. Just talk to your friends about the things you would usually talk about. If you are not feeling well because of your period, you can tell your friends that you are sick without going into all of the details. This can be really hard at first, but it will become easier once your friends start getting their periods."

Talk to your parent about how to handle your period in different situations. [3] X Research source What will you do if you start your period at a friend's house?

      "title": "Consider using pads at first.",
      "content": "Consider using pads at first. Many people believe it is best to use pads instead of tampons when you first start your period. Pads are worn outside of your body, and you can stick them in your underwear. A tampon must be inserted inside of your vagina. [4] X Research source Pads are much easier to change, and it will be easier for you to tell when it is time to change your pad. Some girls alternate between using pads and tampons. [5] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Talk to a parent to help you decide which option is best for you. You can try both pads and tampons to see which one you are most comfortable with. Tampons may be more comfortable for playing sports and going swimming."

These cramps can be painful and distract you from doing your normal activities. If your cramps bother you, ask your parents about taking some pain medication. You will want to take pain medication before you go to school and possibly while you are at school. [6] X Research source Your parents can help you decide the best dose and timing to take your pain medicine. Ask your female family members if they experience cramps. You are more likely to have them if your relatives do. Placing a heating pad on your lower abdomen and/or back can also help with cramps."

      "content": "Write in a journal. You may feel all types of emotions about your period. Are you upset that your period has already started? Do you feel different from your friends now that you have your period? All of the emotions you are experiencing are completely normal.

      "content": "Do something fun. Getting your period at an early age makes you feel less like a kid. Although managing your period is a new responsibility, you can still do all of the things you liked to do before. Focus on things that make you happy instead of thinking about your period. Watch a funny movie or go outside and play. Spend time with your friends and talk about things that are not related to your period."

[9] X Research source Keep a pair of pants and underwear in your locker or backpack. You may also ask your school nurse or guidance counselor to keep your change of clothes in their office. You can also keep a shirt or jacket that you can wrap around your waist if you want to hide an accident. Also avoid wearing light colored pants and skirts when you are on your period if you don't feel comfortable with the possibility of getting blood on your clothes. Accidents are easier to spot on lighter colors."

      "title": "Change your pad",
      "content": "Change your pad at school. Tampons and/or pads should be changed every 4-8 hours. You may be worried about changing your pad at school and feel like everyone can hear what you are doing in the bathroom. If you are worried about other people hearing you, change your mindset. What you are doing in the bathroom is no one's business but yours. Be brave. If you are in the bathroom with other people, remember that there are a lot of noises going on in there. Changing your pad probably sounds louder to you than it does to everyone else. If you need to excuse yourself from class to change your pad, go up to your teacher and say that you need to go to the bathroom for a \"girl issue.\" Your teacher will know what you are talking about. There should be a special trashcan in the bathroom stall for you to throw away your pad or tampon. If there is not, wrap up your used pad in tissue paper and throw it away in the trashcan outside of your stall. You may also go to the school nurse and ask to use a single stall bathroom."

If you feel comfortable, you may want to tell a friend that you can trust. This person can be a source of support for you. You do not have to tell your friends that your period has started if you do not want to. This is private information and it's up to you who you do and don't tell. Be careful who you tell. If your friend gossips about other people, this should not be the person you tell. Find a friend that you have shared secrets and personal information with before."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor. A health care professional is the best place to ask questions and learn about your period. You might wonder if what you are experiencing is normal. Some girls feel more comfortable talking to a doctor than a family member. If you have not started your period, your doctor can give you a physical exam and estimate when you may start. Talk about any of your worries or concerns. For example, if your period is erratic (doesn't come regularly), heavy, or causes you pain, it is a good idea to talk this sort of problem through with someone who has answers. Make list of questions that you would like to ask and take your list with you to your doctor's appointment. This will help you remember your questions if you get nervous."

Think about a female teacher, school nurse, or guidance counselor that you feel comfortable with. This person can be a resource for you if you need some help while you are at school. It is important for you to identify this person before you need any help so you will know exactly where to go. Your parent could send a note to this person that lets them know that you have started your period and may come to them if you need some assistance while you are at school."
