      "content": "Moonstones and opals are two different gemstones. Although some moonstones look similar to opals, opals are more valuable and unique. No two opals are alike, so they come in a broad range of colors and patterns. Moonstones are typically colorless or white, but they have an optical phenomenon known as adularescence (Schiller’s Effect), which gives the stone its unique shimmer. [1] X Research source People often describe a moonstone as a drop of water glowing underneath the moonlight. Opal is the official birthstone for October, while moonstone is one of three birthstones for June (pearl and alexandrite are the other two).

Moonstone belongs to the feldspar group, one of the largest mineral groups on Earth, and it’s composed of albite, orthoclase, and feldspar minerals. [3] X Research source Opal, on the other hand, belongs to the Silicates Quartz group and is formed by water and silica. [4] X Research source The chemical formula of moonstone is KAl 3 O 8 , while the chemical formula of opal is SiO 2 .nH 2 O. [5] X Research source"

India and Sri Lanka are home to the highest quality moonstones, but other moonstone varieties have been discovered in Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Madagascar, Mexico, and the United States. [6] X Research source Opals are also mined globally, but Australia is home to 95% of the world’s finest opals. [7] X Research source Opal is the official national gemstone of Australia."

      "content": "Moonstones are usually clear or white, while opals are colorful. There are only 3 varieties of moonstone: transparent, translucent, and opaque. [8] X Research source In contrast, opals come in a variety of colors and finishes: white, black, brown, purple, orange, red, and yellow (just to name a few). [9] X Research source Opal coloring is determined by the arrangement of silica spheres in the gemstone. [10] X Research source Inclusions, or materials trapped during gem formation, give moonstones their milky, white finish. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Moonstones have a distinct shimmering effect, unlike opals. Moonstones have a unique property known as adularescence (Schiller’s Effect), which gives a subtle, reflective sheen to the gem. Light enters the stone, interacts with its layers, and scatters, creating a glowing optical effect. [12] X Research source Opals have a phenomenon known as play of color (opalescence): light reflects off the silica spheres inside the gem, giving opals fiery flashes of color. [13] X Research source"

[14] X Research source Opal is generally stable, but intense heat or light can create fracture lines. [15] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source Moonstone can withstand harsh light, but it’s highly prone to breakage: most manufacturers set moonstones into pendants or earrings because they’re less prone to damage (vs rings).

For women, moonstone activates connection to the divine feminine, and it’s considered a powerful healer for the female cycle.

It cultivates empathy toward yourself and others, allowing you to process situations from a different perspective. Opal improves psychic abilities and creativity. Having an opal nearby opens the mind to its inner creativity, encouraging new ideas and insight. [20] X Research source Moonstone is a wonderful option for individuals who are more sensitive or stressed than others.

      "content": "Opals are typically higher value than moonstones. Moonstones range from $5-$50 per carat, but stronger adularescence translates to higher value: intense blue adularescence is the most valuable, followed by milky white. [22] X Research source There are numerous factors that contribute to opal pricing, such as play-of-color and pattern. In general, common white opal ranges from $10-$150 per carat, while the Australian black opal starts at $60 per carat. [23] X Research source Black opals are considered the most rare and valuable type of opal, with some selling up to $10,000 per carat. [24] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a moonstone that is free from inclusions. Although it depends on personal preference, most people prefer colorless moonstones that have an intense blue adularescence. Inclusion in a stone refers to anything that breaks the clarity of the stone. Avoid moonstones that have a yellow, green, or brown background tint, and ensure your gem is free from tiny tension cracks (also known as “centipedes”). [25] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source Select a stone that is uniform and rounded: flat moonstones don’t display sheen well and are less valuable.

      "content": "Evaluate the color, clarity, and pattern of opals. There are endless color choices, but make sure to choose an opal that is rich and vibrant. Translucent or transparent clarity showcases the color and pattern best, but some people prefer opaque opals. In terms of pattern, large, tightly-arranged patches of color are more desirable than small, scattered dots.

If you buy an opal ring, you must re-facet it in a few years or replace it entirely. [27] X Research source It’s important to treat your opal jewelry with care so you can extend its wear-time. To clean opal rings , wet a cloth with warm, soapy water and gently wipe the stone."
