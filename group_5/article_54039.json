While it’s not a guarantee, getting outside and getting your blood pumping for half an hour each day certainly can’t hurt. Other studies suggest that moderate exercise can help improve sexual performance, and a 30-minute walk fits the bill of “moderate exercise.” [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Pilates can also help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Try exercises such as knee fallouts. Lie on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Flex your pelvic floor muscles and slowly lower one knee sideways towards the ground, then bring your knee back. Repeat the motion with your other knee. Aim for 10 reps on each side to really build up your pelvic floor. Join a local Pilates studio to take classes or look online for video classes you can try. [4] X Research source Another Pilates movement that can help is the supine foot raise. Start by lying on the floor with both knees bent and your feet flat on the ground. Squeeze your pelvic floor muscles and lift 1 foot straight into the air to create a 45-degree angle. Hold it for a few seconds, then gently place it back on the ground. Repeat the motion with your other leg and shoot for about 10 reps on each side. Try the classic bridge exercise, too. In Pilates, it’s known as the pelvic curl. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the ground. Flex your pelvic floor muscles and lift your butt into the air so the weight of your body is on your shoulders. Hold it for a few seconds then slowly lie back down on the ground. Repeat the exercise up to 10 times."
