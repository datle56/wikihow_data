      "content": "Bumble allows you to “like” 25 profiles per day. There’s no officially stated number, but users report that they get to “swipe right,” or like, 25 other profiles per day. Bumble says this is because limiting the number of likes users can give helps users be more careful with their swipes, making for more careful and genuine connections. [1] X Research source Users can get unlimited likes by purchasing Bumble Premium or Bumble Boost, paid services that offer extra features like backtracking on swipes and receiving a spotlight on your profile. Dating apps don’t limit the number of “dislikes” or left swipes you can use, Bumble included. Note that “likes” are different from “matches.” A “like” is simply a swipe right. If both users swipe right on each other, then that’s a “match.”"

      "content": "On Bumble, likes reset 24 hours after your last like. Bumble confirms that the limit resets 24 hours after you send your 25th like. [2] X Research source That means if you make your 25th swipe at 7pm, your likes will reset at 7pm the next day, and you’re ready to start looking at profiles again. Compare this to other dating apps, where users report that Tinder allows 25 swipes every 12 hours, and Hinge allows 8 likes which reset at 4 am each day. On Bumble, likes last until the other person either swipes left, or swipes right to match with you, but matches expire 24 hours after they’re made if the woman doesn’t respond in that time.

      "title": "How many people “like” you depends on your location and profile.",
      "content": "How many people “like” you depends on your location and profile. There’s no real answer to this question, because every person’s experience on Bumble varies by quite a bit. People in cities are likely to get more people liking their profile, and therefore get more matches , just because of the sheer number of other profiles available. How you’ve filled out your profile also matters quite a bit, as it’s what other users see and use to decide whether or not they’ll swipe right. Users in crowded cities sometimes report getting tens or even hundreds of likes on busy days, while users in less-populated areas sometimes go days or weeks without receiving a like. You usually get the most likes in the first couple days after making a profile, or after moving to a new location, where the other profiles are new to you. If you’re not receiving many likes, it may be time to expand your range in the settings, update or tweak your profile to make it more appealing to other users, or reset your profile to get a fresh start."

      "content": "Include several varied and clear pictures of yourself. Professional matchmaker and dating coach Lauren Sanders says to “post really good pictures. Several of them. The more the better.” Your photos are people’s first impression of you, so make them count, and present your best self. Make sure your face is clear in the majority of them, and that each is visually distinct. And ease up on the selfies. For example, include photos from different angles and in different settings to help people feel like they know more about your looks and general presence. Also, smile in most of your photos! A good smile makes you feel approachable and friendly. Don’t be afraid to get a little goofy in a few of them to show off your fun side, but also consider including 1 or 2 photos of yourself all dressed up, or in your element, practicing hobbies or other passions."

      "content": "Give people a taste for who you are in your bio. Sanders says that the more detail you have in your bio, the better, and that more detailed bios have more success. But also, don’t overthink it! It helps to pretend like you’re already introducing yourself, in-person, to your matches. Here are some things you might include when writing your bio : What you do for work, what you’re studying, or what field you’re in. What you’re passionate about, other than professional pursuits. If you had a captive audience, what topic would you be able to lecture about for hours? What’s something you’ve always wanted to do, and would do if the right person came along? If politics and religion are important to you, politely include those, as well."

      "title": "Tell people what you’re looking for in your bio.",
      "content": "Tell people what you’re looking for in your bio. Sanders also suggests stating your reason for using Bumble in your bio. Your bio tells people who you are, but equally important is what you’re on Bumble (or any other dating app) for. Are you looking for a long-term relationship? Something more temporary? Just friends? People don’t love to guess as to why you’re there and if your goals match up, so help them out! Even if it weeds out some possible matches, you’ll be on the same page with matches you do make. If you’re not sure of your end goal, or are open to anything, say that! You might type something suave like, “Show me what I’m looking for,” or, “Open to anything with the right person.”"

      "title": "Fill out the rest of your profile, not just your bio.",
      "content": "Fill out the rest of your profile, not just your bio. Sanders’ advice about more detail holds true elsewhere on your profile, too. Navigate to your profile, tap “Edit,” and fill out every available field—your gender, hometown, height, weight, activity level, etc. This gives other users an even better idea of who you are. Be sure to answer your profile prompts, as well!"

It’s a safe bet that people are more likely to be online after working hours and on the weekend, when they have some free time to surf the dating scene. Try to log on at around 6-8 p.m. and get your swipes in, when the app is most buzzing, to have more interactions, and maybe even get favored by the algorithm."
