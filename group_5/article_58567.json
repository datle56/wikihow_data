      "content": "Enroll in an in person course. There are in person classes that you can take that are given by the Princeton Review for the ACT, for example. [1] X Research source These classes are great because some students benefit from the sense of accountability that you get from a traditional class setting. These classes can vary in length, but for the Princeton Review course, it lasts 6 sessions. To enroll, you go online and find a website for the course you want to take, enter where you live, and the dates you are interested in taking the class to find a class near you. The Princeton Review course gives 4 practice tests so that you can measure your progress and target your problem areas. Most other test prep courses will offer something similar for you to chart your progress. These classes tend to be expensive but will often include the cost of the study materials that you will be needing. Do the homework associated with these courses in order to score the best you can. If you live in a rural area, you may need to commute to a city to take the tests."

      "title": "Buy study materials, and study the material on your own.",
      "content": "Buy study materials, and study the material on your own. For the ACT, for example, there are different kinds of study guides you can buy depending on your need, and this is the same with many other tests. The following are different types of study materials for the ACT: critical books are study guides are for anyone trying to improve their scores, regardless of skill level or areas of strength/weakness; subject training books will help you focus on one specific area of the test, for example, English, Reading, Math or Science; books for top scorers are for those who want an extra push to get their score to the top; and last, books for people who score low and/or only want to work for a short amount of time. Avoid these 5 hour type short study guides unless you only need to improve your score a small amount. Purchase your materials from book stores, online, or check them out from a library. Research the best study guides for the specific test you are preparing for and your needs."

      "content": "Backward plan to figure out when you need to go to bed or get up. One technique that can help you get to bed on time is backward planning. Start from the time you want to be at your test site or studying the next day, and mentally go through all the things you need to do leading up to that time. Plan backward to figure out when you need to realistically be in bed by to get enough sleep. Consider how long it takes you to fall asleep, typically, and make sure you account for that time. Add some cushion time in your backward planning for your test day in case something unexpected happens, like you get lost trying to get to a test site."

      "title": "Eat brain foods and complex carbs.",
      "content": "Eat brain foods and complex carbs. Eat complex carbs for brain power. If you are distracted by your hunger during your test or while you study, you won’t be able to focus as well. To combat this, on the day of the test and before you study, eat food high in protein, like eggs, and/or whole grains that will stick with you for several hours, like oatmeal. If you have a break during your test, pack a light snack, like an apple, that will keep you alert. On the day of the test, eat complex carbohydrates like oatmeal rather than candy made up of simple carbohydrates and sugar. Eat a serving of omega 3’s three times a week. To help you study better and prepare for your test, consider incorporating omega 3’s into your diet. These nutrients have been found to boost your ability to concentrate and stay alert. You can get these nutrients from salmon, herring, mackerel, trout and sardines. Eat dark veggies and fruits for antioxidants that help your cognitive abilities. Oxidants will damage your cell membranes and fruit like blueberries are a great example of a fruit high in antioxidants that protect your brain cells."

      "content": "Start an exercise routine. To help with your mental well being as well as your physical health, try to incorporate about 2 ½ hours of moderately intense (power walking, cycling) exercise into your schedule per week. This will help you relax and concentrate on your test and studies. If you are interested in sports, often times there are intramural teams that meet at parks that you can play on for free or little cost. Inquire at your school or local parks department. Consider renting a workout DVD from the library or doing a video workout online with friends or family every day or every other day. If you feel like you don’t have the time, take 15 minute walks around your campus when you need a break. This will help you focus better once you get back to studying. Go on jogs first thing in the morning to give you energy. Look for ways to get exercise without going out of your way. For example, if you are in school, walk to class rather than taking a bus, or take the stairs instead of the elevator.

      "content": "Take a diagnostic practice test. Most competitive exams are composed of different parts. For example, the GRE is comprised of math, verbal, and essay components. In order to do targeted studying and practice you need to best prepare for the test, you will need to take a practice test to determine which areas of the test you need to focus on the most. In your test prep books, you can typically find diagnostic practice tests. There are also many websites, like collegeboard.org for the SAT, which provide practice tests for competitive exams. These online tests will score your tests for you. [4] X Research source Take the practice test under test like conditions. This means time your test, put away electronics, refrain from listening to music, and sit in a desk/space that will be similar to the environment of the test. Reader Poll: We asked 316 wikiHow readers how they manage their time while taking a test, and 59% of them agreed that the best strategy is to skip difficult questions and come back to them later.

Having a plan and staying consistent in studying and doing targeted practice are going to be key for success on competitive exams. Typically, you will need to block off large, regular chunks of time in your schedule for studying. According to your outline, break down how much material you will need to study per session, approximately. Start with the most important material and work toward the less important material to make sure the important content gets covered before the test."

      "content": "Keep track of your progress by taking practice tests. Every couple of weeks, or as often as recommended, take a practice test, and then go back through and look at the questions you missed. If your answer sheet tells you what kind of question it was, take note. If not, do your best to determine what kind of problems you are missing, and look for patterns in the mistakes you are making so that you know what to focus on in your studying. [6] X Research source When testing, don’t consider each question unique. [7] X Research source There are different types of questions that recur in tests. For example, on the English portion of the ACT, test questions come from these categories: grammar & usage, punctuation, sentence structure, strategy, organization, and style. [8] X Research source"

Make sure to combat that stress by concentrating on studying one lesson at a time. Remind yourself that you have to go through this test prep one step at a time, and don’t let yourself worry about mastering the whole test in a short period of time. Do not try to learn everything at once, cramming will not help you deeply understand the content you are learning."

      "content": "Remove distractions while you study. One way to make the practice of studying more manageable is if you set up a routine of removing all distractions from your study space. Looking at your phone or computer will break your focus and ability to study well. Make sure that you put all of your electronics away and that you are working in a space that will help you focus. For example, there should be no televisions or distractions in the background."

      "title": "Psych yourself down.",
      "content": "Psych yourself down. When we get ready for a test either by studying or taking the test, oftentimes we tense up by instinct. Oftentimes tensing up is a habit we have had for years, and it makes studying or taking a test more difficult than it needs to be. This is because we become overly aroused by our nervousness, and it makes it harder to concentrate on what we need to do. To combat this negative instinct, try these simple techniques to help you to relax: Tense up your muscles briefly and then release. Tense all of your muscles, for example, close your eyes tight, raise your toes up, clench your fists, tense your legs, clench your buttocks, etc. Breathe in a deep breath, and hold it in for a few seconds while your body remains tense. After about 5 seconds, let go all at once, and enjoy the sensation of releasing your built up tension. Close your eyes and concentrate on the tip of your nose with your eyes. Pay attention to your breathing. Notice how the breath that you breathe in is cooler and the breathe you breath out warmer. Continue breathing in and out and maintaining your focus on your nose until you calm down."
