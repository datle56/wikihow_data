      "title": "Determine the type of dance.",
      "content": "Determine the type of dance. Pay attention to the invitation or information you have on the school dance. Is it a generally formal or informal dance, a homecoming dance, or a dance for a holiday like Valentine’s Day or Halloween? Ask your school or friends about the style or theme of the dance so you understand it before you start to choose your clothing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow the theme.",
      "content": "Follow the theme. Notice if the dance has a theme for a holiday, season, or just for fun, and try to dress according to that theme. Wear a costume for a Halloween dance, or put on a Hawaiian shirt or grass skirt for an island theme. Other dances may not require so much of a costume as a few general colors you might wear. For a “spring fling” type of dance, you could stick to light pastel colors, and for a Valentine’s Day dance you could wear some red or pink. If the dance is a prom, you don’t necessarily need to dress to the theme, unless you want to. Wearing formal wear is typically more important than sticking closely to a theme, in this case."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick to the dress code.",
      "content": "Stick to the dress code. Adhere to your school’s general dress code or the specific code they provide for the dance. Look out for what the rules say about necklines, sleeves, hemlines, logos, and shoes, and make sure that what you plan to wear follows these guidelines. Ask questions of your school administrators or teachers if you are unsure if a particular item of clothing is acceptable."

    {
      "title": "Ask what friends are wearing.",
      "content": "Ask what friends are wearing. Call up your friends or your date to the dance to ask what they’re wearing. Don’t feel like you need to wear the same thing as them, but they could help give you ideas for your own outfit. Get ready for the dance with friends, too, so that you can give each other tips as you’re putting on outfits and accessories."

    {
      "title": "Choose a dress, skirt, or dress pants.",
      "content": "Choose a dress, skirt, or dress pants. If the school dance calls for formal wear, opt for a dress, formal skirt and top, or dress pants and nice blouse. Choose a full-length gown for an extra-formal look, or a knee-length dress or skirt for something more semi-formal. If you’re going to the dance with a date, coordinate with them first to see if part of their outfit can match yours. If you go with a boy, their shirt, tie, or vest/cumberbund could match your dress, top, or accessories. It is better to choose a gown with straps and without a train."

    {
      "title": "Pick out heels or flats.",
      "content": "Pick out heels or flats. Pick a pair of heels or flats that are comfortable enough for dancing and being on your feet for several hours. Try matching your shoes to your dress or accessories, or pick gold or silver shoes to match the type of metal of your jewelry. Pay attention to dress code guidelines for shoes. There could be a restriction on the height of high heels."

    {
      "title": "Add a purse and jewelry.",
      "content": "Add a purse and jewelry. Choose accessories to complement your outfit. Pick a nice purse or clutch in the same color as your outfit or shoes, or in the same neutral silver or gold as your jewelry. Keep jewelry simple and classy by sticking to just a few pieces. If you wear big dangly earrings, stick to a simple necklace or bracelet. Or if you have an armful of bangles, choose a less flashy necklace and earrings. [1] X Research source For a prom or other very formal dance, you can follow the tradition of wearing a corsage that complements your outfit and guy’s boutonniere. You can tell your date what color to buy you, or you can just buy or make your own! Wear the corsage either on your wrist or pinned to the front of your dress near the shoulder. [2] X Research source Accessories are a great way to follow the color or theme of a dance. Pick a bright red purse or pair of shoes for a Valentine’s dance, stick a flower in your hair for a Spring dance, or buy a sparkly eye mask for a masquerade theme."

      "content": "Apply tasteful makeup if you wish. If you want to, you can wear makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your face. Choose a concealer or foundation that matches your skin tone, and add a little blush or bronzer to your cheeks if you like. Sweep mascara onto your eyelashes and add eyeliner to your upper eyelids. If you go with bolder or darker eye makeup, stick to a light lip color or gloss, and vice versa."

      "title": "Get hair and nails done.",
      "content": "Get hair and nails done. If you want to, get your hair styled at a salon in a traditionally formal updo. Or try curling, straightening, braiding, or another style that you or a friend can do to your hair. Add sparkly or colorful pins or clips for extra adornment. You can also go to a salon for a manicure and/or pedicure, paint your nails at home, or buy press-on nails. Keep in mind that doing hair and nails is time-consuming, so make sure to plan it in advance."

      "title": "Dress up a casual outfit.",
      "content": "Dress up a casual outfit. Try something just slightly dressier than your everyday clothes. Choose a nice pair of un-ripped dark-wash jeans with a shiny or sparkly top, a denim skirt with a nice blouse, or a light sundress. Just make sure your choices follow the school dress code. It’s less common to coordinate colors with your date for a casual dance, but you still can if you like! For a semi-formal dance, find something in between formal and casual wear. Opt for a skirt instead of pants if you’re comfortable wearing one. Or choose a casual dress in a light cotton or other knit rather than something shiny or sparkly."

      "title": "Pick appropriate shoes.",
      "content": "Pick appropriate shoes. Remember that your shoes should be comfortable enough for dancing and being on your feet for several hours. Choose nice sandals, flats, or boots in a color that matches your top or accessories, or in a neutral brown, black, or gray. Pay attention to dress code guidelines for shoes, which might say sneakers or flip-flops are off-limits."

      "content": "Apply light makeup if you want. Wear makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your face if you like to, but it’s definitely not necessary for a casual dance. Stick with a concealer or foundation that matches your skin tone, and sweep some mascara onto your eyelashes. If you choose to wear dark eyeliner or colorful eyeshadow, stick to a light lip color or gloss. For more colorful lips, keep your eye makeup simpler."

      "content": "Pick a suit or button-down shirt. If the dance calls for formal attire, rent or buy a suit and wear a button-down shirt and tie underneath. You can opt for an optional vest or cumberbund under the suit, too. Or go without a jacket altogether and stick with nice dress pants and a button-down for more semi-formal dances. If you’re going with a date, coordinate with them first to see if part of their outfit can match yours. If your date is a girl, their dress, top, or accessories could match your shirt, tie, or vest/cumberbund."

      "content": "Add a belt and other adornments. Wear a nice leather belt, and choose a watch and a piece of jewelry if you like, such as a ring or a simple necklace. Get cufflinks to fasten the sleeves of your button-down shirt. You can wear a top hat or other dressy hat if you want, but anything like a cap or beanie isn’t acceptable for a formal dance. For a prom or other very formal dance, you can follow the tradition of wearing a boutonniere that complements your outfit and a girl’s corsage. You can tell your date what color to buy you, or you can just buy or make your own! Wear your boutonniere pinned to the lapel of your suit. [4] X Research source"

Choose a leather belt if you wear a button-down or other shirt that needs to be tucked in. Avoid casual caps or beanies unless the dance is very casual, and check the dress code to make sure hats are okay if you do want to wear one."
