      "content": "Find a location where functional oars can be stored. Oars can be stored horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, so you just need one dimension of the space to be as long as the oars. This space can be in whatever storage area you have, such as a garage or basement, but make sure that you will be able to access them when you need them. Functional oars can be stored diagonally if your space is limited, but they might be a bit less convenient to get off the wall. If you have a variety of lengths of oars to store, be sure that the area you pick is large enough for the longest oar."

Measure the oars and make sure that you have a space on the wall where they will fit. Since the oars can hang at an angle, you can measure a space diagonally to see if the oars will fit that way. Remember that oars can be put up vertically, so they can be a nice decorative element in a narrow wall space."

      "content": "Plan the arrangement. Once you are sure you have enough space, you can begin playing with how you want the oars to be arranged. Hold the oars up at a variety of angles to see what arrangement will look best. One pleasing arrangement for oars is placing them crosswise in an \"x.\" However, simply hanging them horizontally, one on top of the other, is also a good choice. [1] X Research source Even if you want the oars to be parallel, that doesn't mean they need to match each other perfectly. Try putting up oars that are parallel but flipped in opposite directions, so the handle of one is next to the head of the other."

      "content": "Purchase an oar storage rack for a convenient option. Oars are most easily stored on racks made specifically for oar storage. These vary in design, from simple blocks of wood with pegs coming out of them to specially cut pieces that hold the exact shape of the oars. However, oars can also be stored on a variety of other racks or hook systems, such as racks made to store brooms or rifles, so look at a variety of options before choosing. When choosing your rack, consider whether you want to store vertically or horizontally. There are different racks for these 2 configurations. When picking out a rack, take into consideration how many oars you need to store. Storage racks vary widely in the number of oars they can hold."

To make your own simple rack that will store 4 oars vertically, you will need to start with a piece of lumber that is at least 2 by 4 by 24 inches (5.1 × 10.2 × 61.0 cm). You will also need 32 inches (81 cm) of doweling that is at least .5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter, wall anchors, and wood glue. [2] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source You'll also need a saw, a screwdriver, and a drill. Make sure you have a drill bit that is the same diameter as the doweling you are using, and a drill bit that is the same diameter as the shaft of the screws that will go into the wall anchors."

The 8 holes consist of four paired holes. The paired holes should be 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from each other, or the exact width of the neck of your oars. The pairs should be 4 inches (10 cm) away from each other. Then mark the 2 holes that will be used to anchor the rack onto the wall.

They should not go all the way through the wood so that the dowels can be more easily glued into the holes. Drill the 2 holes for the anchors all the way through the wood, so that the anchors can be easily screwed through the rack.

[5] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source If the dowels don't want to stay down, use a piece of painter's tape or masking tape to secure them down as they dry. If glue squirts out around the edge of the dowel, wipe it off with a slightly damp towel right away. It's a good idea to clean up the glue before it dries, as it is easier to remove. Let the dowels dry for 24 hours before proceeding with the project."

[9] X Research source If you want to hang your oars in an \"X\" shape, you'll need 5 hooks -- one at each outer point of the \"X\" shape, angled toward the crossing point of the \"X\" (where the fifth hook will go)."

Oars can be hung by rope by tying one end of the rope near the base of the paddle head, and one end near the handle. Then the center of the rope is hung off of a wall fastener.

Whether you have drywall, lathe and plaster, or concrete walls, get anchors that say they are designed for your specific type of wall.

Be sure to figure out the right position for the anchors on the wall before attaching them, so that the oars will hang as intended. Once your positions are chosen, follow the directions that came with the anchors to attach them. How you attach the anchors will vary depending on what type you are using. For example, anchors attached to drywall often require you to drill a small hole that the wings of the anchor will be inserted through before being tightened. Anchors used in lathe and plaster are often simply screwed straight into the lathe."
