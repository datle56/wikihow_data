      "content": "Choose \"Armor\" from the category list. Other categories include \"Weapons,\" \"Repair,\" and \"Ammunition.\" Armor is broken down into different pieces and types, allowing players to purchase new sets piece by piece. Armor adds a certain number of health squares to your life bar and comes with a set number of hit points that indicate how much damage you can take before needing repairs. These numbers correspond, so if an armor piece's hit points are depleted, the health squares it provided will be locked and unused. Each piece can be repaired separately or a set can be repaired altogether at a blacksmith."
