      "content": "Seiso officially means “clean” in Japanese. Spelled in kanji as 清楚, seiso is an adjective (descriptive word) that means “trim,” “neat,” “tidy,” or “clean.” [1] X Research source It was repurposed by the Virtual YouTuber (VTuber) community to mean a pure and wholesome streamer, but is often used as a tongue-in-cheek way to tease VTubers who definitely don’t fit this definition. [2] X Research source VTubers are streamers who create content using a virtual, anime-style avatar (rather than showing their face on camera). VTubers often adopt a specific persona for their characters, and even come up with in-depth backstories for them. They typically stream on Twitch and/or YouTube."

      "content": "A seiso VTuber has a wholesome, pure, and family-friendly image. By the original definition, a seiso VTuber has a “clean” image—they act very innocently on-stream, and they don’t engage in any adult humor. VTubers are often categorized by the binary of being either seiso or “unseiso” (not entirely wholesome/innocent).

      "content": "Seiso was made popular by VTubers Dennou Shojo Siro and Tsukino Mito. Siro (a VTuber who debuted in 2017 with the .LIVE agency) first coined the term “seiso” in an ironic way within the VTuber vernacular, and Tsukino Mito (a VTuber who debuted in 2018 with the NIJISANJI agency) helped popularize the use of the word. Both of these characters are definitely not seiso in a wholesome way, but in a tongue-in-cheek way. [4] X Research source Tsukino Miko in particular is known for requesting her fans to create mature, adult-oriented art of her, which definitely isn’t a “seiso” thing to do. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Bottom left An ironic term that means someone is both unintelligent and vulgar. The term was coined in a stream featuring Takanashi Kiara (a VTuber with the HoloLive agency) and her fellow HoloLive VTubers. In the video, Kiara was jokingly placed in the “bottom left” quadrant of a purity alignment chart, which represented people who were both stupid and impure. [6] X Research source"
