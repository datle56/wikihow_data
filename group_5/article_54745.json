      "title": "Look for a badge you like.",
      "content": "Look for a badge you like. Find an avatar with the badge you want. Click on an avatar’s name to display its profile card. The avatar’s badges should be displayed at the bottom of the card. Look for the one you like."
    },

      "title": "See the user’s profile for more information about the badge.",
      "content": "See the user’s profile for more information about the badge. On the avatar profile card, click on “Profile” at the lower left. This will take you to the user’s profile home page. If the badge you want doesn’t appear there, look for another avatar that has it on its home page (step 1 and 2). Some users will also set their home page private, so looking for a particular badge can take some time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select the badge.",
      "content": "Select the badge. When you’ve found a home page that displays the badge you want, click the badge beside the profile picture. The user’s friends should appear at the bottom if the profile isn’t private, and their badges should be displayed as well, provided that they didn’t set that to private either. Click on the badge and the expanded image should appear. If you click it, it should take you to the badge’s info page. The name of the badge should be under “Search Catalog,” right after “Product by.” Remember the badge’s name for the next step."

      "title": "Head to the badge’s avatar page.",
      "content": "Head to the badge’s avatar page. In the address bar of your browser window, type in “avatars.imvu.com/[badge name]” without the quotes and the brackets. It should take you to an avatar page of the badge’s creator. Look for the badge you want by scrolling down the bottom of the page. When you see the badge you want, click on “Request badge” right beside your desired badge. An info pop-up should appear, telling you that you have received the badge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Showcase the badge.",
      "content": "Showcase the badge. Now that you have the badge, it’s time to use it. Head back to your profile page by clicking “Account” on the right part of the page where you requested the badge. You should be taken to the Accounts, Settings, and Tools for your profile. Scroll down until you see your profile card. A list of available badges should be right below your profile card. Simply drag the badge you acquired to a vacant badge slot on your profile card. Your new badge should appear on your profile card. To check, click on your profile picture at the top of the page and you should see your new badge under all your displayed badges on your profile card."
