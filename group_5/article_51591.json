      "content": "Choose an indoor type of begonia. This list of begonias that grow well indoors is extensive. It is important to remember that some types of begonias are grown for their brilliantly colored flowers, while other begonias are enjoyed for their unique and beautiful foliage. Most begonias bought at nurseries will be labeled as indoor plants or outdoor plants. There are two main categories of cultivated begonias based on growth habits. Also there are hybrids within these groups. Cane Begonias grow upwards on tall stems that resemble bamboo in appearance. The Angel Wing Begonia is a common example. Fibrous root Begonia species have stems that are directly attached to the crown of the plant like that of radish leaves. This group includes the Rex Begonia hybrids. If you are still uncertain of whether or not your plant will work well indoors, ask an employee at your local nursery."

      "title": "Plant indoor begonias in a good indoor potting soil.",
      "content": "Plant indoor begonias in a good indoor potting soil. When potting your begonias, you should keep three factors in mind: the type of soil, the size of pot, and the amount of soil you use. When choosing your potting material, you want the soil to be relatively neutral or slightly acidic on the pH scale. Your pot should roughly fit the size of your plant--you want to keep root growth in mind but do not want the pot to be overly large. A pot that is too large can lead to using too much soil. When a pot contains too much soil, it can lead to soggy soil that could potentially ‘drown’ your plant roots and kill your begonia. Some people also grow begonias in wet stones or small pebbles as a top medium. You don’t have to completely bury the plant’s rhizome to do this. Just place it on top of the stones."

      "content": "Place indoor begonias where they get bright light. Begonias like a lot of light so place them on windowsills that face east or west so that your plants get several hours of sunlight each day. Avoid southern windows from February through September, as they let in too much light, unless you hang thin curtains that filter the light. [2] X Research source Be sure to filter the light coming from eastern or western windows if these face concrete or water. If you choose to use fluorescent lights, you should place it 6 to 12 inches above your plant. You should keep the light on for roughly 12 hours a day, though some begonia growers leave their lights on for 14. Keep in mind that you will need to water your plant more often when you use artificial light. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Water begonias carefully. Water your plants when the surface of the potting soil feels dry to the touch. You should water your plants more frequently when it is warm, the light is bright and the begonias are flowering heavily and putting out new growth. Water your plant until water runs out of the drainage holes. [7] X Research source Let the potting soil dry out slightly between watering during lower light and cooler temperatures of late fall and winter. If possible, use room temperature water that has been distilled. Promptly empty drained water from trays and saucers. Mist the foliage of Rex (foliage) type begonias twice a week or provide high humidity to avoid leaf drop. Use warm water in a misting bottle."

      "title": "Fertilize your begonias.",
      "content": "Fertilize your begonias. You should fertilize your winter-blooming plants with a high-phosphorus, water-soluble fertilizer that contains little or no nitrogen. Do this once a month from February through September. Fertilize your plants less frequently during the late fall and winter months because your plant will not be growing as steadily during this time. Mix the fertilizer according to the label’s directions. Wait three months before fertilizing if the potting mix you used contained fertilizer."

      "content": "Groom the plants regularly. Your should remove dead flowers and leaves. You should also trim off broken stems to promote plant growth. Dust the leaves if it is needed. Remove the small flowers of Rex type begonias as they start to bloom to concentrate the plants energy on foliage. of water and spray the remaining leaves with it. It would also be a good idea to increase the air circulation around the plant to prevent further incidences.”"

      "content": "Pick the right location for planting. Plant all types of begonias outside in a partly or lightly shaded location after all danger of frost has passed. Use Tuberous begonias for planters or hanging baskets. Use fibrous rooted begonia for creating beautiful flower beds. [8] X Research source Place begonias where they get early morning or late afternoon sun to ensure that you get the best bloom. You can also place them in a location where they get dappled sunlight all day. Avoid sitting begonias in containers on hot surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. Start tuberous begonias inside 3 months before your last frost in the spring for best blooming results. See notes on how to start them."

      "content": "Plant your begonias in fertile soil. Begonias like fertile that is rich in nutrients. You can create this sort of soil by adding peat moss to the area, as well as thoroughly rotted compost. You also have to make sure that your plants’ roots have good drainage or else they could rot. Try to avoid planting begonias in areas with strong wind, as they have weak stems that can be damaged by large gusts of wind. Once you’ve found a good location and prepped your soil, dig holes the size of your begonias’ containers spaced about 12 to 18 inches apart."

      "content": "Water outdoor begonias. You want to make sure that you water begonias so that their soil is moist by not soggy. This means letting the top inch of soil dry out before water the plants again. Soggy soil can lead to a rotting or dead begonia. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Water begonias planted in containers until the water runs from the drainage holes.Dump the drained water out of any trays or saucers immediately after watering. Check hanging baskets of begonias frequently as they can dry out in one day. If you find that the soil is dry to the touch, water the plant."

      "title": "Fertilize begonias.",
      "content": "Fertilize begonias. Begonias prefer a balanced fertilizer, meaning that the fertilizer is neutral rather than acidic or basic. Work a slow release granular fertilizer into the ground where you plan to plant your begonias. Read and follow the label’s directions for the amount to use. Repeat the fertilizer application in three months by gently working it in the soil around the plants. Use a water-soluble fertilizer for blooming plants once a week if you do not use a granular fertilizer."

      "content": "Cut back your begonias. Cut back bedding or fibrous begonias to 3”(7 .6 cm) every 4 months in mild climates where there is no frost to renew the plants. This will ensure that they continue to grow and remain healthy. Bring in bedding begonias that were growing outside to grow inside for the winter. Dig them before the first frost and pot them. Cut the plants back to about 3” to start new growth. See indoor care above."
