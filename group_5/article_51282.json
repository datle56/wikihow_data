      "content": "If you're moderately active, you already burn 2000 calories a day. Everyday activities like breathing, walking, and sleeping contribute to calorie loss, but diet, exercise, and genetics (metabolism) determine long-term weight loss. To lose weight, you need to use more calories than you consume by cutting calories, increasing exercise, or both. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Before cutting calories, talk to your doctor and a reputable fitness coach. Never eat fewer than 1200 calories a day. It's extremely dangerous and can lead to future health problems. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Burning an extra 2000 calories (on top of the 2000 calories you normally burn) isn’t easy or advisable. Unless you’re a professional athlete, don’t attempt to burn an additional 2000 calories strictly through exercise. For effective weight loss, aim to burn an additional 2000 calories over several days or weeks, and break down your fitness goals into smaller, manageable ones so you don’t experience burnout."

      "title": "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)",
      "content": "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) HIIT involves several minutes of high-intensity activity followed by short periods of low-intensity activity or rest. It's an ideal home workout because it doesn’t require much space or additional equipment. In just 30 minutes, you can burn over 300 calories, so grab your workout timer and get ready to sweat! [3] X Research source When adding HIIT to your routine , be sure to warm up before exercising. Start with 10-15 leg swings, or jog in place for one minute. Try 30 seconds of push-ups for beginners, followed by a 15-second plank. Or, run up and down the stairs for 1 minute, followed by 25 seconds of rest. Do 8-10 reps. Instead of a timer, blast music over a speaker to keep track of your workout intervals. Try sprinting until you reach the bridge of your favorite song, then slowly walk in place until the outro (and repeat)."

It’s the perfect exercise to lose weight because it burns body fat and builds muscle, boosting metabolism. You can expect to burn around 315-440 calories in 30 minutes. [4] X Research source If you’re a beginner, it’s crucial to choose the right bike to avoid lower back pain. Search for an indoor recumbent bike , which puts you in a slightly reclined position to put less stress on your body. When cycling outdoors, always wear a safety helmet , and avoid wearing clips to keep your feet on the pedals–your injuries will be worse if you fall off your bike. It’s crucial to monitor your hydration levels when exercising: drink at least 2 litres (0.53 US gal) to 3 litres (0.79 US gal) of water a day, and add electrolyte powder to your water if you ride for over an hour.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To figure out your minimum caloric intake, calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Determine your height in centimeters and your weight in kilograms. Plug these values into an online calculator . A high BMR is ideal because it means you burn a lot of calories at rest. A low BMR means you have a slow metabolism, which is often fueled by restricting calories and limiting exercise. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Calculate your BMR every week to track your metabolism. If your BMR remains the same, you may want to switch up your diet or workout. Then, check if your BMR changes the following week.

To boost your BMR, add muscle-building exercises into your routine, like weight-lifting or cycling."
