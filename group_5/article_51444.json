      "content": "Identify the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism. If you’ve been given a rectangular prism with stated dimensions, then it should be easy to find the length, width, and height of the box. If your box isn’t already labeled, draw a rectangular prism on a piece of paper and label the length, width, and height so they’re easier to keep track of throughout your calculations. The length is the longest side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism. [1] X Research source The width is the shorter side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism. [2] X Research source The height is the part of the rectangular prism that rises up. Imagine that the height is what stretches up a flat rectangle until it becomes a three-dimensional shape. For example , your box may have these dimensions: length (l) = 5 inches, width (w) = 4 inches, and height (h) = 3 inches."

This calculation can also be done by plugging the dimensions into the formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism, which is Volume = length x height x width, or V = l x h x w. [3] X Research source For example , let’s say that your rectangular prism has the dimensions length (l) = 5 inches, width (w) = 4 inches, and height (h) = 3 inches. To calculate this rectangular prisms volume, multiply 5 x 4 x 3 = 60 . The volume of this box is 60 . These numbers can be calculated in any order. For instance, multiplying 3 x 5 x 4 would produce the same final value of 60."

Then, write the number value of your volume, followed by that measurement with the exponent 3 attached to it. For example , the rectangular prism in our example has its dimensions stated in inches.

The space inside of a rectangular prism is made up of cube units, meaning that a rectangular prism can be visualized as a 3D shape with many smaller cubes fitting inside it—almost like a 3-dimensional grid inside the prism. [5] X Research source If you’ve been given a rectangular prism problem where the prism is divided up into cubes and you’re only given the side length of each cube , follow this set of steps. Start by making note of the given side length of each small cube inside the rectangular prism. In our example , we’ll say that each of the cubes in the prism has a side length of 1 inch ."

Then, count how many cubes are included on the short side. For example , our rectangular prism has a 9 cubes on its long side and 2 cubes on its short side. If you’re struggling to visualize this process by counting cubes on the 3-dimensional shape, imagine what it would look like if you picked up the prism and looked at the bottom. What would the dimensions of that bottom rectangle be? In our example , you would see a 9 by 2 rectangle. If you have MathLink Cubes or something similar on hand, it may be helpful to physically build your prism out of cubes to better visualize it and its dimensions."

Now that you know how many cubes make up the long and short sides of the prism’s bottom layer, you can determine the prism’s total length and width. To find the length , multiply the side length of your cubes by the number of cubes on the long side of the bottom layer. For example , our rectangular prism has cubes with a side length of 1 inch, and there are 9 cubes on the long side of the rectangle. Therefore, our prism’s length = 1 inch x 9 = 9 inches . To find the width , multiply the side length of your cubes by the number of cubes on the short side of the bottom layer. For example , our rectangular prism has cubes with a side length of 1 inch, and there are 2 cubes on the long side of the rectangle. Therefore, our prism’s length = 1 inch x 2 = 2 inches ."

You also know that layer’s height, which is equal to the side length of a single cube. To find the volume of that layer (just that layer—not the entire prism), multiply length by width by height. [6] X Research source For example , in a rectangular prism with a bottom layer whose dimensions are 9 inches (length) by 2 inches (width) by 1 inch (height), you’d calculate Volume = 9 x 2 x 1 = 18 . Since our original cube side-length was given in inches and volume is always measured in cubic units, our bottom layer’s final volume with units would be Volume = 18 inches 3"

The great news is that every layer has the same volume—so we’re almost there! Count the total number of layers in your prism, then add together your volume answer from the previous amount of steps that amount of times. [7] X Research source For example , let’s say that our rectangular prism has 2 layers of cubes. Since we already know that the bottom layer has a volume of 18 inches 3 , all we have to do is add that value together 2 times .

[9] X Research source Since our height is given in centimeters (not meters), we must convert this number into meters before continuing: 50 centimeters = 0.5 meters. If you can’t convert units off of the top of your head, use a unit conversation calculator .

      "content": "Thinking that converting units affects the volume If you calculate the volume of a rectangular prism with its dimensions written in centimeters, you’ll get a different number value as an answer than if you calculated the same rectangular prism’s volume with its dimensions written in meters. However, this difference doesn’t change the actual value of the prism’s volume, or the amount of space it's taking up. The difference in numbers only has to do with the differing units—not because the actual volume of the prism has changed. Consider if you had a cardboard box in front of you. You could use a ruler to measure that box in inches or a measuring tape to measure it in feet. You would get a different answer, but the size of the box wouldn’t actually change."

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism can be used for any real-life scenario where you need to know how much space is inside of or taken up by a 3D rectangular shape or box. For instance, say you bought a box-shaped fish tank. If you want to know how much water you need to fill that tank, use the rectangular prism volume formula. In another example, you may want to construct a raised garden bed and fill it with potting soil. To know how much potting soil you’ll need, plug the dimensions of your bed into the rectangular prism volume formula. Or, maybe you’re going on a dream vacation and need to choose between two suitcases. If you want to know which suitcase would fit more inside it, calculate the volume of each one and see which number value is largest."

If you are given the volume of the rectangular prism but not its height, you can use this formula to solve for height: Volume (V) = base area (B) x height (h). For example, if you know that the volume of a prism is 200 cubic units and the base area is 20 square units, then plug those values into the equation. Then, you’ll have the formula 200 = 20 x h . To solve for h , divide both sides of the equation by 20 to be left with 10 = h . Therefore, the height of the rectangular prism is 10 units !"

If all of the dimensions are doubled, the volume will then be (2l) x (2w) x (2h) = 8lwh = 8 x V. As a result, the volume will be 8 x V, or 8 times its original value."
