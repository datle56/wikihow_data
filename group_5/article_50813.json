The more you practice, the better you will get. If you cannot afford to sign up for lessons, you can always find some nice DVDs at Target or other stores that will teach you good dance technique. However, if you plan to become a professional dancer, it is necessary to take lessons from a reputable school."

If you have the space, you may want to put a barre somewhere in your home, preferably in a room with wood floors.
