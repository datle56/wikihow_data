      "title": "Ask in a straightforward way to see how he feels about sharing.",
      "content": "Ask in a straightforward way to see how he feels about sharing. Sometimes, the easiest way to get what you want is to just be confident and upfront.

      "content": "Tell him you love his hoodie so much and you just want in on the fun. If you think your boyfriend’s hoodie is big, soft, and comfy, you should tell him!

[2] X Research source Keep piling on the compliments, and you might not even have to ask to borrow it: he might just offer it to you because you like it so much!"

    {
      "title": "Let him know that you love and crave his energy and support.",

      "title": "Suggest an outdoor activity and say you can’t stop by home first.",
      "content": "Suggest an outdoor activity and say you can’t stop by home first. Asking your boyfriend to bring you a change or layer of clothes is totally normal. Recommend that you meet up somewhere and make it sound like you don’t have a jacket with you and don’t have time to grab one. Plan to go somewhere directly from somewhere else, like school or work to a park. Make your plans sound time-sensitive if he asks why you can’t go home first. For example, “We have to catch the sunset!” or “It’s a surprise!”"

      "title": "Assure him that giving you his hoodie is a romantic gesture.",
      "content": "Assure him that giving you his hoodie is a romantic gesture. Wearing your partner’s clothing is a classic way to show other people that you’re in love. Tell your boyfriend this so he feels like giving you his hoodie to keep you warm would be a proper, old-school boyfriend move on his part! If he doesn’t get it, mention all the classic movies and shows you’ve seen where a guy is chivalrous by sharing his jacket. Don’t be afraid to be corny and over-the-top. For example, you could be like “Haven’t you seen the end of Titanic? Don’t you want to be my Jack?!”"

      "title": "Use silly but truthful logic to convince him to give you his hoodie.",
      "content": "Use silly but truthful logic to convince him to give you his hoodie. It’s true! Wearing something that belongs to a loved one has aphrodisiac effects. In other words, wearing his clothes will only make you fall more in love with him. What boyfriend could turn that down? This is because of pheromones, but you probably won’t have to explain it too thoroughly before your charm and humor win him over. “I heard wearing something with your significant other’s scent strengthens your feelings for them!”"

    {
      "title": "Compliment his smell to make him feel sexy and loved.",
      "content": "Compliment his smell to make him feel sexy and loved. It’s not uncommon for people to want the smell of their significant other on them. After all, scent plays a huge role in attraction. Tell him his scent is sexy, and that it reminds you of him. Also, most guys secretly love being told they smell good. You get his hoodie, he gets a self-confidence boost. Win-win. Plus, smell has a huge effect on memory, so you can tell him he’ll always be thinking of him. (Awww.) This is especially effective if you guys don’t live together or see each other super often."

      "title": "Play the “I miss you” card so he feels better about giving it to you.",
      "content": "Play the “I miss you” card so he feels better about giving it to you. Even if you don’t usually sleep next to your boyfriend, feeling his warmth in bed can be really comforting. Tell your boyfriend you miss him so much that you just want something to remind you of him while he’s not with you. If you think talking about sleeping together is a little too intimate for your boyfriend, you can switch it out for something more casual. For example, “I want to walk around in your hoodie so it’s like you’re walking with me.”"

      "title": "Entice him by saying his hoodie is a status symbol to you.",
      "content": "Entice him by saying his hoodie is a status symbol to you. If you’re wearing something that obviously belongs to your boyfriend, people will know you’re off the market. To other guys, it says you already belong to someone else. Use this logic to convince your guy that this will protect you from prying eyes! This is especially the case if you’re a girl wearing your boyfriend’s clothes. That being said, if you’re wearing anything that fits or looks different from what you’d normally wear, people will probably be able to connect the dots."

      "title": "Swear to treat his belongings with the utmost care to win his trust.",
      "content": "Swear to treat his belongings with the utmost care to win his trust. You probably weren’t planning on getting his hoodie dirty, but your boyfriend might not know that! Assure him that you want to wear it because you love him and respect his belongings. If he’s really anxious, offer to wash it for him before you give it back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Promise to give it back to ease his nerves.",
      "content": "Promise to give it back to ease his nerves. If your boyfriend has issues with sharing his hoodie because he’s afraid he won’t get it back, give him a day you’ll return it by. Make sure the amount of time is reasonable so he’s sure you won’t forget. If he doesn’t agree to your offer, you might have to compromise a bit so you’re both happy. Negotiate nicely to convince him! For example, “I totally understand. Can I just wear it now and give it back to you after class?” If you keep your promise this time, he might let you keep it longer next time."

      "title": "Compromise for another hoodie if he won’t give you your first choice.",
      "content": "Compromise for another hoodie if he won’t give you your first choice. Some people have certain articles of clothing that they just can’t let anyone else wear. That doesn’t mean there isn’t another one he won’t give you! If you can’t get your first choice hoodie, maybe you can get your second or third. Better than nothing, right? Try to not take it personally if he doesn’t let go of his absolute favorite hoodie."

      "title": "Respect his boundaries to show him you have his best interest in mind.",
      "content": "Respect his boundaries to show him you have his best interest in mind. You might be able to convince your boyfriend to say “yes” by giving him the option to say “no.” This will make your request less forceful and show him that you’re taking his feelings into account. Remember to keep your word: you’ve got to respect his decision if he says no. Just because he said no this time doesn’t mean he won’t change his mind later!"
