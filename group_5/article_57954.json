If your document is legal in nature, or will be legally binding on you or other parties, you may wish an attorney look over the document. [1] X Research source By hiring a legal professional to this, you can protect yourself from unwanted consequences due to language in the document. These professionals can make sure that your document is viable. Once a document is notarized, you cannot change it, so it must be correct before you notarize. A lawyer can read the document and point out any errors or loopholes you should correct. You can get an attorney review at any time, but the document will need notarization again if changes are necessary. Getting a review first can save time and money later. Even if you do not hire an attorney to look over the document, make sure that the document meets all the legal requirements."
