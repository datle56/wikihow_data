      "content": "MonkaW is a Twitch emote that expresses anxiety or tension. It’s widely used by audiences in Twitch streams when the streamer finds themself in a tense situation, whether that’s playing a difficult video game or telling a heart-pounding story. The emote features a close-up of Pepe the Frog (a common online character) with a nervous, intense look on his face. [1] X Research source The emote can also be used ironically to show an exaggerated response, or playful worry or fear about a situation."

      "content": "Install the FrankerFacez or BTTV plugins. If a streamer hasn’t added the MonkaW emote to their channel’s emote library, you won’t be able to use or see MonkaW in chat until you download either the FrankerFaceZ or BTTV plugins to your browser, which expand Twitch’s emote library. Simply click the “Download” button on the extensions’ homepages to install them. After, login to your selected extension’s homepage and authorize the extension’s access to your Twitch account when prompted. Without the extensions, you might still see the text “MonkaW” in chat, but it won’t appear as an emote."

      "content": "Use “monkaW” in Twitch chat when you’re concerned for a streamer. Maybe they’re in a tight spot in the game they’re playing, or maybe they just commented off-the-cuff that they haven’t slept in days. Type “MonkaW” to show your own anxiety or worry at their predicament, even if that worry is just humorous or ironic. Example: “Oh man, you almost lost your entire health bar there, MonkaW.” Some emotes are also available by clicking the smiley-face icon next to the chat box, or by configuring them as a keyboard shortcut in your Twitch account settings."

      "content": "Send your close friends the MonkaW emote via text. Twitch emotes are best used on Twitch, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use them elsewhere. If your friends are streaming buffs, you might drop a “MonkaW” in your text messages or group chats to express your concern, anxiety, or fear there, as well. Example: “The bus is 10 minutes late and I have an important meeting at work today, MonkaW.” You might also download the emote image to your phone so that you can send it as a message, rather than just sending the plain text."

The MonkaS emote features Pepe the Frog with a worried look on his face and sweat dripping down his forehead, expressing much the same emotion as MonkaW–anxiety, worry, fear, etc. MonkaW, though, is that same image zoomed in, suggesting an even more intense form of these emotions. [2] X Research source Pepe the Frog is himself a creation of comic artist Matt Furie, and originated in the strip “Boy’s Club,” after which Pepe was lifted and remixed by countless internet users.

The image of a nervously sweating Pepe the Frog first appeared on the somewhat notorious message board 4chan in 2011, where it gained popularity and spread to other sites. In 2016, Twitch user Monkasenpai (for whom the emote is named–short for “monkascared”) uploaded it to the Better Twitch TV extension for use on the streaming site. [4] X Research source MonkaS was popularized by the streamer Forsen. Then, Twitch user DourGent uploaded a zoomed-in version, MonkaW. The “W” at the end of “MonkaW” is a commonly used emote suffix that indicates it’s a zoomed-in version of another emote."
