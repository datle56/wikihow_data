      "content": "Your Midheaven speaks to your career, ambitions, and public image. Also called the Medium Coeli or MC, your midheaven sign occupies the highest point on your birth chart, at the cusp of your 10th House . It defines your achievements, career goals, sense of authority, and the legacy you aim to leave behind. It dictates how the rest of the world sees you and your relationships with authority figures. [1] X Research source Your Midheaven sign can also predict the types of work you prefer and the career paths that may speak to you most. This is because the 10th House of your birth chart also represents your ambition, reputation, and career goals, and it’s connected to your MC. Often, your Midheaven sign is also the 10th sign from your Rising sign —but that’s not always the case."
