For added security, consider putting bars or accordion gates on windows at street level or on fire escapes. [5] X Research source Install a metal grate to protect basement windows, or put a metal bar in the middle to make sure they are too small to crawl through. Secure window air conditioning units.

[7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Consider installing plastic drainpipes, which are much harder to climb than metal ones.

Outside doors should be metal or solid hardwood and at least 1.75 inches thick. Be sure the frames are of equally strong material, and the door fits its frame securely so it cannot be pried open. [9] X Research source Make sure the hinges are on the inside. Inexperienced door installers sometimes leave them on the outside, making it easy to simply remove the door. [10] X Research source If there is a window near the door, put a ¼ inch covering of clear Plexiglas over the existing glass to prevent thieves from breaking the glass and reaching in to open the door.

Landline – A landline phone connection is used to communicate with the monitoring center. It is the slowest option, and if you choose it, you should get cell uplink backup, or cutting the telephone lines will disable your system. Cellular – A cellular uplink is used to communicate with the monitoring center. Cellular monitoring is faster and more reliable, but also more expensive. Broadband – Your broadband internet is used to communicate with the monitoring center. It is much faster than a landline, and while not as reliable as cellular, it is cheaper. Professional or DIY Installation – DIY is usually quite simple, and it means you own the equipment. It is good for renters or people who move a lot. The professional installation allows for more complex systems, but if you will be moving soon, be sure you go with a company that will move your system for free. Home Automation – This provides the ability to remotely control not only your security settings, but also things like turning the lights on and off, and thermostat settings. It can also give you real-time updates and let you know when your kids come home. It is convenient, but more expensive."
