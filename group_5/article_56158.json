      "content": "Intercoolers cool air, while radiators cool down coolant. The major difference between these 2 heat exchangers is what they cool off in your car. An intercooler takes in the hot, compressed air coming from a turbo or supercharger and turns it into more efficient, cool air. [1] X Research source On the other hand, your car’s radiator receives hot liquid, called coolant, from the engine, passes it through its vents to decrease the coolant’s temperature, and cycles it back through the engine.

      "content": "Only cars with turbochargers and superchargers have intercoolers. Some high-performance cars have turbochargers or superchargers, which are special parts that push compressed air into the engine. These parts generate a lot of heat, so an intercooler is installed specifically to cool down the hot air they create. Regular cars don’t need intercoolers because they don’t have turbochargers and superchargers. [3] X Research source The dense, compressed air that turbochargers and superchargers create gives a vehicle’s engine more power and torque. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "A car can just have a radiator, but it can’t only have an intercooler. Because all cars have radiators to cool down, you won’t find an intercooler without a radiator. The intercooler works with the radiator to keep the engine from overheating. In a car without a supercharger or turbocharger, the engine only needs a radiator to cool off. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Intercoolers tend to be more expensive than radiators.",
      "content": "Intercoolers tend to be more expensive than radiators. An intercooler is more of a specialty car part because it’s only used with a turbocharger or supercharger. So, it can cost up to twice as much as a radiator. [6] X Research source The average intercooler replacement costs around $700. [7] X Research source The price of a radiator largely depends on your car, but it typically ranges from $700-1,000 to replace. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "An intercooler is a heat exchanger that cools down hot, compressed air. The hot air coming from a car’s turbocharger or supercharger is pushed into the intercooler. The air flows through the intercooler, cooling it down and making it more efficient for the engine. Once it's cooled down, the intercooler sends the air back to the engine. Intercoolers come in 2 different types that work in different ways: [9] X Research source Air-to-Air intercooler : this type is typically more common. The air from the turbocharger or supercharger flows into the intercooler. Then, air from outside your car flows across the intercooler to decrease the compressed air’s temperature. Air-to-Water intercooler : this intercooler uses water instead of air. Coolant cycles through the intercooler as the compressed air enters, which reduces its temperature."

      "content": "A radiator is a key part of your car’s cooling system. Your car’s engine heats up as you drive, which is why coolant flows through the engine to keep it cool. However, the coolant eventually warms up too. When the coolant gets too hot, it gets sent to the radiator. The coolant runs through the fins of the radiator, which absorbs the heat. When the coolant is cool, the radiator sends it back into the engine. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, intercoolers help increase your car’s horsepower. When intercoolers cool down the hot air they receive from a turbocharger or supercharger, they send it to the engine. The cooler air circulates through the engine, allowing it to work harder and more efficiently. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Typically, the intercooler is installed in front of the radiator. If you’re adding an intercooler to your turbocharged or supercharged vehicle, place it in front of your radiator. This gives the intercooler plenty of space to get lots of ambient air from outside of your car and cool down the compressed air. [12] X Research source If space is an issue, other common placements are on top of the engine or inside the side grill at the front of your car. [13] X Research source"
