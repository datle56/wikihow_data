      "content": "Change your hair. Getting a drastic haircut is the quickest way to look completely different. If you want to disguise yourself, though, you're going to want to pick something that won't draw attention--a blue mohawk or a pink costume wig probably aren't the best choices. [1] X Research source People with short hair can style it differently by using products like hair spray or gel to create a more elaborate \"do\" than usual, or could shave their head completely. Also consider a dye-job, or using cheap talcum powder to make some gray streaks that will really throw people. People with longer hair can consider getting a realistic-looking wig or extensions to change the basic shape of their hair. You can also quickly go back to your \"old\" style that way, if you want to for further disguises. Keep them guessing by changing frequently and without warning. Dye your hair a different color each week and ensure that you'll never be noticed. Try combinations of highlight patterns and full dye jobs. If you have facial hair, shave it into a different shape or get rid of it completely. If you don't have any, consider growing a beard or a sneaky mustache."

      "content": "Wear glasses and sunglasses. It worked for Clark Kent. By adding some frames to your wardrobe, you'll pass the \"glance test.\" People will recognize you when they look closely, sure, but you'll be able to get past their initial screen. By adding glasses or sunglasses, you'll round out a disguise. [2] X Research source If you have contacts, consider trying color-change contacts, or digging out those old frames you no longer wear."

      "title": "Make friends with make-up.",
      "content": "Make friends with make-up. For a dramatic effect, paint moles, beauty marks, wrinkles or other imperfections on your face. Get a spray-on tan or a conspicuous fake tattoo. Even if you don't normally wear make-up, a little can go a long way in changing your appearance. Just adding some eyeliner and changing your clothes can give you a whole different aura."

    {
      "title": "Change your size and posture.",
      "content": "Change your size and posture. Try changing your height with heeled shoes, or by slouching more and carrying yourself differently than usual. Consider losing or gaining weight, if you have the time to do so, or simply begin dressing as if you had. Pad your clothes with extra layers to look as if you've put on a few pounds."

    {
      "title": "Change your style of clothes.",
      "content": "Change your style of clothes. If you usually look tidy and stylish, consider decking yourself out in punk clothes or going goth . Wear old clothes that you rarely ever wear, or raid one of your parent's closets for vintage stuff your acquaintances won't be used to seeing. Consider dressing up or dressing down in age. If you usually dress like a 19 year old, consider how your father dresses and start taking cues from him. Wear polo shirts tucked into khaki pants with your cellphone on a belt clip and you'll age 20 years in a minute. You could consider dressing in a more masculine or feminine style, for example wearing pants where you might normally wear skirts as a way of changing your general presence. If people are used to seeing you in make-up and nice clothes, it'd be a surprise to suddenly be wearing a basketball jersey."

      "content": "Accessorize. It will help for your new look to be believable. [3] X Research source If you combine women's dress pants with cholo shirts, it'll be a surprising disguise, but not necessarily one that will last. It'll just look strange. Think of yourself as an actor who's changing into a character that everyone must believe. Wear hats, appropriate jewelry, and look-appropriate gear."

      "title": "Change the fit of your clothes.",
      "content": "Change the fit of your clothes. Wearing baggier clothes than you usually wear can be a good way of changing your basic body shape and looking different. Buy some surprising items a few sizes larger than you'd normally wear them. Layer your clothes to add some weight to your appearance, then shed layers over the course of the day to ensure that you look different in the morning and at night. No one will be able to find you if you keep changing. Try wearing darker colored clothes to appear smaller and hide your natural physique."

      "title": "Bring back-up clothes.",
      "content": "Bring back-up clothes. A few years ago, an Asian man boarded a plane wearing a silicon mask that made him look like an elderly white man, and then changed clothes and took the mask off in the middle of the flight, getting past everyone. By having a ready supply of clothes to change into (in a back-pack or purse) you can not only disguise yourself but continue evolving your disguise over the course of the day. Keep make-up and emergency hair dye on your person for a quick transformation. Shoe polish can work in a pinch."

      "title": "Develop a new persona.",
      "content": "Develop a new persona. Give your new identity a name and develop a believable story for yourself. This will help you \"get into character\" better, and make your performance more natural. Develop a different sense of humor than you would normally have, start listening to different music, and developing different attitudes. You can even consider working an accent into your disguise. Practice while you're by yourself and only speak in that accent in public. Change your accents periodically with different people to keep them guessing."

      "title": "Age yourself.",
      "content": "Age yourself. Looking older or considerably younger is a particularly effective way to fool people. Dying your hair gray when you're young and working a stooped, hunched walk with a cane into your routine will render you unrecognizable to people who know you. Putting a pebble into your shoe is uncomfortable, but if you're committed to disguising yourself, it can be a good way to ensure that you'll walk differently. Brace your knee with a brace to give yourself a natural limp."

      "content": "Avoid people. The most important part of a disguise is to not to attract attention to yourself. \"Hiding in plain sight\" is the best way to disguise yourself. Avoid making eye contact with people you know, keeping your head low and walking calmly and slowly. Looking as if you're busy, as if you're on your way somewhere in particular with something to do will ensure that you look inconspicuous."
