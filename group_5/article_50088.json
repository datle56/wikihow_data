      "content": "Recite the 6 Kalimas after your daily prayers to affirm your faith. Since some of the Kalimas come from Hadith, not the Holy Quran, it’s best to recite them after you’ve completed your daily prayers. While Salah and Quranic verses must be spoken in Arabic, you can recite the Kalimas in any language. [11] X Research source There’s no specific order you need to recite the Kalimas, and some people choose to recite only one or two. However, others recite them in order from Tayyab to Radde Kufr. Since the Kalimas don’t come from the Holy Quran, a woman can recite them during menstruation. [12] X Research source"
