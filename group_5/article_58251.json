      "title": "The Tarot Cards are cursed possessions that can interact with entities.",
      "content": "The Tarot Cards are cursed possessions that can interact with entities. In Phasmophobia, there are currently seven cursed possessions: the Music Box, Ouija Board, Voodoo Doll, Haunted Mirror, Summoning Circle, Monkey Paw, and Tarot Cards. When these items are found and used, players can provoke the entity to interact with them. This can be useful when determining the ghost , though all objectives can be completed without them. One cursed possession is selected randomly at the start of every game (except with the Insanity difficulty). The locations of these items will vary by map. If you're using Steam , use a Tarot Card by picking up the item with E and then pressing E again to draw. If you're using an Oculus , use the \"interact\" button. If players find Tarot Cards, they will be given a deck of 10 randomly generated cards. There are 10 unique cards that can be drawn, but each card has a different draw chance. It's possible to get multiple of the same Tarot cards in a single deck. When a Tarot Card is drawn, it will vanish in a colored flame. Players can choose to draw cards until the deck of 10 is complete. Once complete, the deck will disappear, and any future hunts will continue for 20 extra seconds. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The Tower. This is one of the most common cards at a 20% draw rate. When this card is drawn, it will cause a ghost interaction and increase activity for 20 seconds. Ghosts can interact with objects, doors, electronics, and more. If you have a D.O.T.S. Projector , you may be able to see the ghost. The Tower can help you narrow down your investigation. When used, the card will burn blue."

      "title": "The Wheel of Fortune.",
      "content": "The Wheel of Fortune. With the same draw rate as The Tower, this card can either help or harm you. If the card burns green, you'll get 25% sanity, but if the card burns red, you'll lose 25% sanity. In most cases, the entity will target you if your sanity level is low."

      "title": "Death.",
      "content": "Death. There's a 10% chance to draw the Death card. When drawn, a cursed hunt will begin. This is similar to a regular hunt, but it will ignore any hunt cooldowns and sanity thresholds. In this case, you can try to use a crucifix or smudge stick to bind the ghost while you hide or make your escape. When used, this card burns purple. Smudge sticks are often burned and used to cleanse an area occupied with ghosts."

      "title": "The Devil.",
      "content": "The Devil. At a 10% draw rate, this card triggers a Ghost Event towards a player. In most cases, this will affect the player closest to the ghost.

      "title": "The Hermit.",
      "content": "The Hermit. When this card is drawn, it will teleport the entity back to its \"room\" and traps it there for one minute.

This card can be helpful if you're in a large map and need help pinpointing the ghost room. When used, this card burns cyan."

      "title": "The Moon.",
      "content": "The Moon. At a 5% draw chance, this card will immediately drop the player's sanity to 0%. When your sanity is low, you become the ghost's top target. If you draw this card, you should take sanity pills (if available) and/or return to the van to keep an eye on your team from the monitors instead. This card burns white when used."

    {
      "title": "The Sun.",
      "content": "The Sun. As the opposite of The Moon, this card fully restores the player's sanity level to 100%, regardless of the starting level. Keep in mind that you'll have high sanity, but you won't be invincible to all ghost attacks. When used, this card burns yellow."

      "title": "The High Priestess.",
      "content": "The High Priestess. If you're nearing the end of your investigation and have a few teammates dead, this card will resurrect a player at random. If no player on your team is dead, this card will instantly revive the next player who dies. Keep in mind that if a player dies and is revived during the same hunt, they won't be killed again until the next hunt. With a 2% chance to draw this card, a rocky investigation could turn into a success. This card will burn light yellow when used."

      "title": "The Hanged Man.",
      "content": "The Hanged Man. At a 1% draw chance, this card is the rarest and deadliest card to pull. When drawn, the player is killed instantly. The only way to avoid death from this card is to have the Friendly Ghost custom difficulty option enabled beforehand; this turns the card into The Fool variant instead. If you're playing with friends , they can continue to pull Tarot Cards to attempt a save with The High Priestess card, but their chances are very low."
