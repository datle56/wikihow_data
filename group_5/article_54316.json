This formula is used for both sine and cosine functions, so you can follow the same steps for either. Divide 2 π {\\displaystyle 2\\pi } by the absolute value of your coefficient B. The absolute value of B is the non-negative value of B. For example, the absolute value is 3 if B equals 3 or -3. [2] X Research source Suppose your sine function is f ( x ) = sin ⁡ ( 2 x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=\\sin \\left(2x\\right)} . In this case, B = 2 {\\displaystyle B=2} . Plug 2 into the formula to get Period = 2 π / | 2 | = 2 π / 2 = π {\\displaystyle {\\text{Period}}=2\\pi /|2|=2\\pi /2=\\pi } . In this case, the period of the sine function is π {\\displaystyle \\pi } .

      "title": "A periodic function is a function that repeats itself at regular intervals.",
      "content": "A periodic function is a function that repeats itself at regular intervals. The period of a function is the distance between each repetition. Periodic functions are represented by the formula f ( x + p ) = f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x+p)=f(x)} , where p {\\displaystyle p} is the period of the function and f {\\displaystyle f} is the periodic function. [8] X Research source A periodic function is also defined by having a positive real number (i.e., a number greater than zero) to represent p {\\displaystyle p} . Therefore, f ( x + p ) = f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x+p)=f(x)} is true for x {\\displaystyle x} being all real numbers. The fundamental period of a function is the lowest possible value of the positive real number p {\\displaystyle p} , or the period in which a function repeats itself. The sine wave is a classic example of a periodic function. The sine wave graph looks like the same wave shape repeated over and over again. The distance between the peaks (or valleys) of each subsequent wave on the graph is the period of the function , as it represents the distance between each repetition."

      "content": "Periodic functions are also defined by amplitude, phase/vertical shift, and frequency. The common form for graphing periodic functions is f ( x ) = A sin ⁡ ( B x + C ) + D {\\displaystyle f(x)=A\\sin(Bx+C)+D} or f ( x ) = A cos ⁡ ( B x + C ) + D {\\displaystyle f(x)=A\\cos(Bx+C)+D} , where A = amplitude , B = frequency, –C/B = phase shift , and D = vertical shift . While the period of a function defines the distance between each repetition of the curve, these other coefficients define other dimensions of the graph. [9] X Research source The amplitude of a periodic function is the height or highest point of each peak in a curve pattern. Amplitude can be found by graphing the function, identifying the minimum and maximum values of the function, then halving that difference. That final number is the amplitude. [10] X Research source The frequency of a periodic function is the number of repeated wave patterns within a certain interval. For sine and cosine functions, this interval is often from 0 - 2pi. For tangent functions, it’s typically from 0 - pi. A phase shift is when a curve shifts horizontally on a graph to the left or right of its normal position. The phrase shift does not affect the other variables in a periodic function, i.e. the frequency, period, or amplitude. A vertical shift is when a curve shifts vertically on the graph to be higher or lower than its usual position. If D is negative, the function will shift vertically DOWN the y -axis—if positive, the function will shift upward."
