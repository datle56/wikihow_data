For a stronger oil-fighting mixture , combine hydrogen peroxide and baking soda into a paste. Hydrogen peroxide eats away at oil and grease, making it a great option for large, stubborn Aquaphor stains. Dab a small drop of hydrogen peroxide onto an inconspicuous part of your clothes to make sure it doesn’t stain them before using it."
