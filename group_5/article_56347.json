      "content": "Wear a fitted dress shirt to make it easier to tuck in. If your shirt is too large, the excess fabric will work its way up during the day. Look for a shirt that fits snugly against your mid-section. A fitted shirt leaves less fabric to come untucked. [1] X Research source Ensure that the shirt isn't too short. It shouldn't ride up if you sit down or bend over. If it does, it will probably untuck at some point. There should be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of fabric below the beltline for you to tuck in."
