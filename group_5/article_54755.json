Go slowly and be patient, as the carpet might be difficult to cut through at first. Continue pulling up the fibers as you cut to make sure you’re not missing any burnt pieces below the top layer. [3] X Research source You can use regular scissors or a smaller, sharper pair with a curved edge, like the kind often used for trimming hangnails. Brush the burnt pieces off to the side and pick them up with a vacuum cleaner or by hand later."
