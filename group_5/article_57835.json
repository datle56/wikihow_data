      "title": "Write down a list of attainable goals and look at it often.",
      "content": "Write down a list of attainable goals and look at it often. Think about the reasons you want to work out, and a few fitness goals you’d like to achieve. Make sure that your goals are very specific, with a clear target and timeline. Put the list somewhere you’ll see it often, like on the refrigerator or near your bathroom mirror. [1] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. Try to include both short-term and long-term goals on your list. For instance, you might include, “Be able to do 50 sit-ups,” as well as, “Finish a marathon.” Do not make your workout all about appearance. Looking good is as good a reason as any to work out. However, this has shortcomings as goal in and of itself. Losing weight will probably make you happier with your appearance, but your looks are a mixture of your weight, complexion, fashion, facial features, and other things that working out will not solve. If you’re working out just because you want to look like a supermodel, you’re probably going to get discouraged because your goals are only achievable for a very, very few. Avoid comparing yourself to other unrealistic goals. If you are 45, even if you got down to your high school weight you will not look 17 years old. \"Looking good\" is a vague goal, so it may be hard to measure. It can get discouraging if you do not feel you look better, even if maybe you do. Or if your appearance is due to a bad hair day rather than your waistline. Work up to big goals. If you haven't exercised in months, don't list something impossible (like you want to bench press over 200 pounds). You will be quickly discouraged if you set unattainable goals."

      "content": "Replace the word “should” with the word “want.” If you tell yourself you “should” do something or you “have to” do something, you’ll find it harder to get started. Instead, look at your list of goals and remind yourself why you want to work out in the first place. [2] X Research source For example, if you think, \"I should go for a run right now, but I don't want to,\" try reminding yourself of a goal, like, \"I want to feel stronger and more confident, and running today will help me accomplish that.\""

      "title": "Buy yourself some cool new workout gear.",
      "content": "Buy yourself some cool new workout gear . If you only have one pair of gym shorts or yoga pants, it’s easy to skip working out because you haven’t done laundry. Treat yourself to a few new pieces of athletic wear that you really love. You’ll be excited to work out just to have an excuse to wear them! Quality running, walking or hiking shoes are important to be fitted properly to you, to prevent injuries and make your experience more pleasant. Cheap, ill fitting shoes will lead to issues like shin splints, foot issues, knee and back pain. It is OK to use what you have. Putting down money on athletic gear helps you commit to an activity. But that might not be affordable for you if you do not have the cash handy. Ask for loaner gear if necessary. Usually a gym, team, or organization will be happy to provide a new person with loaner gear to try before committing. For example, an ice hockey rec league may have some extra pads and skates available if asked. Workout gear can be expensive, so don’t try to buy it all at once if you don’t have the extra money. Just buy one or two pieces whenever you can, and keep your eye out for good sales. Try setting your workout gear on a chair or a table so it’s out in the open. That way, it will keep the idea of working out at the forefront of your mind."

      "content": "Find a workout buddy if you like having an accountability partner. Some people prefer to work out alone, but you might find motivation from having a friend to help keep you on track. The two of you can plan to work out together, or you can just talk at the end of each day and discuss whether you both met your goals. [3] X Research source Talking to a friend can be really helpful for identifying the barriers that keep you from working out. Having to explain the reason you didn’t hit the gym will force you to really think about the underlying cause, whether it be due to self-doubt, stress, or feeling overwhelmed. A group fitness class can be a great way to find a supportive group of people who will motivate you to work out."

      "content": "Make a playlist that makes you want to move. Music that is between 125-140 beats per minute has been shown to be the most effective for working out. Pick fast-paced music with a strong beat that you can jam out to while you exercise. [4] X Research source Songs at 140 bpm include \"Womanizer\" by Britney Spears, \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson, \"Mr. Jones\" by Counting Crows, and \"OMG\" by Usher. Start listening to your playlist while you’re getting dressed to get you in the right frame of mind before your workout even starts."

      "content": "Aim to work out 3 days per week. Setting a manageable goal, like exercising 3 times a week, makes it more likely that you'll meet your goal, because you won't feel discouraged if you miss a day. When you are able to work out without feeling pressured, you might even find that you're motivated to work out more often than your goal! In general, you should do 150 minutes of cardio a week, and add resistance training on at least 2 days of the week."

      "content": "Add both cardio and strength training to your routine. When you're focusing on getting in shape, it's important to balance endurance training, or cardio, with strength training exercises like lifting weights. Some workouts will have both, like a well made Zumba workout or circuit training. Combining resistance training and cardio is a great way to do both at once. Jump squats, burpees, and mountain climbers can be added into your cardio routine. Crossfit and circuit training are other options. Depending on your level of fitness, it's perfectly OK to start with just one type of exercise. You might want to start by just walking, or a 15 minute strength workout you found on YouTube. Aim for a well balanced workout, but start wherever works for you."

If you sign up for a class you have to pay for even if you don't attend, you'll find yourself feeling more inclined to show up. [6] X Research source Fitness classes are also a great way to find a supportive community, and you get the benefit of a trainer who can critique your form. Look for fitness classes that combine cardio and resistance training. Circuit classes and Crossfit may be good options. Depending on your interests, you could try yoga classes, spin class, kickboxing, or dance lessons."

      "content": "Start with short workouts that you’re likely to complete. Don’t try to force yourself to work out for an hour the very first time you exercise. Instead, start with small goals that you feel are manageable, like doing 10 jumping jacks and 10 push-ups .

If you’re finding it hard to get started, try bargaining with yourself. Tell yourself you just have to put on your workout clothes, but you don’t have to do anything else. [9] X Research source After that, try telling yourself to just go outside and stretch, do your warm-up routine, or drive to the gym."

[10] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 30 June 2020.

If you do the exact same thing every day, whether it’s running around the block or doing the same workout video, you’ll start to get bored. You may stop seeing the same results once your body is used to the exercise, and this can affect your motivation. Try to change up your workout routine to keep challenging yourself.

When you don’t feel like working out, take out the journal and read how good each workout made you feel, and look at how far you’ve come. [12] X Research source One of your journal entries might read, “I finally beat my best time on running a mile! I feel excited and strong, but I think I can still go faster!”"
