      "title": "A “parallel universe” is one of countless alternate realities.",
      "content": "A “parallel universe” is one of countless alternate realities. It’s all theoretical science, but it’s fun to think about! Some scientists speculate that our universe might be infinite and believe it could actually be a “multiverse.” If the universe is limitless, then it’s possibly home to an infinite amount of realities that are parallel to each other because there’s just so much space. [1] X Research source In other words, parallel worlds would be on top of, below, or to the side of your current reality. People who are really spiritual, like those who enjoy New Age practices, also talk about “parallel universes.” They usually discuss how they can achieve their dreams or learn about themselves by seeing who they are in an alternate reality."

      "content": "Travel through space with the de Broglie Wavelength. An AU with a high-tech machine can deliver you to your alternate self. Reach out to another society where you have access to equipment capable of sending out a wavelength that can reach infinite realities. It’ll be able to pick up your signal and bring you over to a parallel universe. [2] X Research source A de Broglie wavelength has a very high value of “kinetic energy” and “associated potential energy,” so some scientists believe it can help you travel to a parallel universe really quickly."

      "content": "Jump through an Einstein-Rosen wormhole. Fall into this black hole for a shortcut to encounter your alternate self. Think of a wormhole, or a black hole, as similar to a bullet train—travel through this shortcut and you might come into contact with a version of yourself in a parallel universe millions of light-years away in practically no time at all. [3] X Research source Technically speaking, once technology is developed to safely travel through a wormhole without the danger of it collapsing in on you, you’ll travel faster than the speed of light."

      "content": "Find the distance, time, and tech needed to enter an AU. Create a special formula to outline how you'll run into your alternate self. Take charge of one of your parallel universes and design a special way to find yourself in a parallel universe. You might even discover one AU where you’re the brilliant scientist responsible for changing the multiverse with your discovery. [4] X Research source Formula 1 : “My alternate self will travel 1 million light years in 1 second with a special machine.” Formula 2 : “My alternate self will instantly travel to the closest parallel universe through astral projection.” Formula 3 : “My alternate self will access the furthest parallel universe by reading a magical tome.”"

      "content": "Hop into an alternate reality that’s 2D. Imagine a flat universe to see yourself as a comic book character. Think about a parallel universe where everything is two-dimensional. [5] X Research source For some extra fun, think about what comic book you’d live in and what type of character you’d be in this special universe. If you’re feeling super creative, follow the adventures of your alternate self by illustrating your own comic book—this unique type of magic is called a “hypersigil,” a way to manifest another reality. [6] X Research source Comic Book 1 : \"I'm the superhero Holiday Hurricane, and I fly in to take on villains in underserved neighborhoods while supporting mental health!\" Comic Book 2 : \"I am the random barista that everyone thinks is an NPC but actually is responsible for giving them life-changing advice.\" Comic Book 3 : \"I am a high-level sorceress that people suspect is a villain, yet I'm really saving the planet with counter-curses!\""

      "content": "Access the 4th dimension. Travel through time and see your past or future. Imagine the 4th dimension as every point of time in space in every parallel universe. Decide where you'd like to go or who you'd like to come in contact with—maybe you may want to visit your past self from this current reality, so travel to meet yourself 4 years ago. Then again, you might want to see yourself 10 years from now in an AU. Tapping into any time period is possible in the 4th dimension. [7] X Research source 4 Years Ago, Current Reality : \"I told myself, a grieving teenager who was dumped on prom night, that she'd meet a total prince after she landed her dream job.\" 10 Years From Now, Alternate Reality : \"I ran into myself in a farmer's market and learned that I will enjoy a humble life growing nourishing fruits and vegetables in an alternate world.\""

Find your Higher Self, a spiritual being that's free from pain or fear and that only experiences pure love, in the 5th dimension. To access the 5th dimension, or \"5D,\" activate your imagination and creativity. Something as simple as listening to your favorite song or meditating on kindness can help you channel the 5D. [8] X Research source If you elevate your vibration —aka \"raise your vibes\"—then you're more likely to reach the 5th dimension. When you process your emotions and engage in self-reflection, you'll lift your energy so you can enter 5D, which receives higher frequencies."

      "content": "Imagine a differently colored world to see your alternate self. Focus on the vibrant new shades of an AU to call out to another “you.” As a quick and fun way to visualize yourself in a parallel reality, switch up the color scheme a bit. For instance, maybe the Moon is purple, a shade associated with creativity, and the Sun is black, a hue connected with mystery. In this world, your alternate self might cast spells under the darkness of the Sun and pray to the Moon to ask for artistic abundance. [9] X Research source AU 1 : Green-skinned maidens are considered legendary beauties, so you buy emerald-toned foundation to impress a lover. AU 2 : Everyone wears yellow when they’re in grief, so you wear a goldenrod sweater to your mom’s funeral. AU 3 : You glow with a blue aura, which represents tranquility, so people flock to you when they need healing. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Write a message to communicate with your alternate self. A sincere note can help you talk to a past, future, or AU self. Once you write this letter, you’ll create an artifact that can explain why you acted a certain way in the past, who you intend to become in the future, or who you may be in another reality. When you open up your heart and are really sincere, your alternate selves can learn a lot from each other. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Letter to a Past Self : “ I said that I hated Christmas decorations for being cheesy, but really, seeing tinsel and sparkling ornaments just reminded me that I felt totally alone in that small town. I booked that ticket to New York in order to shake things up and be around a diverse crowd .” Letter to a Future Self : “ I wonder where life will take me. Did you ever open up a cupcake boutique next to the crystal shop, just like you intended to? Are your customers really witchy and funny? Do they offer free charms or curses because your flavors are unforgettable? ” Letter to an AU Self : “ What can you tell me about alien life? Are there many different types of intergalactic civilizations? Are they all friendly? Can they communicate with each other? ”"

      "content": "Currently, there’s no hard evidence that parallel universes are real. Until a conclusive study determines that alternate realities exist and that there’s a multiverse, we can consider parallel universes the stuff of sci-fi. Still, imagining parallel universes can offer you a fun escape and give you a creative outlet. For example, you can: [12] X Research source Picture a parallel universe to visualize a different career path. Imagine going back in time in order to feel like you’re in the “past” again. Meditate on ascending to the 5th dimension, the spirit realm, to see your “Higher Self.”"
