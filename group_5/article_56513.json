      "content": "\"Label created not yet in system\" means the retailer has created a label. One of the first steps of a package's journey is its unique label creation. A shipping label provides customers with up-to-date tracking and estimated delivery dates. When a label is created but not yet scanned by the carrier, it's not traveling through their network yet. It can take a couple of hours to days for it to be processed. [1] X Research source USPS may say \"Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item\" or \"Pre-Shipment, USPS Awaiting Item,\" which means the retailer or seller still has the package. UPS will say \"Label Created\" to let customers know they've received the shipment details and billing information. [2] X Research source FedEx will say “In transit” or “At a local FedEx facility.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Shipping labels are created, affixed, and scanned before going on a truck. A package passes through many hands before landing on your doorstep. When you make a purchase, the retailer will create a shipping label with a unique tracking number provided by their carrier. Then, the label is attached to your package and handed over to the carrier. From there, the carrier scans the package into their system to provide real-time updates. [4] X Research source Once the package is scanned into the network, this will trigger the next status, which is often \"In-Transit,\" \"En-Route,\" or \"Shipped/On the Way.\" [5] X Research source You can manually insert the tracking number into the retailer or carrier's site for real-time updates and estimated delivery dates."
