      "content": "Older nickel-based batteries had a \"memory effect\" that made discharging them occasionally improve their lifespan. The older batteries would start to remember where you would start to charge them and consider that reading as a 0% charge. In essence, if you would charge the battery whenever it reached 65%, that would become the new 0%, thus shortening the lifespan. However, discharging and charging it would help eliminate that memory effect."
