    {
      "title": "Pick a mangosteen with a glossy sheen and no leaking juices.",
      "content": "Pick a mangosteen with a glossy sheen and no leaking juices. For the best results, look for a mangosteen with a firm outer skin and no cracks, leaking juice, or hardened resin. If the mangosteen has a cap of green leaves, make sure the cap is healthy-looking and no bugs are hiding beneath. [1] X Research source Hardened resin on the outside of the rind indicates that the juices have seeped out of the fruit and the fruit isn't fresh."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your fingers to remove the leaves and stem from the top.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to remove the leaves and stem from the top. The cap on a mangosteen is made up of 4 leaves and a stem. Before you open the rind, use your fingers to pluck the cap off of the fruit. Discard the cap after you take it off. [2] X Research source The bottom of the fruit has brown, raised ridges. The number of petals on the bottom of the fruit corresponds to the number of sections in the mangosteen. You don’t need to remove this part."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press on the top of the fruit with your thumb.",
      "content": "Press on the top of the fruit with your thumb. After you remove the cap, the top of the shell will be slightly softer than the rest of the outer rind. Hold the fruit in one hand, then use your thumb or index finger to press in on the indentation at the top of the mangosteen. The fruit should give slightly, preparing the outer rind to be broken. [3] X Research source Don’t push too hard, as you could damage the soft flesh inside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze on the sides of the mangosteen until the purple shell cracks.",
      "content": "Squeeze on the sides of the mangosteen until the purple shell cracks. After you’ve made a slight crack in the top of the mangosteen, hold the fruit in the fingertips of both hands. Apply gentle pressure to the shell by squeezing until it splits open. [4] X Research source The mangosteen shell is about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) thick, but it starts to harden after the fruit is harvested. A very fresh mangosteen will be easy to split by squeezing it, but if it’s been a while, the shell may be tough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a shallow, horizontal cut around the shell if it's tough.",
      "content": "Make a shallow, horizontal cut around the shell if it's tough. If your mangosteen shell doesn't crack easily, carefully use a thin, sharp paring knife to make a 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 3 in (0.64–0.85 cm) deep, horizontal cut around the shell. Then, twist and lift off the top of the shell. [5] X Research source Don't cut all the way into the shell, as you could damage the fruit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull out the white flesh with your fingers and eat it.",
      "content": "Pull out the white flesh with your fingers and eat it. Pick out the flesh with your hands or use a small fork. Large segments of mangosteen fruit usually contain a seed, so watch out for these while eating. Smaller segments are usually seedless. [6] X Research source Mangosteen seeds are white when the fruit is fresh, but as the fruit ages, the seeds start to turn brown, affecting the color of the fruit. The whiter the flesh, the fresher the fruit. [7] X Research source Yellow sections of mangosteen flesh can be very bitter. Whole mangosteen can be stored at room temperature for several days. However, once you cut open the shell, place any remaining fruit in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week."

      "title": "Peel 3 to 4 large, ripe mangosteens.",
      "content": "Peel 3 to 4 large, ripe mangosteens. To make mangosteen juice, choose several large mangosteens with firm, glossy skin. Either squeeze them to crack the skin open or use a small, sharp knife to make a shallow cut horizontally around the skin, then lift away the top half to expose the fruit inside. [8] X Research source This drink is also known as santol-ade."

    {
      "title": "Chop up the fruit and remove the seeds.",
      "content": "Chop up the fruit and remove the seeds. Place the white, fleshy fruit on a cutting board and carefully use a sharp knife to cut the fruit into small pieces. The fruit should cut easily and will likely fall apart, so don’t worry about making the pieces evenly sized. Just break up the fruit as much as you can. [9] X Research source Consider placing the fruit into a bowl after it’s cut to catch any juices that run out."

      "content": "Add the chopped-up mangosteen to the water and stir. Once the sugar is completely dissolved, place the chopped-up mangosteen in the pitcher. Give the mixture another good stir or shake, but don’t worry about getting it completely blended. The flavor of the fruit will infuse into the drink as it rests. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the pitcher in the refrigerator for 4 hours.",
      "content": "Place the pitcher in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Santol-ade needs time to steep to fully infuse the flavor of the mangosteen. Plus, the drink tastes better when it’s chilled. [13] X Research source This drink naturally browns as it sits. When ready, it may have a color similar to diluted apple juice."

    {
      "title": "Strain, if desired, and serve over ice.",
      "content": "Strain, if desired, and serve over ice. Some like the texture of the mangosteen in their juice, while others prefer to strain the mixture. If you want a pulp-free beverage, pour the juice through a fine-mesh strainer or coffee filter, then enjoy it on its own or over ice. [14] X Research source If you don’t strain the juice, give it another shake or a stir before you serve it. Drink the juice within 1 to 3 days, and store it in the fridge."

      "content": "A ripe mangosteen has a purple rind and is easy to open. Picking a ripe mangosteen is easier than it looks! The ripest mangosteens have a deep purple color, are soft to the touch, and can be easily opened. Here’s what to look for in a ripe mangosteen in more detail: [15] X Research source The rind is a deep purple or maroon color. A pale or yellow mangosteen is underripe. The mangosteen slightly gives when pressed. A hard mangosteen is a sign of over-ripeness. The fruit opens easily when squeezed. If you have to pull the rind apart, the mangosteen is either under- or overripe. The fruit is opaque white and firm. A translucent or yellow fruit is a sign of under- or over-ripeness."

      "title": "Yes, you can eat mangosteen raw!",
      "content": "Yes, you can eat mangosteen raw! The most traditional way to eat mangosteen is as-is—simply enjoy it like an apple, peach, or banana. However, you can get a bit more creative and bake it into sweet treats or sauté it into curry dishes. Add raw mangosteen to a salad as a sweet salad topper. [16] X Research source Replace the peaches in a peach tart with mangosteen for a more unique flavor. Put a splash of mangosteen juice or mangosteen pieces into curry or stir-fry to sweeten the dish’s overall flavor. Puree raw or canned mangosteen with pineapple and brown sugar and simmer on medium heat to make a mangosteen pineapple sauce. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Mangosteens have a sweet and tangy taste.",
      "content": "Mangosteens have a sweet and tangy taste. This interesting fruit is often compared to peaches; however, it has an entirely unique flavor profile that’s often said to be a mix of mango, strawberry, and pineapple. Many describe the taste as sweet and tangy, with hints of vanilla and citrus. The texture of a perfectly ripe mangosteen is soft and juicy, much like a ripe peach. [18] X Research source Because of its sweet and tropical flavor, mangosteen pairs well with banana, pineapple, and coconut. Use mangosteen in tropical smoothies, or top yogurt bowls or puddings and cake with cut pieces of the fruit."
