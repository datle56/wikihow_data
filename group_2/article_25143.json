      "content": "Throw on bulky clothes and long sleeves to avoid stings. Put a knit cap on to cover your head, protect your neck, nose, and mouth with a scarf, and put some goggles or big glasses on to keep your eyes safe. Throw on some shoes, long pants, and gloves. [1] X Expert Source Steve Downs Live Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 23 February 2020. Most wasps won’t be able to penetrate thick clothing, so layer up to minimize the odds you get stung. [2] X Research source The odds are very high that you’ll be able to remove the wasp without getting stung, but it’s still better to be safe than sorry. If you’ve got some time on your hands or you want a solid outfit for any future wasp-related encounters, you can always make a beekeeper’s suit."

      "content": "If you make a bunch of rash movements, the wasp might attack. The vast majority of wasps want nothing to do with you, and they’ll leave you alone unless they’re provoked. [3] X Expert Source Steve Downs Live Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 23 February 2020. If you’ve got a wasp nearby, take a deep breath and slowly move away to plan your next move. If you start swatting at it, flailing, or freaking out, the wasp might attack. [4] X Research source Most wasp species avoid people unless they get too close to their nest, or they sense food. Since you aren’t being swarmed by a mob of wasps right now, you probably aren’t near a nest. This means that you’ve got food nearby. If you’re eating or near a trash can, get some distance and the wasp shouldn’t follow you. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "If you don’t have commercial spray, make your own.",
      "content": "If you don’t have commercial spray, make your own. Fill a spray bottle with 16.9 fluid ounces (500 mL) of water and 2–4 tablespoons (30–59 mL) of liquid dish soap. Put the top on the bottle and shake it up. Mist the wasp directly with your spray and take a few steps back in case it comes at you (if it does, it will be mostly immobilized, so don’t worry too much). The soap and water will kill the wasp. If the wasp doesn’t die instantly, it should die in the next 5-30 seconds. The soap clogs their pores and makes it impossible for the wasp to breathe or move."

      "title": "This is risky option unless you think you can manage it in one swipe.",
      "content": "This is risky option unless you think you can manage it in one swipe. Wasps are fast, and if they feel attacked they’re going to try and sting their attacker. If you’re feeling confident about your aim and speed, grab a flyswatter and wait for the wasp to stop moving. Then, strike hard and fast to take that wasp down. [6] X Research source Make sure the wasp is 100% dead once you hit it. If you only injure the wasp, it may release a pheromone that attracts other wasps. If you take a swing and miss, run for cover. Get some distance and do not turn to fight it off if you want to avoid being stung. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Any insecticide spray that lists wasps on the label should kill it.",
      "content": "Any insecticide spray that lists wasps on the label should kill it. These sprays come in a liquid or foam, and either will kill a single wasp with no problem. Read the label to see how far you should stand away, aim carefully, and spray the wasp. [8] X Research source Most of these sprays are designed to work from a good distance. In most cases, you should be able to hit the wasp from 10–20 feet (3.0–6.1 m) away. If you’re indoors, you may want to wait for the wasp to land on an area that you don’t mind staining. Many commercial wasp sprays are oil-based, and you may end up with some minor discoloration on whatever surface you spray. Read the label to see if it mentions anything about staining wood, metal, or drywall."

      "title": "Destroy the nest",
      "content": "Destroy the nest at night when wasps are less active. Wasps are communal so they typically nest in groups. Pick up a can of insecticide designed specifically for wasps, and read the instructions on the label. Stand back and spray a liberal amount of the insecticide into the nest’s entrance. Then, get out of there fast. In most cases, one application of the insecticide is more than enough to destroy a colony. If you see any wasps floating around the next day, repeat the process. If you can, hire a pro to do this. That’s going to be the safest way to 100% remove the wasp nest and ensure that they don’t rebuild. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "If a lone wasp is relaxing on a window or wall, carefully let it out.",
      "content": "If a lone wasp is relaxing on a window or wall, carefully let it out. You can use a pre-built lure trap, or use the “cup and paper” move. It might seem scary, but the wasp shouldn’t freak out if you carefully place a cup over it, slide a paper underneath, and release the wasp outside. If you don’t want to get close, pick up a wasp lure trap at your local building supply store. Read the instructions and set it out near your wasp. When the wasp enters the trap, take it outside and let it go. [10] X Research source Lure traps are very unlikely to work on hornets or paper wasps. If you’ve got yellowjackets, it should work, though! [11] X Research source Only do the cup and paper move if you’ve got a solitary wasp who doesn’t seem especially upset and you’re positive that there isn’t a nest nearby. If the wasp looks like it’s trying to find a way out (i.e. it’s hanging out near a window or wall and it’s not eating), it’s very unlikely to come back after you release it. If the wasp doesn’t go into the trap after 30 minutes or so, put it far away from you. Leaving a lure trap out for too long may attract more wasps to your area. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "If a bothersome wasp is bothering your plants, set a trap. Purchase any hanging bait-style wasp trap online or at your local store. For your bait, use 2-parts water, 2-parts apple juice, 2-parts apple cider vinegar, ½-part sugar, and a few drops of dish soap. Set the trap up outside and empty it out whenever it fills up with wasps. Refill it as needed until the wasps are no longer an issue. [13] X Research source Refill these traps every 2-3 days and whenever it rains. Do not skip the soap! The soap is the only ingredient in these traps that will kill the wasps. These DIY vinegar traps may not work with certain species of wasp. [14] X Research source You can also make a wasp trap and follow the directions to bait and maintain it."

Keep your distance and simply give the wasp a few minutes to find the exit. [15] X Expert Source Steve Downs Live Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 23 February 2020. The odds are high that the wasp doesn’t want to be indoors anyway, so it should have no problem leaving on its own accord. [16] X Research source If the wasp seems to be attracted to some food or drink you have, set the attractive item outside."

      "content": "Wasps can’t withstand a strong wind, so grab a fan to blow it out. Grab a blow dryer, handheld fan, or a table fan with a long extension cord to send the wasp flying away from you. This is a particularly good option if you opened some windows but the wasp is still refusing to leave. Just use the lowest speed setting and try to work it slowly away from you. Once it’s out of the car or room, shut the windows and go about your day. [17] X Research source The wasp shouldn’t register the airflow as a threat, so don’t worry about angering the wasp. You might be able to get away with using canned air as well. This may be too strong for a wasp though, which might injure or irritate the wasp and cause it to turn aggressive."
