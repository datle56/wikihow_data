You can use any color of seed bead you want, but avoid using ones that are too small, or you won't fit them onto the pin. A size \"10/0\" would be ideal. [1] X Research source This design will create a thick cuff-like bracelet that is covered with seed beads. For a wider bracelet, use 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) safety pins. For a narrower bracelet, use ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) safety pins. [2] X Research source"

You will need to pinch this gap shut so that you can't open the pin any more. If you can still push the safety pin open, you need to pinch the clasp tighter. For extra security, add a drop of glue into the clasp before you close the pin. Super glue would work the best. [3] X Research source"

Black or white elastic will work the best for this, but you can also use the clear kind instead. Choose a thicker elastic, about 0.7mm, to ensure that the bracelet will be sturdy enough.

Next, slide the elastic through the bottom hole of your next pin. Keep going, alternating the pins, until you've used them all. Make sure that the beads on the pins are all facing forward. The last pin should be upside down. If the last pin is right-side-up, take it off."
