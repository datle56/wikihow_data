      "content": "Practice gratitude for everything you have. Instead of thinking of all of the negative things you’re dealing with right now, try to think about the positives. Focus on what you do have going for you rather than what you don’t. For instance, if you’re struggling with finances right now, you can practice gratitude by thinking about some of the things that you do have, such as a place to live and a tasty meal to eat. You can be grateful for anything you have, whether it’s tangible or intangible. For example, if you have a loving partner or a great friend to support you, that’s a great thing! If it helps, try making a list of everything that you’re grateful for. Even if you’re dealing with something really difficult, like the death of a close friend or loved one, you can find gratitude in the happy memories you have of them."

      "content": "Think about the positive things that can come as a result. When you’re dealing with a lot of difficult or stressful things at once, it can be easy to fall into the trap of seeing yourself as a victim of circumstance. Instead, think about what got you into the situation and why things are tough right now. Try to think about the potential positive things that can happen and what you can do to try to improve your situation. [1] X Research source Asking questions can help you get to the root of the problem. For instance, if you’re failing a class, you can ask yourself why you’re struggling and what steps you can take to turn things around. If you were laid off or fired from your job, for example, don’t think about it as something you’ll never recover from. Instead, consider all of the new possibilities open to you and the new potential jobs you could try to get."

It can feel like the world is piling on top of you during tough times, but it’s important that you keep your perspective focused on what’s important.

If you’re struggling with a health problem such as obesity, you could try asking questions like, “What can I do to improve my health?” and come up with solutions such as, “I can make sure I have some veggies with each meal and take a walk at least once a day.”"
