      "content": "Lisan al-Gaib means \"Voice from the Outer World\" in the Dune universe. Dune (a science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, published in 1965) takes readers to a desert planet called Arrakis thousands of years in the future. Arrakis has been occupied by the Imperium, an empire that rules the entire Known Universe. The Imperium is mining the planet for an extremely valuable resource called spice. The native people, called the Fremen, believe in the prophecy of Lisan al-Gaib, a messiah who will come from another world, bring water back to the desert, and free the Fremen from their Imperial oppressors. Spice is a drug that provides many helpful benefits to humans, like extending their life span and heightening their senses. Some people who use spice also become prescient, meaning they develop an insight into things that happen before they happen. This substance is absolutely essential for humans to navigate through space, hence why the Imperium is fighting the Fremen for it."

      "content": "Lisan al Gaib is a messianic figure, similar to Jesus. The Fremen, like Christians in the real world, believe their savior will arrive at some unknown future date to save his followers. However, Herbert wrote Dune as a cautionary tale to warn readers against blindly following a charismatic leader. [1] X Research source Did you know? When Herbert published Dune in 1965, he felt that too many readers missed the point by admiring Paul Atreides, the character who fulfills the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy. He wrote the sequel, Dune: Messiah , to drive home the idea that Paul wasn't a heroic figure, but rather a dangerous person who causes the deaths of millions of beings. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Kwisatz Haderach is a powerful male figure who can see the past and the future. In the Dune universe, a sisterhood of witches called the Bene Gesserit have spent millennia using selective breeding to birth a male who possesses their powers. This boy or man is meant to be the only male with the power to see through time and space and access the memories of people who are long dead, as well as glimpse what will happen in the future. He can also use the Voice: an ability which allows him to command people to do whatever he tells them just by speaking. The Bene Gesserit's ultimate plan is to use the Kwisatz Haderach to take over the universe. Did you know? \"Kwisatz Haderach\" means \"shortening of the way\" in a fictional language from the Dune universe called Chakobsa."

      "content": "Lisan al-Gaib is a fake prophecy planted by the Bene Gesserit. The Fremen didn't create or discover the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy on their own. Rather, the Bene Gesserit infiltrated their culture and planted the idea so far back in history that the Fremen think it's real. The Bene Gesserit planted similar \"messiah\" stories in thousands of cultures and planets across the galaxy. They did this so that when the Kwisatz Haderach was finally born, these peoples would accept him as their version of a savior and support him without question."

      "title": "The Mahdi is the Fremen's general concept of a Messiah.",
      "content": "The Mahdi is the Fremen's general concept of a Messiah. In Dune , the Fremen believe in a Mahdi, a messiah who will lead the Fremen and Arrakis to paradise. The Lisan al-Gaib is the specific person who fulfills that role. One way to understand the difference between the Messiah and the Voice of the Outer World is to think about how Christianity and Judaism both teach that a messiah will come to Earth and restore peace to the world. Yet each religion teaches a different idea about who that messiah will be. It's unclear if the Fremen originated the term \"Mahdi\" or if this, too, was an idea seeded by the Bene Gesserit. It's possible the Fremen always believed in a messiah and that the Bene Gesserit simply created a legend to fit their vision. \"Mahdi\" (مهدي) is an Arabic word like Lisan al-Gaib. It means \"guided one\" and refers to a messianic figure in Islam who will reestablish true Islam and bring justice and equity to the world before it ends. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, because Paul Atreides technically fulfills the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy.",
      "content": "Yes, because Paul Atreides technically fulfills the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy. The Lisan al-Gaib prophecy states that a messiah will come from another world and bring peace to Arrakis. He will also bring water back to the planet, which is a barren desert from pole to pole. Paul Atreides technically fulfills all these requirements during his lifetime, so by those standards, he is Lisan al-Gaib. It's important to note, however, that the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy is fake and made up by the Bene Gesserit to manipulate the Fremen. Paul Atreides knows this and debates on whether he should fulfill this \"prophecy\" or not. He eventually chooses to do so to help the Fremen, but also to restore his family name and take control of the universe. The Fremen also refer to Paul as the Mahdi."

      "content": "Yes, Paul Atreides fulfills the requirements of the Kwisatz Haderach. The Kwisatz Haderach is bred to have the power to see into the past and the future through memory. He also has the power of the Voice, which he uses to control other people's actions. Finally, he was created to take over the universe. Paul possesses all the required abilities and does indeed take over the known universe before his death. It's important to note that Paul becomes Padishah Emperor (the ruler of the Imperium) and assumes control over the known universe not by being a benevolent leader, but by sparking a galaxy-wide religious jihad. Did you know? The Kwisatz Haderach was born a generation earlier than what the Bene Gesserit initially planned. But a member of their sisterhood, Lady Jessica Atreides, decided to use her powers to have a boy with her lover, Duke Leto Atreides, instead of a girl as the Bene Gesserit instructed her."

      "content": "In Arabic, Lisan al-Gaib roughly translates to \"tongue of the unseen.\" Herbert was heavily inspired by the Arabic language and Muslim customs while developing the Fremen for Dune . In Arabic, \"lisan\" translates to \"tongue\" or \"voice,\" and \"al-Ghayb\" literally means \"unseen\" or \"hidden.\" Together, the words can mean \"tongue of the unseen\" (لسان الغيب).

      "content": "Muad'Dib Muad'Dib (مؤدّب) means \"one who teaches.\" [5] X Research source In Dune , it's not clear what the actual word means, but the Fremen use it to refer to a specific type of mouse that lives in the desert. The term gains new significance when Paul Atreides adopts it as his nickname. A Fremen leader named Stilgar — who believes Paul is Lisan al-Gaib — explains that Muad'dib is a good name to choose because: \"Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.'\""

[6] X Research source In Dune , it's the name of an ancient giant sandworm that slithers underneath the surface of Arrakis. It's also the name of the Fremen's deity, whom they believe the sandworm represents. Did you know? Sandworm larvae on Arrakis are responsible for creating the spice that the Imperium is mining for and that almost all the characters in the story are addicted to."

      "content": "Jihad Jihad (جِهَاد) means \"struggle\" or \"striving.\" In the Dune universe, it refers to a holy war used to spread the Kwisatz Haderach's rule and conquer other peoples. In the real world, it's used in many different contexts in Islam, both violent and non-violent. For many Muslims, it simply means to strive to overcome the obstacles to doing good. Obstacles can be almost anything from resisting bodily urges like lust or greed, or struggling through pregnancy and parenting to raise a child properly. [7] X Research source"
