If you're busy or on the go, plan for meals that are quick, require little cooking, or recipes that you can freeze for easy-to-prepare meals. Search online for sample meal plans and inspiration."

Stock up on shelf-stable foods for quick and easy balanced meals: canned beans, no-salt-added canned vegetables, canned tuna or chicken, 100% whole grains (like quinoa, 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice), and nut butter. Stock up on frozen items like vegetables (without sauces or seasonings), fruit, pre-cooked grains (like brown rice or quinoa), low-calorie dinners (for busy nights), and proteins (fish or chicken). Keep a supply of fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy (like low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese), and lean proteins (chicken, fish, pork, or lean beef)."

Track as many days as you can. Pay attention to the 5 food groups—are you consuming all of them each day? We are often unaware if we are eating too much or too little of something. A food journal can bring this information to light. When first starting, note where you think you can make improvements or better choices. For example, maybe you're not a big vegetable fan and you typically skimp on this group, or you eat a lot of the same foods each week without much variety."

It's beneficial to consume regular, frequent meals throughout the day. [14] X Expert Source Lyssandra Guerra Certified Nutrition & Wellness Consultant Expert Interview. 25 March 2020. Eating 3 or more meals a day or including snacks makes it easier for you to consume all the recommended amounts of essential nutrients you need each day. Skipping meals puts you at risk of not being able to consume what you need. Regular, frequent meals and snacks provide a steady flow of energy to your brain. The fairly even blood sugar level helps your brain function well. An example of one day of balanced eating may look like: scrambled eggs with vegetables and cheese for breakfast; whole wheat wrap with lean turkey and cheese and 1 cup baby carrots for lunch; a small apple and a cheese stick for an afternoon snack; and large spinach salad with raw vegetables and 4 oz. of grilled salmon for dinner."

It can be easy to overdo it from this group, which can throw off the balance of your diet. 1/2 cup of grains like rice or pasta is a serving and 1 oz of items like bread is also 1 serving.
