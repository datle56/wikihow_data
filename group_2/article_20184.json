Make time to sit down and chat with your partner at least once per day, such as during dinner or over your morning coffee. Say something like, “How was work?” or “Did you have a good time with your friends?” or “What do you have going on today?” Calling or texting during the day. Staying in touch throughout the day can also help to improve your communication. Try sending your partner a quick text or calling just to say hi. You might text your partner something like, “Thinking about you. What are you up to right now?” or call and say “Hey, how’s your day going so far?” Listening. Use good listening skills when your partner is talking to show that you are interested and engaged. For example, face your partner, make eye contact with your partner, nod your head, and make neutral statements to indicate your attention, such as “Yes,” “I see,” and “Go on.”"

It is important to let your partner know that you would like to have sex more often and any other concerns that you have about your sexual relationship. Telling your partner these things can make it easier for you and your partner to come up with solutions to the problem. For example, you can start a conversation about your sex life by saying something like, \"I feel closer to you when we have sex on a regular basis, but we haven't been doing that as much lately. Is everything okay?” Keep in mind that your partner might have had bad sexual experiences in the past with partners who were not as considerate or understanding. Be considerate and let her know she can tell you things without your judgment (if that is true of you)."

Try setting aside 30 minutes per day where you and your partner will do something sexy together with the understanding that it does not have to lead to sex. It can just be a way to relax and feel intimate with your partner. For example, you could take a shower together after hitting the gym, light some candles and enjoy a glass of wine, give each other massages, or just lie in bed and talk for a while. Try not to push sex during this time. Just enjoy the intimacy with your partner and go with the flow. Remember that just because your partner is not in the mood for sex one night, that does not mean he or she will not be in the mood another night."

If you have not yet had sex with your partner, make sure she feels comfortable around you and trusts you. Be considerate of her needs in a non-sexual way, i.e. make sure that she is enjoying the activities you choose for dates, and show interest in her daily life. Celebrate her successes and support her when she is having trouble with school, work, family issues, health problems, or just having a bad day."
