      "content": "Plantains need tropical weather to fruit. In their native habitat, plantains are used to 100 millimetres (3.9 in) of water per month and temperatures around 30 °C (86 °F). For them to fruit reliably, they'll need tropical conditions like this almost year-round. [2] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source In subtropical climates like Florida or most of Australia, you might get plantains to fruit with careful management and plenty of water. In the tropics, you can plant plantains anytime there are at least three months left in the rainy season. Research the climate in your area and if plantains can prosper there before you start planting."

They're surprisingly hardy for tropical plants, so as long as you don't mind the lack of fruit, you can still plant them outside the tropics. Warm growing seasons and mild winters are still best for fast growth. [3] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Mild frost will kill the leaves, while anything colder will cause it to die back to the ground (and grow again in spring). [4] X Research source Below -7ºC (20ºF), plantains need heavy winter protection: burlap wrapping, thick root mulch, and an enclosure filled with at least 1 m (3 ft.) of dry leaves. Below about -12ºC (10ºF), they won't survive outdoors.

Fill the rest of the hole with the lower-quality soil originally from the bottom of the hole. Plant nurseries also sell tiny, container-grown suckers from a plant nursery. These are more fragile in the first couple months, but can work out great if they survive.

So if you know someone with a plantain tree, you can use it to get your own young plantain: Choose a sucker (a growth at the base of the mother plant) at least 30 cm (12 in) tall, and ideally 50 cm (20 in) tall and 15 cm (6 in) across. [10] X Research source The ones with long, blade-like leaves are best for fruit. The ones with broader leaves are stronger, but won't bear fruit. [11] X Research source Disinfect your tools , then dig up the sucker's bulb-like base (the \"corm\"). Try to cut it away from the mother plant with a single stroke of a machete or sharp shovel, and cut as close to the mother plant as you can. [12] X Research source Peel off the outer layer of the corm with a sharp, disinfected knife, starting where the outer layer of leaves attach and peeling all the way down to remove the roots.

[17] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Avoid watering your plants in the middle of the day, as the midday heat can quickly evaporate the water from the soil before the plantain tree gets a chance to drink."

Cover the soil around the plantain plant with one of these organic fertilizers in a circle about 50 centimetres (20 in) across. In addition to fertilizing, this layer traps moisture, stops weeds from growing, and encourages helpful soil microbes. Mixing it into the soil is not necessary and can even damage the root network.

Plantains often need twice as much potassium as nitrogen to produce a good amount of fruit.
