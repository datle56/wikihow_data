      "content": "Begin the interval training. This is the part of the exercise that improves your endurance and builds muscle. Run for one minute at your maximum speed, working hard to bring up your heart rate and exhaust your muscles. Then walk for two minutes, letting your muscles cool down. Push yourself as hard as you can during the one minute of running. Interval training doesn’t work properly if you don’t totally exhaust your muscles. This is called “going into the anaerobic zone,” or exercising the point where you’re literally gasping for breath. [8] X Research source Try to time yourself so that you run for exactly a minute and rest for exactly two minutes. It can be helpful to use a timer app on your phone or to purchase a stopwatch."

It doesn’t seem like a long time, but by the end of the twelve minutes, you should be utterly exhausted. If not, you weren’t pushing yourself hard enough during the minutes of running. Repetition is important because it forces your system to absorb oxygen more efficiently. Over time, this raises the maximum amount of oxygen you can have in your blood. The more oxygen you have, the harder and faster you’ll be able to run!"

Another good way to measure improvement is to run as fast as you can for as long as you can and record the distance and time. After a few weeks of interval training, you will be able to run faster for farther distances than you could previously. If you're training to run a race such as a 5k, take a break from your regular workout once every few weeks and run the full 5k. Keep a journal to record your run times.
