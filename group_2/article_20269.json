As it goes with the rest of your body, the more you exercise your face, the better and tighter it'll look. Smiling is a great exercise because it is psychologically tied in with the experience of being happy, so it's not uncommon to notice an improvement in your mood if you make a regular habit of smiling on impulse.

      "content": "Clench and release your jaw. Getting a better jawline is correlative to working the jaw itself. To do this, try clenching your jaw for 10 seconds before releasing it. This should come with a sense of mild discomfort as well as a subtle burn. Try doing this as many times as you want-- between 10 and 15 should be a good place to start in terms of reps. As time goes on, you should increase the amount of time you're clenching your jaw. This will encourage your jaw to continue toning. Jaw clenching is generally quite easy to fit into a daily routine. Due to the fact that it doesn't look as apparent and silly as many other facial exercises, it's even something you can do at work or on the train."

Maintain the strain for 5 seconds per rep, after which you should relax and give your lips a few seconds to recuperate. You can repeat this exercise as many times as you'd like, although 10 is a good place. This exercise is a great way to improve facial tightness, as the direction and strain work out a wide variety of facial muscles."

      "content": "Make a fish face. Making a 'fish face' is a great exercise for toning up your cheeks and jaw. Suck in your cheeks from inside your mouth and try smiling. Hold the form for at least 5 seconds per rep. It should feel mildly uncomfortable, and by the end of each rep, you should feel a light burn. This is a good thing, as it demonstrates your muscles have been strained by the activity. Repeat this 10 times for a good starting exercise, and feel free to increase the number of reps as it suits you. Exercises like the fish face are very easy to work into your daily routine, so long as you remember to do them. You can do them in the shower or before going to sleep.

Suffice to say, pure H2O intake is a necessary (and shockingly underrated) way of improving your overall health. Drinking water aids in weight loss and improved energy throughout the day. What's more, the surplus moisture will improve circulation throughout your face. Most of its benefits affect your jawline only indirectly, but it's one of the best ways to go about affecting positive physical change. If you have excess weight to lose, drinking water is a great way to shed pounds, as it will keep you feeling full without the excess calories associated with soda pop and junk food. Drinking water has also been proven to accelerate the body's metabolism."

One mistake guys make very often is to trim their neckline too high, usually matching the arc of their jaw. This has the effect of making the jaw look weaker and less defined. If you tend to trim your beard with a higher neck line, try growing it lower than you usually would, all the while making sure the line is well-defined and reasonably well-maintained. If you're having any trouble deciding where your beard's neckline should be, try to imagine a line running in an arc from one ear to the other. This should extend well below the jawline, and should give it a look of greater fullness. [10] X Research source"

[11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oval faces have their widest point at the cheekbones, and are long compared to other face shapes. If you have an ovoid face, consider yourself fortunate; your face is very versatile and can suit a range of styles. Those with round faces will want to pick clothes that make the face look longer. Tight-collared shirts are a great way to go about this. Angular faces (a box shape) suffer an opposite concern than the round faces; if your face is angular, you'll want to add a look of fullness to it. Wide-spread shirt collars can be a good help in this regard."

There are a few ways to do this; if you're not so used to using makeup, getting the effect right may take a few tries before you succeed. These techniques should be kept slight and subtle; this way, the human eye won't notice anything's been done to tweak your jaw's appearance. Contouring your cheek and jaw with a light bronzer will make your jawline more eye-catching. Apply it lightly in a downward motion, one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone. Highlighting your jawline lightly will emphasize its shape. Add a two inch line directly above your jawline. This will improve your jaw's visual definition. Taking a little bit of bronzer and dusting it along your jaw and neck will blend the above cosmetic effects. Be light with your application here; you just want to make it so that the contouring is blended a little better."
