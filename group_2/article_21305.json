      "content": "Try the side-lying hip abduction. [1] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. Lay on your side on a mat, with your knees bent slightly and 1 leg stacked evenly on top of the other. Your hips should be at a 90 degree angle to the ground, not angled towards the front or the back. Bend your lower leg a little more to give yourself balance and support, and straighten your top leg with your foot flexed. Raise your top leg upward (while keeping your foot flexed) and slightly backwards, then lower it again. Lift and lower your upper leg in sets of 5 or 10, depending on how advanced you are in your workout, then switch and repeat the same exercises on your other side."

      "title": "Do the clam.",
      "content": "Do the clam. This exercise is similar to the side-lying hip abduction, but your knees will be bent. Lie on your side as you did with the side-lying hip abduction. Instead of keeping your legs straight, bend them and stack 1 on top of the other. Then, slide your knees forward so you are lying in a loose fetal position. Your feet should be aligned with your hips and your knees should be out in front of your body. When you are in position, slowly begin to lift up your top knee, as if it is the top of a clamshell. As you do this, keep your top foot on top of your lower foot as if they are connected. Then, slowly lower the top leg back down until it is resting on the bottom leg. Do this exercise for about 1 minute. Repeat this exercise on the opposite side after you finish the first side. Do up to 3 sets on each side."

      "content": "Perform the side lunge. Stand up straight, put your hands on your hips, and keep your abdomen tight. Raise your right knee upwards and move your right foot sideways until your left leg is stretched nicely. Place your right foot on the ground, bend you right knee a little more, and keep your left leg straight. Your left foot should still be flat on the ground. Then push yourself off the ground with your right foot and propel yourself back to a standing position. Repeat the same action on your left side. You can do all of 1 side, then move to the other side, or you can alter sides for each lunge. Perform 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise on each side, depending on how advanced you are in your workout. An alternative to this side lunge is to NOT place your foot on the ground when you return to a standing position. But rather to keep your knee bent, and your foot raised up off the ground. This adds a little more complexity and resistance to the exercise."

      "title": "Give the alternative side lunge a try.",
      "content": "Give the alternative side lunge a try. This exercise is still a side lunge, except that you’re not moving your feet when you move your body. Instead, start by standing up straight with your feet 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) apart. Then lunge to the right side by bending your right knee and straightening your left leg. Then straighten yourself back upwards, without moving your feet. Keep your back straight and as upright as possible, keep your head up, and make sure that you knees never extend past your toes on the bent leg. Do the same type of lunge on your left side. This version can put less stress on your knees and adds more resistance to the muscles you’re trying to build. Perform 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise on each side, depending on how advanced you are in your workout."

      "content": "Try curtsy lunges. A curtsy lunge is also a great way to work your outer hip muscles. To do a curtsy lunge, stand with your feet shoulder width apart and take a big step back and across the opposite leg. As you do this, bend your knees and hold your balance in the position for a moment. Then, slowly begin to stand up and return your back foot to its starting position. [2] X Research source Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times on both sides. Do 3 sets. You can also hold weights in your hands to make this exercise a little harder."

      "content": "Do a traditional squat. [3] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. Stand up straight and place your feet so they are about shoulder width apart. Keep your abdomen tight and your back straight. Lower your bum towards the floor like you’re going to sit down, but stop when your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Then raise yourself back up to the standing position (don’t move your feet). Repeat this movement 5 to 10 times, depending on how advanced you are in your workout. To add more resistance to this exercise, you can hold dumbbells in both your hands while you squat. The weight of the dumbbells is up to you - whatever you’re most comfortable with at the time."

      "title": "Perform the standing side abduction.",
      "content": "Perform the standing side abduction. The standing side abduction is the same as the side-lying hip abduction, except that you’re standing upright and adding some resistance to the movement of your outside leg. While standing, hold onto a wall, railing or stable chair with your right hand. Place a dumbbell into your left hand and hold it against your left thigh. Flex your left foot and lift it outwards from the wall, then bring it back down towards the wall again. Keep your back straight. Perform 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise, depending on how advanced you are in your workout. Once you’ve completed all repetitions on 1 side, switch and do the other side. The weight of the dumbbell will depend on what is comfortable for you at the moment. Start with a light weight dumbbell and increase the weight as you perform the exercise over time. An alternative to a dumbbell is to use a resistance band, which is essentially a large elastic band specifically designed for exercise purposes. To use the resistance band, tie the band in a hip-width loop and step into the loop so that it is around your ankles. When you pull your left leg outwards, the band will act as resistance to the movement."

      "title": "Try the Monster or Sumo walk.",
      "content": "Try the Monster or Sumo walk. This exercise requires a resistance band that is short enough to go around your legs and provide resistance as your widen your stance. You can place the band around your legs at knee level (slightly above your actual knee joints), at ankle level, or around the balls of your feet - whichever location is most comfortable for you at the time. Once the band is in place, widen your stance until there is a decent amount of resistance on the band. Then slightly bend your knees and have your arms out in front of you. For the Monster walk, keep the band stretched and walk forwards and backwards, stepping one foot in front of the other. For the Sumo walk, keep the band stretched and shimmy to the left and the right. Perform 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise (in either direction), depending on how advanced you are in your workout."

      "content": "Walk sideways on a treadmill. For this exercise you’ll want to set the treadmill at a 3 to 5% incline, and at a speed of 2 to 3 mph (3.2 to 4.8 km/h) (very slow). Start the treadmill while standing on the side panel (the part that doesn’t move). If your right side is facing the front of the treadmill, place your right hand on the front bar for support, and your left hand on the left-side bar for support. Step onto the tread and start walking sideways. Again, if your right side is facing the front of the treadmill, you’ll want to step ‘forward’ by crossing your left foot over your right foot. Perform this exercise for 5 to 10 minutes on either side, with 30 second breaks every minute or so. Start this exercise at a very, very slow speed until you get use to the motion. Once you’re more comfortable, you can increase the speed. However, note that the speed isn’t the key to this exercise, it’s the movement. So continuing at a slow speed will be just as effective."

Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart, bend forward at your hips, and grasp a kettlebell by the handle with both hands. [4] X Research source Keeping your arms and back straight, lift the kettlebell up, out and away from your body in front of you as you straighten your knees and hips. The kettlebell should swing out as you do this. Then, flowing with the movement of the kettlebell, bend at your hips and knees again and bring the kettlebell back down to the ground. Repeat this movement 10 to 15 times and do 3 sets."

Technically, all yoga poses can be considered hip-opening poses because yoga in general is designed to help your hip muscles. But there are some very specific poses that target this area and also help improve your range of motion, blood circulation and reduce back pain. Exercises focused specifically on the hip muscles will probably make them sore and stiff, these yoga poses will help release that stiffness. [5] X Research source The following poses are recommended to help stretch your hip muscles: The happy baby pose. The reclining bound angle pose. The frog pose. [6] X Research source The ‘thread the needle’ pose. The half pigeon and double pigeon poses. The camel pose. The hero pose. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Stretch your hip muscles. You hip joint is a very stable joint with lots of muscles and a large range of motion. Activities where you aren’t using your hips muscles in the way they were designed to be used (i.e. sitting at a desk all day) can cause them to tighten up and be painful. Stretching your hip muscles is a great way to loosen up this whole area, maintain good posture, and keep your spine aligned properly. There are several hip stretches you can perform to help loosen the whole area: The hip flexor stretch. The hip rotator stretch. The hip adductor stretch. The hip extensor stretch. The standing hamstring stretch. The iliotibial band stretch."

Ideally, your hips will become bigger via an increase in the muscles in that area. The muscles will increase because of the exercises you’ll do to target that area. To get the energy to keep up your exercise routine, and to keep exercising long-term, you need to consume carbs. You also need to consume protein that will help build that muscle. [9] X Research source The average person should eat a decent meal 1-2 hours before they exercise, and have another decent meal 1-2 hours after they exercise. As long as the meals are balanced and nutritious, they will provide the carbs and protein you need to have energy and build muscle. [10] X Research source An example of a pre or post workout meal for a women might be: a small handful of almonds, a deck of cards size of meat, a handful of vegetables, and a handful of rice or other grain. An example of a man’s meal would generally be larger, depending on his weight and height, but up to double what is recommended for women. You should also be sure to consume water throughout and after your workout in order to stay properly hydrated."
