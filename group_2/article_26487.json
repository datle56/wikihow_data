If you tend to get high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming laps, it’s okay to do 75 minutes total a week.

With this type of workout, you go as hard as you can for 20 to 90 seconds, and then you rest for a short period. It can help you lose weight because it revs your metabolism for up to a day. [3] X Research source It's easy to incorporate HIIT into your workouts. Just work on a 1-to-2 ratio of exercise to rest period. That is, you go as hard as you can for a set amount of time and then rest for double that time. For example, if you're biking, bike as hard as you can for 30 seconds then coast for 60 seconds. Keep repeating this process throughout your workout. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Add strength training to help build muscle . Strength training is using resistance to increase your muscle mass. You can use your body weight as resistance in exercises like squats , lunges, sit-ups, and pushups. You can also use weights for resistance in exercises like bench presses , shoulder presses, and deadlifts . Always start with low weights and work your way up. For instance, as a beginner, you might start with dumbbells that are 5 pounds (2.3 kg) each. [5] X Research source Adding muscle will help your body look more defined, even if you don't lose much subcutaneous fat. Muscle weighs more than fat, so if you are just judging your health based on weight, it might seem like you aren’t getting healthy even though you are actually losing fat and gaining muscle."

Food apps make it a little easier because you can look up the food you're eating right on your phone and add it to your food diary. [6] X Research source Figure out how many calories you typically eat in a day and try to cut that back by up to 500 calories to start with. Always talk to a doctor before changing your diet.

Learn common portion sizes to make it easier. For instance, a serving of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.

Similarly, fancy coffee drinks may pack more of a caloric punch then you'd expect. It’s better to eat your food, not drink it, so try to avoid smoothies.

When you use them to bulk out your meals, you get the nutrients you need, and you're able to fill up without overloading on calories. Plus, the fiber in vegetables helps keep you fuller for longer. [14] X Research source For instance, when making scrambled eggs for breakfast, cook strips of bell peppers, mushrooms, or onions in the pan for a few minutes before adding eggs. You could also wilt fresh spinach into the eggs at the end. When making wraps or sandwiches for lunch, fill them up halfway with veggies. Try tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, spinach, and onions, just to name a few. Bulk up your soups by adding extra vegetables. Most of the time, you won't even notice they're there, particularly if they're cut small enough. For example, add onion, bell pepper, and finely chopped kale to taco soup or sweet potato and onion to chili. Try swapping vegetables for some of your carbohydrates. Use zucchini noodles in place of pasta or cauliflower in place of rice or mashed potatoes. Alternatively, just decrease the amount of pasta you fix and add chunks of vegetables instead."
