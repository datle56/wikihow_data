      "content": "The basic act of kissing isn’t considered a sin in Christianity. The Bible takes a strong stance on purity, but it doesn’t specifically call out kissing as a sin—instead, it frowns upon any act that can lead to sex before marriage. By this logic, kissing a partner isn’t necessarily a sin, but getting intimate with your partner before marriage could be. [1] X Research source With this in mind, things like cuddling, snuggling, and holding hands may also be fine as long as they don’t progress to anything more. Colossians 3:5: “So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don’t be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.” 1 Timothy 5:2: “Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters.” Note: Many Bible verses showcase kissing as a friendly and platonic way of greeting a friend, loved one, or fellow believer (especially for early believers of the Christian church). For instance, in Ruth 1:14 , Orpah kisses her mother-in-law platonically: “And they wept together, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye. But Ruth clung tightly to Naomi.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Kissing becomes a sin when it leads to sex before marriage. The Bible doesn’t say outright if kissing your partner is a sin. In 1 Thessalonians 4:3 , though, it does highlight the importance of waiting until marriage to have sex: “God’s will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all sexual sin.” If you think that kissing your partner could tempt you both into being sexually intimate before marriage, you might be better off avoiding it. [3] X Research source Ephesians 3:5: “Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God’s people.” Hebrews 13:4: “Give honor to marriage, and remain faithful to one another in marriage. God will surely judge people who are immoral and those who commit adultery.” Galatians 5:16: “So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves.”"

      "content": "It’s up to you, your partner, and God to decide if kissing is okay. No two relationships are exactly alike—some couples are perfectly content with only kissing and cuddling together; in other couples, however, it might lead to temptation. Take some time to sit down with your partner and pray to discern God’s will regarding what’s best for your relationship, and to see if you need to set any boundaries . [4] X Research source Your prayer could be something like: “Lord, please guide our minds and hearts so we can find a way to stay holy and pure in our relationship.”"

      "title": "Some consider making out a sin since it can lead to sexual temptation.",
      "content": "Some consider making out a sin since it can lead to sexual temptation. Making out (also known as French kissing) is far more passionate than a traditional kiss—because of this, some Christians worry about the slippery slope that it can lead to. If making out tempts you both into having sex before marriage, it could possibly qualify as a sin. [5] X Research source The Bible takes a strong position against sexual immorality in 1 Corinthians 6:18 : “Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.” Ultimately, it’s up to you and your partner to talk, pray, and decide how far you’re comfortable going in your relationship while still staying true to your faith."

      "content": "Kissing isn’t allowed before marriage if you’re a practicing Orthodox Jew. Many members of Orthodox Judaism practice something known as shomer negiah , which forbids them from making physical contact with anyone of the opposite sex. [6] X Research source Individuals who are shomer negiah typically don’t do anything physical with their partner (including kissing) until they’re married. [7] X Research source Orthodox Judaism is a devout variety of Judaism that sticks to very traditional practices. They believe in practicing their faith exactly as it was established back in the days of Mt. Sinai. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source According to the laws of Islam, kissing someone before marriage is haram and therefore not allowed."
