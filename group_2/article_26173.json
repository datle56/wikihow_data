[3] X Research source If you are camping it is a good idea to do this inside a tent away from breezes and noise. Make sure you have adequate light. You will need to be able to see well enough to look for holes."

      "content": "Fill it as much as you can with air, without risking the mattress bursting. Air mattresses are not designed to be filled with high pressure sources such as air compressors. You can use your breath or an air pump to inflate the mattress. Many air mattresses come with these to aid in inflation. Do not overinflate your mattress. [4] X Research source Most manufacturers warn that this can cause a mattress to burst."

      "title": "Inspect the valve.",
      "content": "Inspect the valve. It is a good idea to do this before inspecting the rest of the mattress, because the valve is a common source of leaks. [5] X Research source Doing this first can save you a lot of time rather than searching for leaks using other methods since valves are a main source of leaks. Make sure that the valve plug is completely inserted into the valve stem. For double locking valves, make sure that the valve stem has been completely pressed against the stop behind it. If there is a problem with the valve, it is unlikely to be able to be patched. However, if the valve plug won't seal against the valve stem you can try inserting a thin piece of plastic for a quick fix. If the valve plug is completely inserted into the valve stem, and the valve stem is completely pressed into the stop behind it, you are ready to look for a leak in the mattress itself."

Escaping air will increase the evaporation rate from your skin and make it feel colder. Pass your hand slowly along the surface of the mattress. If you move too quickly, you might not pick up on the subtle sensation of escaping air."

Your ear is more sensitive to feeling escaping air. Escaping air will also make a hissing sound. Listening for escaping air is more effective in finding large holes or leaks rather than small ones. Listen especially carefully around the seams of the mattress, as this is the most common area for leaks."

Others will ask that you send the mattress to them for repair. Don't attempt to patch your mattress without proper instructions from the manufacturer. Different materials may require different methods. Once you locate one leak, inspect the rest of the mattress. There may be more than one hole or tear contributing to the problem."

      "content": "Submerge the valve stem in a pool or bathtub filled with water with the valve closed. Apply pressure around the valve stem. See if you can force any air out of the valve. Escaping air will cause a stream of bubbles to form around the leak. Look for these around the valve as you apply pressure. Submerge parts of the fabric under the water. Look for bubbles, indicating escaping air from a leak. Do this in sections. Looking at a smaller area is easier than trying to find leaks in the whole mattress at one time. Pay close attention to the areas around the seams. Seams are a common area for holes and tears to occur. Mark the leak with a permanent marker once you find the source. Permanent marker is less likely to bleed on a wet surface. You can partially dry the area around the leak with a towel to aid in marking the leak. Once the mattress is dry you can make your mark more clear by placing duct tape or a larger mark near the leak."
