      "content": "Pick between an external or a direct gateway. External gateways (also known as \"redirect\") send your customers to another website to process the payment.

      "title": "Add payment methods.",
      "content": "Add payment methods. The process for this will vary from service to service, but generally, you will need to enter your payment gateway information for each method of payment you intend to accept (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).

    },
    {
      "title": "Test the gateway.",
      "content": "Test the gateway. You will typically be provided Test or Sandbox accounts by your payment gateway service.
