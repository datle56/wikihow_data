[2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source There are several varieties of booster seats to choose from. They vary in design, material, and price. Choose one that fits your vehicle, suits your child, and meets your current and future needs. [3] X Research source Backless booster seats do not have a back (as the name suggests), but it may rest on your vehicle's rear seat. Your child's back is supported by the back of the vehicle's seat. High back booster seats have their own support for your child's back to rest against. These fit within your vehicle's rear seat much like a forward-facing child safety seat. High back booster seats are recommended for vehicles without headrests on the rear seat, shaped like a bench. Combination child safety seat/booster seats can be used first as a child safety seat and then converted to a booster seat when your child is old enough or big enough. All-in-one safety seats have either 3 to 5 modes of use, some of the seats have harness storage compartments underneath the headrest, just like the combination car seats. Most booster seats are designed for kids weighing from up to 120 lbs."

[5] X Trustworthy Source National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. government agency responsible for writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Go to source Therefore, it is critical that the booster seat fit properly into your car and onto the rear seat. Make sure you check the following: The booster seat fits fully on your car's rear seat, and does not hang over the edge. The booster seat sits flat on your car's rear seat, and is not turned or tilted. At least one of your car's rear lap-shoulder seatbelts (not just a lap seatbelt) is able to fit fully around the booster seat so that you can secure it in place."

The instructional videos are available to watch when you install a booster seat into your vehicle. Please review these instructions before proceeding."

The best location for a booster seat is in the center of a vehicle's rear seat, as long as it fits properly there. However, if your vehicle only has a lap belt in the center position of the rear seat, try to install the booster seat on either the right or left side, as it doesn’t permit overhanging on the edge. If you cannot install a booster seat in the center of the rear seat, it’s best to choose the side (right or left) that will allow you to best see your child from the driver's seat, and make it easiest to safely remove the child from the vehicle on busy streets. Some manufacturers don’t allow you to be using outer lower anchors in the center position, so always read your instructions manual to ensure correct use."

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. government agency responsible for writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Go to source Once the booster seat is properly installed, have your child sit in it (while the vehicle is not in motion) to ensure a good fit. Position the seatbelt as you normally would, and make sure the child is snug but comfortable in the booster seat, and that it remains secure on your vehicle's back seat when your child is sitting in it, regardless of their age and size. Watch the Five Step Test video to learn more about the correct use of this booster seat. Adjust your vehicle's seat belt, if necessary. You should use a lap-shoulder combination seat belt. The lap portion should rest on the child's torso (not across the stomach or neck), and the shoulder portion should fit across his/her chest. You can also visit a local police department, fire department, or other safety center to have an official check to make sure your booster seat is installed properly."

When the booster seat is not being used, it should be secured (for instance, strapped down or stowed inside the trunk). Otherwise, a loose booster seat moving around while you are driving the vehicle can cause injury or become a dangerous distraction during a crash, which can cause serious injuries, paralysis, and so on. [12] X Research source Some models of boosters have LATCH connectors to connect to a vehicle's lower anchors for the purpose of securing the booster when it’s not in use. Take advantage of these if your booster comes with these connectors and the dedicated seating position has lower anchors marked with a symbol or a fabric tag for vehicles in the years, 2002 and newer. Some models include the Diono Solana, Graco Affix, and Britax Parkway. Each of the booster seats usually allow both lower anchors and top tethers, like the Graco 4Ever, Britax One4Life, Evenflo All4One, and more. And also, never attach two hooks into one vehicle lower anchor, unless if it’s permitted by the safety seat’s manufacturer."

If they move to the front seat earlier than that, the air bag can injure themselves, causing serious injuries, paralysis, and so on."
