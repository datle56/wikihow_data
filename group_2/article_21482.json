[1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Chilli seeds generally germinate easily, so it's likely that most of your seeds will sprout. Place 1 seed between the paper towel for every plant you want to grow, then add a few extras just in case they all don’t sprout. Either buy chilli seeds online, from your local plant nursery, or harvest your own from ripe chilli peppers. If you’re harvesting your own seeds, choose a chilli pepper, put on some gloves, and cut it in half. Scoop out the seeds with your hand and place them in a shallow plastic container. Then, let them dry out in a well-ventilated area, like your kitchen, for about 1 week. [2] X Research source"

If you don’t have a consistently warm area, place a heating mat under the seeds. [3] X Research source Just make sure that the heat source isn't hot enough to melt the plastic bag or container that your seeds are stored in. After 2 to 5 days, you’ll see the seeds start to swell or sprout. [4] X Research source Pre-germinating the chilli seeds before you plant them in soil typically gives them a better chance of sprouting successfully. In warmer climates, leave the seeds outdoors to germinate. Just bring them in if the temperature drops below 60° F (15° C).

Turn the plant on its side and gently dig it out of the soil, leaving a large clump of compost around its roots to protect them. Set it inside the well of the new pot, fill around it with soil, and then water it thoroughly. [16] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source When a plant outgrows a pot, you’ll see its roots coming out of the top or bottom of the container. That’s your plant telling you it’s too cramped in its current container! If you want to keep your chilli plant small, keep it in a small pot to thwart further growth. The standard progression of pot sizes goes from a diameter of 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm), then finally to 8 inches (20 cm)."

When these flowers fall off, baby chilli fruits take their place. Wait for the chilli to grow to its maximum size and feel firm when you squeeze it. Then, snip off the chilli with a pair of scissors, or remove it by hand. [17] X Research source Always wear gloves when touching chillies. They contain capsaicin, which can irritate your skin. This compound is also what makes chillies hot. [18] X Research source Either wait for the chillies to fully ripen and change color, or pick them when they’re green. Store extra chillies in your fridge, where they’ll usually stay good for 1 to 2 weeks. Alternatively, cut extra chillies into strips, lay them on a baking sheet, and place them in your freezer . When they’re fully frozen, place them in plastic freezer bags and store them in the freezer for 3 to 6 months. Pickling your chillies and storing them in jars is another great way to use them in recipes."

[22] X Research source Then, feed your plants with a general-purpose, 1-1-1 water-soluble fertilizer according to the fertilizer’s label. Monitor your chilli plants for pests like aphids and spider mites. Aphids are pear-shaped and typically white or brown, while spider mites look like tiny moving dots. Typically, spraying your plant’s leaves with a hose removes either pest. If you see ladybugs around your plants, they’ll take care of the aphids for you. [23] X Research source"
