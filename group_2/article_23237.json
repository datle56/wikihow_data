      "content": "Look for a 9 to 12 ft (2.7 to 3.7 m) tall shrub. Elderberry most commonly grows in a bushy, shrub-like pattern. They often start at a small base in the ground and then billow outwards. Mature elderberry plants can range from 9 to 12 feet (2.7 to 3.7 m) tall. [2] X Research source Elderberry can also grow in a small, single-stem tree pattern, but that is much less common. European elderberries can grow to up to 20 feet (6.1 m) tall. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Search for elderberry in the banks of streams, marshes, or moist forests. Elderberry plants love to grow in moist habitats that have a lot of drainage. If you think you are looking at an elderberry but you aren’t quite sure, check to see if you are near a stream or if the soil is moist or damp. [4] X Research source Elderberry is native to most of North America and Europe, and can also be found in some parts of South America."

      "title": "Spot woody brown bark that gets harder with age.",
      "content": "Spot woody brown bark that gets harder with age. New growth on an elderberry plant is smooth and brown, but it gets harder and more wood-like later on. Check large plants for woody brown bark that feels tough and is hard to bend. The oldest part of the plant will most likely be toward the base. [5] X Research source If you break a younger branch you will often find it is soft or hollow in the middle. [6] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 25 June 2021. Old growth on an elderberry plant will need a tool to cut through it, like loppers or a saw. The elderberry plant can look similar to a water hemlock, but a water hemlock has a green stem with purple streaks, not woody brown bark. [7] X Research source Water hemlock is poisonous and should not be eaten."

      "title": "Find long, pointed, light green leaves that have serrated edges.",
      "content": "Find long, pointed, light green leaves that have serrated edges. The leaves of the elderberry plant are light green and can be anywhere from 2 to 5 inches (5.1 to 12.7 cm) long and 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide. Feel the edges of the leaves to see if they are finely serrated and check for a thin point at the end of the leaves."

      "title": "Look for groups of 5 to 11 leaves that grow opposite from each other.",
      "content": "Look for groups of 5 to 11 leaves that grow opposite from each other. The leaves of an elderberry plant grow in groups of 5 to 11 on 1 branch. They grow opposite from each other, meaning that 2 leaves grow directly across the branch from each other out of the same node. [8] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 25 June 2021. A cluster of 7 leaves on 1 branch is the most common."

      "content": "Find small, white flowers with 5 rounded petals that bloom in the summer. One of elderberry’s most identifying traits is its flowers that bloom on the ends of branched stalks (like the head of a cow parsnip). [9] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 25 June 2021. In July and August, the elderberry plant explodes in small, white-colored flowers that most often have 5 petals. They are usually 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) wide with 5 small stamens, or long skinny stalks, at the top. [10] X Research source When in bloom, the elderberry plant creates a stark contrast between the green leaves and the white flowers. European elderberries bloom a few months earlier than American elderberries. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch for flat clusters of flowers in the summer.",
      "content": "Watch for flat clusters of flowers in the summer. Elderberry flowers don’t grow individually. Instead, they form clusters at the top of the elderberry plant that create a “flat” effect. From far away, these clusters can look like large, individual flowers. [12] X Research source The “flat” effect is created because the tops of each flower is flat. When they are grouped together, this look becomes more prominent."

      "content": "Identify purple or black fleshy fruit in the late summer. Elderberry plants produce elderberries in July and August that look rather like black currants. [13] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 25 June 2021. This fruit grows in clusters of 10 to 20 and each individual fruit is less than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) wide. As the fruit matures, the branches will bend from their weight. [14] X Research source Red elderberry bears bright red fruit. [15] X Research source Aralia plants also bear purple, fleshy fruit that can look similar to elderberries. If the plant has spikes or thorns on the stems and branches, it is most likely an aralia plant and you should not eat the berries since they are mildly poisonous. [16] X Research source"
