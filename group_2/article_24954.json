      "content": "Deter your cat with compressed air. Spray your cat a spritz of compressed air whenever they jump on the stove-top or nearby countertops. Only squirt the air around their back and chest—don’t spray it near their eyes or nose, which are pretty sensitive. Don’t let your cat see you squirt them—you want them to think that the gust of air came out of nowhere, not from you. You can also use a spray bottle to spritz your cat with water instead of using compressed air. You can also use “Ssscat,” a special motion-sensing item that sprays your cat with compressed air whenever it notices your cat slinking near the stove.
