      "title": "Wear gloves when handling the bird.",
      "content": "Wear gloves when handling the bird. Birds can carry diseases, so it’s important to protect yourself even when you’re trying to help the bird. Never pick up a wild bird with your bare hands. Wear protective gloves and wash your hands immediately after handling the bird. Wear gloves even if it is a domestic pet bird that is injured, as hurt birds may be frantic and lash out at you if they are feeling vulnerable and in pain. [1] X Research source It’s best to use thick canvas or cloth gloves—like those used in gardening. These will be the most effective in protecting you from the bird’s beak and claws, as well as from any potential diseases the bird might be carrying. If the injured bird is a large bird of prey, you are best off not handling it at all. Instead, call animal control or a bird rescue organization in your area."

      "content": "Avoid putting the bird too close to your face. Even small birds have sharp beaks and talons. Whenever you are handling an injured bird , always keep it away from your face to protect yourself. Even your own pet bird might snap at you if it is hurt and feeling scared.

      "title": "Avoid giving the bird food or water.",
      "content": "Avoid giving the bird food or water. An injured bird will typically be too scared to eat or drink. It might also be dangerous for an injured bird to try to eat or drink, especially when it’s stressed. Instead, focus on getting the bird the care it needs as quickly as you can. [3] X Research source It’s easy for an injured bird to choke on water or food, especially when it is force-fed. Don’t do this."

      "title": "Give the bird time to recover before you touch it.",
      "content": "Give the bird time to recover before you touch it. Sometimes, a bird that looks injured may just be shocked and recovering on its own, like after it’s hit a window . Other times, what looks like an orphaned bird may be perfectly safe and just waiting for its mama to come back. If you can, monitor the bird for 2-3 hours without touching it or getting close to make sure it’s actually in need of help. [4] X Research source If the bird doesn’t move in that time, or is in obvious danger, like is vulnerable to nearby predators or in harm’s way, you may carefully move it. If the bird is bleeding or is obviously injured in some way, it likely needs medical attention. Never attempt to handle an animal that appears sick , like if it’s stumbling, foaming at the mouth, or acting aggressively. They may carry contagious diseases."

      "title": "Use gloves to wrap the bird in a towel.",
      "content": "Use gloves to wrap the bird in a towel. Put on thick gloves to protect yourself from injury or disease. Then, get an old towel or rag and place it over the bird to pick it up, and carry the bird only by the body—not the wings, feet, or head. [5] X Research source The towel will help the bird stay calm, and it will also keep the bird from moving more and hurting itself. Try to protect the injured wing when you wrap the bird in the towel. Gently place the injured wing against the bird’s body (not bent in a funny way) and wrap the bird snugly in the towel. Never try to handle a bird larger than a pigeon or any bird of prey. Call animal control, instead, as it’s too dangerous without proper gear."

      "title": "Put the bird into a towel-lined shoebox with a lid.",
      "content": "Put the bird into a towel-lined shoebox with a lid. Place a towel on the bottom of a shoebox for added comfort, then put the bird on top of it. Make sure the box has a lid that you can close securely to ensure the bird doesn’t escape and hurt itself more. [6] X Research source Make sure any box you put a bird in has some ventilation holes so that the bird can still breathe inside the box. For a larger bird, you may need to choose something larger to carry it in. Try a hard-sided cat carrier or a larger cardboard box. Place a bottle of warm water into the box with the bird to help keep it warm if the weather is cool. Keep an eye on it, though, and remove it immediately if the bird begins panting or trying to avoid the bottle."

      "title": "Move and handle the bird as little as possible.",
      "content": "Move and handle the bird as little as possible. A bird with a broken wing (or other injury) should not be moved except when absolutely necessary, even if it is your pet bird. This will help prevent further injury for the bird. [7] X Research source Pick the bird up with a towel, wrap it in a towel, and place it in a shoebox. Then, don’t move the bird again unless absolutely necessary."

      "content": "Open the box every 15 minutes to give the bird a chance to leave. If the bird is only stunned or minorly injured, it may recover quickly. In the first few hours, keep the box outside, and open the lid every 15-20 minutes to give the bird the option to leave. It may fly away on its own. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the bird in a warm, safe place while you figure out what to do next. If the bird doesn’t leave on its own after a few hours, put the injured bird and its box in a safe place where it will be warm and out of harm’s way while you decide what to do next. Keep it somewhere dimly lit and quiet so the bird can feel more calm. [9] X Research source Keep the bird away from small children or other animals who might attack it or accidentally injure it more."

      "title": "Assess the bird’s injuries, if you can.",
      "content": "Assess the bird’s injuries, if you can. While touching it as little as possible, inspect the bird and determine the extent of its injuries. If the bird looks dazed, stunned, or unconscious, this could mean that the bird is in shock and is suffering from more injuries than just a broken wing. If the bird is alert—and even trying to get away from you—this is a good sign. Look for any visible blood or wounds that can help you assess the severity of the bird’s condition. [10] X Research source If you think the bird’s broken wing is too damaged to repair, or the bird appears to have other injuries as well, the bird may need to be euthanized, unfortunately. If the bird needs to be euthanized, take it to a vet for assistance or call the local animal control authorities."

      "title": "Contact a local veterinarian or avian specialist.",
      "content": "Contact a local veterinarian or avian specialist. For an injured domestic bird, call your personal vet for advice. Describe the bird’s appearance and what you observe about its injuries. Based on the type of bird and its injuries, your vet may have more specific advice. Some vets offer free assistance (like antibiotics or life-saving surgery) to animals injured in the wild. [11] X Research source Your vet probably won’t be able to house a wild bird while it recovers (unless you pay for it), but they may be able to provide some sort of care or support."

      "title": "Call or talk to bird rescues in your area.",
      "content": "Call or talk to bird rescues in your area. If you find an injured bird in the wild, you may need to contact a bird rescue organization for help. Look online to find some in your area. They may be able to provide some medical assistance for your injured bird, even if they have no room to house or rehabilitate the bird. Ask them about what services they are able to offer: one-time medical assistance, housing, rehabilitation services, or continuous medical care throughout rehabilitation. [12] X Research source You may need to call several agencies before you find one that is willing to help you. These rescues typically depend on public donations to function, so they may be running short on funding, supplies, or physical space."

      "title": "Take the bird to a rescue that doesn’t euthanize.",
      "content": "Take the bird to a rescue that doesn’t euthanize. If you’ve determined that the bird’s injuries don’t seem fatal, inquire about each rescue’s euthanization policy. Be sure to ask each rescue what their policy is specifically regarding birds with broken wings. Some organizations believe that birds who have broken wings can never be happy again without the ability to fly, and thus should be euthanized. Others think that it is quite possible for some birds to live a happy life after recovering from a broken wing. [13] X Research source You don’t want to go through all the trouble of helping a bird with a broken wing only to have it euthanized by the rescue you take the bird to."

      "content": "Take the bird carefully to another location. Whether you take the bird to a vet or an animal rescue, you’ll need to transport it safely to the next location. Make sure the lid of the box is securely closed so the bird can’t get out on the trip. Try to keep the box as still as possible. [14] X Research source Put the box in the floorboard of the passenger seat of your car if you are driving. Otherwise, try to hold the box as still as possible. Keep the box out of direct sunlight and away from air conditioning."

      "title": "Leave the bird and box in a safe space, if you can’t get help.",
      "content": "Leave the bird and box in a safe space, if you can’t get help. Unfortunately, mending an injured bird often isn’t possible for those without the specialized knowledge and tools, so don’t try to fix the bird’s wings or other injuries yourself. Luckily, that doesn’t mean you can’t do anything. Create an exit in the box, like a hole cut into the cardboard, and leave the box in a safe place outdoors. The bird may still recover and leave on its own. [15] X Research source Even if it doesn’t recover, it’ll have passed on in a safe and comfortable environment. In this case, go ahead and add a small dish or a bottlecap of water to help the bird recover on its own. Sometimes, the only thing you can do is let nature take its course. It’s hard, but in nature, even birds know that their time will come someday."
