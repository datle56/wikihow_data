      "content": "Establish why you want to ignore your sibling. There are many different reasons you may want to ignore your brother or sister. If you're simply busy and need to focus, be sure to explain that to your sibling and make it clear you aren't ignoring your sibling out of anger. If your sibling is doing something annoying, first ask your sibling to stop. If your sibling has done something seriously wrong to you, try to first resolve the conflict. If your sibling's offense is frequent or especially damaging, long-term avoidance may be your best course of action."

      "content": "Decide on the degree your sibling needs to be ignored. Your reason for ignoring your sibling will decide to what level you will need to take it. If your sibling has done something wrong to you, you may want to give him or her the silent treatment to get your message across. If you are just trying to focus, acknowledge your sibling whenever he or she enters the room or attempts to contact you. Just try to keep from starting a long conversation. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Think of alternative actions you can take.",
      "content": "Think of alternative actions you can take. Open communication is important for all healthy relationships, including familial ones. When you ignore a sibling, you are destroying the ability for you both to communicate. Explore other ways of resolving the issue by first trying to talk with your sibling. If necessary, involve your parents. If you need advice on what to do, ask a friend, counselor, therapist, or someone else you trust for help. For when you're trying to concentrate, tell your sibling something like: \"I really need to study for this test. Could you try being a little more quiet or move to a different room?\" or \"I'm sorry if I've been ignoring you lately. I have a major project coming up and need to focus.\" For when your sibling is doing something annoying: \"Clicking that pen constantly is bothering me. Could you please stop it?\" For when a sibling has hurt you: \"I don't know if you realize this, but what you did was extremely hurtful. I need to know you understand that and won't do it again.\" When you remain calm and collected, you'll keep the peace, and your sibling will be less likely to pick fights and argue with you."

      "content": "Lock your bedroom door. If you have your own bedroom, locking the door is the best way to ensure your privacy, if you're allowed to. This will cut down on any unwanted intrusions into your space. This is especially important if your sibling has a bad habit of not knocking or is too young to realize that it's the polite thing to do. If you need extra support, talk to your parents and explain your needs. For example, tell them that you would be better off without any interruptions so you can focus on your homework. They can set some ground rules with your sibling. Encourage your parents to help your sibling find other hobbies or activities so they'll feel more engaged and be a lot less tempted to look for you when they need some entertainment.."
