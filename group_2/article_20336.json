      "title": "Learn how physical attraction works.",
      "content": "Learn how physical attraction works. Underlying all the emotion, thoughts, and hopes about love is our basic biochemistry. We are hard-wired to love! Attraction is based in brain chemistry. A group of neurotransmitters called monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) creates the feeling we experience as attraction. Dopamine is one of your brain’s “feel-good” chemicals (it’s where the term “dope” comes from). It’s also involved in your brain’s motivation and reward systems. When you meet someone you’re attracted to, dopamine starts sending feel-good chemical “rewards” to your system. Norepinephrine, sometimes known as noradrenaline (but not the same thing as adrenaline), delivers messages to your central nervous system. [1] X Research source Norepinephrine is responsible for your ability to “block out” information that isn’t as interesting as the smart partner in front of you. Serotonin regulates a lot of functions in your body, including sexual behavior and body temperature. When you are very attracted to someone, serotonin decreases your body temperature, which makes your skin slightly more able to conduct electricity. This is the reason that love can literally make your skin tingle. In fact, experts say that attraction stimulates the same chemicals in the brain that addiction does, such as dopamine and oxytocin. [2] X Research source If a girl isn’t attracted to you, it’s nothing to do with you: it’s all down to the chemicals in each person’s brain. A researcher at Rutgers University suggests that it takes less than one second for the brain to decide whether it considers someone to be attractive or not. [3] X Research source You may be able to overcome or cope with this split-second first impression, or you may not. If not, don’t take it personally: people are not able to manage spontaneous impulses and what is judged may not have anything to do negatively with you. For instance, some women are drawn to men which are high risk-takers, some are more attracted to those who seem more cautious. There is nothing wrong with being either. Understanding how attraction works may seem to take some of the mystery and magic from this human emotion. However, what it does make clear is that love and attraction is a fundamental part of how we are hard-wired. And it is on a level that is not heavily rational. And sometimes the chemistry literally is right or wrong."

      "content": "Take care of yourself. Women are generally attracted to people who demonstrate that they are able to care for themselves. This includes good grooming and an overall healthy look. Keeping your body feeling and looking strong and healthy, is a big evolutionary sign of your “reproductive fitness” — basically, a sign that your genes are strong and healthy too. [4] X Research source Keeping yourself well-groomed and healthy suggests self-confidence and a healthy respect for yourself, which most people find attractive. This does not mean you have to go overboard and become a marathoner or a bodybuilder . You may, however, want to consider join a gym or an ultimate Frisbee team to feel healthy and more confident about yourself, and thus be more attractive. Be the best version of yourself and be true to yourself, and remember that you do not have to be the best looking to be good looking."

You can have a great online profile and interaction, but if you finally meet the girl in real life and you reek of body odor and wear unflattering clothing, that will make a stronger impression than any online chat room. Control odors. Generally, women are put off by strong and unpleasant body odors. Someone who does not bathe regularly, does not use antiperspirant, or wears clothes that stink will be unsuccessful. Take care of your body. It is entirely possible to find love if one is imperfect: obese, have eczema, balding...whatever. However, doing your best to maximize your appearance will both directly look more attractive and make you feel more confident . Wear attractive clothing. Every society has a sense of what sort of clothing is attractive, and puts forth social signals of virility, confidence, and masculinity. If your clothing is unattractive, off-putting, or really odd, that sends a signal that there may be something wrong with the wearer."

      "content": "Consider body language signals. Body language can be either conscious (like winking at someone) or subconscious (like your lips reddening or pupils dilating). People convey a variety of messages through body language, including the language of attraction. Most body language signs relevant to physical attraction communicate a few basic messages: [5] X Research source I am available: Lack of a likely partner, and looks confident and emotionally balanced. I am interested: When a person says hi, a friendly and possibly flirty conversation strikes up. I am harmless: There is no aggressive or \"strange\" behavior. I am fertile: An overall healthy, youthful, energetic appearance. I am approachable: Body language appears to be open and relaxed."

Looking for these cues can help you figure out if your tender feeling for the girl is reciprocal. [7] X Research source Flushed or reddened cheeks Reddened lips or lips that appear to get plumper Dilated pupils [8] X Research source The person moves a “block” from out of your way--such as shifting a bag that had been in between you. A suddenly racing heart or more rapid breathing Licking her lips [9] X Research source Subtly echoing your body language. For instance, if you shift your weight from one side to the other, she does something similar a few moments later. Momentary touches. For example, light, brief touch on your arm, wrist, or knee. Remember: none of these behaviors will definitively mean she is attracted to you. While they are good signs, do not jump to conclusions. The girl with rosy cheeks and dilated pupils who moves her purse for you on the bus may just be a courteous and easily flushed girl who just came back from the eye doctor! Never assume her sexuality. In other words, do not work on the assumption that she automatically sees you as a romantic partner. You may come off as rude, arrogant, swarmy, and pushy. Confidence is fine, and flirting is fine, but aggressive \"come ons\" will likely be met with turned off girls."

Watch to see what facial muscles she uses when she smiles to get a sense of whether it’s real or not. Genuine smiles, also called duchenne smiles, use the muscles around the eyes as well as the mouth. Fake smiles usually only move the muscles around the mouth, and these smiles may look tight or empty.

This can help her pick up on your pheromones, which help signal attraction. [12] X Research source Tilt your head if you are talking to her or looking at her. Head-tilting is a sign of interest."

Despite the general creepiness of the pickup artist community, you don’t have to be a 'creepster' to use an opening gambit. Studies suggest that there are three types: [13] X Research source The direct opener. These are honest and get straight to the point, like “I think you’re really cute” or “I’m kind of shy, but I’d love to chat with you.” In general, men tend to prefer to receive these openers when others initiate conversations with them. The innocuous opener. These get a conversation going but don’t go straight for a target, like “What do you think of this place?” or “Do you come here often?” In general, women tend to prefer these openers when others initiate conversations with them. The cute/flippant opener. These involve humor, but are often cheesy or even nasty, such as “Do you like your eggs scrambled or fertilized?” Sometimes these work to \"break the ice\" but you also risk coming off as sleazy, desperate, or weird. Both men and women in general rank these as the least attractive option. If you’re looking to strike up a conversation with a girl, your best bet is to use an innocuous opener. Studies have also shown that honest and supportive gambits more often result in long-term relationships, whereas strategies that use manipulation or dishonesty (like the cute/flippant gambit) result in short-term relationships.

If you have been talking for a while and the girl seems interested in you, you can try a light brush of her arm or touch her hand. [15] X Research source Do not touch a girl unless she is giving you strong signals that she is into you. Even then, proceed with caution. It is usually a good idea to wait until she has initiated some type of touch. If the girl responds negatively to your touch, apologize, and do not try again for a while. Showing her respect and giving her space may well gain her good graces. Being overly aggressive will not. Make sure your physical touches are culturally-appropriate. What is acceptable in Colorado may not be in Morocco. Also, what is considered fine at a public university in Toronto may not be for a very conservative Christian school in Oklahoma. If you're unsure at all, ask for physical touching! For instance, holding out your hand to give it a friendly shake. Or asking, \"May I give you a hug?\" or, \"Would you like some help putting sunscreen on your back?\" This allows for physical touching in a way that respects her boundaries, and being straightforward about it. Do not get fixated on touching the girl. You do not have to physically touch a girl in the early stages of flirting. Trying too hard, or putting undue pressure to touch can backfire severely and make you come off as \"creepy\". The moment for a touch will often \"just happen\". If the connection and attraction is there, often a moment will simply organically happen. The two of you reach for the same tater tot at the cafeteria, or she puts her hand on yours at the movies, or something along those lines."

People often are more interested in others who appear to live full, happy lives on their own. Have you always wanted to make your own video game ? It is possible to do that! Write a book ? Go get 'em, tiger! Become a master spelunker? You can do it! Follow your dreams and you'll find that girls are attracted to your passion and determination. Maintaining your own interests after getting into a relationship will also help keep you from becoming “ codependent .” Codependent relationships happen when one or both partners feel like they can’t be complete or happy without the other person.

When you're alone with a girl, telling a joke can be a great way to break the tension. Remember: if you're not good at jokes, you can still have a good sense of humor — you just have to love laughing and being around people who are funny. Being a good audience is as important as being funny yourself. Bitter or sarcastic humor isn’t a great idea. Try positive, even slightly self-deprecating humor. [21] X Research source Wilbur, C. J., &amp; Campbell, L. (2011). Humor in romantic contexts: Do men participate and women evaluate?Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 37, 918-929.

Don't brag about it or show off, but put these things into your routine and don't be afraid to let them shine every once in a while. The difference between real confidence and cockiness is in how you think about yourself. True self-confidence means you know who you are, and you’re comfortable and happy with that. Cockiness often stems from a need to compete with or put down others to make yourself feel confident. Truly confident guys and girls don’t need to belittle anyone or be a jerk to show that they know they’re cool. [23] X Research source If you do feel the need to take a jab at yourself, make sure you present it as a joke. Laugh at the mistakes you make and the stupid things you do, as well as the things you don't like about yourself. \"Seriously, you DO NOT want me to ask you to dance. I'm a terrible dancer.

This will help you love her as a complete person, and she will appreciate that more than you can understand. [24] X Research source One good way to start is by asking her an open-ended question . For example, social psychologist Arthur Aron has made headlines with his list of 36 questions to foster intimacy between people. They’re creative and open-ended, and they ask about more interesting things than her favorite movie. [25] X Research source For example, you could try asking “Would you like to be famous?

Whether she likes surfing , horseback riding , shopping , or baking , it's a good idea to try to involve her in what she likes doing best. Ask her friend what she enjoys doing in her free time, or ask her yourself if you're feeling brave. (Fortune favors you.)

Maybe try taking her to an amusement park or a haunted house; studies suggest that excitement or a sense of danger on a date helps release a chemical in the brain that bonds the two people together. [26] X Research source Be strategic about whether you call it a \"date.\" Generally, if you've already won the girl over, you want to make it clear that you're going on a date to make sure you're both on the same page. But if you haven't won the girl over yet, it's probably best to slow-play the courtship, and win her over as a friend before you move on to the romantic relationship.

Ambiguity isn’t your friend. You can also be clear when it comes to signalling your continuing interest. For example, if you had a great time, don’t end your conversation on a wishy-washy note.

Second, it means you may be talking about things too soon. The first few dates aren’t the time to trash your boss or talk about how much your ex sucked. This type of self-revelation can actually make you look bitter, indiscreet, or like you don’t have a good sense of personal boundaries.

However, if you expect your girl to read your mind about your needs, you will probably be disappointed because no one is a mind-reader. Furthermore, people’s personalities tend to be pretty set.

But remember that you can do and be everything right, and that does not mean that she will fall in love with you. She is an individual with free will, not an object to be won in a video game."
