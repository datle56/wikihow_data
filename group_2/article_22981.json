      "content": "Bed bugs can live 3 to 5 months without a host. There are a few factors that can impact whether or not a bed bug can survive, but at moderate temperatures and humidity levels, adult bed bugs can last over 150 days without feeding. In fact, the longest recorded time of a bed bug living without food was 400 days, but that was in a lab under optimal conditions. The average lifespan of a bed bug is 10 months to 1 year. However, during that time they will be mating and laying eggs, ensuring new generations of bugs for years to come. Keep in mind that while bed bugs only feed on blood, they don’t just target humans. Bed bugs will feed on rodents, pets, and other animals if they have to."

      "content": "Temperature Bed bugs can withstand a wide temperature range, but extreme cold or warm temps will kill them. In general, temperatures below 25 °F (−4 °C) and above 119 °F (48 °C) will kill bed bugs. Bed bug eggs can survive in temperatures up to 130 °F (54 °C)."

      "title": "Humidity",
      "content": "Humidity Bed bugs thrive in high relative humidity zones. Studies have found that adult bed bugs can live for long periods of time in 75% to 100% humidity. However, as the humidity decreases, the lifespan of adult bed bugs does, too. [1] X Research source Low humidity levels (meaning levels under 15%) can kill bed bugs in a matter of hours. Their bodies don’t perform well under dry conditions, because they need moisture to survive."

      "title": "Bed bugs will hide inside any furniture left in the home.",
      "content": "Bed bugs will hide inside any furniture left in the home. Typically, bed bugs will congregate in areas where people sleep or rest, like beds, couches, and chairs. Even if there are no humans in the home, bed bugs will still flock to the furniture inside. Identify bed bugs by looking for soft, red excrement on mattresses and box springs. Alternatively, examine yourself or anyone in the home for itchy, red bites, especially right after you wake up."

      "title": "Bed bugs may also hide in the walls, electrical outlets, or floorboards.",
      "content": "Bed bugs may also hide in the walls, electrical outlets, or floorboards. Unfortunately, simply removing furniture won’t get rid of bed bugs for good. Since these bugs are so tiny, they can easily fit inside cracks in the wall, behind electrical outlets, behind loose trim or molding, and underneath floorboards. Check for bed bugs in these areas if the home is empty or you can’t find them on any furniture.

However, you can find bed bugs during the day by checking any nooks and crannies in the home."

Buy a plastic cover for both your mattress and your box spring, then seal the bed bugs inside. The warmth from the plastic will speed up the process, and the bed bugs will be dead in a month or two.

Buy or rent a steamer , then make multiple passes over areas where you’ve spotted signs of bed bugs. Do this daily until you don’t see bed bugs anymore.

Then, dry them in the dryer on the highest heat setting. Since bed bugs can’t handle a high temperature, the heat from your washer and dryer will kill them.
