      "content": "Beat a video game if you are into gaming. If you have a video game that you have never had time to finish or if there’s a new game you’re dying to try, now is your chance! Set yourself up with something to drink and an easy-to-grab snack so that you can play for a few hours without interruptions. Then, pop in the game and get started! If you start to lose focus, take a quick break. This may help you to get past a challenging part of the game. You may also want to try turning off the music and turning down the volume to help you stay focused. Watching someone else beat a boss, such as on Youtube or Twitch, may also help you to overcome a challenging point in the game. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a scrapbook if you're crafty. Scrapbooking is a fun way to get creative with printed photos, and it can also help you to feel happy and relaxed. Get a blank scrapbook and fill it with pictures of your school year. Add colorful background paper and stickers to accent the pictures. Then, write on the pages to indicate what is going on in the photos. Another option is to make a collage using a big piece of posterboard or cardboard. Glue pictures directly onto the board and add stickers for accents throughout."

Some cities also have free outdoor movies in the summer, so check your local community events guide to find out about these events.

      "content": "Experiment with a new style if you want to change your look. Summer is the perfect time to experiment with your style. Try out new clothes, hair, makeup, and/or accessories to find what makes you feel confident and comfortable. For example, you could try: Getting a new haircut and color. Try out bangs if you’ve never had them before, or dye your hair a shade darker than your natural color, or try something even more daring! (Be sure to check with your parents before cutting or dyeing your hair.) Opt for a new style of clothing. If your usual style is preppy, such as khakis and polo shirts, then you might opt for a rocker look by sporting a pair of ripped jeans and a band t-shirt. Look into makeup that will work well with your features . For example, if you are fair-skinned with blue eyes, then you might try a copper eyeshadow to make your eye color pop."

      "content": "Teach yourself a new skill if you want to learn something. Summer is a great time to learn something new! Think about what you would like to learn and find a way to teach yourself. Even if you only spend a small part of each day on learning this new skill, you will have another fun way to spend your time. For example, maybe you want to learn how to speak French. Download an app, such as Duolingo, and commit to practicing for 10 minutes every day during the summer. If you want to learn how to cook, try asking a family member if they would help you learn, or get a beginner’s cookbook and use it to help you learn. Look at your interests, if you like music, you could learn to play a musical instrument like a guitar."

You can ask someone you met at the gym, someone from school who you would like to get to know better, or another acquaintance. Whoever you ask, they will likely appreciate the invitation and you might even make a new friend in the process, since making friends is often a matter of putting in the time and effort to get to know someone better. Try saying something like, “Hi Gina! I am planning to go to the movies at 2:00 on Saturday. Would you like to join me?” Another option is, “I want to try to beat Dark Souls this summer and I know you play too, so maybe we should team up!”"
