Leaf nodes are the points on the plant where side shoots emerge—aim to cut the stems about .25 inches (0.64 cm) above this point. [9] X Research source According to plant specialists from Artemisia Nursery, “when you cut the basil just above a node, the plant will divide in two, which allows it to continue growing in a much bushier and fuller form.” [10] X Expert Source Artemisia Nursery Plant Nursery & Garden Shop Expert Interview. 7 August 2020."

Once a basil plant flowers, it will not produce any more leaves. When you remove these leaves and stems, you’re basically signalling to the plant to produce more replacement foliage. [11] X Research source What if I just cut off the flower instead? Unfortunately, cutting off the flower won’t create more basil leaf growth; instead, it encourages basil flower growth. You’re better off keeping an eye on your plant and harvesting the leaves and stems before there’s any major flowering. [12] X Research source"

[14] X Research source Alternative: Mix some chopped-up basil with a little oil (a few tablespoons worth) together in a sealable plastic bag, leaving a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) gap of air along the top of the bag. Flatten the bag on a baking sheet and stick it in the freezer, allowing the basil-oil mixture to freeze completely flat. Then, just snap off a small piece of the frozen basil when it’s time to add it to your recipe. Be sure to enjoy your frozen basil within 1 year. [15] X Research source"

Basil plants are classified as “annuals,” which means they live and die in the span of a single growing system (unlike “perennials,” which can last several seasons). While it’s possible to transfer and repot basil plants indoors when it gets too cold outside, your basil won’t have a much longer lifespan since they’re meant to die in a single season.
