If you have none of the materials needed to create a dispenser, you'll need to gather the following objects: One redstone ore - Mine one redstone block. Redstone occurs at a depth of 16 blocks down. You will need an iron pickaxe (or higher) to mine redstone ore. Seven cobblestone blocks - Mine seven pieces of grey rock. You must use a pickaxe to do so, though you can use a wooden pickaxe. Three pieces of string - Kill three spiders. It's best to do so during the daytime since spiders become more aggressive at night. One block of wood - Chop one block of wood on any tree in the game. If you don't have a crafting table, chop an extra block. You'll also need a crafting table in order to create a dispenser."
