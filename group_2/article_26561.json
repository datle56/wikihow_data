      "title": "Write your intention as a single sentence in the present tense.",
      "content": "Write your intention as a single sentence in the present tense. The thought behind sigil magic is that by transforming conscious intentions into symbols that the unconscious can recognize, you can use the power of your unconscious to manifest what you want. While your conscious mind may doubt your abilities, your unconscious works beyond doubt. You could write something like “I am loved,” “I love myself,” or “I am satisfied in my relationships.” Keep your language positive. Write what you want to happen, not what you don’t want to happen."

      "title": "Remove the vowels and repeated letters, then make a design.",
      "content": "Remove the vowels and repeated letters, then make a design. To concentrate the intention, remove all the vowels and repeated consonants. The consonants are thought of as “manifesting sounds.” [1] X Research source Take the leftover consonants and arrange them into a symbol. You can add extra lines and flourishes for effect. For example, if you wrote “Jack is in love with me,” you would write “j c k s n l v w t h m,” but if you wrote “I am loved by Lilly” you would write “m l v d b y.” Make the actual sigil by overlapping the letters, forming images with them (for example, “m” and “v” can be combined to make a heart), and adding extra stylistic elements. If you had an intention that had to do with filling your home with love, for example, you could use the letters to try and form the shape of a house. If you wanted to receive a message from someone who loves you, you could form the shape of an envelope by stacking an “M” on top of a “T” and laying the flat side of an “F” on the “M.” Feel free to repeat letters, warp lines, or even add things that weren’t present in the original intention—it just needs to significantly represent your wish to you."

      "title": "Add pictorial elements that symbolize love (optional).",
      "content": "Add pictorial elements that symbolize love (optional). If you feel connected to any love symbols (or something in particular that symbolizes love to you) add an image of it to your sigil. You can incorporate it into your design, or just sit your design inside of it. [2] X Research source Some common love symbols are: The heart Hands The Sun The Moon The womb Bees Bulls Butterflies"

      "title": "Concentrate on the image until your vision blurs.",
      "content": "Concentrate on the image until your vision blurs. Once you’ve finished drawing your sigil, stare at it while concentrating on your intention. Think about what the symbol means to you, what you want it to represent, and what you want to come out of this process. Keep staring at the sigil until your eyes unfocus and your vision becomes dreamlike. [3] X Research source Some people have difficulty getting to the “blurry vision phase.” Don’t worry if it doesn’t happen for you—just concentrate on it until it feels natural to stop."

      "title": "Put the sigil somewhere out of sight and let yourself detach from it.",
      "content": "Put the sigil somewhere out of sight and let yourself detach from it. To fully plant the sigil in the unconscious world, detach yourself from it and the creation process. Now that the sigil has been imbued with your intentions, your unconscious mind needs time to absorb it and remove the symbol from language. This could take days, weeks, or months."

      "title": "Choose a premade sigil that speaks to you.",
      "content": "Choose a premade sigil that speaks to you. Premade sigils can also be great for your personal use since they’ve often been tested by other people in the occult community. [4] X Research source Just be sure you know exactly what intentions (or words, even) went into its creation. Steer clear of simple titles, like “love sigil,” and look for more specific options like “self-love sigil” or “finding a partner sigil.” A popular “true love” sigil is a large “X” with dots on each end with a large, curly “S” through it. For finding a partner, draw three parallel lines with a stretched-out, backward “s” through them. Draw a downward curl off of the left side of the bottom line, a circle at the top left above the lines, and a dot at the bottom right, below the lines. Use 2 straight lines to connect the circle and dot to the middle line, then draw a circle around everything. If you want to manifest self-love, draw a large V with dots at each point. Add an upside-down T with the bottom line crossing through the V near the bottom and symmetrical curly cues that meet at the intersection of the T. Then add a large circle in the middle of the V with 3 interlocking curly cues inside the circle."

      "title": "Charge your sigil through meditation.",
      "content": "Charge your sigil through meditation. The idea is that, for sigils to work, they need to be charged with energy. Whatever energy you bring to the sigil is supposedly what’s released when it’s activated. To charge it through meditation, clear your mind , look at or think of the sigil, and concentrate on your intention coming true. [5] X Research source When concentrating on your intention, try not to use words. If you can, just bring the feeling of love (loving someone, being loved) into your mind, then feel appreciative of it, as if it’s already happened. Meditating is the most common and “neutral” way of charging your sigil."

      "title": "Use music, chanting, or dance to charge your sigil.",
      "content": "Use music, chanting, or dance to charge your sigil. Charge your sigil with any activity that makes you, personally, feel alive. Play music you love, make up a beat, sing a song, chant, dance, or do anything to get your heart rate up, then concentrate on your sigil at the peak of your practice. [6] X Research source Don’t know when the peak is? Don’t worry. Try to really get into whatever you’re doing. Dance like crazy, sing whatever comes into your mind. Once you think of the sigil again, it’s time to imbue it with your energy. Since this kind of energy focuses on yourself and your experience (you’re doing what you love), this is best for self-love sigils."

      "title": "Concentrate on your sigil during orgasm to charge it with sexual energy.",
      "content": "Concentrate on your sigil during orgasm to charge it with sexual energy. Sex magic is incredibly powerful, and it goes hand in hand with love magic. If you’re looking for a more physical, passionate love, focus on your sigil while having sex or masturbating, then visualize what you want happening as you reach sexual climax. [7] X Research source If you have a sexual partner, consider asking them to help you charge the sigil. If you feel very close with them, their energy can help manifest your desires, too."

    {
      "title": "Charge your sigil when you feel intensely happy or loved.",
      "content": "Charge your sigil when you feel intensely happy or loved. If you’re feeling an overwhelming positive emotion, it might be a good time to charge your sigil. If you can, draw your mind to a time when you were filled with love or were very happy. [8] X Research source Concentrate on that emotion while looking at your sigil to relate them to each other. This is another relatively neutral method that works well for any love sigil."

      "title": "Add your sigil to your altar, or a piece of artwork.",
      "content": "Add your sigil to your altar, or a piece of artwork. Draw your sigil on your altar or incorporate it into a piece of art you see regularly. [9] X Research source Every time you see the sigil, remind yourself of what it means to you. If it’s on your altar, consider incorporating its shape into spellwork. Another way to make sure you see the sigil regularly is by setting it as your phone wallpaper."

      "content": "Carve your sigil on a candle and use it in a love spell. If you want to use your sigil to cast a love spell , carve it into a red candle to “dress” it. [10] X Research source Before you start your spell, light the candle, and let it burn all the way down. Dressing candles is a way of imbuing them with your energy—it’s sort of similar to charging a sigil. Whatever energy you put into the candle is what you’re expecting to come out of it. People dress candles by carving sigils, words, or symbols into them, or anointing them with oils. Red is the color of passion, lust, and love, so it’s often used in love spells.

      "title": "Destroy your sigil to quickly release the energy.",
      "content": "Destroy your sigil to quickly release the energy. The thought is that when a sigil is destroyed, the symbolic version of your desire can be replaced by the physical manifestation of it (nothing can be created or destroyed, only transformed). Draw your sigil on a piece of paper, then use tongs to hold it over a fire. Let it burn out in a fireproof bowl. Once the sigil is destroyed, try to put it out of your mind. Sigils aren’t a replacement for action, so keep working on manifesting your goals and let your unconscious mind (and maybe the universe) do the rest."
