      "content": "Purchase RAM that's compatible with your computer. RAM comes in a variety of models, sizes, and speeds. The type you'll need to buy depends on your motherboard. Check your motherboard or computer’s documentation, or check the manufacturer’s website for the RAM specifications that are compatible with your hardware. Your motherboard has a limit to the number of RAM sticks you can install. Some motherboards support only two, while others support four, six, or even more. Most motherboards have a limit to the amount of memory that they support, regardless of the number of slots. It's also important to note that not all PCs are upgradeable, so if you're not sure, check with your PC's manufacturer. This is often the case with laptops There's no guarantee that unmatching RAM will work together. So if you're buying multiple sticks of RAM, buy it in a set of two or more that are identical."

      "title": "Open your computer case.",
      "content": "Open your computer case. Lay your computer tower on its side, so that you can access the motherboard when the side panel is removed. You may need a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the panel, or you may be able to unscrew it by hand."

      "title": "Discharge any static.",
      "content": "Discharge any static. Ensure that you do not have static build-up on your body. Static can damage computer parts, and can be imperceptible to a human. Ground yourself before starting, or use an antistatic wrist strap. You can ground yourself by touching a metal part on your computer case while it is unplugged from the wall. Simply being turned off does not remove any standby voltages, so make sure it's unplugged. Don’t stand on carpet while working on the interior of the computer."

    {
      "title": "Locate your RAM slots.",
      "content": "Locate your RAM slots. Most motherboards have 2 or 4 RAM slots. RAM slots are typically located near the CPU, though their location may vary depending on the manufacturer or model. Look for narrow slots about 4.5 inches long with tabs on either end. At least one of the slots already has a stick of RAM in it."

      "title": "Remove old RAM (if upgrading).",
      "content": "Remove old RAM (if upgrading). If you are replacing old RAM, remove it by pressing the clamps downward on either side of the slot. You’ll be able to lift the RAM straight out of the motherboard with little to no effort. If you're having to pull too hard, the clamps are likely not down far enough. You may need to use one hand to push the clamps down while using the other hand to remove the RAM."

      "title": "Insert the RAM into the RAM slot.",
      "content": "Insert the RAM into the RAM slot. Line up the notch in the stick of RAM to the break in the slot. Set the stick into the slot and then apply equal pressure onto the stick until the clamps on the side click and lock the RAM in. It'll only fit in one way, so if it's not lining up properly, just flip it around. You may have to apply a fair amount of pressure, but never force it in. Make sure matching pairs are inserted into their matching sockets. Some are labeled on the board or by color, though you may need to refer to your motherboard layout diagram. Repeat the process for each stick of RAM you want to install. While you have the PC open, remove dust using a bottle of compressed air. This can be a quick fix for general overheating and performance issues. Compressed air cans are available at any office supply store."

      "content": "Put the case back on the PC. Once you’ve finished inserting your RAM sticks, you can put the panel back on and screw it back in. Avoid running your computer while the panel is off, as this will actually reduce the cooling power of your fans. Plug your peripherals and monitor back in."

If your computer displays the self-test during the startup, then you can verify that the RAM has been installed correctly. If not, you can verify that the RAM was installed once Windows starts. If your PC will not boot, the RAM is probably not seated properly. Power down your PC and re-open it. Then, remove and reseat the RAM. Make sure it clicks firmly into place and then try again."

Operating systems calculate memory differently and some computers dedicate a certain amount of RAM to specific functions (e.g., video), decreasing the amount available. For example, you may have purchased 8 GB of RAM, but you'll likely only see about 7.78 GB of usable memory."

If you aren’t sure your memory was installed correctly, or your computer isn't running properly since installing it, you can test the RAM using the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool. It may take a while to run, but will discover any errors and display how much is installed. To run the tool, press the Windows key on the keyboard and type memory into the search bar. Click Windows Memory Diagnostic to launch the tool, and then click Restart now and check for problems to run diagnostics."

Then, push the two levers outward (to the sides) to release the memory cage, and pull the levers toward you to see the RAM slots. 20\" and 17\" models (2006 only): Use a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew both screws on the memory access door, which is on the bottom edge of the monitor. Set it aside once removed. Then, press the two ejector clips on either edge of the access door outward (to the sides). Other models: Use a Philips head screwdriver to remove the screw at the center of the memory access door. The door is on the bottom edge of the monitor. Remove the door completely and set it aside.

It will line up with the notch inside the slot. Press downward until the RAM clicks into place. 20\" and 17\" models (2006 only): Slide the RAM notch-side-in into the slot. Use your thumbs to press the RAM in until you feel a slight click. Press both ejector clips back inward to lock the RAM into place.
