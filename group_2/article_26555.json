      "content": "Overlook minor offenses. The more time you spend with anyone, the more chances they will have to upset you. If someone does something that bothers you, take some time to decide if it is worth a confrontation. If you decide that it’s a minor blunder, just let it pass. If the incident really bothers you, you should talk it over with the other person. For example, if a friend spilled coffee on your shirt, there is no need get angry or lecture them. Just change your shirt and let it go. In contrast, if a friend made up a story about you having an affair because they dislike your partner, you probably should have a conversation with them."
