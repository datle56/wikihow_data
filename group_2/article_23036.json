To make the most flavorful coffee , add a scoop of grounds for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) cup of coffee you’re brewing. [1] X Research source For a drip coffee maker, use the following ratios: 1 cup of coffee = 1 scoop (2 tbsp) of grounds, & 6 fl oz (180 ml) water 2 cups of coffee = 2 scoops (4 tbsp) of grounds, & 12 fl oz (350 ml) water 4 cups of coffee = 4 scoops (8 tbsp) of grounds, & 24 fl oz (710 ml) water 6 cups of coffee = 6 scoops (12 tbsp) of grounds, & 36 fl oz (1,100 ml) water 8 cups of coffee = 8 scoops (16 tbsp) of grounds, & 48 fl oz (1,400 ml) water 10 cups of coffee = 10 scoops (20 tbsp) of grounds, & 60 fl oz (1,800 ml) water 12 cups of coffee = 12 scoops (24 tbsp) of grounds, & 72 fl oz (2,100 ml) water"

      "content": "Aim for a 1:15 or 1:18 ratio of coffee grounds to water. When you measure coffee by weight, you can get more precise with your measurements. Coffee-to-water ratios are normally in the metric system, so for every 1 gram of coffee grounds you use, use around 15 or 18 milliliters of water. [2] X Research source For example, if you want to make a single cup of coffee for a 300 mL mug, then use 20 grams of coffee grounds. [3] X Research source Using a 1:15 ratio gives your coffee a stronger and richer flavor that’s more acidic because you’re using less water. When you use a 1:18 ratio, expect a more mellow, less acidic flavor from your cup of coffee."

If you’re using a normal coffee scoop, you’ll get about 20-30 scoops from the bag. Some coffee grounds and beans vary in weight depending on where they were grown and how they were processed, so your number of scoops may vary."
