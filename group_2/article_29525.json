      "content": "Gather your supplies. You'll be cutting paper into narrow strips and then taping these together in a pattern to create your frilled cuff. You can use different colored paper to make your cuff more colorful, or add designs of your own to it with crayons or markers. It goes without saying that you'll need scissors and paper, but including these, you'll also need: Crayons or markers (optional) Paper (normal size; 2 sheets) Ruler Scissors Tape"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut your paper for folding.",
      "content": "Cut your paper for folding. Depending on how long or short you want to make your cuff, you'll need between four and eight strips of paper. Use your ruler to measure your strips equally to give your cuff a polished look, and then cut the strips longways. The thicker your strips, the thicker your frilled cuff will be. Be careful when working with thin strips; these can tear more easily."

    {
      "title": "Connect the ends of two strips.",
      "content": "Connect the ends of two strips. Take two strips by the ends and layer one over the other. The edges should be even with no overlap and should form an L shape. Now you can use your tape to join the strips together."

    {
      "title": "Fold your paper to add layers.",
      "content": "Fold your paper to add layers. Begin with the bottom paper of the two. Take it and fold it so that it crosses and folds over the layered ends that you've taped together. Crease the fold where it crosses the layered square of your two edges. Repeat this motion with your other strip, which should now be sandwiched between your bottom strip of paper. Continue this pattern, alternating folds between your strips one at a time."

    {
      "title": "Include more strips for more length.",
      "content": "Include more strips for more length. When you begin to run out of paper you can simply add another strip to the ends of each of your starting strips. Tape the ends of your new strips to your starting strips and continue folding."

      "content": "Check to see your bracelet fits and trim unneeded ends. Stretch your frilled cuff bracelet out at various points throughout the folding process. Hold it against your wrist or lay it on top of your wrist to check its length. When you are satisfied with the length: Trim the ends of your bracelet so each lines up evenly. Tape the loose ends together so your bracelet doesn't come unfolded."

      "content": "Collect your bracelet making tools. Though you will make this bracelet through folding, you'll have to cut strips of paper in a 1:4 size ratio first. This means if you cut strips one inch (3 cm) thick, you'll need the strips to be four inches (12 cm) long. Along with your paper and scissors, you'll also need: Binder clip or tape Crayons or markers (optional) Paper (normal size; multiple sheets) Pencil Ruler Scissors"

With your ruler, measure out equal strips from your paper that follow a 1:4 size ratio. For example, ½ inch (1.5 cm) wide strips should be two inches (6 cm) long. Depending on how long you want to make your bracelet, you will need between 16 and 22 strips. Decorate your strips with your own designs to add your personal flair! [1] X Research source"

Then, the same way you folded the bitten croc, fold the bottom and top parts of the \"mouth\" even with the outside edge of your weave and then on top of it. You should then be able to tuck the ends inside a pocket formed by your first two strips. [4] X Research source Folding your open ends into the pocket formed by the first two strips will fasten your strips together without another binder clip or piece of tape. You may want to leave a little extra space on the fold side of the croc-strip, as more loop space can be easier to work with, especially for children."

Use the same pattern as before: Fold the tail so its outside edge is flat to the outer edge of the weave. Fold that on top of the weave and tuck the remainder into the pocket.
