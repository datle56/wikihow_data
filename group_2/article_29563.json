      "content": "Collect your supplies. You will need plain white card stock, 5-6 sheets of different colored construction paper, and some acrylic silver spray paint. Super glue, tape, a ruler, and scissors are all necessary to help build your robot. You may also want to add different colored pipe cleaners, buttons, and beads onto your robot."

      "title": "Draw four connected squares.",
      "content": "Draw four connected squares. First, you will want to find paper which is thick, like card stock. The dimensions of your cube will be 2X2X2 inches. Using a ruler, draw a 2X2 square on the paper. You can use a protractor to check whether each of the angles are 90 degrees. After you have drawn the first square, you will now have to draw three more of equal size. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source [3] X Research source The next three will go directly next to the first square. Each new square will use a line from the previous square. Continue this until you have four squares, all connected together in one large rectangle. You will now have a rectangle of four connected squares, with a total dimension of 2X8 inches, and three visible pencil lines."

      "content": "Join the edges of the cube together. For this step you can use either glue or tape. Fold up the three squares at the top of the cross. Lift up the long end of the cross and fold the top over. You should now have what looks roughly like a cube. Use small pieces of tape, or dabs of glue, to join together the edges. If you use glue, hold the edges together for at least 30 seconds so that the glue can dry. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a cuboid out of heavy paper. This follows the same steps as the normal cube. The only difference is the dimensions. Draw a 2X4 inch rectangle. On top of that rectangle, on the long side, draw a 4X8 rectangle. Make sure that the lines of both rectangles connect with one another. On top of that rectangle, draw another 2X4 rectangle. Then, on top of that one, draw another 4X8 rectangle. At the end, you should have a rectangle that is 4X20 inch rectangle, with three pencil marks. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source Remember, 4 inch sides need to match up with 4 inch sides. 8 inch sides need to match up with 8 inch sides. For example, when drawing the 4X8 rectangle above the 2X4 rectangle, the 4 inch sides need to match up. On both sides of one of the 4X8 rectangles, draw a 8X2 rectangle. At the end, you should have what looks like a cross."

If you use glue, hold the edges down for 30 seconds to ensure that the glue dries. [10] X Research source"

Take them outside so that fumes don't build up indoors. Spray from about 1-2 feet away. Make sure that you get all the sides and edges. You can let one side dry before you spray paint the other sides. [11] X Research source [12] X Research source If you decide to wrap your boxes in tin foil, simply peel off large sheets of tin foil. Cut two long strips which will wrap around both boxes. You also want to cut out four smaller pieces to wrap around the smaller areas and edges.
