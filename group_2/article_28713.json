Add the vinegar, vanilla, and applesauce and mix the ingredients together. Basically, one cup of applesauce per box of cake mix acts as a fair substitute for the required amount of eggs and oil. In a typical cake (if you were making this without the box), one cup of applesauce replaces the two eggs usually asked for."
