Ground meat can be left in the fridge for between 1-2 days past its sell-by date. Chopped meats, steaks, and roasts can last between 3-5 days. Meat can last longer if it is frozen. If your meat has been in the fridge for a few days and you have no plans to use it, freeze it to avoid spoilage. [2] X Research source"
