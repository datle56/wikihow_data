      "content": "Start to analyze what makes you cautious or fearful. Maybe you feel shy all the time. Or you might get nervous and quiet in large social situations. Knowing what causes your shyness will help you to get over it faster. Also, realize that shyness is not a personalityâ€”it's just an obstacle that stands in your way. [1] X Research source Don't just focus on what you need to improve. Think about your strengths too. Maybe you are withdrawn, but you're also really good at observing people and understanding them. You may also want to identify any specific areas that contribute to your shyness. For example, do you feel shy at informal or formal events? Does the age or status of the person you are speaking to influence your shyness?"

[5] X Research source Try to find similar interests by sharing information about yourself. You may be surprised to find that people have similar interests or dislikes as you.
