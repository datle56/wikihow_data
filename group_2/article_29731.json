      "content": "Make your onesie . Measure your fit against a comfy pair of sweats and a hoodie. Fold them lengthwise and cut on your folded fabric, leaving about 1.5 in (4 cm) for seam allowance, then flip them and repeat to cut out the back of your onesie. Sew on your zipper, then cut out and sew on your sleeves. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut and sew your hood. Fold your sweatshirt in half on an unused, folded section of your fleece. Trace it or pin it in place, then cut around it, leaving about 1.5 in (4 cm) for seam allowance. Sew the two pieces together on the curved edge. Open the hood and pin its bottom portion to the back collar of the onesie. Sew it into place. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a chest piece.",
      "content": "Make a chest piece. Choose a complementary felt color, such as pink for a white or gray costume, or white for a pink costume. Measure yourself from chest to waist, then cut out an oval of that length. Cut it in half, then use a sewing machine or fabric glue to affix the pieces to either side of your zipper."

      "title": "Add a pair of bunny ears to your hood.",
      "content": "Add a pair of bunny ears to your hood. Cut out two long ear-shaped pieces of matching felt, then two smaller inner ear pieces out of your complementary color. Glue or sew the inner ears onto the bigger ones. For floppy ears, simply glue or sew your felt pieces directly onto your hood. [3] X Research source For ears that stand up, attach pipe cleaners or thin wires to the back of the ears, following the edge of the felt. Glue or sew a strip of felt over the wire or pipe cleaners to hide them, then attach the ears."

      "title": "Make a bunny tail.",
      "content": "Make a bunny tail. To add the finishing touch to your bunny onesie, use handful of small white cotton balls, one large cotton ball, or a bunched-up feather boa that matches your chest piece and the insides of your ears. Attach it to the back of your costume using fabric glue and let it dry overnight. For added security, clip it on with a few safety pins once it's dried."

For a fuller, fluffier look, line the inside with the batting from a pillow or old couch cushion, hot gluing it in place at the neck and armholes. [4] X Research source To prepare for cold weather, wear a long-sleeve white shirt and leggings underneath the sweatshirt, or leave the sleeves attached and role them at the wrist if needed."

Snip this end off of the sleeve and fit it to your head, trimming more if necessary. With the other sleeve, cut out two triangles, about 7 in (2.5 cm) long each. Cut out two smaller, teardrop-shaped pieces of pink felt to glue to the ears. Glue the triangles onto the hat for floppy bunny ears. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a fake carrot as an accessory. To complete the costume, cut out a carrot-shaped piece of cardboard and cover it with orange construction paper. Add some chopped-up green pipe cleaners to the top for a stem. You could use a real carrot for a shorter party. For example, a real carrot would probably be OK to last through an Easter party, but not a full day of school or a long night of trick-or-treating."

      "content": "Make a dress or leotard out of a large T-shirt. Lay a black, white or pink T-shirt flat and place a fitted dress on top of the shirt. Cut around the shirt around the outline of the dress, leaving about 0.5 in (1.2 cm) in space along the sides. Turn it inside out and either glue or sew the sides together. Cut out a neckline if you'd like a lower-cut dress. Hold the dress up against your body before cutting a neckline to get an accurate measurement. Remember to cut carefully. You can always snip off more if you need to, but it's not as easy to re-attach pieces once they're cut! [7] X Research source If you don't have a fitted dress to use as a template, try on the T-shirt and pin it into the style and fit you want, then cut."

      "content": "Create a cute bunny ear headband. Twist the tops of two pipe cleaners together, then fold in the two ends and twist them together to create a pointy ear shape with a flat bottom. Repeat with two other pipe cleaners to make your two ears, then hold them up against each other to make sure they're the same size. Use tape to attach them to the headband. Lay a piece of felt or satin onto the ears and cut two pieces around the ear shape, then use hot glue to attach them. Trim off any excess along the sides. [8] X Research source Cut out “inner ears” in a complementary color (gray if your dress is black, pink if your dress is white, black or gray) and glue them onto the fabric with hot glue. For a fancier look, use a piece of lace for your ears instead of felt or satin. Don't be afraid to use a lot of tape when you're attaching your ears! You want to make sure they'll stay on as long as you wear them."
