To keep your skin looking its best, you should wash your face in the morning when you get up, and in the evening before you go to bed. Use a facial cleanser (not regular soap) and gentle, circular motions. Never scrub your skin, as this can damage it. When you are done, splash your face with cold water. This will help tighten and minimize your pores. Avoid using hot water, as this can cause your skin to become dry. Focus on the areas that tend to get the most oily and dirty, such as your nose, forehead, neck, and chin. Always remove your makeup before you go to bed, no matter how tired you are. Leaving makeup on will lead to clogged pores and pimples."

Too much sunlight, however, can damage your skin and lead to wrinkles and skin cancer. This does not mean that you have to avoid sunlight like a vampire, however. Simply put on sunscreen that has at least 30 SPF on it every day before you go out, and try to limit your sunbathing. You can always add a healthy glow to your skin with bronzer . Many moisturizers and liquid foundations contain sunscreen. Consider getting one for the summer. Try to avoid the sun between 10am and 2pm, as this is when the sun's rays are at their strongest. If you must step out, put on some sunscreen or a long-sleeved shirt. [4] X Research source"

It can also help you feel good about yourself. Unfortunately, it can also clog your pores and potentially lead to acne.

This will help your skin feel soft and smooth. You can find these at beauty supply shops, but you can make them as well with simple ingredients, such as sugar and olive oil. Avoid using body butters on your face. Use facial moisturizing creams instead. You can use some sugar scrubs on your face, but they must be labeled for facial use.

Don't rely on perfume or use it in place of deodorant. You must wear deodorant daily. If it is very hot, you may have to reapply it.

Having a bad hair day with unmanageable frizz? Try braids. They are much gentler on your hair than straightening, and take much less time to do. Consider no-heat methods when curling your hair.

Don't be afraid to paint your nails, or even get a professional manicure. A little bit of color never hurt anyone. If you do choose to paint your nails by yourself, remember to take the old nail polish off first. Wearing nail polish on top of chipped, peeling nail polish will look messy. To protect your nails and make your polish last longer, remember to apply a good base coat before your nail polish, and a good top coat after you are done. Don't use nail polish as a replacement for proper nail care. Take care of your nails first, then think about nail polish."

You can also go to a beauty salon or manicure place, and have your eyebrows and upper lip waxed as well. Remember shaving is a personal choice, not a requirement. You don't need to shave to look beautiful. It is not a good idea to pluck or wax your eyebrows by yourself. Getting the right shape can be hard, and it is easy to mess up and over-plus. If you can't or don't want to wax your eyebrows, groom them instead. Pluck away any unruly hairs, then comb your eyebrows with a clean spoolie brush. Check with your parents. They might not allow you to shave because of religion or culture. You can bleach your body hair instead of shaving. Bleaching kits are available at drugstores, makeup stores, etc."

It is fine if you prefer a torn, ragged, \"punk\" look, but try not to be sloppy about it. When washing your clothes, read the how-to-wash tags. If you don't wash certain garments properly, you could ruin them. Always wash white clothes separately from colored clothes. If you wash them with other colors, they may turn dingy.
