      "content": "Give signals of being troubled, distracted, or even a little absent-minded. Sad people will pull away from the world and take less interest in what is happening around them. You will look more sad in a face-to-face meeting if you come across distant and lost in your own mind. Give the impression that you have lost interest in things you once enjoyed. For example, pretend you did not watch the latest sporting event and don’t care how it turned out. Start to say something but then stop yourself as though communicating just isn’t important anymore. Toy with things absent-mindedly, such as the edge of your sleeve, twigs or leaves, chipping paint, etc."

Mention casually that you haven’t spoken to friends in a while and have been spending time alone. Respond to invitations by saying “maybe” in a way that invites the person to infer you mean “no.” Stop listening while the other person talks. Do this in order to show disinterest or interrupt them as though you weren’t really listening."

      "content": "Give an impression of detachment and resignation. A deep sadness will often cause someone to draw away from social contact and emotional connection with others, and you can bring signs of aversion and distance to your performance without changing the script or stage at all. For example: [6] X Research source Lower your gaze and avoid looking directly at the other characters on stage. Stare off stage as though unconnected to your surroundings. Maybe make eye contact with someone in the audience. Your character will appear detached from those on stage, but the connection with another person allows you to use smaller gestures such as facial expressions. Toy with objects on stage as though you are lost in thought or moving absentmindedly. Don’t respond to the emotions of the other characters to indicate your detachment. Don’t react to sudden movements or loud sounds to show your brooding, disinterested state."

      "title": "Use melodramatic gestures and overt signals when the performance allows it.",
      "content": "Use melodramatic gestures and overt signals when the performance allows it. Sometimes subtlety is not the name of the game, and you can use profuse dramatic movements and gestures to get your point across during a play. Take advantage of those moments to clue the audience in to your character’s sadness. For instance: Fall into heap of tears, covering or shrouding your face as you sob. Cross your forearm across forehead and look away in the classic theatrical pose of woe and sadness. Speak through sobs or loud moans. Hug and clutch at the other actors, pulling and cloying at them to show your character’s tragic abandon. Maybe you can really shed tears on the stage. Remember, there are a hundred ways to get yourself to fake cry, but in the end it only matters if the audience cries. [7] X Research source Keep the melodrama within the bounds of the performance. In other words, don’t go overboard."
