      "title": "Choose 22 gauge wire in the color of your choice.",
      "content": "Choose 22 gauge wire in the color of your choice. You can select any type of jewelry wire you like to make ear cuffs. Jewelry wire is available at craft supply stores in a variety of sizes and colors. The wire will needs to be thick enough to a hold its shape after you bend it and flexible enough to tighten and loosen it when you take the cuff off and on. A 22-guage wire works well. You can find wire that is finished with different colors, such as copper, red, blue, green, etc., or you can go with a plain silver colored wire. [1] X Research source You will only need a few inches of wire to create an ear cuff, but wire is usually sold in spool that is a few feet long."

      "content": "Measure the part of your ear where you want to wear the cuff. Take a 2 in (5.1 cm) piece of string in both hands and hold it up to your ear. Wrap it around the part of your ear where you want to put your cuff. Use your fingers to pinch off the string at the locations where you want the cuff to begin and end. Then, hold the string next to a ruler to figure out how long your wire will need to be. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) of wire. Cut your first length of wire using a pair of sharp scissors or wire cutters. Cut straight across the wire to avoid creating a pointed edge. [3] X Research source When in doubt, give yourself a little longer piece of wire to work with—you can always cut it later."

      "title": "Smooth out the edges of the wire.",
      "content": "Smooth out the edges of the wire. Use a metal file to smooth the ends of the wire. Move the file back and forth across 1 end of the wire until it feels smooth when you run your finger across it, and then repeat on the other end of the wire. This will help to prevent jagged edges from scratching your ear when you wear the ear cuff. [4] X Research source"

To get the right curve for an ear cuff, take the whole shape you have created and bend it around a pen, or another cylindrical object. A normal permanent marker is usually perfect, but smaller pens may be too thin to effectively round off the cuff. [11] X Research source Once you put the cuff on your ear, you can use your fingers to lightly mold it into place even more, so it will stick to your ear."
