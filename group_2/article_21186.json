Since adeniums originate from a desert climate, it is recommended to use a potting solution other than clay and compost. [1] X Research source Mixing peat moss and sand keeps the soil well-drained while also retaining moisture. You can also use a soil mixture made for cacti and succulents. Fill a tray or pot with 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of depth with the mixture. Line the bottom of the tray or pot with gravel for added drainage. You can substitute perlite instead of sand.

      "content": "Spray the growing medium with water every other day. Adeniums do not require a lot of water, but the seeds should stay moist while germinating. Use a spray bottle to saturate the surface of the potting mixture, being careful not to overwater. [6] X Research source The growing medium should be damp to the touch, but there shouldn’t be standing water on the surface. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the seedlings to individual pots after 1 month.",
      "content": "Move the seedlings to individual pots after 1 month. Fill the individual pots with the same potting mixture. Use a transplant tool or a wooden ruler to dig out the seedling, ensuring the root structure stays intact. When replanting, place the adenium 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher in the soil so 1 ⁄ 2 inch (13 mm) of the root is above ground. This will ensure a thick caudex forms above ground. Since adeniums cannot survive in the freezing temperatures of winter, it’s recommended that you keep them in planters or pots so they can easily be moved inside."

You can substitute the sand with fine gravel or perlite for a similar effect. Lay a thin layer of gravel on the bottom of the pot so the pot drains more efficiently.

Using a rooting powder or solution will promote the growth of roots from the stem and can be purchased at gardening stores. The cut end of the stem will be what goes in the ground. Bury only 2 inches (5.1 cm) so the exposed end has a starting point for leaves. Propagated stems will not form an above-ground caudex. The roots will grow underground, but can eventually be exposed after the cutting grows. [13] X Research source"

When they dry, water them again. Waterlogged adeniums can develop root rot if there is too much water present. [14] X Research source"

The cuttings can be kept indoors or outdoors as long as they stay in a warm and bright place, but keep them out of direct sunlight. As they begin to sprout new leaves, you can begin moving the adeniums into more direct sunlight. [15] X Research source If you keep the adenium indoors, turn the pot 180° every 2 days so it will evenly get sunlight. [16] X Research source"

If it is not, you should water your adenium. This usually equates to about 1-3 waterings per week, though they can survive droughts without affecting their health. The more light an adenium gets, the more water it will use."

      "content": "Fertilize adeniums every 2 weeks between April and October. When adeniums take in water from the potting mixture, they also pull much of the nutrients. Lay a thin layer of general purpose fertilizer on top of the soil once every 2 weeks so the adenium flourishes. Mix the fertilizer at half the recommended strength, and only apply it during the growing season, which is between April and October."

Prune at the end of the blooming season in early autumn. Use a sharp pair of pruning shears and cut where an unhealthy or unshapely stem connects to the other. [17] X Research source Sterilized pruning shears will help prevent fungus or rot on the exposed cuts. Save the healthy stems you prune to propagate more adenium plants!"

      "content": "Bring adenium indoors when temperatures drop below 32 °F (0 °C). Adeniums are from warm climates, so they will freeze and die if they are left outside. Bring any pots or containers into the house or a covered porch to keep them warm and growing. Plants will drop their leaves and go “dormant” at the end of the growing season. Continue providing them with light and small amounts of water so that they will bloom next season."

      "content": "Repot adenium when it outgrows its pot. Adeniums will grow noticeably larger with enough light and water. Remove the plant from its pot and break away as much of the potting mixture as you can. [18] X Research source Place them in a larger pot, making sure not to plant them deeper than what they were in the previous pot. This way the caudex will continue to form above ground. Fill the pot with more potting mixture and water the adenium. Some of the roots may distort plastic pots or break through clay once they grow too large. You may need to use a hammer to break adeniums out of a tight-fitting pot."
