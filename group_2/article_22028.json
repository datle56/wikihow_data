Many people turn their casts into limbs of their favorite superheroes, but you can also be inspired by a favorite snack or beverage, a sports team, your city, or just a pretty scene. [1] X Research source If you're not talented enough to do it yourself, ask an artistic friend to make you a paint-by-numbers with a permanent marker, then you can fill it in with paint. It's probably best to use a more permanent paint such as acrylic. If you use spray paint, be sure to protect your skin with a shield of some kind, such as plastic bags."
