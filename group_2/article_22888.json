      "content": "Get your parents' permission. Let your parents know you want to ask them about something. Pick a space free of outside distractions and a time when your parents are not busy. For example, you could ask them in the family room after dinner one night. Explain the sleepover calmly. Let your parents know who you want to invite, what you want to do, any money you'll need. For example, \"Mom, Dad, I really want to have Maya sleepover Friday night. I want us to be better friends because we have so much in common. I want us to stay up, play board games, and watch movies. All I need is money for pizza and snacks.\" Keep in mind, that your parents may say no. Be respectful of this, as complaining will make you seem immature. Ask them why they said \"No,\" so you can better understand, and ask again in a month or so. They may change their mind with time, especially if you maturely accept their answer."
