      "title": "Take note of where you found the insect.",
      "content": "Take note of where you found the insect. The habitat an insect lives in can help to narrow down what sort of insect you have found. Certain types of insects are predominantly found in swamps, some live in rural areas, and others live in gardens. Note down the general area that you found the insect, such as in the garden, and also record the more specific spot, such as under a log. The more details you record; the easier it is to narrow down what type of insect you have spotted. [1] X Research source Termites and earwigs are commonly found in swampy areas. Bark beetles and aphids are often spotted in gardens. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Record what time of day you spotted the insect.",
      "content": "Record what time of day you spotted the insect. Different insects are active at different times of the day. Take note of whether it is morning, afternoon, or evening. Butterflies often fly around during the day, mosquitos tend to come out at dusk, and moths usually come out at night. [3] X Research source If you observed the insect for a long period of time, take note of the time when you first saw it and when it left the area. This can help give you extra clues when you’re searching for the insect in a database."

      "title": "Note if the insect has wings.",
      "content": "Note if the insect has wings. This is an easy way to narrow down the type of insect that you are looking at. Make a note of whether the insect flies, as some insects have wings but don’t fly. Describe the colour and size of the wings in your notes to help you remember what they looked like.

      "title": "Record the different colours of the insect.",
      "content": "Record the different colours of the insect. Most insects have at least 2 colours. Identify the main colour of the insect and then record any secondary colours and distinct markings. This will help to narrow down what type of insect you have found. [5] X Research source The American dagger moth is green, the boxelder bug has orange markings, and brown dog ticks are brown.

      "title": "Check if the insect has any antennae.",
      "content": "Check if the insect has any antennae. Observe as closely as you can what the antennae look like, as this can help give clues as to what insect it is. Note whether the antennae are coloured, plaited, spiky, short, or long. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Insects use their antennae to help sense the environment around them.

      "title": "Observe whether the insect has a moving jaw.",
      "content": "Observe whether the insect has a moving jaw. Some insects have mouths that open. These insects eat smaller insects or plants. Other insects have straw-like mouths that use to suck food up. If you see an insect eating, record what kind of mouth it has. [10] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source This method of identification is easier to use for larger insects as it is difficult to see the mouth of very small insects. Ants and grasshoppers have jaws that open, and mosquitoes and bed bugs have straw-like mouths. [11] X Research source"
