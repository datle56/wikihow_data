[2] X Research source You do not need a picture of a real skeleton to do this. You can use a prop skeleton from a costume shop. You can also find images of skeletons on Google Images by searching \"Skeleton\", \"Skeleton hand\", \"skull\", etc. Just remember that most photos you find on Google Images are copyright and not free to use for commercial use. However, you can use them for personal use or just to experiment with. You may want to take several pictures of your model posing to make sure you get an image that aligns with the skeleton pose as much as possible. Try to get images of your model and skeleton image in front of a plain white background. This will provide an ideal background for your subject and will make it easier to remove the background of your skeleton image later on."
