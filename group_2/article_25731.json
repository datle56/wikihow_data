In fact, come a little early and open your notebook to the right place, open your textbook and take out your calculator so that you're ready to start when your teacher is ready to start.

Don't just write down the problems. Also write down anything that the teacher says that increases your understanding of the concepts. Work any sample problems that your teacher posts for you to do. When the teacher walks around the classroom as you work, answer questions. Participate while the teacher is working a problem. Don't wait for your teacher to call on you. Volunteer to answer when you know the answer, and raise your hand to ask questions when you're unsure of what's being taught."

You'll learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide both fractions and decimals. Regarding fractions, you'll learn how to reduce fractions and interpret mixed numbers. Regarding decimals, you'll understand place value, and you'll be able to use decimals in word problems. Study ratios, proportions and percentages. These concepts will help you to learn about making comparisons. Solve squares and square roots. When you've mastered this topic, you'll have perfect squares of many numbers memorized. You'll also be able to work with equations containing square roots. Introduce yourself to basic geometry. You'll learn all of the shapes as well as 3D concepts. You'll also learn concepts like area, perimeter, volume and surface area, as well as information about parallel and perpendicular lines and angles. Understand some basic statistics. In pre-algebra, your introduction to statistics mostly includes visuals like graphs, scatter plots, stem-and-leaf plots and histograms. Learn algebra basics. These will include concepts like solving simple equations containing variables, learning about properties like the distributive property, graphing simple equations and solving inequalities."

You'll also learn to: [9] X Research source Solve linear equations and inequalities that contain 1-2 variables. You'll learn how to solve these problems not only on paper, but sometimes on a calculator as well. Tackle word problems. You'll be surprised how many everyday problems that you'll face in your future involve the ability to solve algebraic word problems. For example, you'll use algebra to figure out the interest rate that you earn on your bank account or on your investments. You can also use algebra to figure out how long you'll have to travel based on the speed of your car. Work with exponents. When you start solving equations with polynomials (expressions containing both numbers and variables), you'll have to understand how to use exponents. This may also include working with scientific notation. Once you have exponents down, you can learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomial expressions. Understand functions and graphs. In algebra, you'll really get into graphic equations. You'll learn how to calculate the slope of a line, how to put equations into point-slope form, and how to calculate the x- and y-intercepts of a line using slope-intercept form. Figure out systems of equations. Sometimes, you're given 2 separate equations with both x and y variables, and you have to solve for x or y for both equations. Fortunately, you'll learn many tricks for solving these equation including graphing, substitution and addition."

[13] X Research source Calculus will teach you about functions and about limits. You'll see the behavior or a number of useful functions including e^x and logarithmic functions. You'll also learn how to calculate and work with derivatives. A first derivative gives you information based on the slope of a tangent line to an equation. For instance, a derivative tells you the rate at which something is changing in a non-linear situation. A second derivative will tell you whether a function is increasing or decreasing along a certain interval so that you can determine the concavity of a function. Integrals will teach you how to calculate the area beneath a curve as well as volume. High school calculus usually ends with sequences and series. Although students won't see many applications for series, they are important to people who go on to study differential equations. Calculus is still only the beginning for some.
