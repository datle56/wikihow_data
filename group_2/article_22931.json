      "content": "Red: love, passion, anger Red is one of the most intense, stimulating colors that raises a room’s energy. Muted shades can pique feelings of love, passion, and sensuality, while bright hues may trigger anger, strength, and power. It’s a warm, generally positive, motivating color that encourages people to act and gives shy, soft-spoken folks more confidence. A little red goes a long way—just an accent wall or a few items of decor are enough to invigorate you.

      "content": "Yellow: joy, happiness, communication Yellow is another intense, motivating color that triggers feelings of happiness. It tends to bring out your intelligence, wisdom, and creativity and is the most optimistic, hopeful color (probably because it’s associated with sunlight). It’s light and playful in small doses, but can be overwhelming or anxiety-inducing in large amounts (especially if you’re already stressed). Lighter or pastel shades are less stimulating than bright hues.

Primary blue is used in therapeutic settings for meditation and relaxation because it helps you unwind, find peace, and become more comfortable expressing your inner feelings.

      "content": "Brown: comfort, resilience, security Brown is a warm, grounding, neutral color that provokes a feeling of safety (probably since it’s a rich, earthy color). It doesn’t stand out much on its own, even though it can be used for entire walls or rooms. Brown reminds people of their basic necessities and important connections, like family and shelter. It blends well with most other colors and can add a sense of stability to bright, energetic hues like orange or yellow.

      "content": "Gray: comfort, maturity, calmness Gray is the most neutral of neutrals and is associated with self-restraint or conformism at times, but also sleek sophistication and modern style. It has a calming, unemotional effect and can be somewhat draining on its own, but makes other colors stand out when used in combination. Darker shades of gray may make you feel edgier and moodier (similar to navy blue or black) while lighter shades feel more timeless and hopeful. Gray has less of an impact overall on your mood than other colors.

It has a decluttering effect and can make small spaces seem bigger, which can help stimulate your creativity and make you feel more refreshed and organized. However, too much white can feel sterile, harsh, or lonely.

      "title": "According to color theory, colors can soothe emotional problems.",
      "content": "According to color theory, colors can soothe emotional problems. Also known as chromotherapy or color healing, color theory suggests that specific colors and their frequencies have a physiological and psychological impact on your feelings and behavior. For example, a stressed or angry person might expose themselves to the color blue to calm down and lower their heart rate, while a person with depression may look at reds and yellows to increase their energy. [25] X Research source Color psychology works through simple exposure (for example, surrounding yourself with orange to increase your energy). In a guided therapy session, a practitioner may use projectors or special light bulbs to isolate specific wavelengths of colored light. Color theory has existed in some form or another since the time of the ancient Egyptians. It may also have roots in Eastern healing practices like balancing chakras , where each chakra (pools of energy inside the body) is associated with a different color."

      "title": "There’s some evidence color theory works, but more research is needed.",
      "content": "There’s some evidence color theory works, but more research is needed. There aren’t many clinical studies that prove the effectiveness of color psychology, and the ones that exist are somewhat inconclusive. In one experiment, for example, the color blue was shown to tangibly reduce stress in participants who looked at it during a guided relaxation session. However, a control group that was exposed to white and guided through the same session also showed decreased stress. This shows that the placebo effect may play a large role in the effectiveness of chromotherapy. [26] X Research source Essentially, if you believe that a color will calm you down or energize you, chances are that it actually will because you’re mentally primed to expect a result. While there are some “universal truths” about how certain colors affect the brain and body, each person’s response to a color may be different based on their experiences and cultural background. [27] X Research source In general, color psychology hasn’t been proved to be more or less effective than other forms of mood regulation, like meditating or journaling."

      "content": "Better stress management and reduced anger Wearing or surrounding yourself in colors that calm and relax you makes it easier to cope with stress and work through feelings of aggression. When your environment makes you feel happy, energetic, and motivated, you’re less likely to be triggered by inconveniences, stressors, or negative feelings. [28] X Research source Just a few brightly colored accessories or pops of color throughout your home are enough to elevate your mood."

      "content": "Decreased symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) Through exposure to bright, cheery colors during dark winter months, a person may feel more warmth and comfort in their home. This combats the low-energy, depressing mood some people feel during winter, when the days are shorter and exposure to natural colors like blues, greens, and yellows is limited. Some studies suggest these brighter colors can actually elevate your dopamine levels. [29] X Research source"

      "content": "Improved sleep Exposure to colors can help regulate your circadian rhythm (your body’s internal clock), especially when it’s been affected by depression. This benefit has been studied largely through colored light—exposure to blue and green light is known to make it difficult to fall asleep since those colors are more present in daylight. However, red or amber light has been shown to increase (and possibly stimulate) melatonin production and aid sleep. [30] X Research source If you’ve ever worn blue light-blocking glasses , you’ve participated in a form of color theory."

      "content": "Improved communication and relationships When a person is surrounded by colors that inspire positive emotions, it makes them more open to socialization and opening up to others . This can deepen that person’s bonds with loved ones and encourage them to go out and meet new people as well. Conversely, being surrounded by dark or muted colors may make a person less communicative. [32] X Research source"
