GNOME Desktop comes with all the perks of the GNOME desktop environment, plus additional software like LibreOffice , the Firefox web browser, RhythmBox (a music player), GIMP , and more. The full version is the most resource-intensive version of GNOME and requires the most disk space (2GB). [2] X Research source"

If you don't want all of the extra software but like the GNOME interface, fonts, icons, and views, install GNOME Desktop Minimal. With GNOME Desktop Minimal, you'll get the same great desktop experience with fewer apps to clog up your hard drive. GNOME Desktop Minimal only needs about 800 MB of disk space compared to the full version's 2 GB."

While GNOME Minimal still has the typical GNOME sidebar running along the left side of the screen, Vanilla GNOME is even more stripped-down than that. If you need a bare-bones desktop environment with no added software or even core apps and tweaks, Vanilla GNOME is for you—even on very old hardware. Vanilla GNOME is so stripped down that there aren't even minimize buttons on the windows! If you want to be able to tweak Vanilla GNOME a bit to make it slightly less vanilla, install the GNOME Tweaks tool. To get it, add the Universe repository using the add-apt-repository universe command, then run sudo apt install gnome-tweaks to install. You can then run gnome-tweaks at the prompt to customize your interface."
