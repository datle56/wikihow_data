The Sims 2 was not designed to run on operating systems past Windows XP – Double Deluxe and packs released after it do officially work on Windows Vista, but players tend to run into more issues than on Windows XP. Further Windows releases tend to have even more issues, including issues with actually installing the game on Windows 10, as the DRM the game uses ( both SafeDisc and SecuROM) are blocked. Do not play from disc on Windows 10 unless you already installed from disc on an earlier Windows OS and are just upgrading to Windows 10. If your Sims 2 games and expansions work fine, then you can ignore this section. If you are receiving compatibility errors, changing the compatibility mode may resolve them."

Sims 2 was not designed for modern operating systems, so your results will most likely vary. Some suggest that using integrated motherboard graphics instead of a dedicated graphics card can cause it to fail. Having a 64-bit version of Windows may cause issues, but it has been proven to work on some 64-bit systems . Many people report better results with Windows 8.1 as opposed to Windows 8.
