      "content": "“LF” means “looking for.” On Discord and other multiplayer gaming servers, “LF” is a shorthand for “looking for.” When someone says “LF” in a general chat or text conversation, they’re telling you that they’re trying to find someone or something, like a game ( “LFG” ), one more extra player (“LF1M”), or a party/group of players (“LFP”).

      "content": "Message “LFG” if you’re looking for a group to game with. If you’ve just logged onto Discord and are itching to find a good multiplayer game, text “LFG” to help you find a group or gaming party. Discord even has a server dedicated to “LFG!” “LFG fighting, no items, quick match” “LFG other novice players, medium difficulty” “LFG general mod. I have 150 loot to share!”"

      "content": "Send “LF1M” if you need just one extra person. Unlike “LFP” which means you’re searching for multiple players to join, use “LF1M” if you have just one extra slot open for a party or level. Some people may also message “LF1P” (looking for 1 player) which means the same thing. [3] X Research source"

If you’re in a Discord server for a game like Pokémon or Animal Crossing, where you trade items regularly , use “LF” before saying what specific items you’re looking for. This will help let others know how they can help you and prevent wasted time. “LF all shiny Pokémon. Willing to trade master balls!” “LF any water-types, ideally level 45 or higher” “LF apples for my island. I’ll pay twice Tom Nook’s going rate!”"

      "title": "Invite someone to join your game if you see “LFG.”",
      "content": "Invite someone to join your game if you see “LFG.” When a friend or worthy gamer messages your chat an “LFG,” message their profile and invite them into whatever multiplayer game you’re about to play. Make sure to include your Gamertag or any other necessary information, depending on the specific game, console, and skills required. Stay safe when messaging people you don’t know. Don’t give out any personal information and, if their texts seem cryptic, block them. Someone may also comment “LFG” as an abbreviation for “let’s freaking go!” If their tone feels more supportive than inquisitive, you can share their enthusiasm by typing “LFG” yourself. “We’re wrapping up a team battle right now. Message me!” “Perfect. LFP for a raid. Do you have the expansion pack?” “If you’re level 9+, join our group!”"
