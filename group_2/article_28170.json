Just make sure to use the same word in the script and the element id."

[2] X Research source Change this to a lower number to speed up the blinking, or a higher number to slow it down. The actual delay probably won't match this value perfectly. It tends to be slightly shorter, but can take longer if your browser is busy with other requests."

Back in the .css file, define your “announcement” class with .announcement{ animation-name: blinkingText; animation-duration: 1.2s; animation-iteration-count: infinite; } animation-name can be anything you choose, and its actions will be defined separately within the CSS file. animation-duration defines how long the animation takes to complete – if it is not specified, no animation will occur. In the above example, the sequence will take 1.2 seconds, but you can test different times for faster or slower blinking. animation-iteration-count can either be set to a number – entering 4 means the text would only flash four times on page load and then stop - or “infinite” meaning it will blink forever. if you choose to use id instead of class you will replace .announcement with #announcement"

To create a working blinking text animation, you need to define blinkingText in your CSS document. Enter @keyframes blinkingText{ from {color: black;} to {color: transparent;} } By going from black to translucent, the code appears to blink at the animation-interval you set. You can add different stages using percentages. Instead of from {color: black;} to {color: transparent;} you could enter 0% {color: black;} 50% {color: red;} 100% {color: translucent;} to make the text flash from black to red to translucent. Instead of using color names, you can match the background of your website using the hex code for the color, preceded by a #."
