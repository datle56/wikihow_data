      "title": "Plant your zucchini after the last frost of the year.",
      "content": "Plant your zucchini after the last frost of the year. Depending on where you live, you may plant your zucchini between late April and mid-June. Make sure that you plant your zucchini when there is no chance of the temperature going below freezing, since these cold temperatures will likely kill your zucchini. [1] X Research source If you have a greenhouse, you can plant your zucchini at any time. 60 °F (16 °C) to 70 °F (21 °C) is the optimal temperature range to plant zucchini."

      "title": "Buy a pot with drainage holes that holds 5 gallons (19 L).",
      "content": "Buy a pot with drainage holes that holds 5 gallons (19 L). Zucchini have large tap roots that will reach far down into the soil. Purchase a pot that can hold at least 5 gallons (19 L) of soil in it that has holes in the bottom area for water to drain out. These pots will be large, so make sure you have a space to keep your 5 gallons (19 L) pot, like a porch or backyard area."

      "title": "Fill the pot with soil up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top.",
      "content": "Fill the pot with soil up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top. Use soil that has ingredients like peat moss, perlite, and compost. Pour enough soil into your pot so that only 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the top is left free. Lightly pack down your soil so that it is not loose, but not so tight that the zucchini roots won’t be able to move through it. [2] X Research source You can purchase soil at your local garden or hardware store. Wear gardening gloves when touching your soil."

      "title": "Make a hole 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep in the soil with your finger.",
      "content": "Make a hole 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) deep in the soil with your finger. Use your pointer finger to dig out a hole in the soil in the very center of the pot. Make the hole at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide so that your seeds will fit in it. Use gardening gloves when digging in your soil. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Plant 2 seeds in the hole and cover with 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of soil.",
      "content": "Plant 2 seeds in the hole and cover with 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of soil. 1 seed that you plant might not make it to fruition. Plant 2 seeds to ensure that you get at least 1 zucchini plant to grow. Place the seeds about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) down inside of the soil and cover them up. Do not press down on the soil on top of them or around them. [4] X Research source You can use zucchini starts instead of seeds if you think your seeds might die off before they sprout. Buy some from your local garden store."

      "title": "Add a stake or tomato cage if your zucchini type needs it.",
      "content": "Add a stake or tomato cage if your zucchini type needs it. Some zucchini varieties, like Black Forest, are climbing zucchini, meaning that their vines will reach upward as they grow. Check on your seed packet or your starts label to determine if your zucchini are a climbing type. If they are, put a 4 feet (1.2 m) wooden stake or tomato cage next to the seeds or starts you just planted. If your zucchini are already growing when you realize they are climbing, you can put a stake next to them to encourage the vines to climb upward."

      "title": "Put your pot in an area with at least 8 hours of sun a day.",
      "content": "Put your pot in an area with at least 8 hours of sun a day. Zucchini thrives on heat and getting sunlight. Make sure your pot is in an area that gets at least 8 hours of sunlight per day. South-facing windows or balconies get the most sun daily. Make sure your pot won’t get knocked over by curious pets or critters by putting it on the ground instead of on a window sill or shelf."

    {
      "title": "Water your zucchini plant daily.",
      "content": "Water your zucchini plant daily. The soil your zucchini is in should be moist at all times. Water your zucchini pot at least once per day. Point your water source at the base of the plant and try to avoid getting water on the leaves. If the leaves get wet, they could get diseased or moldy. If the summer is particularly dry and hot, you may need to water twice a day. Feel the soil to make sure it hasn’t dried out. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Fertilize your zucchini every month.",
      "content": "Fertilize your zucchini every month. Add a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer to your zucchini pot once a month to keep nutrients flowing into the soil. Apply a thin layer of fertilizer to the top of your soil and spread it around evenly. Do not cover up any starts or shoots that may be growing. [6] X Research source You can buy fertilizer at your local garden or hardware store. 10-10-10 fertilizer has equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Adding broken down compost to your zucchini soil instead of fertilizer can also help feed it."

      "title": "Spray peppermint spray on your zucchini leaves to deter pests.",
      "content": "Spray peppermint spray on your zucchini leaves to deter pests. Aphids, vine boring beetles, and spider mites are common pests that love to eat zucchini. To avoid these pests damaging your plant, mix together 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of peppermint oil, and a drop of dish soap. Spray the peppermint mixture on your zucchini leaves when they are damp once a day. [7] X Research source The best time to spray your peppermint spray is in the evening when it is cool. That way, it won’t evaporate as quickly. The smell of peppermint deters pests and can even kill some soft-bodied insects."

      "title": "Cut back the smaller seedling when your seeds reach 8 inches (20 cm) tall.",
      "content": "Cut back the smaller seedling when your seeds reach 8 inches (20 cm) tall. Your pot will only be able to support 1 zucchini. When 1 of your seedlings reaches about 8 inches (20 cm) tall, snip the smaller one back with scissors to stop it from growing. This lets the nutrients of the soil be diverted to only 1 zucchini plant. [8] X Research source Always use scissors to cut your seedling. Never rip or tear them, or you could damage your plant."

      "title": "Pick your zucchini when it is 6 inches (15 cm) long.",
      "content": "Pick your zucchini when it is 6 inches (15 cm) long. This usually takes 45 to 60 days of growth. Your plant will continue to sprout zucchini until the cold season hits again and the plant dies off. If you leave your zucchini for too long on the vine, they could start to rot.

      "title": "Cut your zucchini at the base of the plant with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut your zucchini at the base of the plant with scissors. Make sure your scissors are sharp. Do not bend or twist the zucchini to get it off of the vine, or you could damage the plant. Grab the fruit gently and hold it as you cut so that it doesn’t fall. Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands, since zucchini vines are prickly. [10] X Research source You can also carefully use a sharp knife instead of scissors. Make sure your scissors are clean by running them under water and scrubbing them with soap before you cut your zucchini."

      "content": "Store your unwrapped zucchini in the fridge for 1 to 2 weeks. Your zucchini will stay fresh for a few weeks after you pick it. Put it in the crisper of your fridge and leave it uncovered. If you are worried about getting food or grime on your zucchini, put it in a paper bag and leave the top open. This encourages airflow while protecting your zucchini. [11] X Research source Use your zucchini to make zucchini bread, make zucchini noodles, or even freeze it to save it for later."
