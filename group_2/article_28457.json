      "content": "Gather pure salt and consecrate it with the “Exorcism and Blessing of Salt.” Before making holy water, you must create holy salt. Consecrate the salt (or make it sacred) first. Add pure salt, like Kosher or natural rock salt with no added ingredients, to a small bowl or jar. Say the following words from The Roman Ritual , one of the official liturgical books of the Catholic Church: [1] X Research source “Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. O salt, creature of God, I exorcise you by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, by the God who ordered you to be poured into the water by Eliseo the Prophet so that its life-giving powers might be restored. I exorcise you so that you may become a means of salvation for believers, that you may bring health of soul and body to all who make use of you, arid that you may put to flight and drive away from the places where you are sprinkled every apparition, villainy, and turn of devilish deceit, and every unclean spirit, adjured by Him Who will come to judge the living and the dead and the world by fire. Amen.” [2] X Research source If you are consecrating the salt in front of witnesses, invite them to join you in prayer: “ Almighty and everlasting God, we humbly implore Thee, in Thy immeasurable kindness and love, to bless and sanctify this salt which Thou did create and give over to the use of mankind, so that it may become a source of health for the minds and bodies of all who make use of it, and may rid whatever it touches or sprinkles of all uncleanness and protect it from every assault of evil spirits. Through our Lord, Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.” The Roman Ritual contains the services a priest or deacon performs that are not included in other liturgical books. There are no special requirements for the container you use for the salt. If you keep any holy salt that you do not mix with the water, make sure you mark the container so you don’t confuse it with regular table salt."

      "content": "Collect water from a natural source if possible. If you can, get your water from a nearby lake, stream, or river. Filter your water before using it—you don't want dirty holy water! Place the purified water in an open container, such as a large bowl. Try to avoid using tap water. It may have additives such as chlorine and fluoride in it. However, you may use tap water or bottled water if a natural source isn’t available. Store-bought distilled water or spring water are also good choices. If you use tap water, filter and dechlorinate it before you use it to make holy water."

      "content": "Exorcise the water using the “Exorcism and Blessing of Water.” Before combining the salt and water, perform an exorcism over the water to bless it and prepare it for use in making holy water. [4] X Research source Recite the “Exorcism and Blessing of Water” from The Roman Ritual: “O water, creature of God, I exorcise you in the name of God the Father almighty, and in the name of Jesus Christ His Son, our Lord, and in the power of the Holy Spirit. I exorcise you so that you may put to flight all the power of the Enemy, and be able to root out and supplant that Enemy with his apostate angels: through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will come to judge the living and the dead and the world by fire. Amen.” [5] X Research source If you’re doing the exorcism in front of witnesses, have them join you in the following prayer: “ O God, Who for the salvation of mankind has built Thy greatest mysteries on this substance, water, in Thy kindness hear our prayers and pour down the power of Thy blessing into this element, made ready for many kinds of purifications. May this, Thy creature, become an agent of divine grace in the service of Thy mysteries, to drive away evil spirits and dispel sickness, so that everything in the homes and other buildings of the faithful that is sprinkled with this water may be rid of all uncleanness and freed from every harm. Let no breath of infection, no disease-bearing air, remain in these places. May the wiles of the lurking Enemy prove of no avail. Let whatever might menace the safety and peace of those who live here be put to flight by the sprinkling of this water, so that the healthfulness, obtained by calling upon Thy holy name, may be made secure against all attack. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.”"

      "content": "Pour the salt into the water in the shape of a cross. Once you’ve exorcised both the salt and the water, the final step is to combine them. Add the salt to the water, making the form of a cross as you pour it in. As you pour in the salt, recite the following from the “Exorcism and Blessing of Water”: [6] X Research source “May this salt and water be mixed together; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.” If you are performing the ritual in front of witnesses, say, “The Lord be with you.” They will respond, “May He also be with you.” Invite anyone present to join you in this prayer: “God, source of irresistible might and king of an invincible realm, the ever-glorious conqueror; who restrain the force of the adversary, silencing the uproar of his rage, and valiantly subduing his wickedness; in awe and humility we beg you, Lord, to regard with favor this creature thing of salt and water, to let the light of your kindness shine upon it, and to hallow it with the dew of your mercy; so that wherever it is sprinkled and your holy name is invoked, every assault of the unclean spirit may be baffled, and all dread of the serpent's venom be cast out. To us who entreat your mercy grant that the Holy Spirit may be with us wherever we may be; through Christ our Lord. Amen.”"

[7] X Research source If you’re not comfortable using holy water that you blessed yourself, go to a priest in your parish and ask for some. Some churches also have a holy water font where you can fill up a container to take home with you. Keep a holy water font at home to use for blessings throughout your day."

      "content": "Add pure salt to the water to use in banishing spells. Practitioners in many religious traditions believe salt is the preserver of life that helps ward off unfriendly spirits and entities. To make holy water for this purpose, place the water in a chalice. Say prayers over the salt and water that are appropriate for your particular Pagan tradition, then combine the 2 ingredients together and say a final prayer to bless the water and make it holy. [10] X Research source For example, you might first dip your fingers or a magic wand into the water and say the following prayer: “Behold this water that is the giver of life. I ask that this water be blessed and purified and made holy. In the name of Goddess and of God, in love, light, peace, and trust.” [11] X Research source Next, dip your fingers or wand into the salt and recite: “Behold the salt that is the preserver of life. I ask that this salt be blessed and consecrated and purified. In the name of Goddess and of God, in love, light, peace, and trust.” [12] X Research source Add a pinch of the salt to the water and mix them together, stirring in a clockwise direction. After you’re done mixing, say the final prayer while still touching the mixture of water and salt: “For, as the water is holy and as the salt is holy, may the union of these two be blessed and purified and consecrated. In the name of Goddess and of God, by the almighty power of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, may this now be holy water to be used in goodness, love, light, peace, and trust. So mote it be.” [13] X Research source Any kind of water or salt will work for this purpose, including tap water and table salt. In addition to dispelling negative energy , many Pagan magic practitioners believe you can use this type of holy water to bless and purify your body by gently dabbing it on your skin."

      "content": "Leave water outside in the moonlight for another way to make it holy. Many Pagans believe that simply exposing water to moonlight can make it holy. Put any type of water in the container of your choice and set it in a place where it will receive plenty of moonlight. You can “charge” this water with any intention you like and use it for a variety of purposes, like relaxation, clarity, enhanced psychic awareness, and cleansing. [14] X Research source Preferably, you should use a silver or glass container for this purpose since these materials are believed to be good at holding spiritual energy. As you set out the container of water, say a prayer or chant expressing your intention for the water. For example, you might ask for a blessing of love, purity, or protection. One blessing is: “As the full moon rises, so I rise. I am awestruck by my divinity, my potential, my power illuminated fully in Luna’s light. Her great cycle is the death and rebirth that empowers my ascension. I am her and she is me. Across the lands where night has fallen, I am the light. I have released the darkness — the fear, the grief, the worry — and opened my heart to let beauty and bright fruition flow in and to cast it back out, like a beacon from the heavens. Luna, I am thankful. Amen, A’ho, So it is.”"

In addition to consecrating your water by moonlight, many Pagans believe you can bring extra lunar blessings by putting a piece of silver metal into the water. Choose any silver object, such as a ring or a coin, and drop it into the water before leaving it out in the moonlight. [15] X Research source For a sunlight blessing, which is associated with healing and positive energy, you can add a piece of gold to the water and leave it out in the sun. Add silver to a bowl with snow and ice and charge it with an intention such as “freezing” your enemies or getting stuck energies to flow. You can then put this “Winter Blessing Water” out in the light of the full moon to make it holy. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Holy water is water blessed for religious purposes. Most holy water starts as regular water until a priest or other person blesses it, which transforms it. It becomes sacramental, meaning it’s a tool that believers use to practice their religion or faith. [17] X Research source While there’s nothing physically different between regular water and holy water, believers feel there is a spiritual difference. In Christianity, holy water is blessed by the clergy and used in baptisms and blessings for people, homes, churches, and items used in devotion. [18] X Research source In Pagan religions, consecrated water is often used as part of blessings, banishing rituals, or cleansings of a sacred space. [19] X Research source"
