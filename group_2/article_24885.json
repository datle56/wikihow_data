      "content": "Buy fashion glue. Fashion glue is used at fashion shows and beauty pageants to prevent clothing from riding up or coming off during showtime. You can find fashion glue at your local beauty supply store or online. Fashion glue is relatively inexpensive and designed to be applied to skin. Do not use regular glue or other types of glue for this method, as they can injure your skin."

      "content": "Apply the fashion glue to your thighs. Roll on the fashion glue in a thick line around your thighs, at the location where the boots will hit your thighs. Put a generous layer on your skin so your boots have something to stick to. Wait 10 seconds for it to set. If you'd like to get a tighter fit before using the glue, put on thigh high socks. The socks will help to keep the boots in place."
