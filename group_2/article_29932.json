      "content": "Pick up a 24 by 36 in (61 by 91 cm) metal sheet that’s 0.5 mm thick. You can use steel to make your rose, but you can also use copper, aluminum, or general-purpose sheet metal. The overall process is the same regardless of the metal you use. You will need roughly 1 sheet of 24 by 36 in (61 by 91 cm) metal to make your rose. Pick up your metal sheet at your local construction supply store. [1] X Research source The millimeter listed on sheet metal always refers to the thickness. The thicker the sheet metal is, the stronger it is but the harder it is to shape. You can use something a little thinner than 0.5 mm, but it may leave your petals looking kind of flimsy and thin. If you use anything thicker, it will take much longer to shape the metal. With a sheet this size, you can make a rose head that’s roughly 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) tall and 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) wide."

      "content": "Score 4-5 circles into the metal in slightly different sizes with a spring divider. Grab a metal spring divider and press one of the pins into any point on your sheet metal. Drag the second pin around the point in a circle. Make the first circle roughly 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter. Then, make a second circle 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) in diameter. Score 2-3 additional circles on different portions of the metal. Make each circle 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) smaller than the last circle you made. [2] X Research source You can measure the circles out, or just do this by eye. So long as each circle is slightly smaller than the last, you’ll be fine. The bigger your circles are, the larger the rose will be. You can deviate from these measurements if you want to make a bigger or smaller rose."

      "content": "Put on cut-resistant gloves and protective eyewear to protect yourself. You’re going to do a lot of heating, cutting, and sanding from this point going forward. Grab some cut-resistant metalworking gloves and put them on to protect your hands the sharp metal. Put on some protective goggles to keep pieces of metal from flying into your eyes as you cut it. [3] X Research source You absolutely cannot complete this process without gloves or protective eyewear."

      "title": "Cut the circles out using tin snips and trim them to size.",
      "content": "Cut the circles out using tin snips and trim them to size. Grab some straight tin snips and cut your circles out of the sheet in square-like shapes to make them easier to work with. Then, grab some curved tin snips and trim around the circles to cleanly remove the smaller chunks of metal that are sticking out around your scored lines. [4] X Research source The circles don’t need to be perfect. It’s okay if there is a little variation around the edges. You’ll eventually bend the edges downwards to give your petals shape, so people won’t really notice any minor mistakes here."

Place a center punch in the middle of the circle and strike the back of the punch with a ball-peen hammer. This will drive a tiny divot into the middle of the circle and make it easier to cut through the center. Repeat this process with the rest of your circles. [5] X Research source"

Set a large chunk of wood down and hold the edge of your first circle with a set of slip-joint pliers. Hold the disc on top of the wood and use your drill to drive a hole through the circle where you made the divot. Repeat this process with the rest of your circles. [6] X Research source Don’t hold the circles with your hand. Use pliers to keep your fingers away from the drill bit. If the drill bit slips, you want to ensure your fingers aren’t anywhere near the center. You can use an auger to do this if you prefer."

      "title": "Cut 4-5 lines into each circle to make your petals.",
      "content": "Cut 4-5 lines into each circle to make your petals. Grab your straight tin snips and pick up your first circle with the pliers. Wrap the jaws around the edge of the circle so the tip of your blades rest 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) away from the hole you drilled. Cut a straight line leading from the edge of the circle to just outside of the hole you punched. Rotate the circle 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) and cut it again. Do this 4-5 times on each circle to separate your petals. [7] X Research source These cuts do not need to be symmetrical. Just place them kind of randomly around each circle so that there’s some variation in the petals. Each cut you make will separate another petal. The more cuts you add, the more individual petals you’ll have."

Grip any petal with the jaws of your slip joint pliers and lift it up at a 5- to 10-degree angle bend it a little bit. Repeat this process with every other petal you’ve cut out to separate your petals and soften the metal a little bit. [8] X Research source The goal here is not to shape the petals, but to soften the joint where the petal connects to the middle of the circle. This will make the petals much easier to trim, cut, and work with. You’re going to hammer the petals down in a minute, so don’t worry about the shape you bend the petals into. You’re only doing this to separate the petals and soften the metal."

      "title": "Trim the edges of each petal down a little to give them some shape.",
      "content": "Trim the edges of each petal down a little to give them some shape. Grab your curved tin snips and cut off the 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 16 in (0.32–0.16 cm) sharp corners on each petal. This will remove the sharp edges and give your petals a cleaner shape. Clean up all of the corners on all of the circles you’ve cut. On every single petal you’ve separated, trim the edge where it meets the petal next to it. [9] X Research source You’re doing this for safety and aesthetic reasons. It’s not only safer to work with the metal if you trim the corners off, but it will also give your petals softer edges and make them look more realistic."

      "content": "Hammer each petal’s edges down against an anvil to soften the sides. Set a circle down on top of an anvil. Hold it in place against the anvil with your pliers. Then, grab a ball-peen hammer and strike the petals repeatedly. Keep striking every portion of the circle until it flattens out. Strike the edges where they meet the anvil to soften them up a little and rotate the disc with your pliers to hit each side. Repeat this process with the remainder of your circles. [10] X Research source This makes the metal more pliable and blunts the sharp edges of the petals."

Set your first petal on the anvil and strike the exterior edge of the petal with your hammer. You should leave a small line on the edge of the petal with your strike. Repeat this process by striking each petal 5-10 times to leave a series of parallel marks in the edge of each petal. [11] X Research source If you look at a real rose, the lips of the petals are kind of wavy and uneven. Striking the metal petals with this sharp edge will help replicate this look."

Grab an erasable marker or a scriber and draw a 5-point star that’s roughly the same height and width as your largest circle. Use your straight tin snips to cut the 5-point star out of your metal sheet. [12] X Research source Roses have really distinct, pointy sepals. You can skip this portion of the process if you want, but the final product will look more like a tulip than a rose."

Then, set each point of the star on the table where it meets the face of your anvil. Hit the point 4-5 times to bend it inwards with your hammer. Do this for each point. Finish by striking the edges with your drywall or cross pin hammer. [14] X Research source The table is the smaller platform that sticks out from the face of the anvil. Hitting each length of the star against this curved portion will bend the edges in."

Turn on a metalworking disc sander and hold the top 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of the rod against the sander. Rotate the rod as it grinds against the sander to remove layers of metal. Continue sanding the rod until the thickness of the rod’s tip is slightly smaller than the holes in sepal and petals. [16] X Research source The petals and sepal will slide over the top that you sanded down but they’ll get caught on the portion of the rod where it gets thicker. The length of the rod determines the length of the stem. You can use any size you’d like, but something roughly 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) will work well if you don’t have a strong preference."

Make sure that the bent points are facing up. Then, slide your biggest circle on to the rod. Put the remaining petals on top of the first circle so that the smallest petal is on top and each subsequent circle is smaller than the one beneath it. [17] X Research source A 1 ⁄ 2 –3 in (1.3–7.6 cm) portion of the rod should be sticking up past the top set of petals. If it isn’t, take everything off and remove another 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the metal rod to continue sanding and extend the portion that holds the petals and sepal."

Then, turn on your torch and hold the flame against the portion of the rod that’s sticking out at the top. As it heats up, use a pair of slip-joint pliers to bend the tip of the metal rod in any direction so that the petals can’t slide off of the top. Continue heating the tip of the rod down until it melts a little so your petals don’t slide around. [18] X Research source You can typically bend the metal once it gets to the point where it starts glowing slightly orange."

Hold the torch 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) away from the top of the rose and move it slowly in a circle around the petals to heat them up. Then, use your slip-joint pliers to pull your top layer of petals up at an 80-degree angle. Lift the next layer up at a 75-degree angle so the petals rest just outside of the first layer. Continue working the lower layers up to raise them around the rose. [19] X Research source Be careful while you’re doing this. You have to keep heating the petals while you work so just go slowly and keep your working hand away from the flame."

Continue heating the tips of the petals and use your needle nose pliers to shape the edges of the petals in a circle around the center. Bend each vertical petal into a circular shape so that the petals on each disc form a small circle around the center. Pull the innermost petals close to one another to cover up the tip of the rod you bent in the middle of the rose. [20] X Research source This requires a bit of hand-eye coordination. Just be patient and take your time to craft the petals into a shape that looks good to you. You may find it helpful to look at a picture of a rose on your phone while doing this."

[21] X Research source You are done once you’ve shaped all of the petals. If you want, you can bend the points on the sepal down or up. You can also leave them where they are. It’s entirely up to you."
