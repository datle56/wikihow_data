If you're a Linux user , you can block ads on your entire Wi-Fi network (including on your Roku TV), by installing Pi-Hole and using the Linux machine as your router's DNS server. This makes it so Roku ads cannot be shown on your Roku TV as long as the Linux machine is up and running. [3] X Research source To install Pi-Hole, run the command curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net in your Linux Terminal. [4] X Research source This method works best if you're already well-versed in Linux and have the ability leave your Linux system online at all times. If you're not already running Linux or have a Raspberry Pi machine, this method won't be ideal. You will need admin access access to your router to change its DNS server and assign your Pi-Hole system a static IP address."

By default, OpenDNS will be set as your upstream DNS servers, but you can opt for Google, Norton, or other providers instead.

Once the IP address is assigned, edit the router's DNS server configuration to use that static IP address as its only DNS server. You'll usually find this in the \"DHCP Settings\" or \"Network Address Server Settings\" area of your router's admin panel.
