      "title": "Stand up straight with your shoulders back.",
      "content": "Stand up straight with your shoulders back. Your shoulders should be back, but not raised, and your chin should be parallel with the floor. Keep your feet shoulder width apart and your knees loose instead of locked. Your chest shouldn’t be puffed out, but it should be naturally lifted so your belly can expand. [1] X Research source Proper posture will allow you to fill your lower lungs with air. When most people breathe, they just fill up their upper lungs."

      "title": "Inhale through your nose and fill your belly with air.",
      "content": "Inhale through your nose and fill your belly with air. Breathe in slowly through your nose as you count to 4. Hold your hand on your belly to make sure it expands and fills with air. You should also feel your breath in your lower back and the muscles between your ribs.

      "content": "Keep your upper chest and shoulders still as you inhale. Your chest shouldn’t puff out and your shoulders shouldn’t rise as you inhale. As your belly gets round and your lungs fill with air, your lower ribs should expand outward, but don’t let your chest and shoulders rise into a shrug. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Count to 4 as you exhale through your mouth. After counting to 4 as you hold your breath, breathe out by flexing your abdominal muscles. Try to exhale evenly for a 4 count. Instead of blowing out lots of air at first, try to exhale in a steady stream. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Increase each of your counts as you practice proper breathing.",
      "content": "Increase each of your counts as you practice proper breathing. The easiest breathing exercise is to simply inhale, hold your breath, and exhale for longer counts. First, increase your count to 5, then 6, and eventually work your way up to 10. Do 3 or 4 sets of inhales, holds, and exhales for each count. [6] X Research source Make sure to maintain the proper breathing techniques by filling your belly and keeping your shoulders down for this and any other exercise."

      "title": "Decrease your inhale counts and increase your exhale counts.",
      "content": "Decrease your inhale counts and increase your exhale counts. Inhaling for a shorter count and exhaling for longer is great exercise for your diaphragm. Start by doing a few sets of 6 count inhales and 8 count exhales. Proceed to counting to 5 as you inhale and to 10 as you exhale, then gradually work your way up to inhaling for a 2 count and exhaling for a 20 count. [7] X Research source Work on filling your lungs with air in a shorter amount of time and controlling your exhale to blow out in a steady stream for a longer amount of time."

For this exercise, imagine there’s a candle in front of your face. Your goal is to blow out so slowly and gently that your breath doesn’t make the candle flicker.

Start adding vocalizations to your breathing exercises. Say “B,” “F,” “S,” and “Sh,“ as you exhale. Extend the sound throughout your entire exhale by saying, “Beee-,” or “Esss-.” [11] X Research source Try mixing up your counts for this exercise. Inhale for a 4 count, exhale for 8, then inhale for 2 and exhale for 6. Randomize your counts to mimic how you’d have to switch up your breathing during a song."

You can also try pronouncing syllables, like “Ba,” or “La.” Extend the sound evenly as you exhale: use your breath to keep the tone and volume steady throughout your exhale.

While it might take more effort and money to get to a pool or lake, swimming is the ideal form of exercise for singers. Water’s density makes your muscles do extra work, and holding your breath between strokes improves your breath control."
