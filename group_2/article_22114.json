      "title": "Work through disagreements.",
      "content": "Work through disagreements. Even if you and your sister have arguments, she’s still going to be your sister. Figure out the best way to cool off and then come back to her. Apologize and ask her if you can move forward. “I’m sorry I got so upset about you being late. There was no reason for me to yell. Can you forgive me?” “I really thought it was a bad idea for you to date that guy. Sorry. I was wrong -- he is a pretty cool guy, and it’s certainly not my place to judge and then tell you what I think you should do.” “You were right. I was dressed completely wrong for that party and I had a terrible time. And since we had argued, I felt even worse. I should have come with you and your friends.”"

    {
      "title": "Be honest with her.",
      "content": "Be honest with her. You and your sister are together for life, and if your sister asks your advice, be honest while also being diplomatic and sympathetic. Even if it’s not what she wants to hear, you are in a better position than almost anyone to tell her what you actually think and make her listen. She is also in that same position for you. Parental advice can sometimes feel meddling, but a sibling’s advice is often just what you need."

      "title": "Keep her informed about your life.",
      "content": "Keep her informed about your life. Your family is often your best support throughout your life, and your sister could be the most important part of that. She will be with you through the big events in your life, and having someone to turn to in difficult times that really knows you can be incredibly helpful. She probably knows you better than anyone else, and it’s to your advantage to keep your relationship strong and close."

      "title": "Be an emotional support.",
      "content": "Be an emotional support. Everyone has difficult moments, and sometimes a sibling can help comfort you better than anyone, and vice versa. It’s usually not about giving advice -- if she wants it, she will ask -- but just about being there when things don’t go well. Be a good listener. Really paying attention to her problems can be helpful to her and deepen the relationship the two of you have. Being a good, active listener may involve avoiding interruptions, nodding your head, making eye contact, and asking follow-up questions. However, prioritize listening to what your sister is saying (rather than thinking about what you’ll say next).

      "content": "Think about how you see your sister. Are you still thinking of her as she was five years ago? Do you really know her as she is now? It’s easy to not pay attention to how your sister is growing and changing -- she’s always around and you have a lot going on in your own life. If you don’t really know what your sister is like now, or her interests or friends, it’s time to get to know her. She might feel the same about you. Come up with some fun questions you two could ask each other, from wacky to ordinary: favorite movie of the last few years, favorite weird-sounding ice cream flavor, place she’d most or least like to visit. [3] X Expert Source Seth Hall Life Coach Expert Interview. 16 November 2021. Follow her on social media -- you will be able to see how she presents herself and her interests, who her friends are, and how she sees her place in the world. Take a trip together. It could be a simple as an overnight camping trip to the beach or getting a motel room at the mountain. There’s just something about a trip with someone that can really help you get to know them more and open up. Do an activity together. It could be anything -- rollerskating, volunteering at a soup kitchen, learning yoga together, whatever you and your sister think sounds fun. Look through old pictures of yourself together. Remember some of the fun (and not-so-fun) times from childhood."
