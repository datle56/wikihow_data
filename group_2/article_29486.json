    {
      "title": "Pick a dark T-shirt to go with your ninja outfit.",
      "content": "Pick a dark T-shirt to go with your ninja outfit. You can use any T-shirt that you’d like, as long as it’s soft and comfortable against your face. Try to go for a black or navy blue T-shirt to stick with a stealthy ninja theme. [1] X Research source Cotton and cotton blend T-shirts will probably be the most comfortable, and they’ll be easy to breathe through. Stay away from Spandex shirts, as they can be tough to breathe through."

    {
      "title": "Turn the T-shirt inside out.",
      "content": "Turn the T-shirt inside out. Grab the collar of your T-shirt and pull it through the neck, making sure that the sleeves are flipped inside out as well. Smooth the shirt out so there aren’t many wrinkles so it will be easier to work with. [2] X Research source If your T-shirt has a long tag sticking out, cut it off with scissors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the T-shirt on over your head, leaving your face exposed.",
      "content": "Pull the T-shirt on over your head, leaving your face exposed. Hold the shirt backwards so that the tag faces away from you, then pull the shirt on over your head. Don’t pull your head through all the way, and instead pull the opening of the shirt over your face so your mouth, nose, and eyes stick out. [3] X Research source You may look like a nun at this point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Raise the collar to cover your mouth and nose.",
      "content": "Raise the collar to cover your mouth and nose. Grab the bottom part of the collar on your chin and pull it up until it covers your mouth and all of your nose. Make sure you leave your eyes free so you can see! The shirt might not stay in place right away, but that’s okay, since you’ll be fixing it in just a second. [4] X Research source Classic ninja masks only leave the eyes uncovered, which is why you need to pull your shirt up to hide your face."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the sleeves of the shirt behind your head.",
      "content": "Tie the sleeves of the shirt behind your head. Reach around your head and grab the sleeves of your shirt, then pull them back behind your head. Tie them together twice so that the mask is tight against your nose and mouth and the mask stays in place. [5] X Research source You can adjust the mask still if you need to by loosening the knot you tied."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the collar in for a more streamlined look.",
      "content": "Tuck the collar in for a more streamlined look. To make your mask look even more realistic, tuck the collar portion of the shirt in underneath itself, or about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) under. This will make the eye opening of your mask look more sleek and professional. [6] X Research source You don’t have to do this part, but it makes the mask look less like a T-shirt. This is also helpful if you need to hide the tag in your T-shirt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress in all black.",
      "content": "Dress in all black. Ninjas are known for sneaking around in the dark to attack people stealthily. To mimic that, put on some black pants, a black long sleeve shirt , and some black shoes. This will match perfectly with your dark ninja mask you’re already wearing. [7] X Research source You can even put on some black gloves if you have them. You can choose to be any ninja you want—just make sure you’re dressed head to toe in all one color."

    {
      "title": "Tie a bright ribbon or scarf around your waist.",
      "content": "Tie a bright ribbon or scarf around your waist. Some ninjas have a pop of color around their waist to identify who they are. If you’d like to, choose a red, blue, or green scarf or ribbon, then knot it around your waist. Leave the ends hanging on one side of your waist so they don’t get in the way of your ninja moves. [8] X Research source If you want to be a super sneaky ninja, you don’t have to add a pop of color around your waist."

      "title": "Cut some throwing stars out of cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut some throwing stars out of cardboard. Sketch out some 4-point stars onto a piece of cardboard with a permanent marker. Using scissors, carefully cut the throwing stars out, making sure the ends look super pointy. Spray paint them silver to look like real metal throwing stars to give your ninja a weapon. [9] X Research source Normally, ninjas have at least 2 throwing stars so they can attack multiple people at once. Even though these throwing stars are made of cardboard, they can still be a little sharp! Use them with caution, and don’t throw them directly at people."

      "title": "Use a jump rope as fake nunchucks.",
      "content": "Use a jump rope as fake nunchucks. Real nunchucks can be hard to find, and they can be dangerous. Instead, grab a black jump rope and hold it tightly in your hands with the rope wound up. From far away, it will look like you’re carrying a deadly ninja weapon. [10] X Research source Nunchucks are totally optional, but they can help complete the ninja look that you’re going for! You can find jump ropes for under $10 at most home goods stores."
