      "content": "Hinge denies the existence of any shadow bans. Hinge, like other dating apps, claims that they do not shadow ban users. Of course, shadow bans are not meant to be detected, so it is difficult confirm Hinge's claim. This guide operates under the assumption that shadow bans on Hinge may be real, providing info and tips for avoiding such an obstacle to your online dating experience.

      "content": "Your Hinge Likes and matches drop abruptly. A shadow banned Hinge account is an account that still exists, but is now invisible to other users. If you are used to getting several Likes each week, but now are getting none at all, it may be an indication of a shadow ban."

      "title": "Profiles you did not Like are resurfacing.",
      "content": "Profiles you did not Like are resurfacing. A common complaint from users who believe they have been shadow banned is that Hinge continues to put profiles in their deck for which they have already tapped the X ."

      "content": "You receive few profiles in your deck each day. If you are used to never running out of profiles to comb through on Hinge, but you are suddenly only given a few to look at each day, this could be a sign that you have been shadow banned."

      "title": "Wait a few months.",
      "content": "Wait a few months. If it is indeed true that a shadow ban only lasts three months, it is worth taking a break from online dating (or at least from Hinge) and returning to the app in a few months to see if you receive more interaction on the app again."

      "content": "Improve your profile. The issues you are experiencing on Hinge may not be related to a shadow ban. You may simply need to give your profile a new look. Update your photos and swap out your prompts to see if anything changes."

      "content": "A shadow ban likely lasts a minimum of three months. Hinge keeps your personal data for three months after closing your account. [1] X Research source Because Hinge openly notes that users' personal data is kept for three months after an account closes, some users believe a shadow ban lasts a minimum of three months. If you are experiencing a dip in matches on Hinge, try using your account again after three months to see if anything changes."

      "content": "Refrain from closing and reopening your account. Online dating can be frustrating, so you may be tempted to close your account and reopen it at a later point in time.

    {
      "title": "Run only one account at a time.",
      "content": "Run only one account at a time. Never open more than one Hinge account at a time. It may lead to a shadow ban, and it has a negative impact on the online dating community. Each Hinge account must be tied to a new phone number and email. But even if you abide by these conditions in creating multiple accounts at once, Hinge's algorithm may recognize similarities in your photos or your use of the app in certain locations."

      "title": "Follow Hinge's Terms of Service.",
      "content": "Follow Hinge's Terms of Service. If you have in fact been shadow banned, it is likely because you violated Hinge's Terms of Service in some capacity. Be respectful in your interactions with others, do not solicit money or other items on the app, and do not impersonate anyone else. Be careful sharing links to other websites on Hinge, as the company may interpret this as a solicitation. [2] X Research source"
