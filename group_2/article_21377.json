Your bangs should be long enough to stay in place without too much trouble. [4] X Expert Source Jenny Tran Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 19 May 2020."

When the urge hits, do your best to resist. Cutting your hair will just set you back, and chances are the cut won't look right so you'll have to fix it by going even shorter. [6] X Research source While a home cut is usually not the best idea, it's fine to have a trim now and then while you're growing out your bangs. Just be sure to tell the stylist that you're trying to grow them out, and he or she will be sure to just take off a little bit."

      "content": "Facilitate hair growth with a healthy lifestyle. Healthy hair starts on the inside, so do your best to live a lifestyle that facilitates faster growth. Eating nourishing foods and staying hydrated are two great ways to help your bangs grow out. Focus on the following: Eat plenty of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and b vitamins. These are found in fish, nuts, olive oil, eggs, and leafy greens. Drink plenty of water so your hair doesn't dry out. Dry hair tends to break more easily than hair that is hydrated. Stop smoking, since smoking is tough on hair."
