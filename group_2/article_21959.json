      "title": "Harvest your crops when the bolls open up and expose the fluffy cotton.",
      "content": "Harvest your crops when the bolls open up and expose the fluffy cotton. Before they are ripe, cotton bolls are closed up and resemble large seeds. They are greenish brown in color and often solid. Once the plant goes into bloom, it develops the white, fluffy cotton. [1] X Research source If you are using a cotton picker, wait until the majority of your crops have exposed cotton balls. This way, you can maximize your yield."

      "title": "Start harvesting cotton in July if you live in warm climates.",
      "content": "Start harvesting cotton in July if you live in warm climates. Cotton is typically planted in April. In general, it takes 150-180 days from planting until cotton is ready for harvest. If you live in an area with warm temperatures in the spring and summer, your cotton should be ready for harvest by the end of July. [2] X Research source Do this if you live somewhere with very warm springs and summers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick cotton through November if you live in cold climates.",
      "content": "Pick cotton through November if you live in cold climates. Local weather and growing conditions cause the cotton to develop faster or slower depending on your particular region. If your cotton is not ready for harvest in July, let it grow until the bolls open up. [3] X Research source This on average occurs throughout the fall if you live in an area with more mild spring and summer weather."

      "title": "Wear a thick pair of gloves to protect your hands.",
      "content": "Wear a thick pair of gloves to protect your hands. Cotton bolls are sharp and pointy and can injure your hands. While this is not required, wearing gloves will help preserve your hands as you pick the cotton."

    {
      "title": "Pull the cotton at its base and twist it out of its boll.",
      "content": "Pull the cotton at its base and twist it out of its boll. Cotton is easy to harvest because you can clearly see the fluffy white blossoms on the plant. [4] X Research source You can turn your hand in a clockwise motion, for instance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate the cotton from the boll if any of the plant remains.",
      "content": "Separate the cotton from the boll if any of the plant remains. Ideally, the boll will stay on the plant when you remove the cotton. If the boll comes off with the cotton, simply remove it using your fingers. [5] X Research source This makes it easier to use the cotton after it dries."

    {
      "title": "Place your cotton in a bucket or bag as you harvest it.",
      "content": "Place your cotton in a bucket or bag as you harvest it. To keep your cotton clean and fresh, carry a container with you and fill it up as you go. [6] X Research source This way, you can easily keep track of all of your cotton and protect it against dirt and debris."

    {
      "title": "Lay your cotton on a flat surface and remove any leaves.",
      "content": "Lay your cotton on a flat surface and remove any leaves. After you harvest the cotton, sort through your bucket or bag, and get rid of any leaves, branches, or debris. This ensures your cotton is clean and fresh, so you can then use it for crafts or making fabric [7] X Research source ."

      "title": "Read the user manual thoroughly before you operate the machine.",
      "content": "Read the user manual thoroughly before you operate the machine. Every cotton picker is slightly different in terms of their particular settings and location of the buttons. Reviewing the instructions ensures you start up and operate the machine correctly. This is very important. If you overlook the instructions for your particular cotton picker, you can get injured."

Then, push the lever downwards with moderate force into the middle spot where the track starts to divert. Move your key to the “Start” position, and then allow the key to return to the “Run” position after the engine starts.

      "content": "Adjust the initial settings on the cotton picker to start up the machine. First, select your RPM setting on the armrest control module. Most machines have 3 options, fast, normal, and slow. Choose the slow speed to start, then adjust your speed as desired. Then, press down on the floor switch with your foot for about 5 minutes. [10] X Research source If you need help adjusting the settings, review your user’s manual. Here there will be a diagram explaining exactly what each switch looks like."

      "content": "Select the “Field mode” setting and choose your speed setting. Before you move the machine, make sure you have the “Field mode” button pressed, as opposed to the “Road mode” setting. These buttons are typically 2 different colors. In addition, the “Field mode” setting has a slow and fast harvesting speed setting. [11] X Research source Select “1” for the slower setting if you want to take your time. Press “2” for the faster setting if you want to harvest the cotton as fast as possible."

Then, press down and forward on the right switch to start up the row units. Move your lever about 1/4 of the way forward to warm up the row units, and gradually move the lever forward to speed them up. Let the row units and cotton fan warm up for about 5 minutes before use. [12] X Research source As you move the machine, the row units begin to turn and collect the cotton. Many cotton pickers have specific settings to help you navigate across the rows of cotton. See your user’s manual to initiate these settings."

After you’ve gone around your cotton field and harvested your plants, select the “Eject” setting on the lever to open up the back of the cotton picker and dump out the cotton. Use the lever to raise up your harvest, and stop raising the picker when you reach the height of the boll buggy. Then, use the adjustment lever to release the wall and pour the cotton into the boll buggy. Continue ejecting the cotton until your picker is completely empty. [15] X Research source A boll buggy is a separate storage container used to house harvested cotton. To stop the machine, locate the \"Off\" or \"Stop\" button, usually red and near the main lever.
