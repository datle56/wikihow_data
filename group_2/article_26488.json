      "content": "Hydrate with water and cut back on sugary beverages. To stay hydrated , stick to water since it flushes out harmful toxins, carries nutrients to your cells, and lubricates your bodily tissues so they can function at their best. Aim to drink at least 64 ounces (8 cups) of water per day. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Avoid sodas, energy drinks, and juices, which all tend to have tons of sugar and empty calories. Some can even total 300 calories, which can cancel out the calories you burned from a whole workout. Drink green tea, which is a great source of antioxidants that protect you against heart disease. Green tea also contains polyphenols, which help reduce your risk of getting cancer. Best of all, tea is about 1-2 calories per liter, so a single cup of unsweetened tea is about as guilt-free as it gets! [2] X Research source Drink a cup of tea or a glass of water 30 minutes before you eat a meal. You’ll feel more full, so you’re less likely to overeat."

To balance a meal, make sure that you integrate all of these important food groups: [8] X Research source Carbohydrates : Your body absorbs complex carbs (like oats, whole-wheat products, and brown rice) more slowly, so your system won’t be overloaded with sugar. Protein : Lean meats (like turkey and chicken) and other protein-rich foods (like beans, soy products, and nuts) help to feed your muscles. Fruits and vegetables : “Superfoods” (like kale, blueberries, and swiss chard) take more calories to burn off than the foods themselves contain, so they promote weight loss. Good fats : Sources of omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fats (like nuts, olive oil, seed oil, and fish) are “good fats” that help you lower your cholesterol. Dairy : Low-fat dairy products (like yogurt and cottage cheese) are excellent sources of protein and calcium. Yogurt is especially great to eat since it contains bacteria that helps you digest food."

      "content": "Consider a low-carb (Atkins) diet. If you’d like to avoid your body converting your food to sugar and producing insulin, which gets turned into fat, steer clear of starchy and highly processed foods, like white bread. Instead, switch to a low-carb diet full of proteins (like lean meats and soy products), vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Limit the number of carbs to 20% of your diet, since your body does need glucose to function. To stick to a low-carb Atkins diet, include these staples: [9] X Research source Unprocessed, high-protein meats, such as beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and turkey. Unprocessed, high-protein fish, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and trout. Low-carbohydrate vegetables and leafy greens. Full-fat, unprocessed cow, goat, or sheep's milk cheeses."

If you eat too much protein, your body turns excess protein into glucose, which spikes blood sugar and insulin levels.
