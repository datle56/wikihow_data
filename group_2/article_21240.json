      "content": "Choose a variety of chilies. Chilies are one of the most wonderful plants to grow because they come in a wide range of colors, sizes, tastes, and spice levels. Three general types of chili include sweet, hot, and ornamental. All types have some spice level, but sweet chilies are the mildest, ornamentals have lovely colors and shapes with a kick of spice, and hot chilies are used primarily for their intense spice levels and flavors. Chillis come in both annual (meaning you have to replant them each year) or perennial (meaning they grow back on their own) varieties. Colors range from green, butter yellow, peachy orange, and fire-engine red to plum and pitch black. The colors, however, don’t directly correlate to the flavor or spice levels. Visit a local nursery to discover what variety will thrive in your local environment. Certain chilies are used in different areas of the world for special recipes; for example, Serrano chilies are used primarily in Mexican dishes, while the Calcutta pepper is used in Asian curries.

      "content": "Fill seed trays with moistened seed start mix. After soaking your seeds, combine an aerated seed starter mix with water to moisten the soil. Start with a small amount of water and mix the material with your hands to distribute it evenly. Use gloves if you don't want to get dirty. Add the prepared starter to the seed tray (cells). Compress the mixture with your fingers. [3] X Research source If you squeeze the mixture and water seeps out, the mixture is too wet. Add more soil."

      "title": "Sow 2-3 seeds per cell and let them germinate for 14 days.",
      "content": "Sow 2-3 seeds per cell and let them germinate for 14 days. Sowing refers to scattering the seeds onto the soil. Place 2 to 3 chili seeds into each cell. Then, use your finger or the pencil tip to bury the seeds 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) deep. Generously mist each cell and place the tray in a warm area with a plastic cover to contain the heat. [4] X Research source To germinate the seeds, you may need a heat mat to maintain 80 to 90 °F (27 to 32 °C). Fan out the trays once a day for a few minutes to add oxygen. Moisten the seeds as they dry out, but don't add too much water, as overwatering can lead to mold. Sow chili seeds indoors from late winter to mid-spring for a longer harvest."

However, some chili varieties can take up to 3 weeks to sprout. Look for 2-4 sets of leaves before repotting them indoors or outdoors.

Use rich, high-quality potting soil with compost for added nutrients. [6] X Research source Fill the pot with at least 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil. You can also use any indoor fertilizer to enrich the chillis every couple of weeks. Alternatively, you can use a large planter basket for a balcony. For houseplants, use a small chili variety so it can grow efficiently. If you don't have enough light, purchase a plant light ."

      "content": "Transfer the seedling to its new pot and cover it with soil. Transfer the seedling to the larger pot you prepared with soil. Hold the seedling steady with one hand, and add enough potting mix to cover the root ball and stem. The stem should be able to stand steadily on its own. Cover just below the first set of leaves. [8] X Research source If possible, prepare your soil weeks or months in advance so your chilies can grow better. They prefer soil that has good drainage and plenty of nutrients. Add a bit of sand into your soil to help it drain better, and incorporate compost a few weeks or months before planting. Always test your soil first to ensure it has enough potassium. Chillis like soil with a neutral or slightly acidic pH of 6.5-7."

Seeds grown indoors have a consistent temperature. When quickly transferred outdoors, they can experience shock from varying temperatures, moisture levels, and sunlight. Sit them outside for 2 hours a day for one week, then add an hour to each additional day until they can be outside for 24 hours. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Weed and fertilize while you wait for the plant to flower. Pull out any weeds to ensure the plant grows quickly, as these can steal space and nutrients from your chilies. Add compost or potassium fertilizer every month to feed the chilies. You can also add a layer of mulch to lock in moisture so the chilies can begin to flower and bear fruit sooner. [18] X Research source Depending on the type of chilies you're growing, you may need a trellis or stick to take on its weight. For example, bell peppers grow better with the support of a trellis."

Whether you're growing them indoors or outdoors, chillis and other pepper plants grow best in warm climates with well-draining soil. Ideal temperatures for chillis to thrive are between 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) by day or 60 to 70 °F (16 to 21 °C) by night. If the temperature drops lower, use plant lights or heat mats to keep them safe. [19] X Research source Temperatures above 90 °F (32 °C) may cause the plant to droop.

Wait until the color has completely changed for 3 to 5 days before harvesting. Then, select one chili and snip it in the middle between the stem and plant. Taste before harvesting more. [23] X Research source Harvest jalapeños once they turn dark green. Harvest banana peppers when they’re a dark yellow, orange, or red. Cherry, habanero, and poblano are ready when they turn red. Use sharp scissors or clippers to snip the stems above the peppers. Wear gloves when handling chilies and wash your hands afterward to avoid transferring the hot oil to your skin, face, or eyes."
