      "content": "Prepare and design your system. The first step in any septic installation is to perform a site survey and do a percolation (soil) test on the area where the POWTS is going to be installed. [1] X Research source The system then can be designed based on the findings of the survey and results of the soil test. After this, the appropriate permits and approvals can be applied for. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Site survey findings that influence the design include things like: available space topography intended purpose and perceived water use based on the size of the dwelling/building the system will service. location of the well and/or neighboring wells. Soil test findings that influence the design include things like: soil type and layering (sand, clay, rock, and where it is located relative to depth) ability of the soil to drain and filter wastewater."

Zoeller 170 or similar) if required. distribution box (either concrete, or plastic, if running more than two laterals.)"

      "content": "Find where you want to go into the building relative to where you want to place the septic tank. Excavate to at least 2 feet deep and drill a hole through the wall, or go deeper and go under the footing, whichever is desired, or necessary. Plan for the flow to go downhill from here, as this is exactly what a gravity fed system is all about. It does not use a mechanical means other than gravity to discharge the waste from the tank to the drain field. [3] X Research source Pipe 4\" Sch. 40 going a foot through the wall or under the footing, and to a minimum of five feet outside the building toward the tank. Set it level where it's going through the wall or under the footing, and from there run with about an 1/8\" per foot of pitch (slope) toward the septic tank. Go further or all the way into the tank if required. If not, switch to 4\" 3034 with the appropriate adapter and pipe toward the tank with 3034. Be sure that the septic tank would be approximately 15 feet or slightly more out from the exterior wall of your house. Be sure to put a test cap on the end going into the building. If going through the wall, seal around the hole with hydraulic cement, inside and out. Don't run too much pitch going out to the tank. If there's too much, the water runs away faster than the solids, and the solids may get left in the pipe. Also, there may not be enough pitch to get to the drain field, depending on the depth your drain field is, and how close it will be to the outlet of the tank."

      "content": "Excavate a hole large enough to set the concrete aerobic tank below ground. Use the laser transit and \"shoot\" the top of the pipe going out to the tank. Measure the distance from the top of the inlet, to the bottom of the tank. Add this (go up on the grade pole) plus 1 1/2\" to the number you shot off the top of the pipe. The grade pole is now set to the depth that you need. Proceed to use this to excavate the hole to the appropriate depth. Lay out and excavate your leech field as it has been determined by the test done in the permit process. When laying out and excavating, remember to maintain a positive flow between the tank and the drain field."

The pump chamber or sometimes known as a pressure tank, or dosing tank contains the electric pump which is utilized to move the effluent from place to place, and eventually into the drain field for final disposal.

The pump chamber contains the effluent pump and floats to pump out to the drain field at measured or timed intervals. This is a sealed system. The electrical installation will usually require a licensed electrician to satisfy state regulations. In areas with high ground water, be aware that the pump chamber or additional ATUs may be mostly empty much of the time, and these tanks may have to be protected against flotation by the use of extra weight or other protective structures."
