      "content": "Jirai Kei is a fashion aesthetic that contrasts soft looks with edgy ideals. The jirai kei aesthetic is popular in Japan and is all about wearing cute, frilly clothing in contrast to the more extreme sides of your personality. The jirai kei aesthetic is characterized by pink and black clothing, big, anime-like eyes, miniskirts, Sanrio accessories, bows, and ribbons paired with cigarettes and alcohol. [1] X Research source In Japan, people who take part in the jirai kei aesthetic are stereotyped as delinquents who frequently drink, smoke, engage in self-destructive behavior, and are prone to explosive breakdowns. This aesthetic is often seen as edgy and draws inspiration from gothic looks , but has been associated with dangerous things, like self-harm, mental illness, and a willingness to hurt yourself or others. Most people consider this a fashion trend/aesthetic (especially in the west), but the Jirai Kei subculture has dark roots. In fashion, there is more of a focus on edginess with silver accessories, brooches, backpacks and exaggerated makeup. Women who participate in jirai kei are called Jirai Joshi, which translates to “landmine girls.” Men who participate in jirai kei are called Jirai Danshi, which translates to “landmine boys.”"

      "content": "The Jirai Kei subculture originated on the streets of Japan’s Kabukicho district. The Jirai Kei subculture was born among teen runaways in Japan’s Kabukicho district. These runaways, called the Toyoko Kids, are a criminal gang that’s active in the district. Their style of dress inspired the Jirai Kei aesthetic, which became popular in March 2020 when Japanese YouTuber SuReRo did a makeup challenge emulating the Jirai Kei style. [2] X Research source While the Jirai Kei subculture is often associated with drugs, alcohol, and dangerous activities, the Jirai Kei aesthetic is strictly focused on fashion. The Toyoko Kids are often associated with drugs, sex work, and other illegal activities. The term “jirai” is used in Japan to insult women who are seen as overly-emotional and prone to mental breakdowns, akin to a landmine that explodes without warning. Jirai kei derives from the term “jirai onna,” an offensive term that means “landmine woman.”"
