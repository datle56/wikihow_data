      "content": "Cut the top off a plastic bottle to make a funnel. Wash and dry the bottle before cutting it. Make sure there is no drink residue left, since it could interfere with the trap. Use scissors to poke a hole roughly 2 inches (5 cm) from the top of the bottle, at the point where the curved “funnel” part becomes straight. Insert your scissors and cut off the top of the bottle in a circular pattern. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Make your cut as close as possible to the spot where the top “funnel” part of the bottle meets the tube-shaped cylinder. If you cut too close to the top of the bottle, the next step won’t work correctly. The cut-off top of the bottle will be funnel-shaped. The rest of the bottle will be shaped like a tube. You can also use a serrated knife to cut off the top of the bottle."

      "content": "Staple the funnel to the bottle to hold it in place. Use 3-4 staples around the circumference of the bottle. Space the staples equally so that there are no large gaps between the funnel and the bottle. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a stapler, secure the funnel to the bottle with tape. Apply several pieces of tape around the circumference of the bottle so that the funnel doesn’t move."

      "content": "Mix sugar and water to create a syrup. Add 5 tbsp. (63 g) of sugar to a small pot, spreading the sugar evenly across the bottom of the pot. Add a small amount of water—just enough to cover the sugar. Then stir the mixture continuously over medium-high heat until it begins to boil. Once it begins boiling, turn off the heat and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until it’s close to room temperature. [4] X Research source Make sure the mixture is boiling before cutting the heat. The boiling turns the sugar water into syrup, which will attract flies more effectively."

      "content": "Use a spoon to add the cooled-down syrup to your bottle trap. Let the syrup drip down the inside of the funnel and down into the bottom of the trap. This will attract the flies to the funnel and draw them to the bottom, where they’ll get stuck. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add extra bait like fruit, raw meat, or both. This will make the trap even more attractive to the flies. To attract fruit flies, use chunks of fruit like apples, pears, bananas, or whatever you have in your home. To attract houseflies, use raw chicken, fish, or some other smelly raw meat you have in your fridge. [6] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Don’t add raw meat if you plan to use the trap inside your home. It will smell terrible. Stick with fruit alone. Instead of meat, you can use a few spoonfuls of old red wine. This will add “meaty” smell without having decomposing meat in your trap. You can also add extra sugar water or honey to your trap."

      "content": "Let trapped flies accumulate in the bottle. The more flies you catch, the more will be attracted to the trap. Some of the flies may drown in the liquid, but this is a more sanitary outcome than letting them fly around your house or property. Once you’re satisfied with the number of flies you’ve caught, wash the bottle out and make a new trap. You can also throw the trap away if you don’t need it anymore. Wear gloves when handling the trap to avoid touching dead flies."
