    {
      "title": "Look for a sparkle in his eyes when you talk.",
      "content": "Look for a sparkle in his eyes when you talk. People look into each other’s eyes when they’re really invested in what the other person is saying. When you have chemistry, it’s different: there’s a gentleness in their eyes, almost like a sparkle. Next time you’re talking, see if his eyes light up when you look at each other. [1] X Research source If his eyes don’t “sparkle,” see if he gives you a “look” he doesn’t give anyone else. For example, he might raise his eyebrows or stare really intensely at you."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if he leans in to talk to you.",
      "content": "See if he leans in to talk to you. People often physically open up to others during conversations when they’re interested in them. They might face their torso toward you and lean in close while talking and listening to you. [2] X Research source Check to see if he seems relaxed and confident enough to get close while you’re together. Some guys are less confident than others! He might not open up his body, and instead be more fidgety. If he’s a nervous person, check to see if he plays with his hair a lot, or constantly crosses and uncrosses his legs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch if he mirrors your movements while listening to you.",
      "content": "Watch if he mirrors your movements while listening to you. Copying someone’s body language is a sign of attraction and intrigue. While you’re talking and he’s listening, does he shift his arms or legs when you do? Does he lean in when you do? He might be so focused on what you’re saying that he doesn’t realize he’s copying you! [3] X Research source The same goes for facial expressions. Does he smile when you smile? Frown when you frown? [4] X Research source Try telling him a story with a lot of emotion and see how he reacts while listening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notice when he sits next to you or touches your hand.",
      "content": "Notice when he sits next to you or touches your hand. Guys like to be physically close to people they’re attracted to, even when it might seem silly. This can sometimes even result in touching! [5] X Research source If he ever touches you or seems like he wants to, and you feel the same way, that’s chemistry. Some people show this in subtler ways than others. Remember: not everyone is super confident! For example, he might have difficulty pulling away from a hug, or sit on the same side of a table as you. If he touches your back or holds your hand, he’s probably super interested."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep track of how often you poke fun at each other.",
      "content": "Keep track of how often you poke fun at each other. You know how kids can be a little “mean” to their crushes? Some things never change! Fun, harmless teasing can still show that you’re trying to get each other’s attention. Cute nicknames, playful banter, and silly imitations of each other are all actually signs of chemistry. [6] X Research source Teasing should be fun for both of you, and never actually be mean!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to how he speaks with you versus other people.",
      "content": "Listen to how he speaks with you versus other people. It may seem obvious, but flirting is a really important sign of chemistry you can notice right away. When you talk with each other, does it feel like you’re having a secret conversation in public that no one else can hear? If so, there’s probably something special happening between you. [7] X Research source The content of “flirting” can look different for different people. For example, some guys might speak intimately with you, while others might just want to make you smile. Some might love laughing at your jokes that even you don’t think are that funny!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch if his gestures are expressive in front of you.",
      "content": "Watch if his gestures are expressive in front of you. Even though guys tend to be less expressive overall, their faces, bodies, and voices show more emotion toward people they’re attracted to. Take note of how he speaks to you compared to other people. If you can see that he looks and sounds more excited with you, chances are he feels comfortable with you. [8] X Research source Generally speaking, these expressions are happy and excited. For example, he might smile a lot, raise his eyebrows, or talk loudly. The guy pays a lot of attention to every detail and makes sure that you’re feeling happy with him? That's a great chemistry sign!"
    },
    {
      "title": "See if he uses the same words and tone as you.",
      "content": "See if he uses the same words and tone as you. Studies show that people growing close to each other start matching the pitch, pace, and pronunciation of how they speak. [9] X Research source In other words, if he’s interested in you, he’ll start talking like you without even realizing it! For example, he might use the same slang as you, or speak at a similar volume or speed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen for mentions of “next dates” together.",
      "content": "Listen for mentions of “next dates” together. People who talk like they’re already expecting to hang out in the future can indicate how serious they are about getting closer. You can gauge this through his word choice, too! Take note of whether he uses words like “we” and “us” when referring to the both of you and making possible plans together. [10] X Research source Listen closely for personable language versus detached language. For example, “our” versus “the” in reference to plans. However, while talk of current or future plans together is a great sign, make sure he's showing you his commitment in other ways as well (e.g., him making time for and prioritizing you).

      "title": "Notice if you both seem giddy around each other.",
      "content": "Notice if you both seem giddy around each other. Do you catch yourself smiling and laughing more than usual with him? Does he seem like he’s extra happy around you, too? You might not even have to be around each other: just the thought of him makes you smile! Having fun and feeling good around each other is a definite sign of chemistry. [11] X Research source This is especially significant for guys, since they tend to be less expressive with people they don’t feel close to after childhood. [12] X Research source Bonus points if you see a big toothy grin, or he smiles so big that it crinkles up his whole face."

    {
      "title": "Nerves aren’t always a bad thing.",
      "content": "Nerves aren’t always a bad thing. Your body reacts the same way to feelings of nervousness and excitement. A racing heartbeat, sweaty palms, and butterflies in your stomach are all the result of the same chemical reactions. If you notice you feel anxious around each other, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re scared of each other - quite the opposite, actually! Being nervous around each other is different from being uncomfortable. In other words, you should still feel excited about seeing each other!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Attraction can make things a little awkward at times.",
      "content": "Attraction can make things a little awkward at times. Maybe you feel that whenever you spend time together, it feels like you’re both waiting for something to happen, like a kiss or something more. [13] X Research source Take note of these feelings, but remember that there’s no need to rush anything. Tension can make the wait for where your relationship is going all the more exciting! Tension can also make people nervous, so give each other some space if you need it. On the other hand, tension can make people eager to act! Do what feels right for both of you. Once you feel comfortable enough around each other, you can try having a conversation about your desires and expectations."

    {
      "title": "The world might feel like it’s passing you by.",
      "content": "The world might feel like it’s passing you by. When you’re invested in someone, it can feel like time doesn’t matter. This can happen when you’re both completely focused on a conversation you’re having or an activity you’re doing together. Chances are, chemistry is what’s causing you both to live in your own little bubble! One way this shows up is by feeling comfortable with silences in conversations. Remember that even though it may not feel like it, there’s still an outside world to attend to!"
