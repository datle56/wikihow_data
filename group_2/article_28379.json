      "title": "Dip a sponge or brush in white powder.",
      "content": "Dip a sponge or brush in white powder. Applying white powder to your hair is a great way to achieve temporary gray hair or a salt-and-pepper look. Purchase loose white face powder , baby powder, talcum powder , cornstarch, or any other white powder that is safe to use around your hair and face. Pour the powder into a bowl and dip a makeup sponge or brush into it. [1] X Research source If you want something that lasts longer, use powder hair dye according to the package’s instructions."

      "title": "Brush the powder along your temples.",
      "content": "Brush the powder along your temples. Lightly brush the sponge or brush on the hair along your temples to begin graying your hair. Work the powder from the roots of your hair up, especially around the hair that frames your face. This will give it a more realistic appearance. Reapply the powder as needed to ensure you get full coverage and your desired color. [2] X Research source Even though the powder is white, the natural color of your hair will come through to make your hair look like it’s gray. If you want a subtly older look, brushing the powder on the temples is usually enough, as people tend to go gray first around the temples. Make sure to avoid getting powder on your face. Brush away powder with a wet cloth if you get it on your forehead or neck."

      "content": "Sprinkle the powder onto your hair. If you want a dramatic, all-over white look, lean back over a sink and sprinkle a pinch of powder over your hair.

      "title": "Dip a toothbrush in white or gray greasepaint.",
      "content": "Dip a toothbrush in white or gray greasepaint. Purchase professional-grade white or gray greasepaint makeup , which is often used in clowning and can be found at Halloween or costume specialty stores. Dip a toothbrush in the greasepaint and rub it in to cover the brush in paint. [4] X Research source Greasepaint has better staying power than powder and is less messy to apply. However, if you have long hair and are applying it all over, it will likely feel heavier and stiffer than powder. White or grey greasepaint can work, depending on the shade of grey you want. If you use a light hand, your natural hair color will come through so that it will likely look grey even if you use white."

If you have short hair, simply spray your entire head evenly with the hairspray, building it up in layers if you want a more dramatic effect. [8] X Research source Find temporary gray or silver spray color at most beauty stores and Halloween stores. Silver spray is usually more common, but it may have a metallic effect. Check the packaging or consult a store associate before purchasing a temporary silver hairspray.
