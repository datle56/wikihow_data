      "title": "Cut a pool noodle in half with a knife.",
      "content": "Cut a pool noodle in half with a knife. Hold the noodle horizontally in front of you with your non-dominant hand and hold it firmly against a flat surface. Now, use your dominant hand to cut the noodle in half with a vertical cut. Keep the knife straight as you cut and move it up and down in slow, steady motions. [1] X Research source You can use scissors if you'd like but it's much more difficult. Never use a knife or scissors without a parent present."

      "title": "Wrap ¼ of the noodle with silver duct tape.",
      "content": "Wrap ¼ of the noodle with silver duct tape. The silver duct tape acts as the metal of the handle. Start from the bottom of the edge you cut and wrap the tape around the noodle in circles as evenly as possible. Once you've covered about ¼ of the noodle, use a pair of scissors to cut off the excess tape. [2] X Research source Make sure that the final wrap is a straight horizontal line around the tube."

      "title": "Attach 3 rings of black electrical tape to the top portion of the duct tape.",
      "content": "Attach 3 rings of black electrical tape to the top portion of the duct tape. Start by wrapping a ring of electrical tape along the topmost part of the silver duct tape—directly onto the tape—so that the top edges of each tape are perfectly parallel to each other. Now, add 2 more black rings below the first so that each one is about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) away from each other. Wrap the rings so that they're perfectly parallel to each other."

    {
      "title": "Stick 2 rectangular pieces of black tape to the bottom of the lightsaber.",
      "content": "Stick 2 rectangular pieces of black tape to the bottom of the lightsaber. Cut 2 pieces of rectangular black tape about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long and attach them vertically to the bottom of the silver section of your lightsaber. Be sure that each one is parallel to each other with about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between them. [3] X Research source Each vertical piece of black tape should have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the lower black ring and the bottom of the lightsaber."

      "title": "Create an 18 inch (46 cm) tube using your colored construction paper.",
      "content": "Create an 18 inch (46 cm) tube using your colored construction paper. Start rolling your 12 by 18 inch (30 cm × 46 cm) piece of colored construction paper at a slight angle to make one end wider. If you need to adjust the roll's tightness, grab the corner that's inside the tube and pull on it. Once you make a tube, use a piece of clear packing tape to secure the edges. [4] X Research source Wrap the entire tube in packing tape for more durability."

    {
      "title": "Cut the top of the tube to straighten it.",
      "content": "Cut the top of the tube to straighten it. Hold the tube vertically in front of you and use a pair of scissors to create a horizontal cut across the top of the tube so that it's flat. Place this piece aside for later—you're going to need it for making buttons. [5] X Research source Don't use scissors without a parent present."

    {
      "title": "Stuff the tube with filling material.",
      "content": "Stuff the tube with filling material. Shredded paper towel, tissues, and toilet paper all work great. Regardless of what you use, crunch your material into a ball and use a pencil or marker to shove it into the tube until it's packed full and sturdy. [6] X Research source Insert the filling material piece by piece and don't overstuff the tube!"

      "title": "Attach the black paper 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the tube's bottom.",
      "content": "Attach the black paper 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the tube's bottom. Take your 12 by 9 inch (30 cm × 23 cm) piece of black construction paper and wrap it around the bottom of your colored tube. Continue wrapping it in a tight tube and then attach it with a piece of tape. [7] X Research source Be sure to wrap the paper evenly so that the top and bottom are perfectly horizontal. Swap black paper for gray if you'd like—whatever you think looks the coolest!"

      "title": "Close the ends of the lightsaber with packing tape to hold the filling.",
      "content": "Close the ends of the lightsaber with packing tape to hold the filling. Cut a small circle of paper for each hole—1 the same color as your beam and 1 the same color as your handle. Afterward, place a square of tape over the paper circle, align the hole over the end, and then press the tape onto the paper tubing to hold it in place. [8] X Research source To make things easier, cut small lines into the tape to attach to the tube."

      "title": "Add small details and buttons.",
      "content": "Add small details and buttons. Use the excess colored construction paper to create small circles and rectangles to act as buttons. Although red is the color of the main circular lightsaber button in the Star Wars movies, you can use whatever colors look good to you. After creating your buttons, add glue to the back of them and stick them onto your handle. [9] X Research source Look at lightsaber pictures for inspiration when creating buttons for your handle. If you want, cut out different shapes—get creative!"
