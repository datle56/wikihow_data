      "content": "Your Pearson VUE account no longer has an option to book an exam. Log into your Pearson VUE account a few hours after taking the exam. If Pearson VUE (the company that administers the NCLEX) recognizes that you’ve already passed the exam, you won’t be able to schedule a new one on your account. [1] X Research source To verify this, try re-registering for the NCLEX exam. If Pearson VUE doesn’t let you re-register, that’s a positive sign. Instead, you’ll be able to access your exam history, which indicates you’ve passed and can look forward to getting your nursing license."

      "title": "Your Quick Results indicate that you passed.",
      "content": "Your Quick Results indicate that you passed. Candidates who take the NCLEX can unlock their unofficial results (called Quick Results) online 48 hours (2 business days) after the exam. NCLEX Quick Results are believed to be accurate, but they’re still computer-generated and can’t be used to authorize you as a nurse—so you’ll still need to wait for official confirmation to practice as a nurse. [2] X Research source To find your Quick Results, sign into your Pearson VUE account and click “My Account.” Then, click on “Quick Results.” Keep in mind you’ll usually have to pay a fee of $7.95 to see your Quick Results. Regardless of whether you can access Quick Results, you’ll need to wait for your state’s nursing board to send official results."

      "title": "You don’t get a new Authorization to Test (ATT).",
      "content": "You don’t get a new Authorization to Test (ATT). Failing the exam means you’ll be sent an ATT, which is what enables you to retake the exam. So, if you don’t get an ATT or any other communication from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) after taking the NCLEX, that’s a positive sign indicating you’ve likely passed your exam. [3] X Research source It’ll take a few weeks to get your official license in the mail if you pass the NCLEX, so no communication from them in the meantime is a good thing!"

      "title": "You get a temporary license or license number.",
      "content": "You get a temporary license or license number. Depending on which state you live in, your nursing license might be updated before you get your official results. If you can find a nursing license under your name on your state’s Board of Nursing (BON) website—particularly one with a label such as “Nurse of the Future” or “Temporary License” on it—it means you’re a licensed nurse according to the state. [4] X Research source Temporary licenses can sometimes be issued within a few days of passing the NCLEX, but it may take weeks for a permanent license to be processed. For more information on the exact timeline for nursing licenses, check your state’s BON website."

      "content": "The best way to confirm you passed is by getting your test results. Although the questions you get (or the number of questions) during your test might offer clues, it’s unfortunately impossible to know if you passed right away. [5] X Research source While you might have a good feeling about your test performance, your best confirmation is the actual results of your exam (or at least your Quick Results after 48 hours). While you’re waiting for your NCLEX results, try not to worry too much. Instead, try reflecting on the exam. In which areas did you feel most confident? Were there areas you struggled with? Once you’ve analyzed your exam experience, you’ll know where your strengths and weaknesses lie—and what topics you might want to learn about to strengthen your skills and gain more confidence."

      "title": "It may take up to 6 weeks to get the results of your NCLEX exam.",
      "content": "It may take up to 6 weeks to get the results of your NCLEX exam. Even though you might see your Quick Results or a temporary nursing license well before 6 weeks pass, it’ll still take time to get your official results and a notice about passing the NCLEX from your state’s board of nursing. So, be patient and try not to panic if you don’t hear anything right away; a nursing license takes time to process! [6] X Research source Getting official confirmation is the best way to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you passed the NCLEX. After that, the next steps usually include following instructions from your state's nursing board (which may ask you to provide more documentation or fill out an online application). Be sure to follow all instructions carefully since they differ based on state requirements! If you fail the NCLEX, you can absolutely retake it 45 days later. So, be sure to study and prepare for the exam in that time if you need to take it again."

      "title": "Receiving challenging questions",
      "content": "Receiving challenging questions The NCLEX is designed to adapt its questions to your skill level—which is why the difficulty level of questions can be an indicator of how you’re doing. [7] X Research source If you keep getting difficult questions during the test, it may indicate that you’ve been answering questions correctly and showing that you have a solid understanding of the material. A gradual increase in the difficulty of your exam questions can also be a sign that you’re performing well since it can indicate that the test is adapting to your skill level over time. Alternative format questions (like multiple-response or fill-in-the-blank questions) are often more difficult, so getting a lot of them may also indicate a great test performance. However, don’t assume you’re failing if you get a few easy questions. You can absolutely still get easy questions and pass the exam! Plus, some questions may only seem easy because you happen to know a lot about that particular subject; they might actually be considered challenging."

      "title": "Getting the minimum number of questions",
      "content": "Getting the minimum number of questions An NCLEX test can pose a minimum of 85 questions and a maximum of 150 (as of 2024); the number of questions you get generally depends on your ability to answer them correctly. [8] X Research source So, if the test ends after you answer only 85 questions, it might be a sign that you’ve done very well and passed with flying colors! Still, keep in mind that the number of questions you get doesn’t necessarily guarantee passing or failing the exam. While many people who take the exam use the number of questions they get to gauge their performance, it’s still possible to be asked a high number of questions and pass (or to get a low number of questions and fail)."

      "content": "Finishing the exam quickly Candidates taking the NCLEX have up to 5 hours (including breaks) to finish the test. [9] X Research source If you finish the NCLEX in a shorter period of time, it might mean you knew the material well and answered the questions accurately! Of course, everyone takes tests at their own pace, so the time you take on an exam might be very different than someone else’s. So, while this can give you an idea of your performance, it shouldn’t be the only factor you consider. Don’t be afraid to take the time you need, even if it means using all of the allotted time! You can still take 5 hours and pass the NCLEX or take 1 hour and fail it."

      "content": "Feeling confident in your answers Pay attention to your confidence levels throughout the exam and whether you feel good about how you answered most of the questions. If you feel quite confident , that can be a good sign—it may indicate that you’re well-prepared and have no problem trusting your knowledge to get you through the exam. [10] X Research source Obviously, it’s possible to feel confident and still get the wrong answer, but if you really know the material well, you may feel a sense of self-assurance even on many of the tougher questions."

If you’ve studied hard and can quickly understand whatever you’re being asked, it means you’re well-prepared for the exam (and for your future as a licensed nurse). [11] X Research source Regardless of whether you feel confident or not, studying and knowing the material well is the easiest way to boost your chances of success."

The exam is given in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format, meaning the exam adjusts its own difficulty level automatically based on your responses (as mentioned above).

      "content": "The NCLEX operates on a pass/fail scoring system. There’s no numeric score; the test evaluates whether you meet the minimum competency needed to be a licensed nurse, so you’ll either pass or fail outright. Passing the test means answering questions correctly, either at or above the required competency level. Topics covered in the NCLEX include: [13] X Research source Your ability to provide safe, high-quality care to clients and understanding of the nursing process. Your knowledge of safety measures and infection control protocols, as well as your ability to minimize risks to clients and healthcare providers. Your understanding of pharmacology (drug classifications and administration, dosage calculations, adverse reactions, and how to educate clients on their medications). Your knowledge of screening procedures, risk factors for diseases and conditions, and your ability to educate patients on health promotion. Your understanding of mental health disorders, coping mechanisms, and ability to offer clients emotional support. Your knowledge of physiological systems (including the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems)."
