For extra body, select a mousse that says it includes a volumizing agent. This will be displayed on the mousse bottle. If you have very soft and fine hair or want your messy bun up-do to last for a long time, pick out a hairspray that you like to ensure your messy bun stays intact. For the most natural look, choose a hair spray with a micro-fine mist for minimal build up that you can apply and reapply without washing your hair. For a more extreme edgy look, choose a hair spray that offers massive volume without stiffness. If you have extremely soft or freshly washed hair, you can also experiment with dry shampoo or hair salt spray to add texture. (optional)"

Next, you can either spin your ponytail into a single strip and then wrap it around the rubber-band and stick the end back under the rubber-band; or when you are forming the initial ponytail, with the last wrap of the rubber-band, intentionally don't pull the hair all the way through - leaving a large bouncy loop of hair. Pull the loop of hair further through the elastic ponytail holder to make the bun bigger and/or allow some of the strands to fall through for the ultimate messy look. Grasp the sides of the bun and widen the bun's radius by gently pulling the edges out to the sides. Selectively tug on the center of the loop to give it more of a U shape. Pull the ends sticking through the underside of the elastic to the left and right so that they’re more flared out against your head. Tuck any unwanted fallen strands back into the elastic. If desired, wrap a few loose strands around the elastic and pin them with a bobby pin."
