      "title": "Find some paper to create your bow with.",
      "content": "Find some paper to create your bow with. Construction paper works great for this, but you can also use origami paper or even scrapbooking paper. Another option is to decorate printer paper with markers and use that instead. Avoid using thick paper, such as cardstock."

      "title": "Cut the paper down to the right size.",
      "content": "Cut the paper down to the right size. Cut the paper to the same width as your desired bow. The same height as your desired bow, or a little taller. Remember, you can always trim the paper down later."

      "content": "Fold the paper like a fan, keeping the folds 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) apart. Turn your paper so that the back is facing you. Fold the bottom edge up by 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Turn the paper over, and fold it by another 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Keep flipping and folding the paper until you reach the other end. Finish folding the paper in the back. This will make the bow symmetrical. If you finished folding in the front, cut the paper shorter until the last fold is in the back. The back of the paper is the blank or white side. If you are using construction paper, there is no blank or white side."
