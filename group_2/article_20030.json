Also, make sure that the candle's wick is not glued to the bottom of the votive. If your candle's wick is glued to the bottom, the wax may not come out cleanly. [1] X Research source Consider using the method described in the section on using boiling water to remove wax."

    {
      "title": "Prepare the candle jar.",
      "content": "Prepare the candle jar. Many candle jars become narrower at the opening, which means that the wax can get stuck when you try to remove it. You can prevent this by slicing the wax up inside the jar using a butter knife. When the wax freezes, it will break into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces will be easier to take out than one big piece. You can use this technique on shaped candle holders as well. If you are using a regular candle holder with straight walls, then you do not need to slice the wax up."
