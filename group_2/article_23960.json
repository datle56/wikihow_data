      "content": "Measure your space to see how much drywall you need. Use a measuring tape to calculate the square footage of each wall that you’re working with. Then, determine how many 4'x8' (or 4'x12') sheets of drywall you need to cover the space. [1] X Research source You can also use a drywall calculator to determine how many sheets of drywall you’ll need. Don’t worry about fitting the walls perfectly—you’ll cut a few sheets of drywall to fill in any oddly-sized gaps or edges."

      "content": "Buy the right kind of drywall for the environment. Pick whichever variety fits the environment it will be installed in. For instance, there are various moisture-resistant products commonly called \"green rock\" that are designed for installation in high-moisture areas such as garages and bathrooms. Check your local building supply store before committing to purchase. [3] X Research source Drywall typically comes in 4'x8' sheets. Larger 4'x12' sheets are available but are harder to work with and are usually used by professionals with a few extra hands. Thicknesses range from 1/4\"-5/8,\" with 1/2\" being the most popular. The 1/4\" sheets are often used as overlays to existing drywall and are not intended to be used in new construction. Check your local building code for requirements in your area."

Use a crowbar, hacksaw, and whatever other tools you’ve got around to remove all old drywall, nails, screws, and anything else that will prevent the new drywall sheets from laying flat on the studs. Wear a dust mask and protective eyewear while doing this to avoid breathing in any drywall dust or irritating your eyes. [4] X Research source Warning: Do not damage the studs behind the drywall. Unless the building is centuries old, you can (and should) keep the studs."

      "title": "Inspect your studs to make sure they’re straight and undamaged.",
      "content": "Inspect your studs to make sure they’re straight and undamaged. Drywall specialist Ryan Owsiany says that you must check that loose blocking, moisture damage, termites, or other problems will not make installation a problem. Don't be surprised to find steel studs instead of wood. Steel studs are generally a good thing since steel provides added strength, and is termite-proof and fire-retardant. The only difference with steel is that you'll have to use drywall screws instead of nails when hanging the drywall. [5] X Expert Source Ryan Owsiany Drywall & Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021. If the studs are damaged and any of the walls are load bearing , contact a professional contractor who specializes in framing and foundations to have them take a look and repair the issue. If the walls aren’t load-bearing, you can try re-framing the wall yourself. Inspect the insulation that is stapled to the studs. Use Kraft tape to repair tears in the paper backing to maximize your energy efficiency. Use triple-expanding foam to seal cracks and gaps on exterior walls you spot after taking the drywall down."

      "content": "Plan to start at a corner and place a piece so it ends on a joist. Never leave an end piece of drywall unsupported. The end piece of drywall should always be screwed down to a strapping piece or joist. [6] X Research source If your drywall does not end on a strapping piece or joist, try this: Measure to the center of the farthest support piece the drywall gets to and transfer that measurement to the drywall. Place a T-square along the line in your drywall and run a razor along that straight line created by the T-square. Break the end piece off from the scoring line. Double-check the end of the drywall makes it to the center of the strapping piece or joist. Trust us. Start with the ceiling. You may be tempted to skip the ceiling and do the walls first, but the ceilings are the biggest pain and if you do the walls first, you could accidentally damage them as you work. Always get the ceiling out of the way first."

Load your caulk gun with the adhesive and pull the trigger as you apply the adhesive to each board. [7] X Research source You don’t need a ton of glue. It’ll just serve as a backup in the event that the nails or screws begin to come loose."

Lift the drywall with both hands and orient the piece against the joists in the ceiling. [8] X Research source This is a lot easier if you have a helper to assist in bracing the panel as you work. The strapping/joists are the wood beams in your ceilings and walls. They frame your home and give the walls structure. If you’re going to cover a huge ceiling, consider buying or renting a drywall lift to make holding the drywall up much easier."

Repeat this process for each strapping or joist underneath the drywall. [9] X Research source Make sure the five screws are evenly spaced along the strapping or joist. Leave 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) buffer zones on edges when driving screws. Do not screw too close to the edge of the drywall. Drive the screw heads down past the top of the drywall, but not so deep that they break through the surface."

[12] X Research source When cutting drywall, use a T-square and razor knife to score a line on one side of the drywall paper. Place your knee on the opposite side of the cut and quickly pull the drywall piece towards you while at the same time pushing your knee outward, snapping the drywall in a clean line. Clean up the remaining paper along the newly formed crease with your razor."

[14] X Research source Extra screws may help in some situations, but are usually overkill; they will require extra mudding and sanding that may detract from the overall finish. Consider using a spring-loaded drywall screw dimpler. They are designed to automatically countersink each drywall screw to precisely the same depth before ratcheting the screw bit, as a sign to quit and back off the drill."

At the same time, be mindful that no seams line up with a door or window corner, and do not fasten panels to framing around openings yet. [15] X Research source When installing drywall over protruding pipes, place the drywall against the pipe and lightly tap with a flat block of wood to dimple the back. Next, pull the drywall away and use a drywall circle cutter or drywall hole saw to cut a perfect hole along the dimple. This should be much easier to finish than if you punch out a large hole that requires 3 to 4 coats of mud to finish."
