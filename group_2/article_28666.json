Cut diagonally to this point from the left and then the right side. Meet the two in the middle at the chosen point. Carefully remove the cut piece if it hasn't already fallen away."

[13] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. At its most basic, if you can tie the ribbon into a tight knot, then it can be tied into a bow by hand. Some ribbons are too stiff to make into bows without additional help, such as wiring or stitching."
