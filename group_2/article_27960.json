      "title": "Remove the steak and deglaze the pan.",
      "content": "Remove the steak and deglaze the pan. Once the steak has browned on all sides, take it out of the pan and set aside. Pour in a little beef stock or red wine, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and stir with a wooden spoon. This will deglaze the pan, scraping up any delicious browned bits on the bottom to add to the flavor. [2] X Research source Red wine, beef stock or even water will work when deglazing a pan. Choose something that you like the taste of. Red wine will add some extra richness, beef stock will complement the flavor of the meat, and water will let you add your own flavors. Try combining different liquids for a more complex flavor. If you want to add any vegetables to the meal, you should do so before deglazing the pan. Cut your vegetables into bite-sized pieces and cook them until soft and aromatic. Peppers, mushrooms, onion, and carrot would all make great additions,"

      "title": "Add the steak back into the pot and add more liquid.",
      "content": "Add the steak back into the pot and add more liquid. Once the stock or wine has started bubbling slightly and you’ve lifted everything from the bottom of the pan, place the steak back in. Pour in some more beef stock, red wine or water until the steak is around half-covered. [3] X Research source Add any aromatics you want to infuse with your steak at this point. Bay leaves, orange peel, or garlic could all be great additions."

      "content": "Bring the liquid to a boil and lower to a simmer. Keep an eye on the steak as the liquid around it heats up and begins to boil. Once it starts boiling, immediately lower the temperature to bring it down to a slight simmer. [4] X Research source You can also leave your steak to simmer in the oven rather than on the stovetop. Heat your oven to around 350 °F (177 °C), cover the top of your Dutch oven and leave it to cook for around 2 hours."

      "title": "Cook the round steak for around 2 hours.",
      "content": "Cook the round steak for around 2 hours. When the liquid is simmering, cover the steak and leave it to cook until it is tender. Perfectly braised meat should be easily pulled apart with two forks, referred to as being “fork-tender”. Check your steak after around 1 hour to see if it is cooked. [5] X Research source The time it takes to cook your round steak will vary based on the cut and how thick it is. After the first hour, check your steak every 30 minutes or so until it is done."

      "content": "Remove the meat from the liquid and serve. Use a pair of tongs or a wooden spoon to lift the meat out of the Dutch oven and onto a serving plate. Serve the steak immediately with fresh vegetables and mashed potato. [6] X Research source For extra flavor, reduce the cooking liquid down further to turn it into a delicious sauce that can accompany your steak. Cook it over a high temperature until the sauce reduces, or add cornstarch to thicken it to your desired consistency."

      "content": "Cover a flat surface with parchment paper. Tear off a sheet of parchment paper slightly bigger than your round steak. Lay it out over a wooden cutting board or over a flat work surface. This will prevent the steak from sticking to anything as you tenderize it. [7] X Research source Instead of parchment paper, you could also use clingfilm or a clean plastic bag to cover your steak. Anything that will prevent the meat from directly touching another surface and that can be removed easily will work great."

      "content": "Pound the meat to tenderize it. Using a meat mallet, begin evenly tapping across the surface of the meat with the spiked side of the mallet. Apply a firm pressure and work all over the steak, flattening and breaking up the fibers rather than damaging it. [9] X Research source If you don’t have a meat mallet or tenderizer, you can use a flat skillet, a rolling pin, or even a sturdy roll of tin foil. You don't need to completely flatten your steak or spend a long time tenderizing it. Start at one end of the steak and slowly work down to the other end, hitting all parts of the meat with the mallet. Work back up the steak once more to make it tender without overworking it."

Lift the steak off of the bottom piece of paper and place it into a hot frying pan, skillet or griddle to cook. [10] X Research source As you have tenderized the meat and slightly flattened it in the process, the steak shouldn’t take long to cook. Give it 2-3 minutes on either side, keeping a close eye on it as it cooks."

Cover the steak with a layer of salt that is just thick enough so you cannot see the meat. [11] X Research source Use a coarse salt, such as kosher or a coarse sea salt to salt your steak. Table salt or something similar will be more difficult to remove from the steak and will make your steak too salty."

You shouldn’t be using the coarseness of the salt to tenderize the meat, only making sure that all parts of the steak are touching some salt. [12] X Research source The salt will draw out some of the moisture in the steak, concentrating the flavor of the meat and curing it slightly before you cook it. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the steak in the fridge for around 1 hour per inch (2.5cm) of thickness. Place the salted steak in the refrigerator to let the salt begin tenderizing the meat. As a rough guide, you should let the steak sit for roughly 1 hour per inch of thickness of the steak. If it’s 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches (3.2 cm) thick, for example, leave the steak for around 1 hour and 15 minutes. [14] X Research source Don’t let the steak sit for too much longer than it needs to. If you leave it for too long, you may cure your steak rather than tenderizing it, which will change the texture."

      "content": "Scrape away the salt and cook your steak. After the salted steak has been left to sit, use a butter knife or something similar to scrape away as much salt as you can. Rinse the steak under some cold water to wash away any remaining salt and pat it completely dry with a few paper towels. Cook your steak in a skillet, frying pan, or griddle over a medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes on each side. [15] X Research source When seasoning your steak, you shouldn’t add any more salt. There will be enough salt residue on the steak to flavor it and any extra may leave you with a very salty steak."

Olive oil is a great choice, but vegetable, peanut, or canola oil will all work as well. Add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of the oil to the jug of a blender. [16] X Research source If you don’t have a blender, you can make your marinade in a small bowl. Make sure you cut all of your ingredients very finely and mix them together well."

      "content": "Add 3 to 4 tablespoons (45-60ml) of vinegar. The acidity of the vinegar will help break down the steak to make it more tender. Red wine vinegar will complement the meat well, but you could also use apple cider or white vinegar if you prefer. Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) of vinegar to the oil, or 4 tablespoons (60ml) if you want a stronger marinade. The most important part of the vinegar in this context is its acidity, so you can use anything acidic in its place. The juice of a lemon or lime could also work fantastically and provide a slightly fresher flavor."

      "content": "Mix in any herbs and spices you like. With the base of the marinade made, you can add in whichever other flavors you want. Try adding in 1/2 teaspoon (2g) of salt, 1 tablespoon (4g) of dried thyme, 3 cloves of peeled garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5g) of ground red pepper for a simple yet delicious marinade. If you are using a blender, you don’t need to cut up the herbs or garlic as they will be finely chopped as the marinade is blended. If you are working by hand, mince the garlic and chop any herbs you want to add very finely. The flavors you add to your marinade are entirely up to you. Garlic, rosemary, thyme, paprika, and red pepper will all go great with a classic steak. See what other flavor combinations you can come up with!"

Seal the bag firmly and use your hands to massage the steak slightly, so as to make sure the marinade is covering all of the meat. [18] X Research source If you do not have or don’t want to use a zip-lock bag, you can put your steak in a small bowl and cover it with the marinade. You may need to turn the steak over as you let it marinate to make sure all sides are evenly coated."

      "content": "Let the round steak marinate for at least 2 hours in the fridge. Put the zip-lock bag with your marinade and steak into the refrigerator for at least two hours to begin marinating. The acid in the vinegar will start eating into the meat, breaking it down and tenderizing it while adding more flavor. [19] X Research source You can leave your steak in the marinade for longer to give it more flavor. However, if left too long, the acid will break down the steak too much and ruin the structure of it. Don’t leave the steak marinating for more than 6 hours."
