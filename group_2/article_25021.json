      "content": "Don’t share toothbrushes because you might get sick. When you share a toothbrush, you are also sharing bodily fluids and germs, which might lead to an infection. While the risk of getting sick is low, it’s best to play it safe. Get your own toothbrush and don’t share it with anyone. Keep extra toothbrushes in your home in case someone needs to borrow one. That way you can provide them their own toothbrush instead of sharing yours."

      "content": "Stand your toothbrush upright in an open container so it can air dry. It’s important for air to circulate around your toothbrush so it dries quickly.

      "content": "Keep individual toothbrushes separate from each other. It’s okay to store more than one toothbrush in the same holder, so don’t worry about getting each household member their own toothbrush cup. However, make sure the toothbrushes aren’t touching each other. If they do, bacteria and bodily fluids might transfer from one toothbrush to another. If you’re using a holder made for toothbrushes, you probably won’t have to worry about this. Most toothbrush holders are designed to angle the toothbrushes away from each other."

For instance, you might change out your toothbrush the first day of January, April, July, and October. If you have an electric toothbrush, you just need to replace the head."
