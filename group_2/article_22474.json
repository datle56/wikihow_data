Allow your friend to open up to you when they’re ready, and let them know that you truly want to know how they’re feeling. When they do share their experience with you, focus on listening without any judgment. [1] X Research source Don’t pressure your friend into sharing. Just let them know that you are willing to listen when they’re ready, and give them time. Actively listen to your friend. Nod and react appropriately when they speak, and try echoing what they’ve said now and then during the conversation to let them know you’re paying attention. Focus on being understanding, validating their experience, and showing them empathy , rather than trying to jump in and “fix” things. [2] X Research source Try not to offer any unsolicited advice or opinions. Remember, this isn’t something they can simply “get over”—it’s a serious mental health condition that will take time to heal.

      "content": "Encourage your friend and give them positive reinforcement. When someone is suffering with depression, they might be very self-critical, and they may even feel worthless. To help them through this, offer them words of support and remind them of all their positive qualities. Tell them how much they mean to you and the other people in their life. [4] X Research source Point out your friend’s strengths and accomplishments to help build them up. For example, you could say, “You are such a gifted artist. I really admire your talent.” Or, “I think it is so amazing that you have raised three wonderful children on your own. Not everyone has that kind of strength.” Give your friend hope by reminding them that the way they are feeling is temporary. People who suffer from depression often feel like things will never get better, but you can remind them that this is not the case. Say something like, “You may not believe it now, but the way that you are feeling will change.” [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

You could also offer to go to the grocery store and do your shopping together. This helps them with a task they're struggling with, and it’s also a way to spend time together.

Don’t be discouraged or feel inadequate if your friend does not laugh. Depression can make it hard to feel anything at all, even good things, but this will hopefully get better with time."
