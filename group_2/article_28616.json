      "title": "Measure the dimensions for your bed.",
      "content": "Measure the dimensions for your bed. To determine how large you can make your platform, measure the area that you intend to put it. Decide if you want your back seats up or down to fit the platform, and measure the length and width of your configuration. [1] X Research source Remember that vertical height will be important, too. Generally speaking, you should plan on your platform being eight to ten inches above the base on which it sits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather the materials you’re going to use.",
      "content": "Gather the materials you’re going to use. For the base, use sheets of ¾ inch (2 cm) or 1 inch (2.5 cm) plywood . Make the legs out of 2 by 4s if you need legs at all (if your seats in the back go down, just put the plywood on top). Also, acquire wood screws , a drill , any soft and flat material (like carpet or yoga mats), and staples. [2] X Research source Have the plywood sheet cut to fit the dimensions you measured. If you’d like, cut the large sheet in half widthwise with a circular saw so that your platform can be stored in stackable sections. Cut the 2 by 4s to match the height from the plywood (where it overhangs) to the floor of the car. You can cut as many legs as you need based on how much overhang you have."

      "title": "Assemble the legs and attach them to the plywood.",
      "content": "Assemble the legs and attach them to the plywood. Make the legs by aligning a short section of 2-by-4 to either end of a long 2-by-4 piece. Make sure the legs are level with the support, then use 4- or 5-inch (10 to 13 cm) wood screws to secure the legs directly to the support. [3] X Research source Opt to use at least two screws for each individual foot. Repeat this process until you have the legs you need. Skip this part if you aren’t using any legs."

    {
      "title": "Cover the platform with your soft material.",
      "content": "Cover the platform with your soft material. Use carpet, fabric, a tarp, or whatever covering you think is appropriate to cover your platform. Staple your cover down along the edges of your platform using carpet tacks or industrial staples if you’re worried about it moving around while you sleep. [4] X Research source Try to staple the cover to the outer edges of the platform for maximum comfort. Put some of the soft material on the underside of the plywood, too. This way, the wood won’t scratch your car’s interior up."

      "title": "Reassemble the platform whenever you need to sleep.",
      "content": "Reassemble the platform whenever you need to sleep. The platform can be stored in 2 separate pieces whenever you are not using it. To assemble it, simply unstack the 2 pieces and set them up so that one sits directly in front of the other in the back of your car. To help the platform hold together a bit, consider adding a hook-and-loop fastener edge where the 2 pieces of platform attach."

      "title": "Outfit your bed with comfy blankets and pillows.",
      "content": "Outfit your bed with comfy blankets and pillows. Once you have your two platforms ready and in position, decide how you want to outfit your bed. You may want to use sleeping pads, an air mattress, blankets, or another form of cushioning to keep you off the hard surface. Prepare yourself with any pillows, sheets, and blankets you might want, as well. The sleeping platform can be outfitted however you want. Choose a setup that is comfortable for you when you're sleeping, and easy to store when you have the platform packed away."

      "content": "Recline your car's seats as far back as they go. Sit in the passenger side if you want a little bit more room (the steering wheel won’t be in your way). Push and recline the seats as far back as possible. You may be able to recline a seat further by tilting the front edge up (if your car has this adjustment) and by sliding it forward so that it is blocked by the back seat bottom as little as possible. [5] X Research source Clear out everything on your back seats as well as the floor of your car. This will help maximize the amount of recline you get from your seat."

      "content": "Create a makeshift mattress with soft materials. Use what you have to create a soft, cushioned surface for you to lie down on. A yoga mat, towels, or blankets work best if you have them available. If not, you can use a jacket or spare clothing. [6] X Research source If you do not have anything to use as padding while you sleep, that is alright. You won’t do any excessive damage to your car by sleeping directly on the seat. Your back and neck might hurt a bit if you sleep on the seat multiple days in a row, though."

      "title": "Grab a pillow or substitute something soft.",
      "content": "Grab a pillow or substitute something soft. If you have a pillow available, place it at the head of your seat. Travel pillows and inflatable pillows work well for these types of situations. If you don’t have an actual pillow, ball up a towel, coat, or bundle of clothes."

      "content": "Cover yourself to stay warm at night. Your car isn’t climate-controlled and insulated the same way as a normal bedroom. Keep yourself protected from low temperatures at night by covering yourself with a blanket. If you do not have a blanket available, try to use excess clothes such as a warm jacket as a cover. If you are facing cold temperatures, layer on clothes and cover yourself. Wear a jacket as necessary for warmth and keep on accessories such as gloves and hats. Sleeping when it’s hot out? Crack your windows. If you find the heat building up, cover your windows with something dark and open the doors if necessary."

      "title": "Cover your windows for privacy and protection.",
      "content": "Cover your windows for privacy and protection. For added privacy and additional insulation, cover your car windows. If you have additional clothing or towels available, this will work well. Otherwise, use papers, maps, bags, or anything else you have available. If you can, prop or tape the items to your window. If they will not stay that way, roll the edge of the item up in the window. If you have a windshield cover, put it up for additional privacy while you sleep. Do remember to crack a window if there’s more than one person in the car, though. This ensures enough air for both of you."

      "content": "Purchase a rear-seat mattress for your car. Order or purchase one before your planned trip (or to keep as an emergency precaution in your trunk). Just make sure you measure the dimensions of your back seat and cross-check the measurement with the product before you buy. Most mattresses are sized to fit either subcompact and compact cars or SUVs and minivans."

      "title": "Clear out your back seat.",
      "content": "Clear out your back seat. When you are ready to use your air mattress, start by cleaning out your back seat. You will need the seat itself as well as the floor below to be clear so that the mattress can sit flat. Move items to the trunk that will not properly fit elsewhere."

    {
      "title": "Inflate the mattress",
      "content": "Inflate the mattress . Use a battery-powered air pump to inflate the mattress quickly (the hand-pumped varieties will take super long). If you don’t have a pump available, manually inflate the mattress. It will take a while, but it’ll be worth it for a good night’s rest. Find the air valve and either connect your pump or blow directly into the valve. Make sure all other air release valves are closed before you start inflating."

      "title": "Dress the bed with pillows and blankets.",
      "content": "Dress the bed with pillows and blankets. Many inflatable mattresses also come with inflatable travel pillows, but any pillow or blanket that keeps you comfortable will work. Add pillows and blankets to your bed setup so that you are comfortable while you sleep. [7] X Research source If possible, put a layer between you and the mattress. The tops of these mattresses tend to not be very soft. Place a layer between you and the mattress for comfort. If you do not have a pillow and blanket available, use towels, jackets, extra clothes, and whatever else you have available to cover yourself and keep yourself warm. Roll a jacket or a shirt to act as a makeshift pillow if one is not readily available for you."

      "content": "Get some sleep. Once your bed is made, you are ready to get some sleep. When you wake up, break down your bed by taking off all of the dressings, opening the air release valve, and gently rolling the air out of the bed. Store your mattress in your trunk, under your seats, or wherever else you have room. If you know that you will be using the mattress again within the next day or so, consider leaving it inflated so that it is ready to use again."
