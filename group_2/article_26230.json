However, you can still sign out by offloading the app. Use this option to keep your chats and settings. Offloading temporarily removes the app from your iPhone or iPad until you're ready to use it again—at that point, you can quickly reload the app without even having to sign back in again. To offload LINE: Open your iPhone or iPad's Settings app, which is the gray gear icon on the home screen. Tap General . Tap iPhone Storage or iPad Storage . Scroll down and tap LINE . It may take a moment for it to appear. If you don’t see it in the list of apps, tap Show All . Tap Offload App , and then tap it again to confirm. Once the app is offloaded, its icon will remain on your home screen with a cloud icon beneath it. Tapping the icon will re-download the app. Once the app is reinstalled, re-opening it will log you back in, and all of your settings and chats will remain in place."
