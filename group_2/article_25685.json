      "title": "Know the differences between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese have many differences.",
      "content": "Know the differences between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese have many differences. [3] X Research source The most obvious difference is in the words. In Simplified Chinese, words look \"simplified\" and easier to write. In Traditional Chinese, words can look more complicated. For example, 媽 and 妈 both mean \"mom\" or \"mother\". \"媽\" is Traditional Chinese, whereas \"妈\" is Simplified Chinese. Other words that are written differently are 語 and 语 (language), 個 and 个 (one of something), and 綿 and 绵 (soft). The second difference is where they're used. Simplified Chinese is mostly used in mainland China, Singapore, and Chinese-speaking Malaysians. Traditional Chinese is used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. The third difference is how long each type of writing existed. Simplified Chinese was invented recently, around the 1960s when China wanted its Chinese literacy rates to go up. They made many words simplified, hoping people would understand the words faster. Traditional Chinese likely existed since the early Chinese dynasties. [4] X Research source Another difference is how the Chinese words are written. Simplified Chinese uses Hanyu Pinyin, or Pinyin for short. Traditional Chinese uses Bopomofo, or Zhuyin. Simplified Chinese uses Pinyin, which are English letters used to write Chinese. Traditional Chinese uses Zhuyin, which are symbols used to write Chinese. A last difference is how Pinyin and Zhuyin are written. Zhuyin works when you are writing words by hand. Traditionally, Zhuyin is written vertically on paper. Chinese words are traditionally written from up to down. You can type Zhuyin on the computer, although it may be hard to read. Pinyin can work easily on computers, as it uses the English alphabet. It can be written horizontally from left to right like English."

      "title": "Learn how Bopomofo can help you learn different languages.",
      "content": "Learn how Bopomofo can help you learn different languages. The Bopomofo system is based on sounds, but it can still help you with many other languages. For example, many sounds in English correspond to Bopomofo sounds. ㄅ and b, ㄆ and p, and many more letters correspond to the English alphabet. If you know one of the languages, it will be easy for you to learn the other. Putting Bopomofo/Zhuyin letters together allows you to make many Traditional Chinese characters. Traditional Chinese characters are used in Japanese kanji. Kanji Chinese words sounds similar to original Chinese words, so it won't be too difficult to learn Japanese if you already know Traditional Chinese. The words also have the same meaning in both Japanese Kanji and Traditional Chinese, so you will already know the meanings of many words in kanji. You will also be able to understand Simplified Chinese characters. Simplified Chinese characters look similar to Traditional Chinese characters, except that many parts of the word are cancelled out or written in less strokes. If you know the complicated version (Traditional Chinese) of the word, you will understand Simplified Chinese easier. For example, 見 and 见 look very similar, except that there are a few lines missing."

      "content": "If you have a background from Taiwan, Macau, or Hong Kong, you can study traditional characters because you have family ties to the language. A second language learner starting to learn Chinese may learn the traditional characters slowly and get frustrated. Start with simplified unless you have a strong family tie or a strong interest in learning. For example, if you major in Chinese history or East Asian Studies."
