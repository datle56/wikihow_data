      "content": "Cut 4 matching rectangles out of cardstock for the card base. Each rectangle should measure 6 in (15 cm) long by 3 in (7.6 cm) wide. Use a ruler and pencil to mark out the 4 rectangles onto a stiff piece of cardstock. Cut along the edges with a paper cutter to get perfectly straight lines. [1] X Research source Opt for a medium to heavy weight cardstock. Choose a neutral color such as white or cream, or use something more colorful for the base. Either way, cut all 4 pieces out of the same cardstock to enhance the never-ending illusion."

      "content": "Score all 4 rectangles 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) in from the short edges. Working with 1 rectangle at a time, lay the cardstock piece on a scoring board. Position the short end parallel to the scoring channels. Use a bone folder or another scoring tool to create a straight score line. Do this once along the left side, 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) in from the short edge. Score another line on the right side, 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) away from the short edge. [2] X Research source Repeat this process to score all 4 card base pieces. Once you’re finished, each rectangle will be divided into thirds, with a square in the center and narrow rectangles on either side. If you don’t have a scoring board, use a ruler to guide your scoring marks. [3] X Research source A bone folder is the best tool for creating a crisp indentation that will fold easily. If you don’t have one, use the blunt side of a butter knife to score the cardstock. [4] X Research source"

Rotate a piece of cardstock 90 degrees on the scoring board, so that its long end lines up with the scoring channels. Use the bone fold to score down the center of the cardstock, from the top edge until you reach the previous score line. Repeat this process for the other side of the rectangle. [5] X Research source Repeat this process for all 4 pieces. On each piece of cardstock, you should now have a perpendicular score mark placed 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) in from either side, which stops when it touches the crosswise score mark. After the scoring is complete, each rectangle will be divided into a large central square with 2 small squares stacked together on the left and right sides."

Take the fourth cardstock rectangle and align its long edge with the bottom half of the large square. The fourth piece of cardstock should meet the third piece in the middle. Their long edges will be running perpendicular to long edges of the first 2 pieces of cardstock. Make sure the pieces don’t overlap where they meet along the long edges. They should just touch.

Press along the fold line with the side of a bone folder or your fingernail to create a crease. [10] X Research source The top cardstock pieces will fold back on themselves and the under layer will be revealed. Now your large square will be divided into 3 parts horizontally, with a narrower top and bottom band and a thicker rectangle in the middle. If you added a piece of tape to hold the cardstock together, remove it once it’s exposed."

Crease these folds as well. [14] X Research source You’ll now have 3 parallel creases dividing the paper into 4 narrow rectangles. Don’t fold the cardstock in half lengthwise and then in half crosswise. This won’t give you the right shape for the crease lines."

[16] X Research source Be sure to crease these new folds with a bone folder or your fingernail.

As you invert the bottom-left square, raise the paper from the bottom side over the piece from the left side.

Once your card base is completely assembled and the fold lines are creased, start testing out the assembly and never-ending unfolding patterns. Try repeating the unfolding sequence a few times to make the card a little easier to operate. You’ll notice that, although it’s called a never-ending card, it actually has 4 different views. Open the 4-piece card by lifting the flaps from the middle and folding them to the back of the card to expose a new layer of cardstock. [20] X Research source With a 4-piece card base, the first view is made up of the first 2 pieces of cardstock that you placed side by side to form a large square. The second and third views are also square, and the fourth view is plus-shaped. To open a folded 1-piece card base, instead of opening both left and right flaps to reveal the new view, simply re-fold the card in half, turning both sides away from you. This will allow you to unfold it along a new crease to reveal a new view."

While it can be fun to add decorations directly onto the card base, you can spruce up your card by adding a layer of contrasting paper to the panels in each card view. Choose a different color from the card base, or try a patterned paper for these decorative panels. Feel free to use medium to lightweight cardstock or lightweight scrapbook paper. To create decorative panels for a 4-piece card base, cut 8 squares measuring 2 3 ⁄ 4 in (7.0 cm) by 2 3 ⁄ 4 in (7.0 cm) each, which will be used to decorate the large square sections on the card. For the smaller side panels, cut out 4 rectangles measuring 2 3 ⁄ 4 in (7.0 cm) by 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (3.2 cm) and 16 small squares measuring 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (3.2 cm) by 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (3.2 cm). [21] X Research source To make decorative panels for the 1-piece card base, cut out 16 1 3 ⁄ 4 in (4.4 cm) by 1 3 ⁄ 4 in (4.4 cm) square pieces."

As you open the card to each view, you’ll be able to see where the large squares, small squares, and rectangles should go. Each piece of decorative paper will sit within your score lines and creases so that the unfolding pattern isn’t obstructed by another layer of paper. While you can use white craft glue, a glue stick or double-sided tape will be quicker. [22] X Research source With the 4-piece card base, begin with the first view, which has your first 2 pieces of cardstock sitting side by side. Glue 2 large squares and 4 rectangles onto the middle and outside panels. Then glue 2 large squares and 8 small squares onto the panels you see within the second view. In the third view, glue 2 large squares to the center panels and affix 4 small squares to the corners. When you get to the plus-shaped fourth view, glue on the last 2 large squares and the last 4 small squares. For a 1-piece card base, since all of the square sections are the same size, you can simply glue 4 squares onto each 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) view."

With your never-ending card fully constructed and enhanced with decorative paper on each panel, you’re ready to start personalizing and embellishing your card. Add whatever decorations you choose to each of the panels. Feel free to use stickers, die-cuts, photographs, and stamps or create your own illustrations, doodles, and collages. Sign off with a handwritten note, either hidden in one of the views or spread across all 4. [23] X Research source It’s fine to have flat decorations, like drawings or stamped designs, go past the fold lines. Just don’t place any layers of paper or raised decorations over the fold lines. For a 1-piece card, it can be fun to add one motif, like a heart cutout, across the whole view. Just make sure you cut the motif into 4 quarters so you can still unfold the card. [24] X Research source Keep in mind that with a 4-piece card, the large squares in the fourth view will also be partly visible in the third view. You may want to design your decorations for the top of the upper square and the bottom of the lower square with this in mind. [25] X Research source"
