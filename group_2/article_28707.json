      "content": "Put a CD or DVD at the top of the paper. Lay a piece of paper in front of you in the portrait position. The short sides should be at the top and bottom. Then, place your CD, or DVD, at the top of the paper. As it's in the portrait position, the top side will be shorter. Align the top of the disk with the top edge. [1] X Research source This step determines the size of the sleeve."

      "content": "Fold the vertical sides inwards. Keep the disk where it is. Fold the right vertical side of the paper to the center of the disk. Then, fold the left side to the center too. Fold the paper as if you were trying to wrap the disk inside. [2] X Research source The folds won't cover the entirety of the disk."

      "content": "Remove the disk and crease the vertical edges. Take the disk out, making sure not to disrupt the folds. Crease the edges so they're flat and defined once the disk is removed. The paper should be able to hold its shape on its own. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the disk in the center of the paper and fold the bottom side upwards. Put the disk back on top of the paper so that it sits on the folds. Bend the bottom horizontal edge up to the disk in the center. The top of this fold should extend just above the central hole of the disk. Remove the disk once you're finished. [4] X Research source Make the fold stronger by creasing it with your thumb, making the edge flat and defined."

Grab the top left corner of the paper and fold it down to the lower edge, approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the bottom right corner. This is your first fold.
