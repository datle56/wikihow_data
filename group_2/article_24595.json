      "content": "Learn about the different opportunities with NASA. When you think of NASA, your first thought is probably of astronauts; if going to space doesn't sound so appealing to you, you may nonetheless find a rewarding career with NASA. Just a few of the professionals that NASA employs are as follows: Medical doctors, nurses, and mental health care professionals. Researchers, engineers, geologists, microbiologists, and physicists. Writers, human resource specialists, and communications professionals. Computer programmers and IT specialists."

      "content": "Identify your academic talents. If you'd like to start down the path towards working for NASA, it will help to think about what you're good at as early as possible. This will help you begin to formulate an idea of the position at NASA that would be the best fit for you. Think about the following: What subjects do you excel in at school? For example, if everyone wants to be your lab partner in physics class, then you may want to think about a future career in applied physics with NASA."

Meet regularly with your academic advisor to make sure you're taking the right courses, and the right number of them. Particularly if you want to be an astronaut, an engineer, or a scientist with NASA, you should choose a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) centered education path.
