      "content": "Begin with unwashed hair. While you can wear a ponytail with freshly-washed locks, this style is great for second or third-day hair—even if you're aiming to create a dressy, polished look. You'll have fewer fly-aways, and the natural grease that comes from not shampooing will help hold your style and give you a bit of shine. [1] X Research source Don't fear if you decide you want to wear your hair in a ponytail and have just shampooed: you can still style your hair into a polished ponytail, but may you need to use additional product to get the volume and texture you want."

      "title": "Use thickening spray or dry shampoo before you begin.",
      "content": "Use thickening spray or dry shampoo before you begin. Spray on a bit of thickening spray or a little dry shampoo, focusing upon the roots of your hair. This will give you more volume and hold. [2] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. If you don't have either of these products on hand, baby-powder can work in a pinch. Sprinkle a small amount into your palm and massage into the roots of your hair. The baby-powder will help absorb excess oil and will add texture and lift to your roots. Be sure to thoroughly brush the powder out, though, so that you won't have white or grey streaks throughout your ponytail. You can even make your own dry shampoo at home. If you have darker hair, add a bit of cocoa powder to darken the final product—be prepared to develop a sudden craving for brownies, though!"

      "title": "Curl your hair.",
      "content": "Curl your hair. Use a curling iron to create soft curls or waves (curl your hair in 2-inch sections). Your curls will last longer if you lightly spritz the sections with hair spray before curling, or if you run a small amount of gel or mousse throughout your hair before you curl. Alternatively, you can set all of your hair in hot rollers. Leave them in until they are fully cooled. If you have longer hair, you can pile your hair high on the crown of your head, place into a ponytail, and then add rollers. This won't be your final ponytail, but is a way for you to curl your hair more quickly and efficiently. However, you won't get as much volume at your roots as you would if you curled your hair normally. Once your curls (or rollers) have cooled completely, loosely comb through your hair with your fingers. Don't use a comb or brush, or the curls will relax too much. You can speed up the cooling process by quickly blasting your hair with cool air from your blowdryer (if yours has that setting) to help your curls set. Avoid curling your hair too often, as using too much heat can damage your hair. [3] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020."

Do this carefully, so as not to brush out your curls and volume. For a classic ponytail look, center the ponytail midway between your crown and the nape of your neck (it should be level with the tops of your ears). [4] X Research source"

For a natural look, go with your natural part. If you'd like a bit more volume at the top of your head, part your hair on the opposite side. A good guide is to begin your part at the highest point of the arch in your eyebrow. [6] X Research source"

Even if you have washed recently, though, you are aiming for tousled or wavy hair. An easy way to get soft, unfussy waves is to braid or twirl your slightly damp hair into a bun and sleep on it. This will require a bit of planning ahead, but can save you precious time in the morning and sets you up for a simple and quick styling session in the morning."

Use the tips of your brush bristles to smooth down the front of the teased section, using gentle motions. The bottom half of your hair will be hanging down. Gather the rest of your hair and pull it into a ponytail as well, directly underneath the top ponytail. Divide the lower ponytail in half and pull the ends in opposite directions to move the ponytail up and tighten it. After you secure your hair, cover the elastic with a piece of hair.

From the underside of the ponytail, reach up through the opening you've created, grab the entire ponytail, and pull it up and through the opening. You can also wear this style in a half-ponytail. Gather only the top portion of your hair into a ponytail and flip it through, leaving the bottom half of your hair hanging down."

      "content": "Wear pigtails. Divide your hair into two sections by parting your hair down the middle of your head, and create a ponytail on each side. The position and placement of your pigtails can vary according to your preference: experiment with low, loose pigtails (situated low behind your ears), or high, tight pigtails (situated above your ears). Classic pigtails are symmetrical (the same amount of hair gathered on each side). This playful style works well for shorter hair that can't be pulled all the way back. Experiment with a straight centered part, but don't be afraid to try a funkier zigzag part, too."

Straighten your ponytail with a flat iron if you have straight (or mostly straight) hair; this will make your strands even more sleek and shiny. For wavy or curly hair, use a cream to define and separate your curls."
