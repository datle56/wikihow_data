      "content": "Gather your supplies. You will need at least 4 12 in (30 cm) cleaners, and assorted beads in at least 6 colors. Plastic pony beads work best for this project, although you can use any kind of beads that have a hole wide enough to fit over the pipe cleaners. Each of the 2 pairs of pipe cleaners should be a different color, giving you 4 total pipe cleaners preferably black and orange. One pair will be the phosphate and the other pair will be the deoxyribose."

Use 2 different colors of beads to represent the sugar and phosphate groups, and bead them in alternating colors down each of the full-length pipe cleaners. Be sure that the 2 long strands that form the double helix match up, so that the beads are in the same order. Leave about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between each bead to allow room to attach the other pieces of pipe cleaner."

[2] X Research source Place 1 bead from each pair at the ends of the 2 in (5.1 cm) sections of pipe cleaners. Leave a little room at the ends to wrap around the double helix strands.

Space each small piece so they are always attached above a bead of the same color on the side. You should be skipping every-other bead on the double helix strands.

You could choose to have one of the colors be white, so that you don't have to paint some of the styrofoam.

There should be more sugar balls than phosphate balls. Make sure that the 2 strands of sugar and phosphate are in the same order, so that they line up when placed next to each other.

You cannot mix colors between pairs. For example, you cannot combine T--G or A--C. The colors you choose are completely arbitrary and are entirely based on personal preference."
