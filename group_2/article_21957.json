      "title": "Select a cinnamon tree that’s at least 2 years old.",
      "content": "Select a cinnamon tree that’s at least 2 years old. It's best to harvest cinnamon from a tree that's at least 2 years old—once the tree is 2 years old it's often cut back down so that it will grow even more shoots. If you're not sure how old the tree is, you may need to ask someone who's familiar with the environment. [1] X Research source After 2 years, you can grow more shoots by cutting the tree back down to a stump and covering it with soil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait until after a heavy rain to harvest cinnamon easily.",
      "content": "Wait until after a heavy rain to harvest cinnamon easily. The rain will help soften the bark of the tree, making it easier to remove the outermost layer. You can harvest the cinnamon any time throughout the year, but waiting until after rainfall will make the process easier. Most people harvest the cinnamon about twice a year, so try not to harvest it more than that to keep the tree healthy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off the branches of the tree using a saw.",
      "content": "Cut off the branches of the tree using a saw. You can use a handsaw or a chainsaw, depending on the size of the tree and its branches. Carefully cut off a few branches to harvest a smaller amount of cinnamon, or use a chainsaw to cut the entire tree down. It’s okay if you cut down the entire tree, as the stump will regenerate and an even fuller tree will grow within a few years. Try to choose branches with a diameter of 1.2–5 centimetres (0.47–1.97 in)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Score the cinnamon layer into 3 in (7.6 cm) sections.",
      "content": "Score the cinnamon layer into 3 in (7.6 cm) sections. This will make it easier to work with the cinnamon. Use a knife to carefully cut around the diameter of the branch. When scoring, try to cut the cinnamon into 3 in (7.6 cm) sections along the branch. [2] X Research source Be careful not to cut all the way through the branch—you want to only score the cinnamon so that it becomes loose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a paint scraper or similar tool to scrape off the cinnamon in sheets.",
      "content": "Use a paint scraper or similar tool to scrape off the cinnamon in sheets. Start at one end of the scored line and scrape upwards to remove the reddish-brown cinnamon. Go slowly using a paint scraper and try to remove the cinnamon in solid sheets. [3] X Research source If the cinnamon crumbles as you peel it off, this is okay too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean off the cinnamon to remove the tree’s inner core.",
      "content": "Clean off the cinnamon to remove the tree’s inner core. When you scrape the cinnamon off, it may have part of the inner core attached to it still. Carefully use a knife or paint scraper to scratch off the inner core. [4] X Research source The tree’s inner core isn’t edible, which is why it must be removed. The inner core will be lighter in color than the cinnamon and very easy to distinguish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the cinnamon dry in a clean, warm environment.",
      "content": "Let the cinnamon dry in a clean, warm environment. Lay each piece of cinnamon out on a kitchen counter or similar surface to let it dry. You can lay down plastic or paper towels under the cinnamon, if desired. [5] X Research source Try to let the cinnamon dry in a single layer, if possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait 4-5 days for the cinnamon to dry.",
      "content": "Wait 4-5 days for the cinnamon to dry. As the cinnamon dries, it will curl up into little scroll-like forms. If you're not sure whether the cinnamon is dry or not, wait at least 5 days to be certain. You can break the pieces up after the cinnamon dries."

    {
      "title": "Grind the cinnamon into a powder or leave it rolled up.",
      "content": "Grind the cinnamon into a powder or leave it rolled up. If you scraped off tiny scraps of cinnamon, put the scraps into a coffee grinder to turn the cinnamon into a powder. You can leave longer scrolls of curled up cinnamon as they are and use them for drinks or recipes. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Store the cinnamon in a cool, dry place.",
      "content": "Store the cinnamon in a cool, dry place. Choose a spot on your shelves or in the pantry to keep the cinnamon out of hot, moist environments. Put the cinnamon in sealed containers to help it stay fresh. [7] X Research source Place cinnamon in glass jars or plastic containers to preserve its taste and smell. Cinnamon will last 2-3 years when stored in a sealed container, though it may begin to lose its strong flavor and scent as time goes on."
