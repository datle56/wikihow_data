If your friend's name is grayed out and it says \"Already owns this item\" next to their name, you won't be able to send them that game as a gift. There's a regional restriction: Certain games can't be gifted to users living in certain regions. If there's a regional restriction on a game, it will be noted on the game's store page. [2] X Research source Your friend doesn't own the DLC's base game: If you are sending DLC as a gift, the recipient must already own the base game. You're trying to gift a bundle: Certain bundles cannot be gifted because they are created specifically for your account. You're trying to gift a multipack: Sometimes, multiplayer games are sold in multipacks of 2, 3, or 4. You cannot gift the multipack, but if you purchase the multipack, you will be prompted to select other Steam users to get the extra copies of the game as a gift. The game can't be gifted: Although rare, some Steam games can't be sent as gifts."
