      "content": "Gather your materials. To make your lips look bigger using makeup you’ll need a lipliner or lip crayon; a lipstick or lip crayon that is the same color as the lipliner, but a shade lighter; a lip gloss; a highlighting balm or powder; and a lip exfoliator (a toothbrush will do). For a more natural look, use two nude shades of lipliner and lipstick; for a more dramatic look, use vibrant reds or pinks. Dramatic colors will immediately make your lips look fuller and more prominent. Some makeup manufacturers sell double-sided lip crayons in complementary shades of the same color. These are great options. You may find that matte lipsticks and crayons are easier to work with, particularly when going for a naturally bigger lip."

Some dermatologists advise against exfoliating one’s lips, as this can cause them to become dry and chapped over time. Exfoliating your lips is fine to do once in a while if your lips are flakey and you need to wear lipstick (for example, if you’re going somewhere formal); just avoid it whenever you can!"

Even if your lips are not chapped, consider using a lip moisturizer that contains an SPF to protect your lips from the sun’s damaging rays. If your lips are sensitive, it may take some trial and error to find a lip balm that works for you. Some people use natural balms containing ingredients like coconut oil and honey, while others find that medicated balms containing menthol are best. Unless your lips are already well-hydrated, avoid beeswax lip balms. Beeswax lip balms are too heavy to actually impart moisture to your lips; they can only seal in the moisture that’s already there."

Dermatologists warn that wearing lip gloss without an SPF can do more than damage your lips: it can actually cause skin cancer."

[17] X Research source Augmentation is a relatively quick procedure that can be completed in your doctor’s office with little to no downtime: Your lips will likely be numbed before the injections. The doctor will then mark the areas that he/she will inject before injecting them with fine needles. After the injections, ice may be applied to ease discomfort and swelling. You’ll need to avoid putting any products on your lips immediately after the procedure. Ask your doctor for advice on what’s okay to put on your lips, and when.

More serious side effects include severe and prolonged swelling and bruising lasting longer than a week; lip asymmetry; lumps and irregularities in the lips; infections; and ulcers and scarring that can cause the lips to become stiff.
