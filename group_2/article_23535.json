      "content": "Choose a location for your date. First, ask her if she wants to choose the setting, in case she already has an idea about what she’d like to do. Plan ahead for where you’ll go. Keep in mind that your preparation shows your interest level. When selecting a location, look for places you’ll have the chance to talk and find out more about each other. You can also arrange multiple places to go on a single date, if desired. [1] X Research source Try asking, “Do you have anyplace specific in mind, or would you rather be surprised?” For instance, you might choose to go to an aquarium followed by a restaurant that isn’t too casual. Other ideas are ice skating, bringing a picnic lunch to a park, or a city walking tour. Avoid places like the cinema, concerts and clubs, where you’ll have to compete with the noise level and energy. [2] X Research source If you’re going out to eat, ask her what type of food she likes first, and don’t wait until the date to pick a restaurant. Choose a place, make reservations, and let your date know whether she should dress formally or casually. Avoid choosing a noisy place like a sports bar, where you won’t be able to hear each other well. [3] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 658 wikiHow readers, and 50% of them agreed that a coffee shop is the best place to have a first date. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Clean your car, if applicable. If you’re going to drive on the date, take some time beforehand to throw away any trash in your car. You may want to vacuum your car out as well, especially if you have pets or it’s been a while since you vacuumed your car’s interior. Wipe down any dusty interior surfaces. [4] X Research source Bonus points if you get a car wash, place a well-concealed air freshener in your car, and keep gum and/or mints in your console!"

      "content": "Have topics of conversation in mind. You may not need to use them, but it’s good to have some ideas prepared ahead of time in case you find yourself at a loss for words. Think of questions that are open-ended, so they can start conversation rather than inviting simple “yes” or “no” answers. Try asking, “Do you like to travel? Where would you most like to go?” Discussing dream travel destinations makes people feel good and even look more attractive to each other. You could also ask her what here favorite trip is that she’s been on. [5] X Research source Some light-hearted topics you can discuss: Does she likes pets? What does she enjoy doing in her free time? Does she consider herself a morning or night person? Heavier topics you might bring up: What is she passionate about? Does she enjoy her job? What would be her dream career? Does she have a favorite memory from early childhood? Avoid asking about past relationships, family problems, politics, religion and finances."

      "content": "Consider preparing a small gift. You may want to bring flowers, candy, or something geared more towards what she likes. If you don’t know much about her, you could ask someone who knows her about some of her interests and hobbies. Put thought into it, and you’re certain to impress! The gesture is more important than how much you spend on the gift."

It doesn’t need to be too fancy, but making an effort in how you present yourself with your style does make an impact on the girl. You also want to be yourself; don’t dress totally out of character. Consider which clothes you feel good in that present your best self and make you feel attractive and confident. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Be well-groomed. Wear fresh cologne. [8] X Research source Have good dental hygiene – no bad breath! Make sure that your nails are clean and trimmed, and get a hair cut if you need one. Wear deodorant. [9] X Research source Don’t use cologne that you’ve had for longer than three years, as the oils can change and begin to smell stale. Avoid wearing both scented soap and cologne, as the smells can clash – stick with one or the other. [10] X Research source Apply cologne sparingly to the skin on your chest and neck right after you get out of the shower. Don’t put cologne on your clothes, walk through a cloud of it, or rub it in once applied. [11] X Research source Prevent bad breath by brushing your teeth, flossing, using mouthwash, and gargling with a half-teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in a small glass of water."

      "content": "Remember your wallet. If you’re driving, you’ll need your driver’s license. Bring cash or a credit card that covers more than you think you’ll need for expenses on the date. For instance, people spend an average of $80 on a date, and that number may increase for special occasions like Valentine’s Day or a first date. [12] X Research source If you live in a city where the cost of living is higher, that number can even double. Don’t plan to spend more than you can reasonably afford. Plan a budget-friendly date, if necessary, like sight-seeing."

      "content": "Relax. It’s normal to feel a little nervous on a date, but it’s important to be yourself, and your nervous self isn’t necessarily your genuine self. Calm yourself down when you’re nervous. Realize that you’ll have other dates and opportunities to impress a girl, maybe even the same girl. [13] X Research source Avoid looking nervous by staying calm and not fidgeting, tapping your foot, or biting your nails. Relax your muscles and think calmly and positively."

      "content": "Compliment your date . Don’t overload her with compliments the whole date, or you might come off as insincere. Instead, express your appreciation with genuine feeling when you first see her, and whenever else it feels natural and truthful. Avoid comments about her body or what she’s wearing. When you greet her, try saying, “You look beautiful,” before or after a kiss on the cheek. Or, focus on something about her that’s more specific, like “You have gorgeous eyes.” Compliment good features of her personality as you notice them, such as her intellect or sense of humor."

      "content": "Pay attention to her. Smile at her and make frequent eye contact. Be an active listener by nodding and showing that you’re genuinely interested in what she says. Definitely avoid staring at or showing interest in other girls during your date. For instance, don’t interrupt when she’s talking. Give her your full attention, as if you’re going to be quizzed on it later. Listening to your date is the best way you can find out what she wants and expects in a relationship."

      "content": "Act smooth when it’s time to pay the bill. Be the one who asks the waiter for the bill if you’re at a restaurant. You want to impress her, so plan to pay for the date and don’t make a show about it – in fact, if you want to earn her respect, pay it discreetly without making any mention of it. Many girls expect their date to pay, and she may be insulted if you suggest that she pays half. [15] X Research source Don’t say anything to her about the bill unless she comments on it or offers to contribute to it. If she does, try saying, “Please, allow me.” Who pays the bill is a delicate situation. A girl may offer to pay towards the bill, but be annoyed if you take her up on it. However, if your date sincerely insists on paying, don’t refuse to allow her to contribute to the bill, either. Use your best judgment."

      "content": "Say goodbye appropriately. Don’t hesitate, be fidgety, or otherwise make the parting awkward. Tell her that you’d like to see her again, if you would. Pay attention to her body language , eyes and facial expressions . If you believe she’ll be responsive to it, give her a hug and a kiss either on the cheek or the lips. Don’t break apart right away or linger too long. Try saying, “This was a great time! I’d love to see you again.” For example, if she seems put off when you go in for a hug, don’t try to follow it up with a kiss. Don’t give her a sloppy kiss! You don’t want it to be aggressive or leave slobber all over her face. Give her a soft kiss with your lips closed for a few seconds. The more gentle and tender, the better."
