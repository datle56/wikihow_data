      "content": "Do two things at once. Try to maximize the time that you have in the shower by consolidating some of your shower activities!

Once you finish washing, you can rinse the shampoo out of your hair and then apply your conditioner, then multitask in a similar way while the conditioner soaks into your hair. [7] X Research source"

Shampooing and conditioning your hair is often what takes the largest chunk of time in the shower, especially if you have particularly long hair.

These products can be equally as effective as using two separate products, and they can shave off a significant amount of time from your shower. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Never turn the water to a temperature that is too uncomfortable. Instead, turn the water from hot to lukewarm, rather than freezing."

      "content": "Don’t wash your hair every shower. If you shower every day, remember that it’s not necessary to wash your hair during every shower. In fact, most experts agree that most people do not need to wash their hair every day, and that daily washings can strip essential oils from your hair that keep your hair and scalp healthy. [10] X Research source Unless you have a very oily scalp or exercise and sweat a significant amount, you probably don’t need to wash your hair every day. Try to wash every other day instead. Not washing your hair can cut your showering time significantly, even by half. To keep your hair fresh in between washes, you can use a dry shampoo to minimize oil. Though dry shampoo can be helpful occasionally between washes, you shouldn't depend on it to take the place of actually washing your hair. [11] X Research source"

Instead of shaving while you are in the shower, consider shaving the night before. [13] X Research source To shave the night before, sit at the edge of your shower and wet your legs, underarms, or wherever else you may regularly shave with warm water. Apply shaving cream and shave carefully, adding water or shaving cream to any dry areas as needed. Shaving while sitting down can allow you to do a better and more thorough job than you might do while in the shower while you are standing."
