      "title": "Open a word processing document.",
      "content": "Open a word processing document. You can use an open source processor on Google Drive or a fresh piece of paper in a typewriter; however, formal business letters should always be typed and printed, with a signature in pen."

      "title": "Use a sheet of company letterhead if it is available.",
      "content": "Use a sheet of company letterhead if it is available. At minimum, formal letterhead includes the person's name, the name of the business, the address of the business, phone number and usually a company logo. This information takes the place of a sender's address in the body of the letter. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Start your letter with your address, if you don't have letterhead.",
      "content": "Start your letter with your address, if you don't have letterhead. Only include your street address, city, state and zip or post code on the first two lines in the upper right hand side of the page. You don't need to put your name or title, since it will be included in the closing at the bottom of the letter. [2] X Research source You may also choose to include your email address or phone number, if your letter suggests contacting you by one of those methods."
    },

      "title": "Include the date.",
      "content": "Include the date. Use a month, day and year format, such as “May 4, 2019.” You can include it two spaces below your address on the right or on the left. [3] X Research source There is a lot of variation on which side the date is written, so look for another piece of correspondence from your company to use as an example. Dates in the UK may be written with the day, month and year. For example, “4 May 2019.”"

      "title": "Type the recipient's address two lines below the date on the left side of the page.",

This is also called the “inside address” and it should include the name of the person with title, the address in US Post Office or Royal Mail format. Include the name of the company, if applicable, on a line between the person's name and the address. [4] X Research source Don't indent the address, date, salutation or paragraphs. The paragraphs in a business letter are separated by spaces and begin flush with the left hand side. If you are writing to a foreign country, type the country in all capital letters on the last line. The inside address should be approximately one inch (2.5 cm) below the date if the date is on the left hand side, or it should be one space below the date if it is on the right hand side."
