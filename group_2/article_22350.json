      "title": "Use cotton to lift the toenail.",
      "content": "Use cotton to lift the toenail. The following day soak your feet for about 20 minutes. Then, take a small piece of cotton (gauze or cotton ball) and roll it between your fingers so that it forms a cotton “tube” that is about ½ inch long. Tape one end of the cotton tube to the top of your toe. Then, gently lift the corner of the ingrown nail up a little bit with one hand. With the other hand, work the free end of the cotton tube under the corner of the nail and out the other side so that the cotton is between the skin and the nail. [4] X Research source This might be a little painful or strange at first, but it is necessary to lift the nail away from the skin to prevent it from growing deeper into the skin."

      "content": "Repeat this process for up to two weeks. Keep the cotton in place and replace it every day after soaking your foot. You will need to repeat this process for two weeks or until the toenail grows out a bit, but you should notice some improvement after a few days. If you do not notice any improvement, then call your doctor. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your shoes are too narrow, try to find some wide shoes in your size or opt for open-toed shoes when possible. High-heeled shoes may also cause ingrown toenails, so wear flats or low-heeled shoes as much as possible. Stick to plain white, cotton socks. Dyes from the fabric of colored socks may irritate an ingrown nail. If you can go without socks and wear sandals instead, then that may help your ingrown nail to heal even faster."

Your podiatrist can perform this procedure using local anesthesia, so you will not feel anything. If the problem keeps recurring, then it may be necessary to remove an entire section of the nail root to prevent future ingrown nails.
