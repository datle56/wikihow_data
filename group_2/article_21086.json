    {
      "title": "Wash the zucchini.",
      "content": "Wash the zucchini. Even if there's no visible dirt you should always wash them under fresh running water to rinse them of any pesticides or lingering bacteria. With your hand, gently rub the skin of the zucchini while holding it under water until it no longer feels gritty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim off the ends.",
      "content": "Trim off the ends. Remove both the stem end and the flower end of the zucchini with a sharp paring knife."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the seeds.",
      "content": "Remove the seeds. If the zucchini is greater than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter then the seeds may be large and bitter. If this is the case then carefully split the zucchini from end to end, lengthwise. Hold a spoon firmly in one hand and the zucchini in the other, run the tip of the spoon down the zucchini with gentle pressure to remove the seeds. If your zucchini are smaller then you're ready to grate them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select either a plank grater or a box grater.",
      "content": "Select either a plank grater or a box grater. Set the grater on a firm surface such as a cutting board. You can either grate the zucchini in a pile straight on the cutting board, or you can place a bowl under the grater to catch the grated zucchini and make your clean-up easier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose the style of grated zucchini you'd like.",
      "content": "Choose the style of grated zucchini you'd like. Most graters have both coarse and fine patches of the grating surface. Grate a bit on each to test and see what size looks right for your purposes. Some graters will have a mandoline-style slit for grating, which will result in thin sliced rounds of zucchini, appropriate for stir-fry, lasagna, or other uses in which you'd like to see the zucchini. This would probably be inappropriate for baking into zucchini bread, however."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the utensil firmly in one hand.",
      "content": "Hold the utensil firmly in one hand. With the other hand, hold the zucchini. Evenly run the zucchini up and down the coarse-holed side of the grater while pressing down firmly. A box grater will collect the zucchini inside, and you'll need to remove it in order to grate several zucchini. As the zucchini accumulates under the plank grater you can simply scoop it aside to continue grating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be careful as you get close to your fingers.",
      "content": "Be careful as you get close to your fingers. You'll have to reposition your fingers slightly as you gradually grate up the zucchini. Eventually, there won't be much left to hold. Don't try to grate it until it disappears, because you'll end up with a little fingertip in your cookies if you're not careful. If you're feeling thrifty, stab the nub of zucchini left with a fork and try to grate as much as possible with that, your fingers safely out of the way."

    {
      "title": "Set up your food processor.",
      "content": "Set up your food processor. Affix the coarsest or largest hole grating attachment, according to your food processor's directions. Make sure the appliance is clean and assembled properly before starting to grate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the zucchini.",
      "content": "Prepare the zucchini. Depending on the size of your food processor, you might want to chop your larger cleaned zucchini into some smaller pieces before you start feeding it into the food processor."

    {
      "title": "Turn the machine on and feed the zucchini into the food chute.",
      "content": "Turn the machine on and feed the zucchini into the food chute. When the receiving bowl is full, empty the contents, reattach the bowl and continue grating."
