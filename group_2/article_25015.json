[1] X Research source If your dress has a lining, you can try pinning the dress only through the lining so that the pin doesn't show on the outside at all. Make sure, though, that the lining is strong enough to support the dress! If the lining is very thin, and the dress fabric quite heavy, it may tear the lining. Alternatively, if there is no lining or you want the extra support, pin through the entire dress, but make the space between where the pin exits the fabric and then re-enters the fabric as small as possible so that it will not be too visible."

Before purchasing one, read reviews about different brands, and read the label carefully to make sure it will be suitable for the fabric of your dress. Look for tapes that are bit wider, as they will have more surface area, meaning they will stay stuck longer. Make sure you get double-sided wardrobe tape, not just double-sided tape. You need heavy tape that will adhere to your skin. [2] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020. You can find this tape on Amazon.

The tape will be sticky on both sides, and will typically have a sticker you have to remove from both sides in order to keep it sticking to everything before you’re ready to use it. Carefully apply the tape all the way around the top of the dress, as close the top edge as you can. Apply another layer below the first for extra protection, if you wish. Make sure you apply firm pressure to the tape before moving on to the next step. Line the tape on maybe four or five different sections along the top of the dress, to make sure it won't go anywhere.

You will need to use at least four pieces of boning. Two pieces will go in the front and two pieces will go in the back. Be sure to space the boning evenly! If you are sewing the boning directly onto the dress (and not using the old boning spaces), make sure you leave at least 1/4 inch of space (3 cm) at the top and at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) before the bottom of the waist. Do not sew the bottom of the boning, but leave it free (and not sewn into the dress). When sewing boning to the dress lining, make sure you do a line of stitches on the top of the boning to keep it from poking you. Be cautious when sewing, you don't want your needle to go all the way through the liner to the outer fabric!"
