      "content": "Stay connected via texting, calling, or video chatting. One of the biggest challenges of long-distance relationships is the absence of physical contact with your partner. However, just because you’re not side-by-side doesn’t mean you can’t form a real connection and keep the spark alive. Be sure to text, call, and video call each other as often as you need to help you feel connected to each other. This doesn’t mean that you have to text or call them 24/7. In fact, avoid spamming them with messages since that may make them feel a bit suffocated. Just reach out to them when you feel like talking and let the conversation flow from there. Come up with a schedule to make sure you’re contacting each other regularly. For example, save Friday evenings for FaceTiming each other."

      "content": "Ask for their advice or opinions to include them in your world. To help strengthen your bond, do little things to make your partner feel like their presence is truly valued and appreciated in your life. Ask for their opinion when you’re making a decision, go to them for advice about a problem, or even ask them for help on a project you’re working on. Long-distance relationships work when you both truly feel involved in each other’s lives. For example, even if they can’t be there to help, involve them in the conversation about what color you should paint your room. Or, ask them for honest advice if you’re having trouble at work or school. Also be sure to introduce them to your friends and family since this can help them feel even closer to you and the important people in your life."

      "content": "Quality time helps to strengthen your emotional bond. Unfortunately, unlike in a regular relationship, you can’t just hang out together or go to visit each other whenever you feel like it. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t carve out some special time to reconnect. When you spend quality time together , make sure all of your attention is on your partner and do some fun or relaxing things. For example: Have a dinner date over a video call. Put on the same movie at the same time and talk about it while you watch. Bake something together while video chatting."

      "content": "Plan times to physically be together to reaffirm your commitment. Being in a long-distance relationship doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stay long-distance for the entire time. Make time to visit each other as often as possible or as often as your budget permits. Once you meet up, go ahead and do all the things you might’ve been missing out on while communicating long-distance, such as going on dates or introducing each other to the place you live. Plan ahead for your next meetup so that you have something to look forward to. Meet away from home sometimes, too. Visit a place together that’s new to both of you, or choose a place that’s halfway between you and make a vacation out of it."

      "content": "Always be ready to give heartening words. Just because you’re not right by each other’s sides doesn’t mean you and your partner can’t cheer each other on. Send them encouraging messages throughout the day, support them when they try new things, and offer them reassurance when they have doubts. Even though you’re not together, you’re still a team, and it’s important to remind them of that whenever you can. For example, if you know they have a big presentation at work coming up, send them a good luck message that day and let them know you want to hear all about how it went. Give them your full attention and listen attentively when they call you with a problem to show that you really care and want to help."

Complimenting your partner and expressing your gratitude to them can help remind them just how precious of a person they are to you. When you’re in a long-distance relationship, it’s natural for you and your partner to have a few doubts about if things will work out at first. However, if you continuously remind them just how much they mean to you (and they do the same for you), your bond will definitely strengthen despite the distance. For example, make sure to tell your partner “I love you” often. Be direct and sincere with your compliments. For example, say something like, “I really love how safe you make me feel” or “I love how in touch you are with your emotions.”"

Fortunately, no amount of distance can stop you from sending a thoughtful gift through the mail. For example: [2] X Research source Send them chocolates on Valentine’s Day. Mail them a care package with all of their favorite snacks and treats. Gift them an item they’ve always wanted for their birthday.

Technology makes communication almost instantaneous, but if you’re looking to add a bit of excitement to your relationship, why not opt for a more traditional means of communicating? Not to mention, waiting for a reply will give you something to look forward to. [3] X Research source To make things more intimate, spritz your letter with your signature cologne or perfume so that your partner instantly thinks of you when they get it.

Setting boundaries is a way to maintain a healthy balance between you and your partner and lays out your expectations for one another. These ground rules can act as a blueprint for your relationship and can be something you refer to if things get complicated. Discuss things you’re comfortable and uncomfortable with regarding your relationship and set boundaries accordingly. For example: Let your partner know how often you want to call and text each other. Tell them if you feel uncomfortable sharing any personal details about your life. Set expectations that you’ll listen to each other without being judgmental.

Show your partner that you’re 100% committed to your relationship by scheduling time to be together, being there when they need you, and addressing any issues rather than giving up on the relationship right away. [5] X Research source Commitment is also about not putting yourself in situations that could jeopardize your relationship.

That’s why it’s incredibly important to have a serious conversation about your relationship whenever you feel unhappy or dissatisfied with something. [6] X Research source When talking to your partner, use “I” language to keep the focus on your feelings and perspective and avoid sounding like you’re blaming your partner. For example, instead of saying, “You never call me first and it’s annoying,” say, “I’ve been feeling a bit lonely recently and would like if we could talk more.”"

      "content": "Live your own life and pursue your passions outside of the relationship. Healthy relationships, whether long-distance or not, all require partners to maintain a sense of independence and personal freedom. This allows each person to grow and bring new energy to the relationship. Instead of constantly thinking about your partner and how far away they are, get out and do things that make you happy, then go back to your partner and tell them all about what you did. [7] X Research source For example, set aside time to pursue your hobbies during the week. Or, just spend some time relaxing on your own by reading a book, going for a walk, or even meditating to clear your mind."

Avoid letting yourself get wrapped up in your romantic relationship and be sure to spend time with friends and family to nurture those relationships as well. For example, hang out with friends on the weekend, get together for a meal with your family, or take a trip with your closest pals.

For example, studies have shown that long-distance couples actually experience more intimacy and stronger emotional connections. Also, tell yourself daily about what you love about your partner to remind yourself why it’s all worth it.
