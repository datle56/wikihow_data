      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain what JoJo’s work means to you. Whether it’s about her music, dancing, or activism, get specific about her impact to make your message more meaningful. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send an autograph, or answer one of your burning questions. [2] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality. For example, instead of saying “I love your new single,” you could say, “I have Karma on repeat—because it’s such a BOP! I can’t wait for more music in this new era.” To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), decorate the outside of your envelope with stamps and stickers, or write JoJo’s name in calligraphy . If you’re requesting an autograph, send your photo in a properly stamped and self addressed envelope. It typically takes 3+ months for a response, so try your best to be patient. [3] X Research source In the meantime, send fan mail to Jenna Ortega , Johnny Depp , or another celebrity you admire!"
