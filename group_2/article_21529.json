      "content": "GRWM stands for “Get Ready With Me.” GRWM usually refers to a style of video where creators on social media share their process for getting ready for their day or night. Influencers with a beauty and fashion focus typically apply their makeup, do their hair, and plan out their outfits while they talk about the products and clothes they’re wearing. [1] X Research source GRWM is commonly used on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram where creators share their getting-ready routines for heading to class, going on a date, having a cozy night in, and traveling. GRWM is also used in texts. You might message your friends, “Come over to grwm,” or ask, “Did you see Ashley’s grwm video?” When watching a GRWM video, you might hear other slang terms like OOTD, which stands for “Outfit of the day,” and haul, which refers to products the creator bought or was gifted. Aaron Makelky, influencer and content creator, says GRWM videos aren't exclusively about an influencer's outfit and makeup. The content of the video can be about their day, telling a story, or going shopping, for instance."
