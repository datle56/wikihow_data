You will need to protect yourself from contact with the patient’s body fluids, and protect the patient from injury or infection. To begin the procedure, make sure you have the following materials: [2] X Research source Non-sterile gloves Tourniquet Alcohol wipe or antiseptic solution (2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol) Local anesthetic solution (optional) Syringe with a needle of appropriate gauge Venous access device Transparent dressing Paper tape Sharps container"

      "content": "Choose the correct cannula size for your patient. The larger the gauge of the needle, the higher the maximum flow rate of fluid entering into the vein. [3] X Research source This means larger-sized needles have a smaller number, so a 14-gauge is large, while a 22-gauge is small. Choose a size that corresponds to the specific procedure but does not exceed ⅔ the size of the vessel being accessed. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source The size of the cannula depends on several factors, including the patient’s vein condition and the purpose of the infusion. For routine procedures, a 20 to 22-gauge cannula is often suitable for adults, while a 22 to 24-gauge cannula is suitable for children. A 14 to 16-gauge cannula is typically reserved for emergency situations, such as a rapid blood transfusion.

Perform the following steps in order to build rapport with your patient and create a more comfortable experience: Introduce yourself to your patient. Verify your patient’s identity, including their name and date of birth. Explain the procedure to the patient and answer any questions they may have. Check if your patient has any allergies or sensitivities. If they have a latex allergy, make sure your tourniquet, gloves, and cannula are latex free. [6] X Research source"

Using gloves will not only protect your patient, but will also protect you from exposure to bodily fluids and potentially infectious material. A single pair of non-sterile gloves will probably be sufficient for this task. [7] X Research source Depending on your facility’s requirements, you can also wear an apron or protective eyewear when inserting an IV catheter."

Place the tourniquet about 5 to 10 cm above the cannulation site, then tighten it. [8] X Research source Other methods for locating a good vein include: [9] X Research source Tapping on the vein to make it dilate. Asking the patient to open and close their fist. Using gravity to highlight the vein by holding the patient’s arm down. Applying mild heat to the site of the vein. If you have a difficult time finding a good vein on the arm you have selected, inspect the opposite arm. In some cases (e.g. if the patient has diabetes or a history of IV drug abuse), you may need to use an ultrasound to help you locate a good vein. [10] X Research source"

[12] X Research source If you are trying to access a small, superficial vein, use a small catheter (with a gauge of 22-24) and insert at an angle of 10° to 25°. For a deeper vein, use a larger catheter and insert at an angle of 30° to 45°. [13] X Research source Make sure you insert the needle bevel up (with its eye facing upwards).
