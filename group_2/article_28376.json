      "content": "Soak up the sun for 1-4 hours a day, especially in the summertime - but be sure to wear sun protection people with blonde hair are highly susceptible to melanoma. Sunlight exposure naturally lightens the hair follicles, which makes your hair blonder. The more time you spend in the sun, the lighter your hair will turn over time. Spend as much time as you can outside, and you’ll notice your hair change shades in 1-3 weeks. Make sure you wear sunscreen to protect your skin! [1] X Research source Try to go outside every day, weather permitting. While this may not be possible every day, the more sun exposure your hair receives, the more blonde it becomes. You can go for a walk, lay out on the beach, or ride a bike, for example. If you live somewhere that is warm and sunny year-round, you can do this at any time of year, not just in the summer."

      "title": "Apply lemon juice to your hair if you want a natural lightening agent.",
      "content": "Apply lemon juice to your hair if you want a natural lightening agent. Lemon juice is made up of citric acid. When it heats up, lemon juice causes the cuticle of your hair to open and the pigment to lift from your hair. Pour a dime-size amount in your palms, rub your hands together, and run your hands through your hair. Do this right before you go outside, and you’ll notice your hair get even lighter! Wash your hands with soap and water after you apply the lemon juice. [2] X Research source You may need more lemon juice for longer hair. An easy way to apply lemon juice to long hair is to put the juice in a spray bottle. Mist your hair before you leave the house. Additionally, lemon vodka works in similar ways. You can use this as a substitute for lemon juice. Simply pour 1–3 US tbsp (15–44 mL) into your hands, and spread it over your hair. Alternatively, you can mix lemon juice with your conditioner and rinse your hair with it. This lightens your hair over time, instead of only when you are in the sunshine."

      "content": "Spray your hair with a saltwater solution to lighten color-treated hair. Pour 1-2 tbsp (14.8 g - 29.6 g) of salt into a spray bottle, and fill the rest with water from your faucet. Then, spray the salt water solution over all of your hair. Do this before you go outside on a sunny day, and within a few weeks you'll notice your hair pigment turning lighter and lighter. [3] X Research source Saltwater helps lighten hair that is already color-treated because the salt opens up your hair cuticle, making it easier for the sun to penetrate the follicles and lighten the pigment. This is a great option if you already have blonde or light-brown hair and want to go even lighter."
