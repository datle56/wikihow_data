For bakery quality frosting, keep the knife clean after every pass, using a little warm water to ensure your frosting knife applies the icing smoothly and evenly. Use big globs of icing at a time and don't try to spread it too thin. By working in small areas, not spreading too thin, and cleaning the knife regularly, you can get a quality frosted cake. If you've got time, real pros will \"double frost.\" Start with a thin layer of frosting everywhere -- it is okay if it pulls up crumbs. Then freeze the cake for 15 minutes, pull it out, and frost \"for real.\" You'll be astonished how easily it goes on!"
