If you feel the need to use cologne, use it sparingly. Try choosing a deodorant that smells refreshing with a hint of musk. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Even if your middle school requires uniforms, you can still pull off a sharp look by caring for your clothes. Do not let your clothes get shabby or smelly.

Avoid putting others down even as a joke; she may see you as judgmental and feel self-conscious around you. You can be compassionate by showing encouragement to her and others. Positive reinforcement goes a long way in middle school and is often overlooked. Try out some positive messages in your day at school like \"Don't even worry about that math test, Shonda.
