      "title": "Combine baking soda and hot water.",
      "content": "Combine baking soda and hot water. Stir 1 cup (250 ml) baking soda into 2 cups (500 ml) hot water until well combined. Combine the two ingredients in a large bucket or other container. Note that the baking soda will not dissolve, but it should be completely soaked. This homemade fabric softener is often praised by people who have hard water. Baking soda regulates the pH level in your rinse water, preventing it from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. It also cancels out mineral deposits, like those found in hard water. These mineral deposits are often responsible for making clothes stiff."

      "title": "Slowly add the vinegar.",
      "content": "Slowly add the vinegar. Slowly add 1 cup (250 ml) white distilled vinegar to the mixture. Stir gently until the baking soda is dissolved. The vinegar will react with the baking soda, causing a fizzy chemical reaction. Do not pour the vinegar too quickly or you will end up with a mess. Vinegar strips soap and residue from clothing and also helps to soften hard water. Some believe that the vinegar and baking soda cancel each other out, making them ineffective. The salt that is produced from the chemical reaction acts as a buffer in the rinse cycle, however. Moreover, many of the elements that help soften clothes remain in the solution even after the reaction occurs."

      "title": "Scent the fabric softener, if desired.",
      "content": "Scent the fabric softener, if desired. If you want to make scented fabric softener, then you need to add essential oil or scent booster to the ingredients. Stir either option directly into the fabric softener solution. If using essential oils, 25 to 30 drops should be sufficient. If using scent booster, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of the crystals to your water and stir until dissolved. [1] X Research source Scent booster is usually found in the laundry aisle. It is not a natural product, so it may not be preferable from an ecological sense, but it will lend your fabric softener a pleasant scent and may save you money in the long run."

For a normal load, fill a fabric softener ball with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the fabric softener solution or add the same amount directly to the washer just before the rinse cycle begins. Do not add the fabric softener to the machine before its primary wash cycle. Pour the rest of the fabric softener into a storage container. Shake or stir well to combine before each use."

      "content": "Combine 1 gallon (3.8 L) vinegar with 25 to 30 drops essential oil. Stir the essential oil directly into the container of white distilled vinegar for a minute or so to ensure that the two liquids combine well. Note that the essential oil is not necessary. The vinegar is the component responsible for softening clothes. It strips away residue on your clothes that would otherwise make them stiff, and it has properties that can break down some of the minerals found in hard water supplies. If you do decide to use essential oils, you can use any scents you want."

In a large bucket or other container, stir together 3 cups (750 ml) white distilled vinegar, 2 cups (500 ml) hair conditioner, and 6 cups (1500 ml) hot water until evenly combined. [2] X Research source You can use any hair conditioner you want for this method. To make it more cost effective, choose a cheap brand. Since there are many varieties and scents of conditioner available on the market, your scent options are nearly endless. Note that this is not an \"all natural\" solution, but it is quite effective. The vinegar strips aways stiffening residue and the conditioner softens fibers."

[3] X Research source Cotton works well because it is a natural fiber and relatively breathable. Avoid fabrics with fibers that are spaced too tightly together. Also avoid synthetic fabrics. You can use a rag or old piece of cloth for this, but make sure that the material you use is clean."

The cloth can be moist, but it should not be dripping wet by the time you add it to the dryer. The vinegar is the only element in this fabric softener formula that lends itself to actually softening your clothes. It may not be as strong as a liquid fabric softener using vinegar, but some of the effects should still remain."

      "content": "Add a few drops of essential oil onto one square. Drop 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil onto a cloth square. Spread the drops out so that they seep into the fibers of the entire square. The essential oil will give your clothes a pleasant yet mild fragrance. You can technically use this method without the use of essential oils, but since the softening effects are less powerful than a liquid fabric softener alternative, it would make more sense to take advantage of the deodorizing and re-scenting abilities of this method."

You do not need to do anything special from this point on. Each dryer sheet can be used for two or three loads, but you may need to refresh the scent by adding 3 drops or more of the essential oil before use. Refresh the softening properties by giving the sheet another quick spray of vinegar."
