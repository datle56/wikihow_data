      "content": "Velcro strips securely attach your cushions to your furniture. Simply buy a roll of Velcro and cut it down to the length of your cushions. Peel off the backing to expose the sticky backside, then attach one side of the Velcro to the underside of your cushions. Attach the other side of the Velcro to the base of the furniture. Situate your cushions onto your furniture, and they’ll have almost no chance of blowing away. [1] X Research source Don’t have any Velcro? Try using double-sided tape instead. Or, use fabric glue for a more permanent option."

      "content": "Cushion ties are an easy way to tie your cushions to your furniture. Look for some cushion covers that have ties on the very back and the sides. Place the cushions in the furniture, then use the ties to attach them to the legs or the base of your outdoor furniture. You can also try a little DIY action to add the ties to your cushions yourself. Simply cut a small hole into the back of your cushion, then loop a fabric tie or a cord through the hole. Then, use your new tie to attach the cushions to your furniture."

      "content": "Weigh your cushions down with small, discreet weights. If you just want something heavy to keep your cushions in place, buy some patio furniture weights that you can set directly on top of your cushions. These weights are small enough that you can hide them behind pillows, but heavy enough to keep your cushions in place all day. [3] X Research source Or, you can unzip your cushions and hide the weights inside for a seamless, non-intrusive way to weigh them down. If you don’t want to shell out for patio furniture weights, you can simply use decorative rocks. However, these are harder to hide and can make your furniture look less attractive."

      "content": "A protective tarp will keep your cushions safe from wind and rain. If you know there’s a big windstorm coming, grab a weighted tarp and cover all of your cushions and decorative pillows. Not only will it keep them in place, but it will prevent rain or morning dew from damaging your cushions over time. If you don’t have a weighted tarp, use a regular tarp and weigh down the ends with rocks or large bricks."

If none of these options sound great to you or you know there’s a big storm coming, take all your cushions off and throw them into a large basket or outdoor chest . Keep your cushions indoors or in a garage to protect them from the elements and keep them in tip top shape. [4] X Research source Worried about your storage basket blowing away? Look for one with a securing hook on the back so you can attach it to a wall outside."
