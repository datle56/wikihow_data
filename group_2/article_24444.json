      "content": "Lay out your tie. Make sure your hands are dry, and then lay your tie face-up across the ironing board. Smooth out the tie the best you can. Make sure the tie is not stained, because if you iron over a stain it may permanently set-in and ruin the tie. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Saturate a pressing cloth.",
      "content": "Saturate a pressing cloth. Ties are typically delicate, so you do not want to press the iron directly onto the tie fabric. Instead, you need to wet a clean, white cloth. [2] X Research source Make sure that the cloth is damp, but not dripping with any excess water. Any drops of water that fall onto a tie could potentially leave a water stain. Keep wringing out the cloth until it does not drip any water."

      "content": "Cover the tie with the pressing cloth. The purpose of the pressing cloth is to protect the tie fabric from coming into direct contact with the iron. Lay the pressing cloth completely over the area of the tie that you iron."

      "title": "Iron the tie.",
      "content": "Iron the tie. To safely iron your tie, you will gently move the iron over the pressing cloth, and let the steam produced from the cloth work to release any wrinkles from the tie. Never let the iron rest in one spot. Using gentle pressure, start from the bottom, and work your way to the top. Iron small sections at a time as you move the iron from the edges inward to prevent creases. When you have finished one side, flip it over, and repeat the process. Make sure your pressing cloth is still wet. If it feels dry, get it wet again, and wring it back out. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Untie your tie when you are not wearing it. It may be tempting to loosen your tie, slip it off, and throw it on the dresser while you go relax. Try not to do this because this will cause major wrinkles, kinks, and maybe even permanent damage to your tie. Always undo your tie completely, and then hang it up on a rack, or lay it out flat when you are not wearing it. [7] X Research source"
