      "content": "Choose your bread and place it in the toaster. Any bread works for buttered toast: white, brown, wheat, sourdough, rye, pumpernickel, or another variety. Each one will give you a slightly different flavor and/or texture, so pick your favorite. Making bread in the toaster is perhaps the faster and easiest way to make bread. Use this method if you are pressed for time."

      "content": "Choose the toaster setting. Your toaster probably offers options for how dark and crisp you want the toast to be. If you're not sure, start with a light setting; you can always put the toast in for a second round to get darker, but you can't do anything about toast that's become too dark. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Butter your toast.",
      "content": "Butter your toast. Use a butter knife to spread butter over the toast while it is still warm. If you wait until the toast has cooled, the butter will not melt into the bread. Cut the bread into halves or quarters before you eat, if you wish. Lots of butter will likely make your toast softer as it melts, and less butter will keep your snack more crisp and dry. The amount of butter used is based on personal preference. Soften the butter before spreading it on your toast. Take it out of the refrigerator 20 minutes before you plan on making toast to help it warm to room temperature. Whipped butter may also work for this. If you're using a stick of butter and don't have time to soften it, cut the butter into thin slices and apply to warm toast. Thicker slices won't melt as well."

Fluffy, tender breads like challah and brioche can't take as much heat and need shorter cooking times. Choose any bread, like ciabatta, semolina bread, baguette, or rye.

Make sure the other side of the bread soaks up some of the butter in the pan. Place the lid back on top. Let this side toast for 2-3 minutes. [5] X Research source An alternative is to toast the bread in a pan that has no butter in it. Just let the bread brown in the pan and then flip. Butter it after you remove it from the pan.

      "content": "Remove from the pan. When the bread has browned to your desired level of crisp, take the bread out of the pan. Do not add extra butter after taking it out of the pan. This method of toasting bread cooks the butter into the bread, giving it a different flavor than if you add the butter after it is toasted. This method ensures there are no uneven chunks of butter on the toast, and helps the toast not to be soggy from too much buttering. Toasting the bread this way allows for a crisp outside but a fluffy, chewy inside."

An alternative is to spread the butter on the bread after the bread is finished.

Turn the bread over when the first side is brown enough. Let the next side cook for 2-3 minutes. [7] X Research source If you are using a toaster oven, you probably will not have to flip it over because the bread will cook on both sides. You don't have to flip it over and cook it on both sides. You can leave one side un-toasted if you wish. It will still be warm and slightly cooked from being in the oven."
