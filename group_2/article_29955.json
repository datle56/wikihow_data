The caffeine in the coffee will may also help tighten your skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite. [2] X Research source The coffee does not have to be freshly-ground. You can even use leftover grounds from your morning coffee."

      "title": "Add ½ cup (115 grams) of white sugar.",
      "content": "Add ½ cup (115 grams) of white sugar. The sugar will help further exfoliate your skin. For something even more exfoliating, you can use raw cane or palm sugar. For an even more exfoliating scrub, use sea salt instead."

      "title": "Add the ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of coconut oil or olive oil.",
      "content": "Add the ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of coconut oil or olive oil. If you can't find any, you can use other types of food-grade oil, such as almond oil or grape seed oil. [3] X Research source If you are using coconut oil, melt it in the microwave first, then let it cool slightly."

      "title": "Add some fragrance with vanilla extract and/or ground cinnamon, if desired.",
      "content": "Add some fragrance with vanilla extract and/or ground cinnamon, if desired. You will need ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract and/or 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. These are not completely necessary, but they will make your scrub smell delightful, just like a latte! [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the ingredients together using a fork, then make any necessary adjustments.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients together using a fork, then make any necessary adjustments. Ideally, the scrub should feel like wet sand. If it is too dry for your liking, add a little bit more oil. If it is too wet for your liking, add a little bit more sugar."

    {
      "title": "Transfer the scrub to an airtight jar and store it in a cool, dry place.",
      "content": "Transfer the scrub to an airtight jar and store it in a cool, dry place. The oil, sugar, and coffee may separate over time. If this happens, simply stir the scrub up using a spoon or your finger. The scrub should last up to two months. If it does start to smell or look strange before then, throw it out and make a new one. If you used coconut oil to make your scrub, store it at room temperature so that the coconut oil doesn't harden too much. Use a glass jar, if you can. The oil in the scrub may degrade plastic over time; glass will last much longer. If you wish to give the scrub away as a gift, consider sticking a personalized label onto the lid."

Scoop up 1 to 2 tablespoons of the scrub into the palm of your hand. Gently massage the scrub into your skin for 45 to 60 seconds using circular motions. Rinse the scrub off when you are done. [6] X Research source There may be some oily residue on your skin afterwards. You can wash it off with soap, or you can leave it to help moisturize your skin. Consider buffing your skin with a dry brush first. This will exfoliate your skin and stimulate blood flow. It will make the scrub even more effective when you use it! [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Place 3 tablespoons of finely-ground coffee into a small mixing bowl. Coffee may help reduce puffiness and swelling, making it ideal for that sleepy, morning face. It is also a natural astringent, so it can help tighten your pores and reduce oiliness. [8] X Research source The coffee grounds will also help exfoliate away dead skin cells."

      "title": "Add 2 tablespoons of oil.",
      "content": "Add 2 tablespoons of oil. Olive oil is a good choice, but you can use another type of oil instead. If you tend to get breakouts, however, you should avoid olive oil and the following oils as they tend to clog pores: coconut, flax seed, linseed, palm, and wheat germ. Here are some suggestions based on certain skin types: [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Acne-prone or oily: argan, grapeseed, hemp, jojoba, sunflower seed, or sweet almond. Dry or mature skin: apricot kernel, argan, avocado, hemp, jojoba, sunflower seed, or sweet almond. Normal: apricot kernel, argan, grapeseed, hemp, jojoba, sunflower seed, or sweet almond."

    {
      "title": "Add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.",
      "content": "Add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Avoid using white sugar or \"raw\" cane sugar if you can. These will make the scrub too harsh and abrasive for your face. Brown sugar is the better for the face, because of its smaller grain size. It is still exfoliating, but in a gentle way."

If this is too dry for you, add a little more of whichever oil you were using. If the scrub is too wet, add a little bit more ground coffee or brown sugar.

Scoop out a small amount of the scrub, and gently massage it onto your face for 45 to 60 seconds. Use small, circular motions and take care to avoid the area around your eyes. Rinse the scrub off with warm water, then splash cool water onto your skin to seal the pores. Apply some moisturizer afterwards, if needed.
