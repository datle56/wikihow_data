      "title": "Live your own life.",
      "content": "Live your own life. Don't make him the center of your universe: no one wants to, or can be solely responsible for the other person's happiness. It's too much to ask of anyone, and it is ultimately a relationship-killer. [1] X Research source Spend time cultivating your own interests and allow him the time to do the same. When you make time for yourself, you'll be surprised at how much more frequent and enjoyable your time with your boyfriend will become."

    {
      "title": "Spend time with your friends.",
      "content": "Spend time with your friends. Don't put your social life on hold for him. Make your own plans to hang out with your friends. This will let him see you as an independent person who has a social life apart from him. Over time, he'll realize that he needs to claim some of your time if he wants to be with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go away for a while.",
      "content": "Go away for a while. This is especially important if you live with your boyfriend. You need to give him the physical space to miss you a little. Take a two-week vacation somewhere you've always wanted to visit. Go home to your family for a little bit, or go and visit some friends you haven't seen in a long time. Important tip: resist the urge to call or text him, other than a short message to let him know you arrived safely at your destination."

    {
      "title": "Give him the space to chase you.",
      "content": "Give him the space to chase you. Simply put, if you're doing most of the chasing, you're not giving him the opportunity or the desire to chase you. Don't take charge of your relationship. Let him come forward in his own way, and in his own time. For example, try the following: If he texts you or leaves you a message, don't return it right away. Make him wait a little. Let him plan your next date. Make him do the work. The date will be much more satisfying for the both of you."

    {
      "title": "Play hard to get.",
      "content": "Play hard to get. As trite as this sounds, it is effective. It doesn't mean withholding sex, although that can be part of it. In modern practice it just means that you aren't always available when he asks you on a date or to hang out together. Even if you have no plans, don't agree to see him every time he calls you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress nicely.",
      "content": "Dress nicely. You don't have to forsake your comfortable sweats and old ratty t-shirt, but you should dress up nicely sometimes. Studies show that when you like what you're wearing, you radiate self-confidence, and self-confidence is very attractive. Choose outfits that you know compliment your body and that you feel confident in wearing. When you know you look good, it will show in the way you carry yourself, and nothing is more sexy to a man than a confident woman."

    {
      "title": "Show him your appreciation.",
      "content": "Show him your appreciation. Your boyfriend enjoys giving to you, and it's his goal to make you happy. So, when he succeeds, be sure to show him. Be specific, too: men respond best to compliments tied to a certain action rather than generalities. [2] X Research source You can say something like \"Honey, I really enjoyed our date last night. You did a great job picking out that restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful night.\" Knowing that he has pleased you will swell his chest with pride in himself and love for you, the amazing woman that he's so lucky to have in his life."
