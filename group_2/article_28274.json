      "content": "Look up reference pictures of the type of ears you want to make. Regardless of whether you are making realistic wolf ears or cartoon wolf ears, you need to have some reference pictures. Decide what sort of wolf you want to be, such as gray or arctic, then look up pictures of that wolf. Use real-life pictures if you want to make realistic ears. Use cartoon pictures if you want to make cartoon ears."

      "content": "Draw 2 right triangles on cardstock, then cut them out for the ear templates. Draw 1 right triangle on a sheet of cardstock; make it about the size of your hand, or whatever size you want your ears to be. Cut it out with scissors, then use it to trace a second right triangle. Cut the second right triangle out too. A right triangle has 1 horizontal bottom edge, 1 vertical side edge, and 1 diagonal side edge. The diagonal edges will be the outside edges of the ears. The vertical edges will be the inside edges of the ears. Don't make the corners too sharp and pointy. Make them slightly rounded for a softer, more natural appearance."

      "content": "Trace the templates onto your desired fur, with the fur running upward. Set a piece of fur fabric furry-side-down on a flat surface, then place the templates on top. Make sure that the fur is running towards the pointed tips of the triangles, then trace around the templates with a chalk or pen. [1] X Research source Use a pen for light fabrics and chalk for dark. Be careful of how you set the templates down. You want a left ear and a right ear. Your wolf ears can be any color you want. Gray will look the most real, though. Faux fur runs in 1 direction only. Most patterns require the fur to run from top to bottom, but for this, you need it to run from bottom to top."

      "title": "Trace the templates onto white fur.",
      "content": "Trace the templates onto white fur. Flip a piece of white fur over so that the furry side is facing down. Rotate the fabric so that the fur is pointing upwards. Set the templates down, and trace around them with a pen. [2] X Research source You are making these triangles in addition to the ones that you have already made. In total, you should have 4 triangles, 2 of each color. These triangles will be for the inside of your wolf ears. White is the most common, but you can use a different color too. If you want to use a different color, consider a lighter shade than the outside of the ears. For example, if your ears are gray, you could do light gray for the inside."

      "content": "Cut the triangles out with a box cutter, craft blade, or utility knife. Keep the fur furry-side-down. Run a shape box cuter, craft blade, or utility knife across the fabric backing, using the lines you traced as a guide. Be careful to only cut through the fabric and not the actual fur. You can use scissors too, but you will have to slide the lower blade through the fur. Don't cut straight through the fur, or it will end up too short."

      "content": "Shave the gray fur with trimmers for a more realistic look. Wolves have furry ears, but the fur is short. If you used fur that is more than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) long, you should trim it. Get out a pair of trimmers, and add a 1 ⁄ 4 or 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64 or 1.27 cm) guard. Shave the fur using upward strokes, working from the bottom of the triangle to the top. [3] X Research source Don't shave all of the fur off! You want it to be about 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) long. You don't have to do this step at all, but it will make a huge difference! Comb the ears afterwards with a pet brush or a pet comb to remove any excess fuzz."

For example, you can shave most of the fur off, but leave the fur longer along the vertical edge. [4] X Research source Use the same trimmer and set of guards as you did for the gray fur. You can leave the fur a little longer here too. Remember to comb the fur afterwards to remove any fluff."

Place the matching white fur pieces on top, with the furry side facing down. Pin the pieces together along the vertical and diagonal edges; leave the bottom horizontal edge unpinned. Don't let any fur stick out from under the fabric when you pin it together. Brush the fur towards the middle of the ears."

You can do it by hand using a whipstitch , or you can do it on a sewing machine . If you choose to use a sewing machine, use a 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) seam allowance and a straight stitch. You can also sew along the edges with a zigzag stitch instead. [5] X Research source The thread color does not really matter, but it would be best if it matches the white or gray fur. If you are using a sewing machine, backstitch when you start and finish sewing."

To loosen it, find a skinny knitting needle or skewer, and run it along the seams. Use the point to pull any loops of fur caught in the stitching. You can also shave the edges of the ears to make them more even. Use your trimmers with a 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) guard."

Cut the traced triangles out of the craft foam with scissors. [6] X Research source You will be putting these inside your wolf ears, so the color does not matter. White will work the best, though, so that it doesn't show through the white fur. If you sewed your ears on the sewing machine, you might want to make these a little smaller to allow for the 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) seam allowances. Make the triangles the same size as the ears. It is easier to trim them smaller later on. If you cut them smaller now, you may accidentally make them too small."

Hot glue the wires to the craft foam, about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the bottom edge. [7] X Research source You can use thinner wire if you want, but it is too thin, it may not hold its shape well due to the weight of the ears. Use wire cutters to cut the wire. Don't use scissors."

Gently press down on the fur to seal it against the glue, then repeat the process for the other ear. [8] X Research source It would be best if the wire is on the same side as the white fur, but it's okay if it isn't. Depending on your seam allowances, you may have some foam sticking out of the bottom of each ear. This is okay; you'll trim it off later."

Slide your hot glue gun into the ear and draw a squiggle of hot glue along the foam. Slide the hot glue gun out, then press the fur down. Repeat this step for the other ear.

[10] X Research source Do this step for the second ear too. You need to leave gaps in the middle so that you can insert the headband into them.

Choose a paint that's a few shades darker than your gray fur, then air brush it onto the edges of the ears. Extend the color down the tip of the ear and onto the back. [13] X Research source Add some light gray paint to the inside if each ear. Make it go down to the middle, just to the side of the longer fur. Let the paint dry, then comb the fur out with a pet brush or pet comb. This will help break up any chunks of paint."
