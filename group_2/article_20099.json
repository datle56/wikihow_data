Consider writing your crush a note and leaving it somewhere, like their locker or desk. Or send your crush an email to tell them how you feel. [28] X Research source For example, write something like, “Hey, I'm really shy, so it’s hard for me to say this, but I wanted you to know I have feelings for you.” Make sure to mention that you’re writing them a note instead of talking to them face to face because you’re shy. Sometimes, a crush may be offended or think you aren’t serious if you write a note instead of just talking to them. Don’t send an anonymous note. It defeats the purpose of confessing your feelings, because they don’t know who’s writing the note. An anonymous note can backfire if your crush assumes the letter is from someone else."
