      "title": "Check that your sawtooth hanger can support the weight of the picture.",
      "content": "Check that your sawtooth hanger can support the weight of the picture. Sawtooth hangers are made to support 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of weight at the most. Anything heavier than that will need to be hung by a different means. To easily weigh the picture, hold it as you step onto a scale and then subtract your weight from the total. [1] X Research source For heavier pictures , you'll want to use a wire installed across the back of the frame. [2] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."

      "title": "Measure the frame's width and mark the center point.",
      "content": "Measure the frame's width and mark the center point. Use a tape measure and a pencil or pen to make the mark. This will help you properly situate the sawtooth hanger once you're ready to install it. [3] X Research source If you don't have a tape measure, you could also use a yardstick or something similar to get the measurement so that the weight is distributed more evenly."

      "title": "Use 2 sawtooth hangers if the frame is longer than 2 feet (24 in).",
      "content": "Use 2 sawtooth hangers if the frame is longer than 2 feet (24 in). This will help keep it level and make it less likely that it'll get bumped out of place over time. If you're doing this, position the sawtooth hangers about 6 inches (15 cm) in from each side. [4] X Research source This isn't a requirement, but it will make your frame more stable when it's finally hanging up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Center the sawtooth hanger and mark the nail holes with a pencil.",
      "content": "Center the sawtooth hanger and mark the nail holes with a pencil. Position the sawtooth hanger overtop of the mark you made in the exact center of the frame. Hold it down in place and make a visible mark through each nail hole so that you'll be able to quickly find your place again in case you accidentally drop the hanger. [5] X Research source A lot of sawtooth hangers have a mark in the very center to make it easier to line it up on the back of the frame."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the sawtooth hanger into place with 2 small nails.",
      "content": "Secure the sawtooth hanger into place with 2 small nails. Take a nail, line it up with the hole in the hanger, and gently hammer it into place. Hammer as straight as you can so that the nail doesn't go in at an angle. Repeat this action on the opposite side. The nail will be really short so it doesn't go through the front of the frame, so be careful to not catch your fingers with the hammer. [6] X Research source Some sawtooth kits come with nails, and some come with screws. Use whatever came with your kit to ensure the hanger is properly attached. If it came with screws, you'll need to use a screwdriver rather than a hammer. The sawtooth hanger needs to be attached to the frame. Even if there is sturdy canvas paper covering the back of the picture, chances are the hanger will just rip through it once you place the picture up on the wall."

      "title": "Choose where you want to hang your picture.",
      "content": "Choose where you want to hang your picture . The general rule of thumb is that the center of the picture should rest about 57 to 60 inches (140 to 150 cm) from the floor, but you can put it wherever you think it would look best. It may be helpful to have another person hold the picture up while you look at it from the other side of the room to make sure it's positioned the way you want it. [7] X Research source Because your picture is so light, you don't need to worry about finding a stud to tap in to."

      "title": "Mark where the top of the frame will rest with pencil or painter's tape.",
      "content": "Mark where the top of the frame will rest with pencil or painter's tape. Hold the picture back up to the wall, and mark where the top of the frame rests. A pencil, so you can erase the mark, or a piece of painter's tape, which will easily peel off the wall, are the best options to use for this part. Try your best to make the mark in the center of the frame; if someone is helping you, they could hold the frame as you measure and mark the exact center. [8] X Research source Because the sawtooth hanger is located on the frame, you don't need to measure down to meet the hook like you would with other types of hanging implements."

      "title": "Hammer a small nail into the wall just below the mark you made.",
      "content": "Hammer a small nail into the wall just below the mark you made. A 1.5 in (3.8 cm) to 2 in (5.1 cm) nail will be enough to support your picture. Hammer the nail down into the wall at a 45-degree angle to provide the most support for the picture. Don't forget to erase your mark or remove the tape after you've hammered the nail into the wall. [9] X Research source Some sawtooth kits come with small hooks that go on the nail. This hook latches into the sawtooth hanger, rather than just hanging the picture from the nail. You could also use a screw driven straight into the wall for the same effect. [10] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."

      "content": "Hang up the picture and check that it is level. [11] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. Carefully position the sawtooth hanger across from the nail and lower it into place until you feel it snag on the nail. Stand back and check to see if it looks level. Because there are multiple “teeth” in the sawtooth hanger, you might need to move the picture slightly so that it's hanging perfectly straight. [12] X Research source If you're having trouble gauging whether or not the picture is straight, use a level to check it. Many smartphones now have “level” apps so you might not even need an additional tool."

      "content": "Install rubber bumpers behind the frame if it scrapes the wall. This is optional and won't be needed for every frame. Sometimes, depending on the weight of the frame, the bottom edges might scrape against the wall, causing small marks to appear or even chipping the paint. If this is the case, you can put 1 small rubber bumper beneath each bottom corner of the frame. That way, it won't leave marks when it hits the wall. [13] X Research source Find rubber bumpers online or at your local home improvement store."
