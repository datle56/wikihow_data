If your face is not cleaned beforehand, the bacteria can be pushed down into nicks and cause ingrown hair or acne."

This removes any excess shaving cream, dead skin or hair build up from the blades. Don't press the razor too hard. Remember that the blade does the work, not your muscles. When shaving under the nose, it is common for hair to grow down towards the tip and outwards. To prevent cuts, tuck your top lip under your teeth. This will pull your skin taut and will allow better exposure in such a small area. Use the razor and do short, small strokes, while working from the outside towards the middle of the lip. Don't be afraid to only use the corner of the blade. Small strokes will allow for more accuracy and closeness. Use a similar trick for shaving the chin, by pulling your lower lip up around your teeth. This will flatten some curves of the chin. When shaving the chin, use short strokes and try your best for a slight over-lap. The overlap will catch any missed hairs. Don't be afraid to open your mouth and move your jaw in order to have optimum exposure on your chin. Hair on the neck will often grow upwards. Use the razor in upward, smooth strokes. Keep in mind the neck can be a very sensitive area, so it is important to shave efficiently."

When proper preparation of the skin takes place, you will only need a single blade razor. However, picking a double or triple blade won't hurt your skin and can provide a closer shave. Many razors have a pivoting head. This allows for the blade to move smoothly over the curves of the skin, helping ensure a close shave. A disposable razor can still be an acceptable razor. Though often low quality, a disposable razor will serve you well when used only once or twice. If you desire a high-quality razor, check that the blade head is of similar weight to the handle by balancing the shaft on your finger. An off balance razor can lead to an unequal shave. Pay attention to how the handle feels in your hand. If the handle doesn't feel natural to you, there is usually a better option. If the handle is plastic, it may feel too light, and you may overcompensate with additional pressure that can cut your face. A better alternative to plastic is a metal handle, which will feel more hearty and is environmentally-friendly. Don't be afraid to replace those blades. When you select your razor, purchase extra disposable heads. Replace them often to prevent nicks, and scratches to your face. To extend the lifespan of any razor, disinfect it and dry it after use.

Picking the right aftershave for you can take some experimentation. If you have naturally dry skin, choose an aftershave in the form of a balm, gel or lotion. These aftershaves are moisturizing and gentle. If you have naturally oily skin, choose an alcohol or toner based aftershave. These aftershaves remove excess oil but sting on open cuts.
