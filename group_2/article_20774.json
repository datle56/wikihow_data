      "content": "Ghosting is when someone breaks communication abruptly. The term \"Ghosting\" or \"Ghosted\" is often used in the context of a romantic relationship. However, it can also apply to friends, family, and even work relationships. Ghosting may happen abruptly, or it may be a gradual process where the other person starts distancing themselves before cutting off communication completely. Ghosting can often cause people distress, as it ends a relationship abruptly without an explanation or closure., especially if it was a close or romantic relationship."

If they don't want to go on a date, they cancel plans, or don't seem like they want to meet with you, this is a sign they are starting to distance themselves. It could also mean they are busy or they don't feel comfortable meeting in person just yet."

      "content": "They keep posting stories. If you notice they keep posting stories on Snapchat or they are active on other social media platforms, but they aren't talking to you. This could be a sign you've been ghosted. However, it could also mean they haven't thought of a response or they overlooked your message."

      "content": "Check their Snapchat score. If you open someone's profile, you can see their Snapchat score next to the Snapchat logo below their avatar or Bitmoji. Make a note of their Snapchat score. If it increases in a short period of time, then this means they are actively chatting with other people on Snapchat. You may have been ghosted. However, if their Snapchat score doesn't change for a long period of time, it means they are not using the app. They may be away from their phone. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "They wanted to avoid an awkward conversation or confrontation. Studies show that ghosting often happens if someone anticipates a tough conversation that they’d rather avoid. [4] X Research source Maybe they did something to hurt you and feel too guilty to own up to it, or wanted to dodge the consequences of something they did by cutting off contact. If the matter is important, reach out to one of their friends and explain the situation. Their friend may be able to help you sort things out, or mediate the conflict."

Whether you were friends or romantic partners, they might have decided the relationship wasn’t working for them, and that it was better to end it all at once. [5] X Research source It doesn’t feel good, we know. We also know that hanging around someone who doesn’t appreciate your company hurts more than moving on and finding new friends or partners. If you think you were genuinely ghosted, do your best to distract yourself with your hobbies, spending time with other friends, or even making new friends. There’s a whole world of worthwhile people out there, even if this person wasn’t worthwhile."

      "content": "They just got busy or distracted. Life happens when you least expect it. They may be grieving a loss, or navigating a new and busy job. Whatever the reason, it could be that other things caught their attention, and they had to let some things fall by the wayside for a bit while they sorted other things out. Find out if you’ve really been ghosted by sending them a polite message, like, “Been thinking about you!” If they just got distracted, odds are they’ll respond in their own time."

      "content": "They deleted or forgot about their Snapchat account. Sometimes it’s not you that’s been ghosted, but the app itself, and their contacts and friends are unfortunate collateral. They might have decided that Snapchat wasn’t good for their mental health, or they got bored of it, and wanted to move on. They may not be responding because they simply don’t have the app anymore. Reach out on other social media, or by call or text. They might be happy to talk to you, but didn’t realize they lost your contact info when they deleted the app."

      "content": "Think about why you want to ghost them. Ask yourself if ghosting is the right move—it isn’t something to do lightly. It can seriously hurt the other person’s feelings, and even cause prolonged depression or distress. [6] X Research source That said, there are plenty of valid reasons to ghost someone, like if they make you feel unsafe, or if they keep pursuing you (as a friend or romantic interest) even after you’ve made it clear you’re not interested. Otherwise, it might be best to tell them you’re not interested firmly but decisively to give you both some closure. You might say, “Sorry, I just don’t feel like this relationship is what I want right now, and I’d appreciate it if we went our separate ways."

Tap “Manage Friendship,” then tap “Remove Friend.” Block them for added privacy by tapping “Block” instead of “Remove Friend.” This way, they can’t view your public story."

      "content": "Cut off contact elsewhere, and avoid talking to them in person. Ghosting someone is an all-or-nothing deal, even if you’re doing it gradually. Remove or block them from your other social media, and avoid them in real life if possible to make the break clean. If you do encounter them, be prepared for questions or a confrontation—not everyone takes being ghosted well. You might explain that you were having a rough time in life and needed to concentrate on other things, or you might simply say that you didn’t think your relationship was what you wanted."
