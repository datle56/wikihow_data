      "title": "Start a fire.",
      "content": "Start a fire. Fire is probably one of the most infamous ways of killing off Sims - and it doesn't help that there are so many ways to start it! If you start a fire and prevent a Sim from extinguishing it (or just allow them to run around panicking), the fire will typically kill them off quite quickly. Some ways to start a fire are to: [1] X Research source Set the stove or microwave on fire. Direct a Sim to cook a meal, then distract them with something else while the food is in the microwave or on the stove. (The meal may catch fire on its own if the Sim making it has low Cooking skill.) Certain foods, such as Baked Alaska or Lobster Thermidor, have a higher risk of fire, especially if they require a flambé; however, a Sim's Cooking skill needs to be quite high before these foods are available to cook. Use a grill inside. Place a rug in front of a fireplace and start a fire in the fireplace. Direct a Sim to use University's \"Counterfeit Machine\" aspiration reward for more than three hours. Turn on the Happy Holiday Stuff Christmas tree and leave it on. Buy the Nightlife flame jets and place it inside a room next to an object. If you have Seasons, direct a Sim to rake leaves and then burn the leaves near other objects. Have a Sim with a low aspiration use Seasons' Weathernaught Aspiration Reward. Doing so will cause fire to rain down on the Sims. Direct a Sim to use FreeTime's train table - there's a small chance of it catching fire when used. If you have Apartment Life, have an Evil Witch cast the Inflammo spell."

      "title": "Drown your Sim in a swimming pool.",
      "content": "Drown your Sim in a swimming pool. Another infamous manner of killing off Sims is to let them jump in a pool that's missing a ladder. Have a Sim jump into the pool with a diving board, delete the ladder once they've climbed in, or have them jump in or use the slide if you have Seasons. Once their needs deplete past a certain point, the Sim will drown. If a Sim drowns, other Sims typically can't plead with the Grim Reaper at the time of death, since they can't walk on top of the pool. A Sim who drowns will leave puddles all over the lot if they reappear as a ghost. Sims cannot drown in a hot tub or bathtub."
    },
    {
      "title": "Electrocute your Sim.",
      "content": "Electrocute your Sim. If an electrical appliance (e.g. a TV or computer) breaks, send a Sim with low Mechanical skill to repair the object. To increase the chances of electrocution, make sure they're standing in a puddle while working on the equipment. When they get shocked, if three or more of their motives drop too low, the Sim will die."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let your Sim starve.",
      "content": "Let your Sim starve. Remove all fridges from the lot, and delete the phones so that the Sim can't call to get takeout. They'll complain about being hungry, but since they can't get food without a fridge, they'll die of starvation. Children and younger Sims can't die from starvation; the Social Worker will come and get them if their Hunger bar drops too low."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch clouds or stargaze without a telescope.",
      "content": "Watch clouds or stargaze without a telescope. If you direct your Sim outside and tell them to watch clouds or stargaze, there's a chance that a satellite will fall and crush them, killing them. (The satellite can then be sold for Simoleons, though this should be done quickly, as the value depletes rather fast.) Whether or not a satellite falls is determined when your Sim begins the action. If you're trying to kill a Sim in this manner, wait for your Sim to have had about eight thought balloons appear above their head; if no satellite falls after this, restart the action.

      "title": "Allow the Sim to get eaten alive by flies.",
      "content": "Allow the Sim to get eaten alive by flies. If enough garbage and dirty plates pile up in a room, if a Sim walks directly through the garbage, there's a chance of flies swarming up and devouring the Sim. To increase the chances of your Sim being eaten, place them in a narrow hallway that's completely filled with trash and direct them to keep walking up and down the hallway."

      "title": "Keep a sick Sim uncomfortable.",
      "content": "Keep a sick Sim uncomfortable. If a Sim isn't taken care of while they're sick, there's a possibility they'll die of disease. Keep their Comfort level low, and they will eventually die (though be aware that it's surprisingly difficult to kill a Sim through disease). [3] X Research source Sims will most often get sick by being near roaches or using the biotech station career reward. There's also a chance of them contracting a cold or the flu from work or school, and they can potentially contract food poisoning from eating spoiled food. Sims can die of food poisoning, pneumonia, the flu, and the disease from the biotech station. Morning sickness and colds won't kill a Sim, though a Sim can contract pneumonia if their cold goes untreated."

    {
      "title": "Scare your Sim to death.",
      "content": "Scare your Sim to death. If there are tombstones or urns of other Sims on the lot, it's possible for the ghosts to frighten your Sims. When a ghost frightens a Sim, the living Sim's motives will drop; if their motives drop too low, they will die of fright. The angrier a ghost is, the more likely they are to try and scare a Sim. Some death types (like fire) result in angrier ghosts. In-game events such as a kicked tombstone, selling the bed they slept in, or their partner marrying someone else will also agitate ghosts."

      "title": "Allow your Sim to die of old age.",
      "content": "Allow your Sim to die of old age. Elder Sims will eventually pass away on their own accord, though you can't control when it happens without using cheats. Once you have an Elder Sim, just continue playing them as normal; eventually, when their time is up, the Grim Reaper will come to collect them. If a Sim dies of old age, other Sims cannot plead for the Sim's life. Sims who Grew Up Badly when aging from Adult to Elder will die sooner."

      "title": "Use the University Cowplant.",
      "content": "Use the University Cowplant. If you have University, a Sim who reaches the top of the Natural Science career will be rewarded with a Cowplant. Neglecting to feed the Cowplant will make it attempt to lure Sims with its cake-shaped tongue and eat them. Typically a Sim will die upon being eaten, with a few exceptions (if their hygiene is very low, for instance). After a Sim is eaten by the Cowplant, another Sim can milk the plant. The \"milk\" will extend the drinker's life, similar to the Elixir of Life."

      "title": "Send a Nightlife vampire outside during the day.",
      "content": "Send a Nightlife vampire outside during the day. Vampire Sims are extremely susceptible to sunlight, and their motives will decay rapidly when they're outside. They will use their hands to shield their face and turn to ash."

      "title": "Have a Sim peek in a vampire's coffin (Nightlife).",
      "content": "Have a Sim peek in a vampire's coffin (Nightlife). If a Sim's motives are fairly low and they peer into a sleeping vampire's coffin, there's a chance the vampire will scare them (provided the vampire isn't too tired to do so). If the frightened Sim's motives drop too low, the Sim will die. While this death is similar to death by fright, they're not exactly the same - the ghost types are different, and the death by \"coffin scare\" checks fewer motives than the regular death by fright.

      "title": "Overtax a Sim by Rally Forth (Open For Business).",
      "content": "Overtax a Sim by Rally Forth (Open For Business). If your Sim owns a business and has the Rally Forth business perk, sending that Sim to use Rally Forth while they have low motives will kill the Sim. Sims dying of Rally Forth will cough and choke as though they're dying of illness, but the ghost of a Sim who dies of Rally Forth will carry a megaphone."

      "title": "Kill a Sim with weather (Seasons).",
      "content": "Kill a Sim with weather (Seasons). While freezing or overheating a Sim won't kill them on its own, Seasons introduced two weather-caused deaths. Lightning and hail can result in your Sim dying, though it does require it to be storming outside. Lightning. Send a Sim with low motives outside during a thunderstorm. To increase the chances of them getting struck, make sure they're in a body of water (e.g. a hot tub or pool). If you have Open For Business, directing them to use an evil kite will also increase the chance of getting struck. Hail. Send a Sim with low motives outside during a hailstorm, and they'll eventually die from being struck by hail. It's been noted that overheated Sims can spontaneously combust (i.e., catch fire), but it's extremely unlikely for this to happen, and if the Sim does die, it will be treated as death by fire.

      "title": "Make a failed wish for money at the wishing well (Seasons).",
      "content": "Make a failed wish for money at the wishing well (Seasons). If a Sim wishes for money at the wishing well and the wish fails, there's a chance of a bag containing a single Simoleon will fall and land on your Sim's head, killing them. The failed wish is not guaranteed to kill your Sim; there's a larger chance of the money bag hitting your Sim on the head and simply causing their needs to drop (though this can still inadvertently kill your Sim if their motives are too low).

      "content": "Use the Murphy Bed from Apartment Life. If you have Apartment Life, you can purchase a Murphy Bed (a bed that folds out from the wall). If you direct a Sim with low motives and a Body skill of less than 5 to lower the Murphy Bed, there's a possibility of the bed falling on the Sim and crushing them to death."

      "title": "Use the \"Running with Scissors\" set.",
      "content": "Use the \"Running with Scissors\" set. Download and install the scissors from SimsWiki's archived Sims 2 downloads and place them on a lot. Direct a Sim to run with the scissors and allow them to just run around for a bit. Eventually, the Sim will be \"stabbed\" (i.e., perform the \"scared by a ghost\" animation) and die. Sims who died by running with scissors will be treated by the game as though they've died of fright."

      "title": "Use testingcheats.",
      "content": "Use testingcheats. If you open the cheat console ( Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + C ) and type boolProp testingcheatsenabled true , then hit ↵ Enter , you can find a variety of ways to kill Sims, though not entirely legitimately. Testingcheats allows you to drag your Sim's motives and relationships. Drag your Sim's Hunger motive all the way down to instantly starve them. Shift-click a Sim, select Spawn... , and find Rodney's Death Creator . A tombstone will pop up next to the Sim, which allows you to choose the way that Sim will die. (This also allows for deaths not possible in typical gameplay, such as a teen Sim dying of old age.) Shift-click a Sim and click Kill... . You can kill the Sim by flies or choose Give Dead Token , which will make the game treat the Sim as though they've died. Shift-clicking an object can allow you to break it, which is helpful if you want to electrocute your Sim but don't have a broken electrical appliance."
