[1] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. Soak the dog's fur from the neck down, but avoid wetting your dog’s face or ears. Apply about 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of shampoo to your dog’s fur and use your hands to work it into a lather. Then, let the shampoo sit on your dog’s fur for up to 10 minutes and rinse it out completely. [2] X Research source Leaving the shampoo on your dog’s fur will help to soften it, but some dogs might not like standing with shampoo in their hair for this long. Keep it on for as long as your dog will tolerate. You can put your dog into your bathtub at home, bathe them outside with a hose if the weather is warm, or visit a self-serve dog wash. Shampooing your dog too frequently washes off the natural oils in their coat that keep it waterproof. Always use a shampoo that’s made for dogs since human shampoo can irritate your dog’s skin. Find one that has moisturizers in it, such as aloe vera or oatmeal."

Use a towel to blot excess moisture out of your dog’s fur after washing it. Then, use a blow dryer or let your dog’s fur air dry over the next few hours. If you use a blow dryer, move the dryer back and forth over your dog’s fur to cover all of it. Keep doing this until the fur is dry. [4] X Research source If you take your dog to a dog wash to groom it, they might have box dryers that can quickly dry your dog’s fur. Make sure to follow the establishment's instructions carefully for how to use the box dryer."

      "title": "Brush your dog’s fur",
      "content": "Brush your dog’s fur at least once per week with a wire slicker brush. [5] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. Start by brushing the top of your Australian shepherd’s back and then work downwards along its sides. Brush the fur underneath your dog’s body, such as along its chest and belly. Brush your dog’s head, tail, and legs as well. [6] X Research source If you encounter a snag or mat in your dog’s fur, don’t try to move through it with the brush. Pull the brush away from the fur and gently brush the snag at the ends to untangle it. This may take a while depending on the size of the mat. Weekly brushing sessions are usually enough to maintain your dog’s fur and prevent mats from forming. However, your dog may require more frequent brushing if it’s shedding."

      "title": "Use an undercoat brush every 2 to 3 days to remove clumps of fur.",
      "content": "Use an undercoat brush every 2 to 3 days to remove clumps of fur. If your Australian shepherd starts shedding, it will develop clumps of fur that may become matted if you don’t remove them. Use an undercoat rake to brush these areas of your dog’s fur. Then, follow up with a wire brush to get any remaining excess fur off of your dog. Removing the mats will prevent them from growing and impeding your dog’s movement and it will also improve the overall look of your dog’s fur. Check your dog for ticks daily during the summer and fall months. Look between its toes, behind its ears, under its tail, and on its belly. If you find any, use a tick hook to remove them as soon as you can."

      "content": "Secure your dog to a grooming table before you begin. If you plan to trim your dog's fur at home, a grooming table is a good investment. Secure your dog to the table with a short leash to keep them in place while you trim their fur. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a grooming table, ask someone to help you by holding the dog’s collar while you trim its fur. You can purchase a dog grooming table online or in a pet supply store for around $80 to $300 (USD) depending on the type of table you get. Some grooming tables are very basic, while others feature extras, such as electronic controls for raising and lowering them."

If the end of your dog’s tail looks wispy, you can trim 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) of fur off to even it out. This will help to give the tail a neat appearance. Use a comb to smooth out the fur and then cut straight across it with a pair of grooming shears. Don’t cut more than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of the tail fur off unless absolutely necessary, such as if part of the tail fur is matted."

Use a 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) attachment on the clippers and run them over the excess fur between your dog’s foot pads. If you don’t have clippers or prefer to use shears, don’t trim too close to your dog’s feet and be careful not to cut your dog’s foot pads."

      "title": "Consider clipping your dog’s fur short to help it stay cool or to remove mats.",
      "content": "Consider clipping your dog’s fur short to help it stay cool or to remove mats. You can use clippers to trim your Australian shepherd’s fur starting from the neck down to a shorter length. This might be necessary if the weather is hot or if your dog has developed mats in its fur. Start with the largest clipper attachment you have to cut down the length and then use smaller attachments if needed to make the fur even shorter. Use the clippers to cut the fur to the same length all over your dog's body except for its head and trim other areas shorter if needed. For example, you might start with a 2 in (5.1 cm) attachment and then move to a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) attachment for select areas. Keep in mind that this can be a difficult task, so you might want to leave clipping to the professionals. Shaving your Australian shepherd’s coat could expose its skin and increase its risk for getting a sunburn. Always leave about 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64–1.27 cm) of your dog’s coat when you’re trimming it to protect its skin."

The quick is the living tissue inside of your dog’s nail similar to the skin under your fingernails. If you cut into this, it will bleed and be painful for your dog. Keep in mind that the quick will be visible as a light pink tissue if the nails are white, but the quick will not be visible if the nails are black. If your dog has black nails, trim 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) at a time until a solid black dot is visible. [8] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. Then, don’t trim any more because the quick is below this point. [9] X Research source You may also use a nail grinder on your dog’s nails to file them down. Get the dog used to the sound by turning on the grinder while it's lying down and attempt to slowly file 1 nail at a time. Praise your dog when you finish so they know they’re being good."

Squirt enough ear cleansing solution onto a cotton ball or piece of gauze to make it damp, then wipe the cotton on the inside of your dog’s ear. [10] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. Only wipe the visible parts of your dog’s ear. Don’t insert the cotton ball into its ear. You can purchase ear cleaning solution from your dog’s veterinarian. Don’t use anything else to cleanse your dog’s ears. Take your dog to the veterinarian if it shows signs of pain when you clean its ears, such as whining or growling. Also, check for signs of an infection, such as redness, soreness, drainage, or a foul smell. If you note any of these signs, take your dog to see a vet."

Use a dog toothbrush or wrap your finger with gauze or a clean washcloth if you’re comfortable sticking your finger in its mouth. Then, apply a pea-sized amount of dog toothpaste to the brush or cloth and wet it with water. Rub your dog’s teeth and gums all over with the brush or cloth using small, circular motions. Then, rinse the brush or cloth and rub the teeth and gums again to get the excess paste off.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Brushing your dog’s teeth regularly will help to prevent plaque from forming, which can protect it from other health conditions later on, such as heart disease and kidney problems. Don’t use human toothpaste since it has fluoride, which can be harmful for your dog."
