Dating coach John Keegan recommends just telling her that she caught your attention, but there are lots of ways to compliment girl. [1] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. Almost everyone appreciates a good compliment. If you choose the right words—walking the thin line between sincere and funny—she just might blush. (For a list of great compliments, check out the section below .) Make the compliment about her choices or her personality instead of just her looks or her belongings, like “You know how to choose a dress,” instead of “You look good in that dress.” Explore topics besides her looks. For example, her smarts and artistic abilities are also great things to bring up. Don't lay it on too thick. One or two compliments per conversation are fine. A constant string of compliments will usually make people feel uncomfortable.

Just like a compliment, don’t lay it on too thick, and keep it light and playful. The simplest way to flirt is to give her a quick wink when you catch her eye, then look away like nothing happened. This works best when someone else is talking. Another basic way to flirt is to give someone a ridiculous compliment with a lighthearted delivery. For example, if the girl flexes to show off her bicep, you might say something like, \"Oh man, I bet you could lift more than me.” Just don’t be condescending—she’ll probably be able to!"

If she hears her friends or family talking about what an amazing, desirable person you are, she may start thinking about you in new romantic ways. Your best bet for this to happen is to simply present your best self to impress her circle. Look as good as you can, have confidence in yourself, and make an effort to be friendly to all of her peers. If you're already dating, impressing her parents with your politeness and achievements can be a major plus. For many girls, the approval of their parents can mean the world.
