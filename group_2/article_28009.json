      "content": "Gradually stir in the half-and-half or milk until you have reached your desired consistency. If the frosting is too runny, add more powdered sugar. If it is too stiff, add more milk. If you want to thicken your frosting without making it sweeter, you can add more butter."

      "title": "Add in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt and mix well.",
      "content": "Add in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt and mix well. The salt is not necessary, but it will help cut down on the overall sweetness."

      "title": "Consider adding a few drops of food coloring.",
      "content": "Consider adding a few drops of food coloring. Squirt a few drops of food coloring over your frosting and mix it well with your electric mixer. If the color is too light, add a few more drops of food coloring and mix again."

      "title": "Put the butter in a heat-safe bowl and microwave it until it has melted.",
      "content": "Put the butter in a heat-safe bowl and microwave it until it has melted. The butter will eventually harden up, but you need it to be liquid in order for the cocoa powder to dissolve properly."

      "title": "Add in the cocoa powder and mix it.",
      "content": "Add in the cocoa powder and mix it. You can use a whisk or an electric mixer. Keep mixing until the cocoa powder is completely blended in and you have a uniform color."

      "title": "Add the milk and vanilla extract.",
      "content": "Add the milk and vanilla extract. Keep mixing until the mixture is frothy and foamy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep mixing while gradually adding in the powdered sugar.",
      "content": "Keep mixing while gradually adding in the powdered sugar. Over time, the frosting will stiffen up and become more buttery in texture. If the frosting is too stiff, add some more milk, one teaspoon at a time, until you have the desired softness. If the frosting is too runny, add in a bit more powdered sugar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the powdered sugar into a bowl.",
      "content": "Pour the powdered sugar into a bowl. Consider pouring the sugar through a sifter to break up any clumps; this will make mixing easier later on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add two tablespoons of milk or water.",
      "content": "Add two tablespoons of milk or water. You can also use another liquid, such as lemon or orange juice, for a more flavorful glaze. If you choose to use juice instead of water or milk, then omit the extracts and food coloring in the next step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider adding some extract or food coloring.",
      "content": "Consider adding some extract or food coloring. Vanilla or almond extract will enhance the flavor, while a few drops of food coloring can lend the glaze some color. Do not add extract or food coloring if you used juice instead of milk or water; both will clash with the natural flavor and color of the juice."

      "content": "Add up to four more tablespoons of your chosen liquid. You can use the icing as is, or you can turn it into a glaze by adding more milk or water (or whatever type of liquid you used). The thinner the icing is, the easier it will be to pour or drizzle over cookies and cupcakes."
