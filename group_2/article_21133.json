      "content": "Master the Two-Handed Backhand Grip. The most common way to perform a two-handed backhand is by placing your dominant hand in the Continental Grip (base index knuckle on the top right slanted facet), and then placing your other hand just above it in the Semi-Western Forehand Grip (base index knuckle on the bottom left slanted facet). This grip: is much more powerful than a one-handed backhand. makes it difficult to slice, volley, and reach out for wider shots."
