      "content": "Q: Queer or Questioning Originally used as a slur, many in the LGBTQ+ community have since reclaimed the word “queer” as an umbrella term for sexual orientations and gender identities that don’t fit the heterosexual and cisgender (identifying as the same sex you were born as) mold.

Go to source From a historical perspective, the subversive nature of kink allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to create communities and subcultures that helped them fight back against rigid and unaccepting societal norms.
