In some of these beliefs, people with a grasshopper spirit animal are often in tune with their intuition, easily adapt to their surroundings, and are prepared to take a leap of faith.

Many Native American cultures recognize animals as spiritual guides meant to teach you lessons and appear to you when you’re in need of help or guidance. Because these beliefs are sacred, using these terms in your own life could be cultural appropriation if you’re not of indigenous descent. In this case, avoid copying images from sacred Native American imagery, like totem poles, and do not use terms like “spirit animal” in direct relation to Native American culture, as it can trivialize Native Americans’ deep relationship with the animal world.
