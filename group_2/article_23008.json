If you date someone once a week, you’ll get to know them intimately a whole lot faster than if you two dated once a month. If you’re seeing your date every other day or so, you might be comfortable committing in a week! Alternatively, it might take a few months if you only occasionally hang.

If you’ve been dating someone for a week or two and you’re wondering when most couples have the exclusivity talk, don’t worry. Many long-term couples made it official after a few months of casual dating. [2] X Research source It’s perfectly fine to pull the trigger earlier if you’re both on board, though. If you two have been friends for a while, or you’ve been casually hooking up, you already know each other well enough to make a decision ASAP. Don’t force yourselves to casually date if you’re both already on board with a relationship. [3] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020.

Most couples go on 5-6 dates before they start discussing a relationship, and some take even longer. Don’t sweat it if you’re a few dates in. [5] X Research source This lines up with the 1- to 3-month timeline for most folks. That’s 1 date every weekend on the fast side, and 1 date every 2-3 weeks or so on the longer side. After 6 dates, you should start to form an impression of whether there’s anything here or not. If you still can’t tell, it’s okay to keep dating, but try to identify whether you want a relationship with this person or not.

This signals that both of you are at least thinking about seeing where this can go, which is a huge sign you’re ready for a relationship . If this were just a quick fling, the two of you would never mention future plans, hopes, or dreams that involve the other person.

If nobody is dealing with some unresolved feelings for an ex, neither of you are seriously dating any other partners, and there’s no trauma either of you are working through, you’re both ready to date.
