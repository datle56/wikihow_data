      "content": "Unbuckle the halter and attach the lead before approaching the horse. Unbuckling the halter before you get near your horse can help the process go more smoothly. Unbuckle or unsnap the crown piece, which is the halter strap that goes behind the horse's ears. Then, clip the lead line to the ring at the bottom of the halter's noseband. [1] X Research source The noseband is at the end of the halter and fits around the horse's nose. Horses tend to get nervous when they're introduced to something new. Fiddling with buckles and ropes after you walk up to it may make your horse jumpy or scare it off. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Walk up to your horse from the front so you don't spook it. Approach your horse head-on at a normal pace so it has plenty of time to see and hear you. Come in from the front left at an angle, if you can; experts say horses prefer this approach. Say the horse's name or murmur soothing words as you get close so your horse won't be spooked or caught off-guard. [3] X Research source Horses have monocular vision, which means they have blind spots in front of their nose, under their head, and in their rear. Sudden sounds or movements, especially in their blind spots, can frighten them. Avoid approaching your horse from behind unless you absolutely have to. Horses don't like surprises!

      "content": "Let your horse sniff your hand and gently stroke its neck to calm it. Continue speaking to your horse in a soft voice to keep it calm. Reach out your right hand and let your horse sniff it. Then, put your hand on its shoulder or neck and stroke it softly. [5] X Research source Avoid making any sudden movements or touching its head immediately since you might startle the horse. It's best to work up to things slowly since horses like to be fully aware of everything happening around them. [6] X Research source If your horse seems calm and happy, you're all set to give the halter a try. If it seems nervous, keep stroking it and speaking softly. Don't try to halter your horse until it's calm. [7] X Research source Pay attention to its ears since horses tend to put their ears back when they're angry or upset. If your horse's ears are tilted forward, it's calm and listening to you. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try again tomorrow if your horse seems nervous or afraid.",
      "content": "Try again tomorrow if your horse seems nervous or afraid. If your horse isn't calm, don't try to halter it yet. For the first couple of days, simply hold the halter so your horse can see it while you're petting it. Let your horse sniff the halter, too, so it gets used to the way it smells. Then, try gently slipping the halter over its nose and ears. It may be a few days before you get the halter on the horse and buckled properly! Go slow and take off the halter if your horse gets upset. Limit halter sessions to 10-15 minutes at a time so your horse doesn't get overwhelmed. Try to be patient and let the horse go at its own pace. Otherwise, your horse might start associating the halter with feeling overwhelmed or scared. End practice sessions positively by offering treats, speaking encouraging words, and stroking the horse's neck."

      "content": "Stand on the horse's left side with the halter in your left hand. Halters are designed to be buckled on the left, so walk around to your horse's left side and stand near the side of its head. Gently stroke the horse's neck a few times with your right hand to make sure it knows you're there and to soothe it. [9] X Research source If your horse flares its nostrils or swishes its tail around, it's agitated or scared. Spend a few more minutes soothing it. If the tail swishing continues, don't try to halter your horse today. [10] X Research source Be especially wary if you can see the whites of your horse's eyes or if its showing you its teeth. This means your horse is pretty upset! It might kick you or try to run. [11] X Research source"

Hold both ends of the rope in one hand so the rope forms a noose around the horse's neck. [12] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source This gives you some control if your horse gets impatient or tries to run away as you're haltering it. Avoid tying the ends of the rope together since this can make the horse feel trapped. Keep the rope loose so it doesn't squeeze the horse's neck. [13] X Research source"

Make sure the halter's noseband is facing the same direction that your horse is facing so you can slip it on easily. Then, grasp the horse's nose gently with your right hand and use your left hand to gently guide the halter over its nose and up to its cheekbone. [14] X Research source If the horse gets antsy or frightened with the halter over its nose, take the halter off. You can try again tomorrow! If the noseband brushes against the large hairs on your horse's nose, it can tickle a bit! This can make your horse shy away from the halter, so try to avoid nudging these hairs if you can.

Make sure the buckle is snug enough that the halter can’t be pulled over the horse's ears, but it shouldn't be so tight that the straps are cutting into the horse's skin. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the straps and buckle so the halter fits properly. The noseband should fall 2 in (5.1 cm) below the bony part of the horse's cheekbone. Make sure you can fit 2 fingers under the noseband and 2 fingers between the buckle and your horse's cheek. Adjust the noseband, chin strap, or buckle, as needed, until everything fits properly. [17] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Some halters have adjustments on each side of the crown piece, too. If the noseband is too tight, your horse won't be able to open its mouth. [18] X Research source The halter should not put any pressure behind the horse's ears. [19] X Expert Source Kate Jutagir Equestrian Specialist & Trainer Expert Interview. 31 March 2020. If the halter still isn't fitting properly after adjustments, it's too small and you need to size up."

      "content": "Grab the lead line near the horse's chin once the halter is in place. Use your right hand to grab the lead line 1–2 ft (0.30–0.61 m) from the horse's muzzle. Then, fold or coil the remainder of the lead line loosely and hold it in your left hand. You're ready to safely lead your horse while its wearing its halter! [20] X Research source Never wrap or tie a lead line rope around your hand. If your horse strains against the halter or tries to run, this can injure your hand pretty badly. It's not a good idea to turn your horse loose when it's wearing a halter since the halter could catch on a tree branch or fence. [21] X Research source"
