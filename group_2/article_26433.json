Professional hair stylist Steven Waldman says this solution breaks down the bonds of your hair, allowing it to conform to the curl pattern. Your stylist will leave the solution on for a few minutes and check a strand of hair to see how the curl looks. If the curls need more time, they’ll leave the solution on for a few more minutes."

It’s normal for perms to loosen up a bit and fall in the first few weeks, but for the most part, your new curls will last for several months. How long they last depends on how quickly your hair grows and how you care for your hair.

It’s important to properly take care of your hair, especially in the first few days, to ensure your curls hold. Hair stylist Tiffany Carnevale-Russo suggests visiting your hair stylist every 4 to 6 weeks to maintain your perm. Any new growth will be straight, so this helps keep your hair consistently curly."
