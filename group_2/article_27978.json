      "title": "Beat the eggs in a bowl with a fork or whisk.",
      "content": "Beat the eggs in a bowl with a fork or whisk. Determine how many servings you'd like to make and plan on using 2 eggs per person. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them until the whites and yolks are combined. [1] X Research source To prevent bits of shell from getting into the eggs, crack them against a flat surface instead of the rim of the bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Put 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of butter into a small non-stick skillet and turn the burner to medium-high. Let the pan heat for about 1 minute so the butter melts and foams a little. Tilt the pan around so the butter coats the bottom and sides of the skillet. [2] X Research source If you prefer, use olive oil or coconut oil instead of butter. If you'd like to make soft-set scrambled eggs, don't heat the butter in the pan. Instead, pour the eggs into the skillet and put the butter in at the same time."

    {
      "title": "Pour the eggs into the skillet and turn the burner to low.",
      "content": "Pour the eggs into the skillet and turn the burner to low. Slowly pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. You should hear them sizzle a little as they hit the pan. Then turn the burner down so the eggs don't cook too quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir and cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Stir and cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes. Use a silicone spatula or a wooden spoon to stir the eggs constantly as they cook. Keep stirring the eggs until they begin to clump together and pull away from the sides of the pan. If you'd like firm scrambled eggs, cook them for 3 to 4 minutes. [3] X Research source For soft-set eggs, move the pan off of the heat and stir the eggs for about 30 seconds. Alternate between cooking and stirring the eggs over heat and off of the heat just until the eggs form soft curds."

    {
      "title": "Serve the scrambled eggs immediately for the best texture.",
      "content": "Serve the scrambled eggs immediately for the best texture. Turn off the burner and quickly transfer the eggs to a serving plate before they cool off. Sprinkle the eggs with additional seasonings, such as salt, pepper, or fresh herbs like basil, tarragon, or parsley. Then serve the eggs with toast, bacon, or fresh fruit. Scrambled eggs won't keep because they'll become watery as they're stored."

      "content": "Put the eggs and seasonings into a microwave-safe bowl. Get out a bowl with a rounded bottom and crack 2 eggs into it. Sprinkle salt and pepper into it. [4] X Research source For a more interesting flavor, use your favorite seasonings instead of salt and pepper."

      "title": "Microwave the eggs for 1 1/2 minutes using high power.",
      "content": "Microwave the eggs for 1 1/2 minutes using high power. Place the bowl into the microwave and heat the eggs for 30 seconds. Stop and stir the eggs before microwaving them for another 30 seconds. Stop and stir the eggs again before you heat them for a final 30 seconds. The eggs should form curds and become set once they've finished cooking."

      "content": "Stir in a little butter for a richer flavor. Remove the bowl from the microwave and enjoy the eggs while they're hot. If you'd like the eggs to have a buttery flavor, stir in 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of butter until it's melted."

      "title": "Mix in a dollop of dairy for extra-creamy scrambled eggs.",
      "content": "Mix in a dollop of dairy for extra-creamy scrambled eggs. To stop the eggs from cooking and to give a rich flavor, stir in a large spoonful of a cold dairy product. For example, stir in cream cheese, sour cream, creme fraiche, mascarpone, or cottage cheese. [6] X Research source If you're using cream cheese, soften it in the microwave for about 10 to 20 seconds. This will prevent the cheese from forming small lumps in the scrambled eggs."

      "title": "Add your favorite cheese if you want a richer flavor.",
      "content": "Add your favorite cheese if you want a richer flavor. Some people like to add a handful of shredded cheese to the liquid eggs while others prefer to top the cooked eggs with cheese. Use a single type of cheese or a combination of your favorites. Try any of these cheeses: [7] X Research source Cheddar Mozzarella Feta Goat cheese Parmesan Smoked gouda"

      "title": "Stir in meat for an extra savory flavor.",
      "content": "Stir in meat for an extra savory flavor. If you want to add raw meat, such as bacon or uncooked chorizo, cook it in the skillet before you pour the eggs in. If you're using cooked meat, stir a handful of the meat into the eggs about 1 minute before they finish cooking. This will give the meat a chance to heat up."

      "title": "Include fresh herbs for a brighter flavor.",
      "content": "Include fresh herbs for a brighter flavor. Chop a few sprigs of fresh herbs and add them to the cooked eggs. Use a single type or combination of your favorite herbs, such as dill, oregano, basil, parsley, or chives. [8] X Research source For a faster way to get a strong herb flavor, stir in enough fresh pesto to taste. Keep in mind that this will change the color of the scrambled eggs."

      "content": "Garnish the eggs with your favorite sauce or spice for a unique flavor. Once you've put the scrambled eggs on serving plates, sprinkle them with a little spice instead of salt and pepper. For example, use a spice blend such as za'atar or garam masala. If you'd rather squirt some sauce over the eggs, try sriracha, salsa verde, soy sauce, or Worcestershire sauce. [9] X Research source For a really simple and tangy topping, squirt a little ketchup on the scrambled eggs."
