      "content": "Locate a major city. There are only so many places that are currently available through the app that will allow you to access 3D maps. New York, Portland, and Chicago are a few examples of cities that are available. Google does continue to add more and more to this app, however, so if the option isn’t currently showing your personal neighborhood, know that Google is working on it. Using the search bar at the top of the page, type in the desired city and hit the magnifying glass at the bottom right of the on-screen keyboard to go to the location."

      "content": "Zoom in. Once the desired location has fully loaded, all that is left is for you to zoom in on the map. To zoom, you can pinch your screen or tap on the “+” icon at the bottom right of the screen. As you do, Google Maps will tilt down to about 45 degrees."

      "title": "View the buildings in the area in 3D.",
      "content": "View the buildings in the area in 3D. Continue zooming in until you see the buildings appearing in 3D. Once you have zoomed in to the appropriate distance and see the buildings in 3D, the view can be adjust even more for different angles. Placing two fingers on the screen and moving them both vertically across the screen will bring the view down closer to street level, but not completely."
