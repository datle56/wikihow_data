      "content": "Look for large spiders. The nursery web spider is one of the largest true spiders. They are so big that they are sometimes mistakenly thought to be close relatives of the tarantula. [2] X Research source The nursery web spider's body is typically about a quarter of an inch to an inch in size, but it may spread its legs out to as far as three inches. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Take note of coloration. Although there are several different variations in coloring, nursery web spiders generally have a base color that is tan, gray, beige, or buff, with darker brown stripes or other markings. [4] X Research source Close inspection of the legs of these spiders will reveal small black spines sticking out."

      "title": "Examine the spider's eyes.",
      "content": "Examine the spider's eyes. Nursery web spiders have eight eyes. They appear in two horizontal rows. The bottom row is nearly straight, while the top row curves upward forming a \"u\" shape. [5] X Research source The eyes of the upper row are somewhat larger than the lower one. Examining the eyes, if you can get close enough to do so, is a good way to differentiate between the nursery web spider and the wolf spider, which have a different arrangement of eyes. Specifically, wolf spiders have three rows of eyes. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the shape of the spider's body.",
      "content": "Look at the shape of the spider's body. The nursery web spider has a slender body. [7] X Research source Its abdomen is widest in the middle and tapers toward the rear. [8] X Research source Male nursery web spiders are typically very slender. An egg-bearing female, however, may have a very large abdomen."

      "title": "Watch for an egg sac.",
      "content": "Watch for an egg sac. Possibly the easiest way to identify a female nursery web spider is to watch for any spiders that are carrying an egg sac. A nursery web spider will carry her eggs in her fangs until they are nearly ready to hatch. [9] X Research source The egg sac looks like a tiny white golf ball. It typically contains a few hundred eggs. [10] X Research source The spider will carry the egg sac underneath her body. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for a nursery web.",
      "content": "Look for a nursery web. When it is almost time for the eggs to hatch, the female spider will spin a protective nursery web. This tangled web is usually spun in high weeds or low shrubs, with the egg sac itself suspended inside a leaf. [12] X Research source After spinning the nursery web, the mother spider will stand guard over it until the eggs have hatched. [13] X Research source The nursery web spider will shelter the young spiders until they are ready to fend for themselves."

    {
      "title": "Watch hunting behavior.",
      "content": "Watch hunting behavior. Nursery web spiders, unlike many other species, do not spin webs for hunting purposes. Instead, these spiders hide in wait for prey (typically insects) and then spring out quickly to catch it. [14] X Research source Instead of entangling insects in a web, the nursery web spider simply overpowers and subdues its prey. [15] X Research source These spiders hunt both by day and by night."

      "title": "Observe posture.",
      "content": "Observe posture. A nursery web spider, while at rest, will often adopt an \"X\" shaped posture, holding its front and hind pairs of legs together. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn the nursery web spider's range.",
      "content": "Learn the nursery web spider's range. Nursery web spiders are quite common across much of North America. They are most commonly found in the eastern part of the US and southeastern Canada. [17] X Research source People disagree about how far west these spiders can be found. Some say they have been found all the way out in the states of the West Coast. [18] X Research source Others disagree. It is safe to say, however, that they are less common in western states and provinces."

      "content": "Look for them in their normal habitats. You can look for nursery web spiders in a variety of different types of habitats. They are often found near water. [19] X Research source They are known to inhabit the following areas: Woodlands Farms and gardens Grasslands and heaths Old fields Rocky areas along the edge of streams and other water"

      "title": "Watch for them in the right season.",
      "content": "Watch for them in the right season. Nursery web spiders mature in late spring and reproduce in the summer. [20] X Research source They are most often seen between the beginning of May and the end of July. [21] X Research source Juvenile spiders will hide under loose bark or rocks in the fall and will remain there for protection during the winter. They will emerge in the spring mature. Like most spiders, the lifecycle of this spider is about year."
