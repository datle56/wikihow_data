      "content": "Wash straight hair 2-4 times a week and curly hair 2-4 times a month. How much you should shampoo your hair depends on your hair type. Curly hair is often thinner and, therefore, drier than straight hair, so while grease builds up at the roots faster for straight hair individuals, people with curly hair don’t need to strip their scalp’s oils as often. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, a study on 1,500 East Asian people found that washing their hair 5 times a week kept it healthy and looking its best. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source On the other hand, people of African descent have historically had routine wash days for their hair, once a week to a couple of times a month. [3] X Research source Overwashing your hair dries out the shaft, which can lead to split ends and breakage, which sets you back on your hair-growing journey. Evan recommends using dry shampoo on your off-days: “[D]ry shampoos like R+Co Death Valley are a must for the days you’re not washing. You just spray them into dry hair, work through with your fingers, then brush [it] out. They refresh your hair and absorb any excess oils.”"

He warns that “while most people need to be using 280-325 degrees, [they often use] the 450-degree maximum.” Search for hairstyles on YouTube with the keywords “No heat” for ideas. Heat tools include straightening and curling irons, hot combs, rollers, and blow dryers."

      "content": "Hydrate your hair with leave-in conditioner and oils. If your hair is usually dry and frizzy, use a leave-on conditioner after you shower. To lock the moisture in at the tips (and prevent split ends), work a hair oil into the ends of your hair, or use natural products like coconut oil, olive oil, and argan oil. While argan oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, and rosemary oil can help protect your hair and make it look better, peppermint oil can actually help it grow. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Unlike the other ones, apply peppermint oil directly to your scalp. You can buy hair treatments at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store, or you can make them yourself . Try using olive oil in a hair mask or making a protein hair mask to heal damaged hair. Apply a mask or other treatment to your hair every week while you’re growing it out. Great household ingredients for hair masks are coconut oil, olive oil, eggs, and yogurt. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim split ends and damaged hair. Some people say regular trims help grow your hair, but that’s only true if the trims are removing damaged sections and split ends that can travel up the shaft of the hair. [6] X Research source If you’re having trouble retaining length, then a trim might be what you need. If your ends are healthy, you can skip the haircuts."

      "title": "Avoid bleaching and coloring your hair.",
      "content": "Avoid bleaching and coloring your hair. Bleach breaks down the protein bands in your hair and makes the strands more porous and brittle. [7] X Research source If you frequently bleach your hair, you may experience a lot of breakage. In extreme cases, damaged hair might have to be fully removed to ensure split ends don’t travel up the shaft. Vegetable dyes and henna don’t damage your hair the same way since they coat the hair shaft instead of penetrating it."

      "content": "Wear your hair in loose or protective styles. Tight ponytails and buns can break your hair and cause it to fall out. Switch out your elastics for thick scrunchies and don’t pull your hair tight. If you have natural hair, you may find that wearing a protective style , like cornrows or box braids, can help you retain length. [9] X Research source Tightly wrapping your hair after washing it can also cause it to break. Try scrunching your hair with a cotton t-shirt instead."

[11] X Research source Eggs are also a good source of B vitamins! Hair stylist Patrick Evan says, “Healthy hair growth starts internally. Making sure you’re eating a balanced diet and drinking lots of water is your first step.” Several vitamins fall under the umbrella of B-complex vitamins.

Replace your soda, juice, and coffee beverages with water if you don't think you're getting enough. Think of drinking water like watering a plant. The water you drink will nourish your hair from the scalp, just like plants are nourished from their roots."

Meat is a great source of protein, but vegetarians can get it through foods like beans, nuts, whole grains, spinach, and peanut butter. When you don’t get enough protein in your diet, you’re more likely to experience shedding and breakage. [14] X Research source While it’s more important to eat healthy, high-protein foods than it is to eat a set amount of protein a day, you can estimate how many grams you need to aim for by multiplying your weight (in pounds) by .36.

While most daily multivitamins will do the trick, double-check to make sure yours has Biotin, vitamin C, and your B-complex vitamins. [16] X Research source If you have any allergies, talk to your doctor before starting a multivitamin. Sometimes, inactive ingredients in the vitamins can cause allergic reactions. Multivitamins can interfere with certain medications. It's extremely important that your doctor knows your medical history, your current prescriptions and medicines, and has given you the all-clear to start taking multivitamins."

[17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Therefore, it is often recommended to take a Biotin supplement that’s at least 500-700 micrograms to prevent becoming deficient. Biotin supports hair growth by making the hair more elastic and thus less likely to break off. You may have to take Biotin for months (ideally 3-6 months) before seeing big results, although it can start benefiting your hair within a month. Biotin is generally safe, but if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, double-check with your doctor before beginning this supplement."

Strong hair is more likely to grow and resist breakage. Plus, fish oil can make your hair shiny, too! Low doses (less than 3 grams) of fish oil is typically safe. In high doses, fish oil can prevent blood from clotting, decrease your blood pressure, or cause rashes and diarrhea.

      "content": "How much does hair grow in a month? Hair normally grows .5 inches (1 cm) in a month. Your hair follicles go through three different stages as they grow: anagen (growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (rest). [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because of the different states your hair follicles could be in, hair growth is variable, but often grows about .5 inches (1.3 cm) a month. Anywhere up to 15% of your hair will be in the telogen phase at a given time. This phase can last up to a year on your scalp, and means that you may have some months where you don’t see as much growth as previous ones.

However, if you have very curly hair (4C, for example), 2 inches may only look a fraction of the length unless you wet and stretch your hair. [22] X Research source"
