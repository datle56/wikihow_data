      "content": "Pour ½ cup (45 g) oatmeal into a microwave safe bowl. For most types of oats , like quick-cooking or rolled oats, ½ cup (45 g) is an average serving size, but you can always double or triple this amount to make more oatmeal. [1] X Research source If you’re using loose oats, measure out the portion with a dry measuring cup . If you’re preparing individually packaged instant oatmeal, simply open the package and dump the contents into the bowl. They’re pre-portioned, so there’s no need to do a lot of measuring."

      "content": "Add 1 cup (240 ml) of water and stir. Fill a liquid measuring cup to the 1 cup (240 ml) mark with cold water, then pour it on top of the dry oats. Give the oats a stir until the water is evenly distributed throughout. There should be no clumps or dry spots in the bowl. 1 cup (240 ml) of water may look like a lot in ½ cup (45 gm) of oats, but keep in mind that the oats will absorb moisture quickly when cooked. If you doubled or tripled the amount of oats you used in the first step, make sure to double or triple the amount of water accordingly. For example, if you used 1 cup (90 g) of oats, use 2 cups (480 ml) of water. For thicker, creamier oatmeal, use regular or non-dairy milk instead of water."

If you’d prefer a thicker oatmeal, up the time to 2 minutes, or even slightly longer. [2] X Research source If you’re using a heartier type of oats, like traditional rolled oats or steel-cut oats, you may need to increase the cook time to 2½-3 minutes to make sure they get tender enough.

After a quick stir, your oatmeal will be fully prepared and ready to eat. Just allow it to cool for a minute or two before you take your first spoonful, so you don’t burn yourself."

You can also add a dollop of fresh cream or your favorite nut butter. It’s entirely up to you! [4] X Research source If you used individually packaged instant oatmeal, give it a taste before adding extra toppings and sweeteners. These packages tend to be flavored with additives like brown sugar, cinnamon, and apples already, so they might not need too much else."

      "content": "Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Fill a regular tea kettle with fresh water and place it on the stovetop over high heat, or fill an electric kettle with water and set it to boil. Depending on how thick you like your oatmeal, you’ll need ½ cup to 1 cup (120-240 ml) boiling water for each ½ cup (45 g) serving of dry oats. This method can be used to prepare packaged instant oatmeal, as well as loose steel-cut and rolled oat varieties."

Drizzle the water onto the dry oats, stirring continuously as you pour. For creamier oats, use about 1 cup (240 ml) of water. If you prefer your oatmeal thick, use only ½ cup to ¾ cup (120-180 ml) water. The oats will thicken and absorb the water as they cook, so it’s typically better to use a little more water than you think you’ll need."

To avoid burning your mouth, hold off on taking a bite until most of the steam has dissipated. This also gives the oats time to soften and fully absorb the water. [5] X Research source If you’re in a rush, a splash of cream or a dollop of Greek yogurt will help fresh-cooked oats cool off quicker. [6] X Research source"

This is the optimal temperature for simmering oats, so hold off on adding the oats until your water or milk reaches this point.

Rather than watching the clock, keep a close eye on the oatmeal as it thickens, and stir periodically while it's cooking. [10] X Research source It may take anywhere from 8-10 minutes to simmer a pot of old fashioned rolled oats. Because of their tougher texture, steel-cut oats may require as long as 20 minutes to soften up enough. [11] X Research source Over stirring oats breaks down their starches, causing them to turn gluey and neutralizing much of their natural flavor. To avoid this, stir the mixture periodically, but be careful not to overdo it."

Transfer the oatmeal to a bowl, and use a spoon or spatula to scrape the sides of the pot to make sure you get everything.

You’re aiming for approximately a 1:1 ratio of oats to milk, so if you double or triple the amount of oats you’re using, be sure to increase the amount of milk accordingly. It may take a couple trial runs before you get the proportions exactly right. If your overnight oatmeal turns out a little soggy the first time, cut back on the amount of milk you use on your next attempt. If they’re overly dry, add an extra splash just before serving.
