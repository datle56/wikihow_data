      "content": "Track down the mouse. If you saw something running by out of the corner of your eye, see if you can figure out where it went. Mice are pretty fast, and just chasing them around the house isn’t usually the best way to catch them. Instead, track down the mouse to its nest so you can catch it using a trap. If you didn’t see where the mouse went, try looking for the nest. A mouse’s nest is usually composed of scraps of cloth, paper, hair, and other odds and ends. It will have a musty smell. Look in the back corners of closets, under the sink, behind the refrigerator, in cracks in the wall, and in any other dark, hidden places. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source You can also track down the mouse by looking for droppings. Mouse droppings look like pieces of black rice. If you see some droppings, the nest is probably nearby. You can also simply set traps in areas where you know mice tend to gather in your home, such as your garage, basement, attic or kitchen."

      "title": "Set a humane trap.",
      "content": "Set a humane trap. Humane traps let you trap a mouse without killing it. Most humane traps work by using bait to lure the mouse into a maze-like tunnel. While the mouse is inside, the trap closes behind it, making it impossible for the mouse to escape. You can buy one of these traps online or in a hardware or home supply store. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Humane traps tend to be a little more expensive than snap traps, but like snap traps they’re reusable, so it’s worth the investment. Bait the trap according to the instructions using peanut butter, oatmeal, or nuts. Set the trap near the mouse’s nest and wait. Check the trap every day to see if a mouse is inside."

      "content": "Build a homemade trap if you’d rather not buy one. You can also make your own trap using materials you can find around the house or in a hardware store. This may be a cheaper option than buying a prefabricated trap. To make a simple soup can trap: [4] X Research source Take the lid off a soup can, empty the soup can, and drill a small hole in the base. Alternatively, you can take an empty soft drink can and poke a hole in the bottom with a screwdriver or awl. Take a bucket (ideally at least 5 gallons (19 L) in volume) and grease the inside with cooking oil to make the walls slippery. Drill 2 small holes on opposite sides of the bucket, directly under the rim. Feed a length of wire through the can and through the holes on the bucket, and make sure the can can spin freely on the wire. Wrap the wire through the holes on the bucket a few times to secure it. Lean a piece of wood against the bucket so the mouse is able to climb up and get to the wire. Coat the can with peanut butter, oatmeal or nuts. The mouse should crawl along the wire to reach the bait, then slip off into the bucket, where it won’t be able to climb out."

      "content": "Release the mouse outside once you’ve trapped it. Don’t just take the mouse into your backyard to release it. Walk, bike, or drive your trap at least 1 mile (1.6 km) from your house, since you don’t want it to come right back inside. Release the mouse in a park or a forest. When you’re ready to release it, just open the trap and let it hop out. Some animal rights organizations advocate releasing the mouse into another part of your property, such as your garage or shed. This will give the mouse a better chance of surviving, especially if it’s been living in your house its whole life.

      "title": "Try shooing it out of your house.",
      "content": "Try shooing it out of your house. There’s one more humane way you can try to get a mouse out of your house: just shoo it outside! Sometimes a mouse will just wander in, confused and wanting to leave just as much as you want it to. Help it along by using a broom to scoot it towards an open door. This may require chasing the mouse around a little before you’re able to get it outside. However, when all’s said and done, it’s faster than trying to trap and release it. Of course, if you use this method, later, the mouse may decide to come right back in, especially if it got inside through a crack in a door or a hole in your foundation. If your house isn’t sealed against mice, take measures to seal it up and use repellents so mice won’t wander in."

      "title": "Set snap traps.",
      "content": "Set snap traps. This is widely considered to be the most effective method for getting rid of a mouse. Be sure to get a snap trap designed for mice rather than rats. Bait the trap with peanut butter, oatmeal or nuts according to the instructions and place it in an area where mice tend to be active. When the weight of the mouse presses against the trap, a wire springs down and kills it instantly. Using snap traps isn’t the most pleasant way to get rid of mice, but it does at least get the job done. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Place the trap against the wall so it is perpendicular to the wall (i.e., the trap and the edge of the wall form a “T” shape), with the baited end closest to the wall. Set traps in places where you’ve noticed signs of a mouse, like droppings or a nest. Be careful not to put them in places where children or pets are likely to find and play with the trap."

      "title": "Check the traps often and dispose of dead mice.",
      "content": "Check the traps often and dispose of dead mice. Once you set a mousetrap of any kind, don’t forget to check it every day. You may need to replace the bait if a smart mouse figured out how to steal it. And if you caught a mouse, just leaving it to sit for several days is unsanitary. The dead mouse could attract bugs and start to smell, so don’t forget to check your traps. If you find that you’ve caught a mouse, get rid of it promptly. Remove the dead mouse from the trap and place it in a plastic bag, then throw the bag inside a trashcan with a secure lid. [7] X Research source To protect yourself from disease, put on gloves when you handle a dead mouse, and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water afterwards."

      "title": "Avoid using inhumane glue traps.",
      "content": "Avoid using inhumane glue traps. Glue traps look like little cardboard houses or trays. The floor of the trap is lined with a very sticky glue that holds mice in place as soon as they run inside. Once mice are caught, they eventually die of starvation. Because these traps cause unnecessary stress, pain, and suffering for the animal, most animal rights organizations strongly recommend not using them. If you must outright kill the mouse, choose a snap trap instead of a glue trap. [8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also don't recommend glue traps, since live mice or other animals caught in the traps may urinate or defecate, potentially exposing anyone who handles the trap to disease. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Glue traps can also be harmful to pets in your home, who may step on the glue and get it stuck to their paws or fur. Some countries and regions have strict laws regulating the sale and use of glue traps."

      "content": "Invest in a cat for long-term rodent control. Cats are natural predators of mice, and having one around is a great way to keep the rodent population down. [10] X Research source If you don’t already have one, see if a friend who’s a cat owner would mind if you had the cat come stay with you for a few days. Not all cats like to catch mice, so this isn’t guaranteed to work, but it’s often just as effective as setting a trap. Some animal rescue organizations adopt out rescued feral cats to homes and businesses to work as mousers. [11] X Research source Search “adopt a working cat” to find mousers for adoption near you."

      "content": "Seal your doors to keep mice from getting in. If you have a crack between the bottom of your front door and the floor, a mouse can walk right in. Mice can squeeze through very slim cracks, so don’t just look at a crack and assume nothing could get through.

[12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Look around the vicinity of your front door to see if there are any other places mice could be getting through. You might have holes in your foundation that need to be plugged. You can also stuff them with steel wool. Cover any vents around your home, such as drier or attic vents, with mesh screen. [13] X Research source Also check your screen doors to make sure they don’t have holes."

      "content": "Keep your trash contained. Mice are attracted to food smells, so it’s important to keep your trash well contained within your house and your yard. Use trash cans with tight-fitting lids both inside and outside. Make sure trash gets removed from the premises properly on trash collection day. [14] X Research source Mice may also be attracted to recycling containers, since the bottles, cans and boxes they contain could still have traces of food in them. Keep recycling in a container with a secure lid as well. If you have a compost bin, make sure it’s located well far away from your home. It may be attracting mice."

      "content": "Clean up messes promptly. Both inside your house and in your yard, clean up messes that could provide food and shelter for mice. When you leave food out, neglect to pick up crumbs, or even have a pile of trash in your yard, mice may start to move in. Keep your home neat and clean to make it less hospitable to mice. [16] X Research source You can also block their access to food by keeping food in sealed containers. For example, you might transfer cereal from cardboard boxes to plastic or glass containers with tight fitting lids. If you have pets, get rid of their food overnight instead of leaving it out."

      "content": "Try using repellents along with other pest control methods. Some people advocate using peppermint oil as a natural mouse repellent, but it’s unclear how effective this method actually is. Try mixing 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of peppermint oil with 1 cup (240 mL) of water in a spray bottle and spritzing it around in areas where mice tend to congregate. [17] X Research source You can also buy ultrasonic mouse repellent devices and install them in your home. There’s no strong evidence that peppermint or other essential oils can effectively keep mice away, and while ultrasonic mouse repellents will keep mice away for a while, they will eventually get used to them. Use these methods in combination with other pest control techniques. [18] X Research source"
