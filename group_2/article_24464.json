Users on Depop and other e-commerce sites like eBay, Mercari, and Poshmark often employ similar schemes to scam both buyers and sellers out of their money, like: Requesting transactions be made off Depop . Both buyers or sellers might ask you to make your transaction on a third-party payment app instead of Depop. This can prevent you from getting Depop’s help with the issue or receiving a refund. Emails impersonating Depop . Some users may email you from an account impersonating Depop in an attempt to steal your personal information. Remember that official Depop emails come from “@depop.com” and that they will never ask you for personal information off of the app. Selling counterfeit items . Some sellers might list fake items as the real deal. Always inspect items for signs of authenticity and request authentication from the seller. Use your best judgment, too—if an item seems too good to be true, it likely is. Switching shipping addresses . In this scheme, a buyer asks a seller to send the item to a different address than what’s listed on your receipt. This allows them to claim that they never received their item and get a refund. Always send items to the address listed in your seller’s receipt to stay protected by Depop."

Many Depop users complain about Depop’s commission fee, which takes 5 to 10% of your sale, and slow response times from Depop’s customer service team. There is also the risk of running into scams from buyers and sellers. However, these disadvantages aren’t unique to Depop and are broadly experienced by people who use similar e-commerce sites like Mercari, eBay, and Poshmark. If your items aren’t selling well on Depop, try a different site: Poshmark is geared towards Millennials and older while Depop is geared more towards Gen Z and young Millennials. Etsy is regarded as a great place to sell vintage pieces. As an alternative to using Depop or an e-commerce site, sell your items to a local consignment store."
