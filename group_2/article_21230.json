      "title": "Pick a suitable sprig to take softwood cuttings from.",
      "content": "Pick a suitable sprig to take softwood cuttings from. Look for a stem with little to no flowers, [2] X Research source and plenty of young leaf nodes or bumps. Pick a stem with new growth, rather than a fully mature stem. The stem should snap when you bend it. If the stem does not snap when you bend it, the plant is too young. If you cannot bend the stem easily, then the plant is too old. [3] X Research source The best time to take a cutting is in the morning, during spring or early summer. The leaf nodes appear as little bumps along the stem. They are important, as that's where the roots will form. If it is not possible to find a sprig without any flowers, choose a sprig with as few flowers as possible, and nip them off. Producing flowers takes a lot of energy, and your cuttings will need all the energy they can get to put out roots. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut a sprig from the plant.",
      "content": "Cut a sprig from the plant. Sterilize a sharp knife or garden shears with rubbing alcohol, and then cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) section from the top of the plant. Cut at an angle, just below the leaf node. If there is no node 4 inches from the top of the plant, cut at the node closest to the top. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the sprig in a cup of water.",
      "content": "Place the sprig in a cup of water. The water should be deep enough to hold several of the leaf nodes. Avoid submerging any leaves in the water, however, or you will risk rotting the leaves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a suitable environment for the cup and sprig.",
      "content": "Find a suitable environment for the cup and sprig. A bright window is ideal, as long as there is no direct sunlight. While sunlight is important for plants, too much sunlight can burn or wilt the leaves. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Change the water daily.",
      "content": "Change the water daily. Because there is so little water in the cup, it will grow murky and stale quickly. You will need to pour out the old water and fill the cup with fresh water every day until the roots develop. This will take one to two weeks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the cutting to a small pot.",
      "content": "Transfer the cutting to a small pot. When the roots are about 1 to 2 inches long, take the cutting out of the water and plant it in a small pot filled with good-quality soil. Make sure that the soil is damp but not soggy. Keep the pot in a bright window, but out of direct sunlight. The pot must have a drainage hole at the bottom. Consider dipping the roots in rooting hormone to encourage root development before planting the cutting in the soil."

    {
      "title": "Transplant the cutting into a larger pot or into your garden.",
      "content": "Transplant the cutting into a larger pot or into your garden. Once the cutting is large and strong enough, you can choose to transfer the plant to a larger pot or your garden. Keep in mind, however, that catmint is an invasive plant. If you choose to plant it in your garden, make sure that you surround it with a brick, plastic, or wood border so that it does not spread over your entire garden. You can also confine your catmint by planting it in a pot or planter under the surface of the soil. While not as attractive to cats as catnip, catmint still attracts cats. If you dislike cats rolling over your plants , you may have to protect your catmint by rolling chicken wire over it."

    {
      "title": "Select a suitable pot.",
      "content": "Select a suitable pot. Make sure that the pot has a drainage hole in the bottom. If you are planning on using very fine soil, you can prevent it from escaping through the drainage hole by lining the bottom of the pot with a coffee filter. The paper will prevent any soil from escaping through the hole, but it will still let water pass through and drain."

    {
      "title": "Fill the pot with damp soil.",
      "content": "Fill the pot with damp soil. The soil should be good-quality gardening soil with nutrients. It should also be damp, but not soaking wet or soggy. Catmint will also do well in coco peat, perlite, rockwool, vermiculite, and other soilless potting mixes. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make holes in the soil.",
      "content": "Make holes in the soil. Take a chopstick, dowel, pen, or pencil and make a few holes in the soil. You will be inserting the cuttings into these holes, so make as many holes as you have cuttings."

      "title": "Cut a section from the plant.",
      "content": "Cut a section from the plant. Sterilize a sharp knife or garden shears with rubbing alcohol, then cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) section from the top of the plant. Cut just below a leaf bump, at a slight angle. If there is no leaf bump 4 inches from the top of the plant, then cut below the closest bump."

      "title": "Plant the cuttings.",
      "content": "Plant the cuttings. Gently tuck each cutting into the holes you have made and pat the soil around the stems. Make sure that there are at least a few leaf bumps on the stem section going into the soil. The roots will grow from these bumps. Consider dipping the cuttings in rooting hormone to encourage root development."

      "title": "Create a mini greenhouse over the cutting.",
      "content": "Create a mini greenhouse over the cutting. You can do this by placing a glass cloche over the pot, or by draping a plastic bag over it. [8] X Research source This will help keep the cutting damp while it grows."

      "title": "Transplant the cuttings to a larger space.",
      "content": "Transplant the cuttings to a larger space. After your cuttings grow a few more sets of leaves, you can move them to a larger pot or a sunny spot in your garden. Keep in mind, however, that catmint is very invasive. To prevent it from taking over your garden, consider reining it in with a brick, plastic, or wood border. Also, cats do find catmint attractive; if you do not wish to have cats rolling around in your catmint, consider protecting it by covering the plant with chicken wire. If you are planting multiple cuttings in a garden, choose a location with well-drained soil that gets plenty of sunlight. Plant the cuttings 18 to 24 inches (45.72 to 60.96 centimeters) apart.
