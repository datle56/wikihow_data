Many retailers online offer the seeds for sale in large quantities. Purchase a number of seeds that is right for you. If you have leftovers, a moringa seed may be eaten once the outer shell is removed. Chew the seed thoroughly. [2] X Research source"

Cut off a branch 3 feet (0.91 m) long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Choose a healthy looking branch from the tree to remove. Use pruning shears to make a diagonal cut on the branch at both ends. Keep the branch at least 3 feet (0.91 m) long. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a 10 US gal (38 L) pot with 85% soil, 10% sand, and 5% compost. Moringas need a well-draining potting mixture, otherwise, the seeds will become waterlogged. Mixing potting soil with sand and compost will create a nutritious and well-drained mix for your new moringa seeds. [4] X Research source Use more or less sand and compost depending on the soil you use."

      "content": "Plant your moringa in the pot. Moringas cannot survive the winter if it drops below 32 °F (0 °C), so keep moringas in pots to transport them inside and outside easily. If your climate does not drop below freezing, you can plant moringas directly outside in a similar soil mixture. [5] X Research source If you’re planting seeds, remove the shell and plant them 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep and 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart. Use your finger to push holes into the potting mixture. [6] X Research source If you’re planting a cutting, expose the nodes of a cutting and push it ⅓ of the way into a 15 US gal (57 L) pot. [7] X Research source Pack the dirt tightly with your hands so that the cutting is able to stand on its own and so the potting mixture is firm around it. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Water the soil with a watering can until it is damp. The soil should be saturated, but not overwatered. If there is standing water on the top of the soil, you’ve watered too much and your soil likely has poor drainage. Check the moisture by sticking your finger into the soil down to the first knuckle. [9] X Research source Water once a week or more depending on your climate so the soil stays damp."

      "content": "Transplant moringas grown from seeds when they are 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm). When moringas reach this size, they will begin competing for resources in the soil and need to be moved to individual pots. Carefully use a ruler or transplant tool to loosen the soil around one of the seedlings. Lift the root system and place it into the pot. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your moringa in a sunny indoor or outdoor spot. To grow healthy and strong, your moringa tree will need around 6 hours of direct sunlight. Moringa trees are from a tropical climate, so they need the maximum amount of sunlight you can provide. Keep them in an area that receives full sun throughout the day."

      "content": "Water your moringa once a week. Even though moringas are drought-tolerant, they should still have a weekly watering while they are establishing. Put your finger into the soil up to the second knuckle. If it feels dry, water. Be careful not to overwater the soil, or else the roots will become waterlogged and possibly develop rot. If it has rained during the week, your moringa has gotten enough water for the week."

Once the trees reach 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m), cut them back so they are at your desired level. Any branches you remove can be dried and propagated to plant another tree."

If you live in a temperate climate, you will want to store your tree inside your home or in a greenhouse during the winter. Moringas are susceptible to the frost and will not survive through the winter. [11] X Research source Moringas can grow up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall in a year, so plan accordingly with how much space you have available. Moringa can be restarted each year with cuttings taken from the previous season. Cuttings from moringa trees are the same age as the tree it was cut from."

If you wait until they ripen, the inside may have a stringy and less desirable consistency. Boil the seed pods until they are soft and squeeze the inner flesh out to eat. The exterior of the pod is fibrous and inedible."
