      "content": "Many popular soaps contain ingredients that dry out your skin. If you already have cracked skin on your fingers, regular soaps will make your condition worse. Look for a liquid soap with words like \"gentle\" on the label, or that state clearly that they're for sensitive skin. [2] X Research source Bar soaps typically dry your skin out more than liquid soaps, even if they contain moisturizers. If you prefer bar soap, look for one that is oil-based or that includes soothing ingredients, such as aloe or oatmeal. Avoid using anti-bacterial gels to clean your hands. They contain alcohol and can dry your skin further, making the condition worse. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Limit bathing 5 to 10 minutes to keep your skin from drying out. Although it may seem counter-intuitive, long exposure to water can actually dry out your skin. The water dilutes and strips away the oils that naturally moisturize your skin. [6] X Research source You may also want to switch to a gentle liquid bath or shower wash, particularly if you're experiencing dryness on other parts of your skin. Bath and shower washes designed for babies and children are naturally gentle and typically unscented."

      "content": "Rubbing your skin can worsen the peeling of cracked, dry skin. When you've finished washing, gently pat your skin to dry it rather than rubbing it. A soft washcloth or hand towel works better on your skin than a paper towel. [7] X Research source Never use air dryers on cracked skin – the heat will cause excessive dryness and could worsen your condition. Try carrying a handkerchief with you to dry your hands in public places where hand dryers and paper towels may be all that is available."

      "content": "Lotion after drying your hands locks in moisture. Dry your hands thoroughly, then gently apply an oil- or cream-based moisturizer. After the moisturizer is absorbed, gently massage your hands and fingers with steady pressure to allow the moisturizer to absorb more deeply. This will lock in the natural oils and moisture in your skin to promote healing. [8] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. [9] X Research source Dot small amounts of the moisturizer all over your hands and then dab it in, rather than rubbing it. You don't want to exacerbate any peeling or cracking. If your skin still feels dry, you may want to reapply the moisturizer, repeating the same process."

After that has dried, gently dab a thicker ointment onto your hands and fingers. Cover your hands with light cotton gloves to seal in the moisture. [10] X Expert Source R.

[12] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. However, these ointments will likely feel greasy and may inhibit your activity during the day. In a pinch, thin cotton socks can work if you don't have appropriate gloves available. Just be aware that they may slip off during the night and you may end up with grease stains on your sheets from the ointment."

Most liquid skin bandages come with an applicator. Wash your hands and dry them. You may want to wait a minute to make sure the skin is completely dry. Then use the applicator to paint the liquid skin bandage over the deeper crack. [13] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital.

If you're cleaning the bathroom or washing dishes, rubber gloves can protect your cracked skin and keep your condition from getting worse.

Make sure your gloves are completely dry on the inside before you put them on your hands. If you're going to reuse rubber gloves, take them off from the wrist so that chemicals from the cleansers don't touch your skin. Rinse off the exterior and hang them up to dry."
