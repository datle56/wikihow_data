      "content": "Soak chopped-up peel in warm alcohol overnight. To make a citrus spray insecticide, roughly chop the peel from at least a couple of oranges, lemons, or other citrus fruit. Put these into a pot along with enough ethanol (or other alcohol) to cover them. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Let the mixture soak for 12 hours, then strain into a spray bottle. [1] X Research source Spray onto silverfish when you see them, or onto the areas around your bookshelves to make them less appealing to the insects. Any form of high-proof alcohol can extract a natural chemical called limonene from the peel. You can try using water instead, but it extracts limonene much less effectively. [2] X Research source Limonene (at high enough concentration) is proven to kill silverfish. Oranges or mandarins are good choices, but just about any citrus fruit peel contains lots of limonene. [3] X Research source This recipe isn't hard science. The more peel you use and the longer you soak it, the stronger your spray will be, but feel free to experiment."

      "content": "Mint and thyme are your best bets, but others might work. Try drying sprigs of herbs to keep next to or behind your books, bruising them a little to help them release their scent. Mint and thyme both contain lots of limonene, while sage, hyssop, rosemary, and fennel have some (though much less). [4] X Research source Limonene is dangerous for silverfish to contact, so the goal is to release enough of it that they see your bookshelves as a danger zone. Not all mint is created equal. Fortunately, spearmint is quite high in limonene, while \"mountain mint\" is even better if you can find it. [5] X Research source If your local grocery store just sells \"mint\" with no other description, that's probably spearmint (at least in the US). [6] X Research source Until some scientists start to focus on this vital course of research, it's hard to say exactly how many herbs you need. The more concentrated the better, so bunch them up wherever you see the most damage. Replace the herbs once they dry out."

      "title": "Strong options include oils of lemon peel, celery, and mint.",
      "content": "Strong options include oils of lemon peel, celery, and mint. A pure essential oil (not diluted with a carrier oil) can be an extremely concentrated delivery system for substances that silverfish hate. While wearing gloves, place a few drops of essential oil onto the ends of shelves, wall crevices, and anywhere you see silvery dust. To make an insecticide spray that covers larger areas and is safer for children and pets, instead mix 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) essential oil, 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) liquid dish soap, and 2 quarts (1.9 L) water, and shake well in a spray bottle. [7] X Research source Essential oils may be natural, but they're also dangerous when they're not diluted. If you get it on your bare skin, wipe it off with vegetable oil to prevent a burn or allergic reaction. Don't use them on bookshelves that children or pets can access. [8] X Research source Mint oil is a proven insecticide against silverfish. [9] X Research source Lemon peel oil and celery seed (or \"celery fruit\") oil both contain extremely high concentrations of limonene, a known silverfish insecticide. (Check the details before you buy: essential oil from celery root is about seven times weaker. [10] X Research source ) Neem oil is okay, but weaker than mint. [11] X Research source Cinnamon, cloves, and lavender are all traditional silverfish repellents, but there's not a lot of evidence behind them. [12] X Research source (Then again, most agricultural scientists are busy studying pests that eat grapes and not Grapes of Wrath .) It's best not to use a diffuser as a permanent insect repeller. Being around a diffuser for more than an hour can cause headaches and other unpleasant symptoms. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Bait the trap and give the insects something to climb. At least you can be thankful for one thing: silverfish aren't the smartest. Drop a piece of bread into a glass jar, and they'll happily fall in to eat it and get stuck. Help them get to the top by wrapping the outside of the jar in masking tape (which they can climb). [14] X Research source Place the jars around your bookshelves to distract and trap silverfish before they get to the paper. Instead of the masking tape, you can tape the short edge of an index card securely to the top of the jar. Arrange the card so the other end touches the ground, forming a ramp the silverfish can climb up. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Moist rolls of newspaper are a quick, effective lure. A damp newspaper, rolled up and held together loosely by a rubber band, is very attractive to silverfish as a food source and resting place. Pick it up every two to four days (without opening it), take it outside to the trash, and replace it with a new one. [16] X Research source This is probably going to catch more silverfish than a glass jar would, but of course you might not want to live with wet newspaper in your living room."

Use a bulb duster or a plastic squeeze bottle to blow one of these fine dusts into cracks and crevices around your bookshelves. [17] X Research source Unfortunately, without a synthetic insecticide mixed in, they are unlikely to end the infestation. That said, they will still hurt or kill the silverfish that touch it directly. Careful—diatomaceous earth and silica gel are forms of fine sand that can irritate your lungs and skin somewhat.

[25] X Research source Note that the adults can still survive for up to three years. Use deterrents and traps to help protect your books immediately. Try this method alongside them as an investment in your future, to make the infestation less of a problem down the line."

[26] X Research source A cedar box is a pretty way to protect your most sentimental books and papers, even if it's a bit impractical for a whole library. Cedar probably works because it contains limonene, a chemical that can kill silverfish when it's more concentrated. A lot of coniferous trees (trees with needle-like leaves) also release at least a little of this, so you could experiment with their leaves or bark if they grow nearby. [27] X Research source"
