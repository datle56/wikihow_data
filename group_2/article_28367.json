      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. You want your friend’s older brother to think of you romantically and you also want him to like you for you. So, don’t try to act any different or be someone you aren’t to make your friend’s older brother think of you romantically. Just know that if he is going to think of you romantically, then you being yourself will be enough. If you are normally bubbly and silly, then don’t start trying to act mysterious and quiet because you think your friend’s brother might like it. Do the things you would normally do when you are around your friend and your friend’s brother. Remind yourself that your friend’s brother will be more likely to think of you romantically if he doesn’t think you’re fake. You could say to yourself, “It’ll be easier for him to like me if I just act like me.” Remember, though, that dating is so generationally nuanced that at times it may be hard to find common ground when it comes to cultural references and hobbies with an older man."

      "content": "Present yourself well. You can make your friend’s older brother think of you romantically if you look nice when you are around him. You don’t have to do a total makeover or buy a new wardrobe – you still want to look like you and show him your personality. You can, however, make sure that you make a good impression when you are around your friend’s older brother. Make sure your hair is combed, your face is washed, your clothes are clean, and you smell good. Make sure you dress appropriately, though. You don’t need to look out of place or feel uncomfortable just to get your friend’s brother to look at your romantically. For example, if you are meeting at your friend’s house so you two can go jogging, don’t wear an outfit you would wear out for a special occasion. Just wear an outfit that is clean, fits, matches, and good for sweating in when you meet up with your friend."

      "content": "Show confidence. Your friend’s older brother will be more likely to notice you and possibly think of you romantically if you show him your personality by being confident around him. Remind yourself that you are an interesting, exciting person and that you can be confident around your friend’s older brother. Hold your head up, stand up straight, and relax your shoulders to show that you are confident. Smile and look your friend’s older brother in the eyes when you are talking to him– it’s a great way to show that you’re confident. For example, when you go to your friend’s house, stand up straight, smile, and look your friend’s brother in the eyes when you say hi. Use a clear, confident voice when you are talking. Don’t whisper – but, don’t yell either. Just speak in a normal, calm tone of voice. For instance, if your friend’s older brother is picking you guys up from dance class, you could smile and say, “Hey, Josh. Thanks for picking us up” in a clear voice."

      "title": "Act calm and mature.",
      "content": "Act calm and mature. It will be hard for your friend’s older brother to think of you romantically if you start giggling and saying, “OMG!” every time he’s around you. Being calm and mature when you see him will help him see you as more than just his younger sibling’s friend. Remember that being mature is not the same as trying to act older than you are. Acting mature means acting your age. When you see your friend’s brother, calmly smile and say “Hi, How are you?” Remind yourself that staying calm and showing how mature you are will help your friend’s brother see you as a person and not just as his sibling’s friend. You might say to yourself, “If I relax and act my age, he’ll be able to see my great qualities and might think of me romantically. For example, if you happen to see your friend’s brother at the mall, don’t run up to him and start jumping up and down in excitement. Instead, take a deep breath, calmly walk up to him, and say something such as, “Hi, Bruce! What are you doing out here?”"

      "title": "Find out about his interests.",
      "content": "Find out about his interests. The more you know about your friend’s older brother, the easier it will be for you to talk to him and make him think of you romantically. You don’t have to interview your friend, but pay attention for clues that tell you more about your friend’s older brother. When you are at your friend’s house, pay attention to things you see around the house. For example, a flyer for a band might give you insight into what type of music your friend’s brother likes. Notice if your friend talks about their brother’s activities. For example, if your friend mentions that their brother plays a sport or an instrument. It’s okay to ask your friend once (or twice) about their brother. More than that and it can get awkward. For instance, you might say, “So, tell me more about your older brother. I know a bit about him and I’d like to know more.”"

      "title": "Talk to him directly.",
      "content": "Talk to him directly. Your friend’s older brother may be used to thinking of you only as his sibling’s friend. You can start to make him think of you romantically if you make an effort to talk to him when you are around him. So, say hi, and start a conversation with your friend’s older brother. You can start by just asking him how things are going, how his day was, or about one of the activities he participates in. For example, if he walks in while you and your friend are making a snack, you could say, “Hey, Matt. How’s lacrosse going?” Ask him his opinion on current events or things going on in the community to keep the conversation going. You might say, for instance, “What do you think about the latest presidential debate” or “Who do think is making it to the playoffs this year?”"

      "title": "Talk to him about dating in general.",
      "content": "Talk to him about dating in general. Starting a conversation with your friend’s older brother about relationships and dating can help him start looking at you as someone he might go out with. You don’t have to ask him out, but you can talk to him about his opinions on relationships. [1] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “So, Tommy, what do you think makes a good relationship? Or, you could try, “What’s the most romantic date you would ever want to go on?” You might even say, “How do you let someone know you are interested in them romantically?” Ultimately, it's going to come down to figuring out what your shared values are. Many long term relationships work because they simply have those shared values about family, career, education, etc. — those end up being the things that make or break a relationship."

      "title": "Know that you can't make him like you.",
      "content": "Know that you can't make him like you. Even though you have great qualities, your friend’s older brother still may not think of you romantically. If this happens, accept that it doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you, it just means you and your friend’s brother aren’t meant to be. Respect it if he thinks the age difference between you two is too big. He may be right if you two aren’t adults and are more than a year or two apart. Don’t do anything against your beliefs in order to convince your friend’s older brother to think of you romantically. For example, don’t do something sexual with your friend’s older brother just to get him to like you."

[2] X Research source You don’t have to ask their permission, necessarily, but you should let your friend know what is going on. Once you realize you want your friend’s older brother to think of you romantically, you should go ahead and let your friend know. You might say something like, “Hey, Stassi, I’m starting to have feelings for your brother and want him to think of me romantically.” Or you could try, “Derrick, I’m interested in your older brother and want him to think of me romantically.”"

Your friend might also have some good reasons why they don’t want their older brother to think of you romantically. [3] X Research source When you talk to your friend about your feelings for their older brother, take the time to listen to what your friend has to say. For example, your friend could know that their brother is already in a relationship with someone. Or, for instance, your friend might know that their brother isn’t really good in relationships. When you tell your friend how you feel, listen if they say it’s not a good idea. Your friend could be trying to protect you from getting your heart broken."

[4] X Research source Continue doing the things that you were doing with your friend before you realized you had feelings for their older brother. Let your friend know that even though you want their brother to think of you romantically, you don’t want things to change in your friendship. You could say something like, “I don’t want my feelings for your brother to change anything between us.” Make sure that when you talk to your friend, you talk about things other than their brother. Talk about the things you all always talked about."

It could make your friend uncomfortable. Your friendship will go much better if you don’t put your friend in the middle of things. [5] X Research source Make sure you aren’t using your friend just to get close to their older brother. Don’t just hang out with your friend to be around their brother. It can also be really awkward for your friend if things don’t work out between you and their older brother. If things don’t work, don’t say bad things to your friend about their brother. They could get mad at you and you could lose a friend."
