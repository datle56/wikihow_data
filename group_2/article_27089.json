      "title": "In a small pot, heat the garlic, wine, vinegar, water, and onion to a boil.",
      "content": "In a small pot, heat the garlic, wine, vinegar, water, and onion to a boil. Add 1 cup (85 g) of chopped onion, 2 minced cloves of garlic, 1 c (240 mL) of water, 2 ⁄ 3 c (160 mL) of white vinegar, and 1.5 cups (350 mL) of white wine to a small pot. Turn the heat on high and wait until you see large bubbles rising to the top of the mixture. [1] X Research source You can use any kind of white wine that you have handy. White wine is what separates Dijon mustard from other types of mustard."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reduce the heat and simmer the mixture for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Reduce the heat and simmer the mixture for 15 minutes. Turn the stovetop down to medium low and allow the flavors to combine for about 10 to 15 minutes. You can leave the pot uncovered for now to let the steam escape as it cooks. [2] X Research source You don’t need to stir the mixture; because there’s a lot of liquid, there isn’t much chance of it burning. Simmering the mixture will also help burn the alcohol out of the white wine so the taste isn’t quite as strong."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off the heat and cool the mixture to room temperature.",
      "content": "Turn off the heat and cool the mixture to room temperature. Quickly turn off your stove top and move the pot to a burner that’s off. Let the pot sit for about 10 minutes, or until it’s room temperature, before you move on. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Strain the liquid into a large bowl.",
      "content": "Strain the liquid into a large bowl. Hold a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and carefully pour your liquid through it. Throw away the chunks of onion and garlic, but keep the liquid in the bowl. [4] X Research source It can be a little tough to hold the strainer and pour at the same time, so don’t be afraid to ask a friend or family member for help!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the mustard seeds, dry mustard, garlic powder, and salt to the liquid.",
      "content": "Add the mustard seeds, dry mustard, garlic powder, and salt to the liquid. Pour 1 cup (128 g) of whole mustard seeds, 1/4 cup (32 g) of dried mustard, 1 tbsp (17 g) of garlic powder, and 1 tsp (4 g) of salt to the liquid. Stir the dry ingredients into the liquid with a wooden spoon until they’re fully incorporated. [5] X Research source You’ll blend the mustard seeds later, so don’t worry about it being too chunky."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the bowl and let it sit for 24 to 48 hours.",
      "content": "Cover the bowl and let it sit for 24 to 48 hours. Grab a sheet of plastic wrap and use it to cover your bowl of mustard, making sure that it’s airtight. Leave the bowl on the counter at room temperature to let the mustard solidify for 1 to 2 days. [6] X Research source Keep the bowl out of direct sunlight so it doesn't get too hot. Hot mustard breeds bacteria, and that’s a big no-no for a delicious condiment like this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pulse the mustard in a blender.",
      "content": "Pulse the mustard in a blender. Pour your mustard mixture into a blender and pulse the blender a few times. The consistency of your mustard is up to you, so you can stop once all of the mustard seeds are blended, or you can keep going to make your mustard smoother and creamier. [7] X Research source You can also use a handheld blender and blend your mustard in the bowl. Creamy mustard is better for adding to recipes, while chunkier mustard can add a little bit of texture to a sandwich or a wrap."

      "title": "Heat the mustard in a saucepan and add water.",
      "content": "Heat the mustard in a saucepan and add water. Pour the mustard into a saucepan and turn the heat up to high. Slowly add in about 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of water to smooth out your mustard and thin it out. Use a whisk to combine the water and the mustard mixture. [8] X Research source Add more water if you’d like your mustard to be runnier, and add less water if you prefer your mustard a little thicker."

      "content": "Simmer the mustard for about 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium low and keep the pan uncovered, letting the mustard simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the mustard occasionally to keep the bottom from burning as it absorbs the water. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Store the mustard in airtight glass jars.",
      "content": "Store the mustard in airtight glass jars. Carefully spoon your mustard into clean, sterile jars, filling them about 3/4 of the way up. Run a butter knife along the edge of the jars to remove any air bubbles before you seal them with an airtight lid. [10] X Research source You can use multiple small jars or one large jar to store your mustard. Look for glass canning jars at your local grocery store for a cute, easy storage solution."

      "title": "Refrigerate the mustard for about 1 week.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the mustard for about 1 week. The flavors of the mustard will continue to blend in the jar. Try to keep your mustard in the fridge for at least a week so your mustard is the most flavorful before you try it. [11] X Research source Consider writing the date that you made the mustard on the jars so you know when it’s time to eat it."

You don’t need to worry about blending up the mustard seeds just yet—plus, soaking them will make them softer. [12] X Research source Whole grain Dijon mustard isn’t quite as smooth and creamy as classic Dijon mustard, since you won’t be blending the mustard seeds all the way. It’s slightly more spicy and flavorful than classic Dijon."

      "content": "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for 2 days. Grab a sheet of plastic wrap and cover your bowl tightly, making sure no air can escape. Leave the bowl covered on the counter for 2 days to let the flavors combine. [13] X Research source Keep the bowl out of the direct sunlight so that it doesn’t get too hot."

Add in 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) of kosher salt and 1 tsp (5 g) of light brown sugar. [14] X Research source You don’t have to add brown sugar to your mustard, but it will make it slightly sweeter and more flavorful. You can also add 1 tsp (5 g) of honey instead of brown sugar for a honey mustard flavor."

      "content": "Blend the mixture until it’s thick and creamy. Pulse your blender 3 to 4 times until the mixture is smooth, but the mustard seeds aren’t completely broken up. Remember that whole grain mustard is supposed to be chunky, not smooth, so don’t overblend it! [15] X Research source If you don’t have a blender, use a food processor instead."

      "title": "Refrigerate the mustard for 2 days before you eat it.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the mustard for 2 days before you eat it. Just like classic Dijon mustard, the flavors of the whole grain mustard need to combine for a few days after you make it. Keep your mustard in the fridge for at least 2 days before serving it on hot dogs, sandwiches, or wraps. [17] X Research source For a stronger flavor, let your mustard sit for 1 week."

      "content": "Mix the ingredients with a spoon until they’re creamy. Using a whisk or a spoon, mix your ingredients together for about 1 minute until they are smooth and creamy. The resulting mixture should be a bright yellow color that tastes a little like dijon mustard and a little like yellow mustard. [20] X Research source Classic Dijon mustard includes actual mustard seeds, which is the main thing missing from this substitution. If your mustard isn’t the right color, add in 1/4 tsp (1.5 g) of turmeric powder for a classic brown/yellow coloring."

Or, if you’re really craving a sandwich with some Dijon mustard but you want to eat it right away, you can spoon some of this on for a more subtle and sweet mustard flavor. [21] X Research source One of the only drawbacks of Dijon mustard is that it takes a long time to make, so this substitution comes in handy when you’re in a pinch."

Whether it’s the classic or the whole grain mustard, Dijon adds a spicy tang to any hot dog, bratwurst, or sandwich. Use a tablespoon or two to add a hearty flavor to your meal, and give your deli sandwich a little spice. [22] X Research source Dijon mustard goes well with chicken sandwiches, turkey sandwiches, and sausages. Try putting Dijon mustard on a vegan sandwich made with lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, and thinly sliced eggplant."

[23] X Research source You can also add salt, pepper, and paprika to taste to make the filling more flavorful.
