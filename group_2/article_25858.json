      "content": "Lesbian bed death refers to the supposed decline in sexual activity in long-term lesbian relationships. Lesbian bed death is a concept that suggests lesbians in long-term, committed relationships have less sex than other types of couples. Some define it as a drop-off in sexual activity that occurs two years into a long-term lesbian relationship. [1] X Research source These days, most people consider lesbian bed death to be a myth, as most relationships, regardless of sexuality, experience drops in physical intimacy now and then, especially in long-term relationships."

Even if they see each other regularly, they may have kids to take care of or important errands to run. By the time they’re finished with the day, they may be too stressed or tired for physical intimacy. [3] X Research source Couples may also be experiencing life transitions, like job loss, financial issues, or childbirth, during which it’s normal for sexual desire to decrease as they focus on reestablishing balance."

      "content": "Sociologist Pepper Schwartz is credited with coining the term in the 1980s. The concept of lesbian bed death is based on 1983 research by sociologist Pepper Schwartz and social psychologist Philip Blumstein. The research was published in American Couples: Money, Work, Sex , and found that lesbian couples reported lower numbers when asked, “About how often during the last year have you and your partner had sex relations?” [7] X Research source The results found that only about ⅓ of lesbians in relationships of 2 years or longer had sex once a week or more, and 47% of lesbians in long-term relationships had sex once a month or less. In comparison, only 15% of married heterosexual couples claimed to have sex once a week or less. Schwartz and Blumstein found this information by conducting a survey on American relationships. Initially, 12,000 couples, including 788 lesbian couples, filled out the questionnaire, then 300 couples in Seattle, San Francisco, and New York were selected for more in-depth interviews."

      "content": "Most agree that lesbian bed death isn’t real. Schwartz and Blumstein’s research was only supported by anecdotal evidence and didn’t capture the full range of human sexuality, as it focused on heteronormative standards of sex and intimacy. Newer studies have shown that lesbians tend to report equal or greater sexual satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Additionally, almost all couples, regardless of sexuality, experience a decrease in sexual activity in long-term relationships. It’s completely normal and can be increased through strong communication. Sexual satisfaction is also more about quality than quantity, so even if couples do see a decrease in sex over time, it doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t have a good sex life."

According to Moore, “Having an honest conversation about what the two of you are feeling can be a fast track to unlocking the intimacy and passion you once felt.” Everyone has a different libido, so sex may be more important to some people than others. If you’re going through a sexual drought, talk to your partner. Discuss how frequently you’d both like to have sex, your turn-ons and turn-offs, and any boundaries or limits you have. Opening communication is the first step to having a satisfying sex life .

Communicate openly and honestly with your partner about all aspects of your life, not just your sex life. Actively listen to what each other has to say, validate each other’s feelings, and support each other’s goals. Being vulnerable with your partner builds trust, which is important not just for your sex life but your relationship in general. [11] X Research source Spend time together . Everyone needs alone time now and then, but make sure you aren’t neglecting your partner. Surprise each other with romantic dates and gifts. Make sure your partner feels loved and appreciated. Moore recommends, “Remember how the connection used to feel and take small actions every day to increase the connection between the two of you. Give your partner a longer kiss in the morning than you usually do before you both head off to work. Send your partner a flirty text in the middle of the day to let them know you were reminiscing about the wild times you two have had and [that] it made you smile.”"

      "content": "See a sex therapist. If you’ve tried to increase physical intimacy with no success, it may be time to see a sex therapist. According to Novak, “Sex therapists are much more open to talking about sex than couples therapists.” Sex therapists can help you work through the mental and emotional aspects of sex-related issues and provide professional suggestions on how to improve your sex life. Sex therapists prioritize your privacy and provide a safe, judgment-free zone to talk about any issues you’re having with your sex life. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When choosing a sex therapist, Novak emphasizes, “The initial consultation can be really huge. Give a little baby snippet [of your situation] to hear how they would handle the situation or help you through it. How are they talking about it? Are they talking about it in a way that makes you feel better? That’s a really big thing to look out for.” If seeing a sex therapist still doesn’t help, consider whether your relationship is fulfilling in other aspects. If you’re not happy, it may be time to talk to a couple’s counselor or to take a break from the relationship."
