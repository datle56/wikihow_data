In the weeks leading up to bleaching your hair, avoid anything that may damage your hair — particularly chemicals and heat. If your hair feels dry and damaged, spend some time repairing before you bleach it. You can do this with deep conditioning treatments and by letting your hair dry naturally, without the use of styling products or tools."

You needn’t wash the oil out before bleaching. If possible, leave coconut oil on your hair overnight before bleaching. Some people even claim that the oil can help the bleaching process, although there is no real evidence for this. Coconut oil is made up of molecules that are small enough to penetrate the hair shaft, making it an effective choice for moisturizing your hair.

They are made to prevent damage caused by improperly drying, and they also reduce frizz.

Many stylists recommend using 10 to 20 volume. It will take longer for the mixture to lighten your hair, but it will also be much less damaging than using the higher volumes. If you have fine, fragile hair, use a 10-volume developer. For dark, coarse hair, a 30- or 40-volume developer might be necessary.

When choosing a toner, take your skin tone and hair color into consideration. If your hair is too golden, you’ll want a toner shade that’s opposite gold on the color wheel such as a blue or violet ash-based toner. Some toners need to be mixed with developers before being applied to your hair, while others come ready to apply. Both can be equally effective."

Red gold correctors often come in little packages that you can add to your bleaching mixture to help reduce brassiness; they aren’t absolutely necessary for getting white hair, but a lot of people swear by them. Whether you need a red gold corrector will really depend on your hair. People with darker hair, or hair that contains red, orange, or pink tones may find red gold correctors particularly useful in getting their hair extra white. Unless you already have ashy blonde hair that you're trying to make white, you might want to err on the side of caution and purchase a red gold corrector, as they are fairly inexpensive at around $1 USD per package."

In addition to the ingredients for your bleach mixture, you’ll need a tint brush, a plastic mixing bowl, plastic spoon, gloves, plastic hair clips, towels, and plastic wrap or a clear plastic shower cap.

      "content": "Do preliminary tests. Before you bleach your hair you’ll need to do a patch test and a strand test. A patch test will ensure that you’re not allergic to anything in the bleach mixture, and a strand test will help you determine how long to leave the mixture in. To do a patch test, create a tiny amount of the mixture you will use on your hair and place a small dab of it behind your ear. Leave it for 30 minutes, wipe any excess off, then try not to touch it or get it wet for 48 hours. If after 48 hours that area of skin is fine, go ahead with bleaching your hair. To do a strand test, prepare a small amount of the bleach mixture and apply it to a strand of your hair. Check it every 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches the desired color. Note the time it took to reach this color so that you have an idea of how long it will take on your whole head. Another thing to pay attention to in the strand test is how damaged the hair feels after you've washed and conditioned the strand. If it feels very damaged, try a lower-volume developer or a slower bleaching process (i.e. bleaching your hair over several weeks instead of in one go). If you only do one test, do the patch test, as a severe allergic reaction could be fatal."

If the tingling and stinging become too painful, remove the plastic wrap and wash out the bleach. If your hair is still too dark, you can try to bleach it again with a lower-volume developer in 2 weeks if it's healthy enough.
