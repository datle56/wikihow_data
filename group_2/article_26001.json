      "title": "Put a Christmas wreath on your table or windowsill.",
      "content": "Put a Christmas wreath on your table or windowsill. You can buy a wreath made specifically for Advent candles, or you can get a normal wreath and put candle holders inside of it. Set the wreath down on a flat surface in a prominent area of your home, like your kitchen table or in your living room. [2] X Research source The evergreen branches of a traditional wreath represent the continuous life of Christ since they never die. The circular form of the wreath symbolizes the eternity of God and the everlasting soul, since a circle has no ending. Your wreath can be as big or as small as you want it to be—just make sure it can fit four candles around it!"

      "title": "Add three purple candles to the wreath.",
      "content": "Add three purple candles to the wreath. The purple candles are the main candles of Advent, and they each represent something different. Set three purple candles in three of the candle holders around your wreath, and make sure they’re far away from anything flammable. [3] X Research source If your wreath didn’t come with candle holders inside of it, you can buy candle holders and set them directly inside of the wreath. Look for tall, thin candles that you can burn multiple times throughout the month."

      "title": "Set one pink candle on the wreath.",
      "content": "Set one pink candle on the wreath. This candle represents joy, which is why it’s a bright, fun color. Put this candle in the last spot on the wreath. [4] X Research source Go for a pale pink candle in the same style as your purple candles."

    {
      "title": "Put a white candle in the middle of the wreath to represent Christ.",
      "content": "Put a white candle in the middle of the wreath to represent Christ. Not every faith uses a white candle in the center, so you can choose whether you’d like to or not. Put a large white candle in the very center of the wreath to light on Christmas Eve. [5] X Research source A white candle is very traditional, but more modern Advent wreaths usually don’t include it. If you’re having trouble deciding, ask your church leader about it. Since the candle represents Christ, you can use one with Jesus’s likeness on it instead of a plain white one."

    {
      "title": "Explain to your family members what each candle represents.",
      "content": "Explain to your family members what each candle represents. If you have young children in the house, this is a great way to teach them about when Jesus was born and what Christmas really means. You can talk about why Christmas is celebrated and what it means to you as you set up your Advent wreath. [6] X Research source The Christmas holiday has a tendency to focus on getting gifts and material goods, so you can use your Advent wreath as a nice reminder of what it’s truly about."

      "title": "Light the first candle on the first Sunday of Advent.",
      "content": "Light the first candle on the first Sunday of Advent. On the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day, light one of the purple candles. This candle represents the hope that people felt before the birth of Jesus, and you can read Isaiah 64:1–9 to accompany your lighting. [7] X Research source You can also sing hymns like 'O Come Divine Messiah,' or 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.' You can leave the candle burning until you’ve read a piece of scripture or sung a hymn with your family. Don’t forget to blow it out before leaving the house or going to bed! The date of the first Sunday of Advent changes every year, but it’s usually close to the end of November."

      "title": "Think of faith as you light the second candle on the next Sunday.",
      "content": "Think of faith as you light the second candle on the next Sunday. On the following Sunday, light both the first purple candle and a second purple candle. This one represents faith and how people believed in God before Jesus’s birth, and you can read Isaiah 40:1–11 after you light it. [8] X Research source If you’re lighting the Advent candles with your family, give each member a turn lighting the candle. Some traditionalists say that you should always light your candles in a clockwise circle, but you can decide whether you’d like to do that or not."

    {
      "title": "Light the pink candle on the third Sunday to represent joy.",
      "content": "Light the pink candle on the third Sunday to represent joy. Light the first two purple candles, then light your pink candle as well. Think about joy and what it means to you and your faith as you watch the candle burn. [9] X Research source This candle is also called “The Shepherds Candle.” You can read John 1:6–8, 8–11 as you light this candle. The pink candle celebrates the joy that people felt when Jesus was born."

      "content": "Remember the creator as you light the last purple candle on the last Sunday. On the last Sunday of Advent, light all four candles at the same time, including the unlit purple one. The fourth and final candle represents waiting for the coming of Jesus Christ, so you can talk about your anticipation and excitement for Christmas. [10] X Research source Read Luke 1:26–38 as you light this candle."
