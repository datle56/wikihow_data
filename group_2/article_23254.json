      "content": "Silverfish love to chew papery items, like books and magazines. These tiny pests are about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) long and are normally silver or pearl gray. They have no wings, and they are soft-bodied with 2 antennae sticking out of the top of their heads. Most adult silverfish have 3 long, tail-like appendages sticking out of the back of their bodies. [1] X Research source Silverfish are nocturnal, meaning they’re only active at night. To trap silverfish , set out sticky traps near your bookshelves or filing cabinets. The traps will stick the silverfish in place, and they’ll die within a day or so."

      "content": "These biting bugs are small and not easy to see. If you have bed bugs, your first clue will be their bite: you’ll probably wake up with small, itchy red bumps on your legs or arms. Adult bed bugs are flat, oval-shaped, and about 1/4\" to 3/8\" long (5-9 mm). They usually live in box springs, in furniture, behind wallpaper, or in cracks in your floor. [2] X Research source Bed bugs are often confused with fleas, because fleas can also bite humans and leave small, itchy red bumps. However, bed bugs do not congregate near your pets like fleas do. If you have fleas in your home, you’ll find them in your pets’ bedding, not just yours. If you have bed bugs in your home, call a professional exterminator right away. It can take months to get rid of bed bugs completely, so it’s important to catch them early."

      "content": "Fleas feed mostly on cats and dogs, but will also bite humans in a pinch. Usually, you’ll find fleas on your furry animals: you might see their small black bodies hopping around, or you could discover flea dirt (flea poop) on your pet. Adult fleas are almost microscopic and hard to see, so looking for their feces is a better way to ID them. Your pets will also probably be itchy and scratch themselves more often if they have fleas. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source To get rid of fleas, start by treating your pet for fleas with a topical flea treatment. Then, wash your pets’ bedding and your bedding in hot water to kill any remaining fleas. Vacuum your carpets and soft furniture and immediately empty the vacuum in the garbage outside to dispose of any fleas and their eggs. It can take up to 4 months to get rid of a flea infestation completely."

      "content": "Moths usually hide in your pantry to eat flour and cereal. Most moths are less than 1/16th of an inch long, which means they’re pretty hard to spot. However, if you go to grab a package from your pantry and notice a small insect with wings inside, you’ve probably found a moth.

      "content": "There are 2 main types of termites: drywood and dampwood. Drywood termites infest dead wood, and they’re usually a little smaller than typical termites. They produce long, round fecal pellets that look like petrified wood. [9] X Research source Dampwood termites are more common. You can usually find them in damp, dark spaces, like your basement or crawl space. They’re reddish-brown with 6 legs and 2 mandibles on the front of their bodies. [10] X Research source You might see small tunnels or tubes in your wooden structure. Those are termite tunnels, and they create them by boring into your home.

      "content": "Also called wood bees, these pests can damage your wooden structures. These bees look almost like bumble bees, and they’re anywhere from 5 ⁄ 8 to 1 in (1.6 to 2.5 cm) long. You can usually spot them flying in and out of the holes they’ve made in a wooden structure, like wall beams or a shed. The male bees can’t sting, and the females only sting when they feel threatened. [11] X Research source Carpenter bees are valuable pollinators, so killing them isn’t a great option. You can deter them from your wooden structure by filling the holes they’ve made with steel wool. You can also use pre-treated lumber or stain your wood to make it harder for them to bore into your structure."

There are a few different types of wasps you might see around your home, but the most common ones are yellow jackets. They range from 3 ⁄ 8 to 5 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 to 1.59 cm) long, and their wings extend the entire length of their bodies. [12] X Research source Wasp nests are brown, and they often look like they’re made of wet paper. Wasps tend to make their nests in trees, patios, or attics. If you see a wasp nest on your property, it’s a good idea to call a professional to avoid getting stung. Or, hang up wasp traps near their nest to trap and kill them."
