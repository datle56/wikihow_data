Ask what documents you'll need to ensure that your marriage is legal both there and in your home country.

In the UK, it will be your local register office. In the US, it's typically your city or county clerk's office. [3] X Research source When you call, tell the employee who answers that you're getting married in another country and want to make an appointment to get a certificate of no impediment. Ask them what documents you need to bring with you and when your certificate will be issued. Some offices may be booked up for several weeks, so don't leave this to the last minute! You want to make sure you have all of your documents in order before you leave the country so your marriage will be legal. If the office isn't particularly busy, they might tell you that you can drop in at any time during business hours. If this is the case, get over there as soon as possible to take care of it. A CNI is called by different names in different countries. For example, some states in the US call this document an \"Affidavit of Single Status.\" Double-check with the embassy or consulate of your destination country to make sure the document you get will be acceptable.

While the specific documents vary depending on where you live, generally, you'll need to bring something that proves you live in the area served by that office, as well as a government-issued identity document. To prove your identity and citizenship, a passport, birth certificate, or a government-issued photo ID usually works. You might need more than one document. For your address, a lease or mortgage statement, utility bill in your name, or bank statement should suffice."

Typically, the clerk will give you a copy of the application when you show up for your appointment.
