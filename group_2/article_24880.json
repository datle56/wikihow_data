      "title": "Warm up the plate you're going to rest the meat on.",
      "content": "Warm up the plate you're going to rest the meat on. It might not seem like a game-changer, but resting your steaks on a hot plate does prevent heat loss. Stick a heat-proof platter or large plate in the microwave and heat it for about 1 minute. Remember to wear oven mitts when you take the hot plate out! Then, set your cooked steaks on the plate. If you don't have a microwave, don't worry! Stick the plate or platter in the oven and turn your oven to its lowest setting. It may take around 5 minutes for the plates to warm up, so put them in the oven when you start cooking your steaks."

      "content": "Cover the steak loosely with foil if you're outside and it's windy. There's a lot of controversy about whether or not foil traps heat effectively. Some argue that it doesn't make a noticeable difference unless you're cooking the steaks outdoors when it's cold or windy. It's totally up to you if you want to lay a piece of foil over the steaks. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that tenting the steaks does soften the crust so you lose the crisp exterior."

      "title": "Keep the steak uncovered if you like a crisp crust.",
      "content": "Keep the steak uncovered if you like a crisp crust. While covering steak loosely with foil might keep it a little warmer than if you rest it uncovered, you will lose the crackly crust. If you'd rather have the crust, don't feel like you have to cover your steaks! It's totally fine to rest them uncovered on a warm plate. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the steaks in a 150 °F (66 °C) oven if you want them to stay really hot.",
      "content": "Place the steaks in a 150 °F (66 °C) oven if you want them to stay really hot. This is another controversial way to rest steaks. While the low heat from the oven will keep the meat warm while it rests, some argue that it can dry out the steaks. You might pop them in the oven for just a few minutes of the rest time so they don't have a chance to overcook. [3] X Research source If you try this method, leave the steaks uncovered so foil doesn't trap moisture and make the crust soft."

    {
      "title": "Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes before serving them.",
      "content": "Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes before serving them. Resist the urge to cut into the meat while it's resting! Just leave it alone and get the rest of your meal finished up so you can bring the steaks to the table the moment they're done resting. Give them at least 5 minutes. [4] X Research source Set a timer so you don't forget that your steaks are resting or they'll cool off way too much!"

      "title": "Sear grilled steaks for 1 minute after resting to give them a crispy crust.",
      "content": "Sear grilled steaks for 1 minute after resting to give them a crispy crust. You've taken your perfectly browned steaks off of the grill and rested them only to find that the exterior is soft and your steaks have cooled down. Don't worry! There's a quick fix. Toss a dozen coals onto your grill or turn your gas grill to high. Right before you're ready to serve the steaks, lay them on the grill and sear them for about 30 seconds on each side. [5] X Research source This quick sear on the grill just gets rid of the exterior moisture that made the crust turn soft and it warms your steaks without making them tough."

      "title": "Pour hot pan juices over pan-seared steaks for a crackly crust.",
      "content": "Pour hot pan juices over pan-seared steaks for a crackly crust. If you've rested pan-seared steaks only to find they've lost their crisp exterior, don't worry! It's easy to re-heat them and get that great crust. Heat up the skillet with the pan juices and drippings while your steaks are resting. Just before you're ready to eat, pour the hot juices over the steaks. They'll crackle and bubble as the drippings crisp up the exterior of the meat. [6] X Research source It's really important to serve the steaks immediately or they'll cool down again and soften."

      "title": "Slice the steaks thin and pour hot gravy or sauce over them to warm the meat.",
      "content": "Slice the steaks thin and pour hot gravy or sauce over them to warm the meat. If you're worried that you'll overcook the meat by re-heating it, try this great trick. Slice cold, cooked steaks as thin as you can and arrange the meat on warm serving plates. Then, heat up gravy or sauce until it's steaming hot and pour it over the meat. Your steak will be warm and the meat won't be tough at all! [7] X Research source This is a great way to serve steak to a group since you can cook the steak in advance and slice it up right before you're ready to eat."

      "title": "Heat leftover steaks in the oven and finish them in a hot skillet.",
      "content": "Heat leftover steaks in the oven and finish them in a hot skillet. If you have leftover steaks in the fridge, the oven is your best way to reheat them. Set the steaks on a wire rack and place it on a baking sheet. Then, heat the steaks at 250 °F (121 °C) until they're about 110 °F (43 °C). To get that great crisp crust, heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat and lay the warm steak in it. Sear each side for 60 to 90 seconds and let your steaks rest on a plate for 5 minutes before you serve them. [8] X Research source Don't do this more than once with the same steaks since the texture of the meat won't hold up."

      "content": "Cover cold leftover steak with a damp paper towel if you have to microwave it. When you're hungry and have leftover steak, it's tempting to just stick it in the microwave for a few minutes. Unfortunately, microwaving uncovered meat dries it out and makes it chewy—not a pleasant experience. If you have no other way to reheat your steaks, lay a damp paper towel over the steaks and microwave the meat in 30-second increments. Flip the meat over each time so it warms evenly. [9] X Research source Lower the microwave power to medium, so you're not as likely to overcook the steaks. Plan on reheating the steaks for 90 seconds to 2 minutes. The amount of time it takes depends on the size and thickness of the meat."
