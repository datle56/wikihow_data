      "content": "Get bangs. [1] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. The best way to hide your forehead is by going to a salon and getting bangs. A straight across bang that gets gradually longer on the sides is the most versatile and fitting for larger foreheads. However, this style doesn't flatter all face shapes, including those that are wide or feature a prominent nose. There are many different types of bangs to choose from. Flip through a magazine and pick a favorite type to ask your stylist for, and be sure to go with one that best fits your face shape. Opt for curtain bangs or textured side bangs if your face is round. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Go for a low, loose up-do. If you want to wear your hair up, part your hair down the middle and put it in a loose bun. Pull a couple of pieces out of the top front and curl them with a curling iron on low heat to create a nice face-framing effect. [3] X Research source Avoid the slicked back look. Unlike the low, loose up-do, a tightly pulled back ponytail or bun won’t be very flattering. Don't pull your hair back too tight, or else it will exaggerate the size of your forehead.

      "content": "Create volume with layers. A big forehead often means a seemingly longer face. While flat, straight hair will make your face look even longer, hairstyles with a lot of wave and volume bring balance to your head shape by having a subtle widening effect. [5] X Research source Also create volume by using volumizing hair products, curling your hair, or blowing it dry with a hair dryer and a round brush."

      "content": "Add drama to your eyes. Use bold eyeshadows and eyeliners to accentuate your eyes and make them the focal point. Eye makeup can also influence others’ perception of your face shape. [8] X Research source For a dramatic nighttime look, go for a smoky eye look by applying a gray, navy, eggplant, or brown eyeshadow on your top eyelid, working up from the lashline to the crease. Sweep a deeper shade of the same hue into the crease, using a fluffy brush and soft window-wiper motions. Highlight your browbone with a neutral eyeshadow 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Then, finish with your favorite dark eyeliner and mascara."

Use a clear brow gel to help hold your brows in place and keep them looking great all day long."
