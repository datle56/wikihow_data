      "title": "Choose a 1-quart (1-L) glass or plastic jar.",
      "content": "Choose a 1-quart (1-L) glass or plastic jar. You can use a dedicated sprouter to sprout broccoli seeds, or you can use a clear glass or plastic jar. A mason jar is ideal, but you can also use a plastic food storage container. A 1-quart (1-L) jar will provide lots of room for the water and for the growing sprouts. [1] X Research source Use a sterile sprouter or jar to prevent the growth of pathogens. You can sterilize the jar by running it through the dishwasher, or by washing it in hot, soapy water."

    {
      "title": "Measure the seeds.",
      "content": "Measure the seeds. To make about 1 ⁄ 2 pound (230 g), you need to start with 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) (45 g) of broccoli seeds. You'll also need fresh, filtered water to soak and rinse the seeds multiple times each day over the 7 to 10 days needed to grow the sprouts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine the seeds with filtered water in the jar.",
      "content": "Combine the seeds with filtered water in the jar. Cover the seeds with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of cool, filtered water. The water should be between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C). Swirl the water and seeds around together to completely saturate the seeds. If any of the seeds float, push them down in the jar. [2] X Research source If you don't have a thermometer, the water should feel slightly cool."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the jar with cheesecloth.",
      "content": "Cover the jar with cheesecloth. Place the cheesecloth over the mouth of the jar and use an elastic band or a mason jar ring to secure it in place. You can also screw on a dedicated sprouting lid with a built-in screen if you have one. [3] X Research source Using cheesecloth or mesh will allow airflow into the jar, but will keep dirt, bugs, and particulate out. You can also use a clean tea towel in place of the cheesecloth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the seeds to a warm, dark place.",
      "content": "Transfer the seeds to a warm, dark place. This will help to replicate the conditions the seeds experience in the soil, and will encourage germination. Ideal places include a kitchen cabinet, cupboard, or pantry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the seeds for about 8 hours.",
      "content": "Soak the seeds for about 8 hours. Leave the seeds in the water in the pantry overnight, or for 8 to 10 hours. This will kickstart the germination process and help the sprouts to grow faster. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drain and rinse the seeds.",
      "content": "Drain and rinse the seeds. Once the seeds have been soaking for about 8 hours, remove the cheesecloth and transfer the seeds to a fine-mesh colander. Turn on the water and rinse the seeds for about a minute to remove any dirt or plant matter. If you're using a sprouting cap with a built-in screen, simply drain the water by slowly turning the jar upside down. Pour in some fresh water, swirl the water and seeds around in the jar, and then pour out the water again. After you drain the water, place the jar upside down at a 45-degree angle for 30 minutes so that all of the water in the jar drains out."

    {
      "title": "Return the seeds to the jar.",
      "content": "Return the seeds to the jar. Use a clean spoon to transfer the rinsed seeds back to the sprouting jar. Replace the cheesecloth and secure it in place with the elastic. Place the seeds back in the same warm, dark location that you used for soaking them."

      "title": "Rinse and drain the seeds every 6 to 8 hours for up to 4 days.",
      "content": "Rinse and drain the seeds every 6 to 8 hours for up to 4 days. Over the next 3 to 4 days, the seeds will germinate and begin to sprout. It's important to continue rinsing and draining them frequently during this process. Regular rinsing will prevent the growth of mold and bacteria that could cause food poisoning. [5] X Research source As the sprouts grow, they will develop root hairs, which look fuzzy and are sometimes mistaken for mold. Root hairs help the sprouts absorb water, and they are completely normal. After rinsing, you won't even see them. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the sprouts to indirect sunlight after 3 to 4 days.",
      "content": "Move the sprouts to indirect sunlight after 3 to 4 days. When the sprouts are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and have grown yellow leaves, move them to a bright location to encourage chlorophyll growth. This will turn the leaves from yellow to green, and increase the amount of nutrients in the sprouts. A room temperature location, such as a kitchen counter, is an ideal place for this greening process. [7] X Research source Don't put the sprouts in direct sunlight, otherwise they will burn."

      "content": "Continue rinsing every 6 to 8 hours for another 1 to 2 days. The sprouts are still susceptible to mold at this point, so you have to keep rinsing every 6 to 8 hours as the sprouts green. Once the leaves on the sprouts turn dark green in a day or 2, the sprouts are ready to eat. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the hulls.",
      "content": "Remove the hulls. When the leaves are dark green, transfer the sprouts to a large bowl. Cover the sprouts with water and gently agitate the sprouts with a clean hand to loosen the hulls. Use your hand or a small fine-mesh strainer to skim the surface of the water and collect the hulls. Broccoli hulls can hold a lot of water, and this can lead to premature spoilage if you don't remove them."

      "title": "Rinse and drain the sprouts one last time.",
      "content": "Rinse and drain the sprouts one last time. Transfer the hulled sprouts to a fine-mesh colander to drain the water. Rinse the sprouts with clean water and then leave them to drain for about an hour. After an hour, transfer the sprouts to a clean tea towel to air dry for several hours. Drying the sprouts before storing them will help to preserve them longer. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Eat the sprouts on their own. Sprouts make for a delicious snack, and you can eat them by the ounce (28 g) for a nutrient-dense and healthy snack at any time of day. You can also eat the sprouts with a dip if you like, such as: Hummus Vegetable dip Spinach dip Yogurt sauce"

You can drizzle the salad with oil and vinegar, or dress it with your favorite dressing, such as: Ranch Caesar Fruity vinaigrette Blue cheese Italian Poppy seed"

      "title": "Use them as a sandwich topping.",
      "content": "Use them as a sandwich topping. Just like with salads, fresh sprouts are also great for sandwiches because they're mild but add a bit of crunch. For a quick and easy vegetable sandwich, toast and butter two pieces of your favorite bread, add some sliced tomato, avocado, and onion, and top everything with an ounce (28 g) of sprouts. For a slightly more gourmet sandwich, don't toast the bread at the beginning. Instead, add a few slices of your favorite cheese and finish the sandwich in a panini maker. You can add sprouts to any type of sandwich you like, such as a Reuben or a BLT."
