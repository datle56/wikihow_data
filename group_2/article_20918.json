      "content": "Glass hair is a polished hairstyle with a glossy mirror-like finish. As Todd describes it, “glass hair is a refined hairstyle characterized by a high-gloss, mirror-like finish. This sleek and polished look is achieved by creating extremely smooth strands that reflect light, showcasing the health and moisture of the hair.” First made popular by Kim Kardashian in 2018, glass hair is known for looking healthy and ultra-shiny—like a piece of glass! In a nutshell, this elegant and minimalist style is characterized by: [1] X Research source Extreme shine: The glossy appearance of this style is why it’s called glass hair and is its most important aspect. If you don’t have the shine, you don’t have glass hair. Silky and smooth feel: Glass hair also has an extremely smooth texture that’s silky both to the eye and to the touch. Blunt ends: Glass hair was originally done with a straight bob or lob with very blunt ends and a sharp center part. However, modern glass hair can be any length and can have waves and curls. Healthy hair: One of the main ideas behind the glass hair trend is that it’s what hair looks like at its healthiest. The best way to get that look is to take care of your hair and keep it as healthy as possible."

Todd recommends following up with a high-quality nourishing and moisturizing conditioner . Soak your hair with clear, warm water to release oils and open the cuticle. Lather a quarter-sized amount of shampoo through your hair, gently massaging your scalp and roots. Then, smooth the lather through to the ends. [2] X Research source After shampooing your hair, be sure to rinse it thoroughly before applying conditioner . Condition your hair from the mid-lengths to the ends. Allow the conditioner to sit on your hair while you finish the rest of your shower. Rinse out the conditioner with lukewarm water and gently squeeze out any excess water. Press a soft microfiber towel around your hair and squeeze. Don’t rub your hair dry, as this can rough up the texture and cause frizz."

      "content": "Apply heat protectant and/or a hair primer or serum. Apply a heat protectant to your hair if your hair primer or serum doesn’t already have heat-protectant properties—many serums and hair primers do have these properties, so you may not need a separate heat protectant. Start out with a pea-sized amount of hair primer or a few drops of glossing serum . Todd recommends choosing styling products that contain polymers in order to enhance shine and reflectivity! Heat protectants shield your hair from any heat tool that you may use to style your hair, including flat irons and blow dryers. It preserves moisture and reduces breakage. [3] X Research source Use a hair serum to help smooth hair, eliminate frizz, and boost shine. A hair primer helps create an even humidity-resistance shield on your hair strands that helps your style last longer. It may also act as a serum and heat protectant, saving you from buying extra products. [4] X Research source Depending on your hair texture, you may only need one of these products or all three. Those with fine hair may only need a primer, while people with coarse hair benefit from layering products."

Turn the blow dryer on medium heat and hold it 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hair with the nozzle angled down. Slowly run the brush through your hair, following it with the blow dryer. [5] X Research source Continue sectioning off your hair and smoothing it dry with the brush and blow dryer until your hair is 100% dry."

      "content": "Straighten your hair in small sections with a flat iron. To straighten your hair with a flat iron , start by dividing your hair into 4-6 sections. Use a hair clip to hold the top sections of your hair out of the way. Choose a 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) lock of hair. Place your flat iron 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5 cm) above your scalp. Close the two heated sides together, with the hair between them. Slowly run the iron down the length of your hair, keeping the same amount of pressure on the hair at all times. Repeat with all remaining locks. [6] X Research source Heat your flat iron to the lowest setting for thin hair, medium heat (about 300–350ºF / 150–177ºC) for average hair thickness, and high heat (400–450ºF / 200–232ºC) for thick hair. Don’t start straightening your hair if it’s not 100% dry. Using a flat iron on wet hair can cause damage."

      "content": "For long-lasting glass hair, get a hair gloss or keratin salon treatment. If you want your glass hair to last longer without repeating the above steps, you can get a professional treatment to increase the shine in your hair. One option is to use a glossing semi- or demi-permanent hair color , which adds shine and conditions your hair while adding color that washes out after 3-12 shampoos (depending on the product you choose). [8] X Research source A clear hair gloss is one type of semi-permanent or clear treatment that evens hair tones and adds shine. Because these products don’t use the harsh ingredients in permanent hair dye, they are gentler and less damaging to your strands than full-process color. [9] X Research source You can also ask a hair professional to apply a keratin treatment. These treatments can cut down on frizz, smooth your hair, and amp up shine. This treatment is performed in a salon, and the results can last up to 6 months. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keratin treatments can cost from $82 - $400 depending on your location and the exact service you receive.

      "content": "Keep your hair clean and moisturized for more shine. Maintain the health and luster of your hair by washing and moisturizing regularly with products designed for your hair type. The frequency of washes depends on your hair type—if you have oily hair, washing your hair daily keeps it looking its best, while dry or color-treated hair can be washed every other day to prevent stripping natural oils. However, if you start to see white flakes in your hair, start washing it more frequently. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source To moisturize your hair, use a leave-in conditioner on the ends of your hair. If you have fine hair, however, use a hydrating conditioner that you can wash out, since leave-in products can weigh your hair down and make it look greasy. Look for silicone- and sulfate-free products, since silicones and sulfates may leave a dulling film on your hair."

      "content": "Use a silk hair wrap or pillowcase at night. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is not only luxurious, but it also helps prevent frizz! A traditional cotton pillowcase may rough up your hair as you toss and turn, and it’s also more likely to soak up all of your natural hair oils. A silk pillowcase reduces friction, causing less damage to hair follicles and existing strands. [13] X Research source Silk hair wraps are especially good at protecting natural curl patterns and blowouts overnight."

[14] X Research source Alternatively, apply a dime-sized amount of hair oil to sleek down areas of your hair that are acting up.

      "content": "Glass hair works for all hair types, curl patterns, and lengths. The main trick to achieving glass hair is to keep it healthy and moisturized. That said, people with straight and fine hair of any length will have the easiest time getting that glassy look. Glass hair was also originally a shorter hairstyle and is considered easier to achieve on short hair. However, if you use the right products for your hair type, you can get that mirror-like shine, too. [17] X Research source Here are tips for those with other hair types. If you have a natural hair texture or curly hair , avoid using water-based products to straighten your hair. The water will bring your hair back to its natural textured or curly state. [18] X Research source If you have a coarser texture , keep your flat iron below 400 degrees to avoid frying your hair. [19] X Research source If you have thin hair in short, medium, or long lengths, use only lightweight products to avoid weighing it down and making it look more greasy than mirror-like."

      "content": "Liquid hair is like glass hair with more movement. While glass hair is known for being completely straight and smooth, liquid hair is characterized by a fluid-like movement. Think of glass hair as stick-straight and a little stiff, like a reflective pane of glass. Liquid hair is all about how your hair flows like water over your shoulders. [20] X Research source Liquid hair is softer than glass hair. It looks lived-in and slightly undone, like it’s bouncy and soft to the touch. Liquid hair is shinier than glass hair. While glass hair might look like a mirror, liquid hair takes it to the next level by being so shiny it almost looks wet. Glass hair tends to be shorter than liquid hair. Originally, glass hair was a way to make bobs and lobs sleeker and shinier because it’s more difficult to keep longer hair pin-straight. [21] X Research source The process to get liquid hair is very similar to glass hair, but you skip the flat iron and your cut is longer without the blunt ends."
