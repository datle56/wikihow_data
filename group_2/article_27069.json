      "content": "Pre-heat your oven to 350°F (176.67°C) then prepare the cake mix according to the instructions on the box. Most cake mixes will also require additional wet ingredients, such as water, oil, and an egg. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with your whisk or spatula while mixing. This will help the batter come out more even. You will also want to \"fold\" the batter every now and then; this will give you a smoother batter. If you are going to be using dark or nonstick baking pans, lower the temperature to 325°F (162.78°C). How much water, oil, and eggs you will need will depend on what brand of cake mix you are using. If you lost the box, try finding the instructions on the company website; they often will have them posted there. Plan on using about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water, ½ cup (120 milliliters) of oil, and 2 to 3 eggs."

The liners are not necessary, but they will make cleaning up easier; they will also make the cupcakes look prettier. You can use a regular, mini, or jumbo sized cupcake pan. If you want to fill the wells with batter directly, you will need to wipe them down using a paper towel soaked with vegetable or canola oil first."

A quick and easy way to fill the cupcake wells is to use a large spoon or an ice cream scooper. A box of cake mix will be enough to make 24 to 30 regular-sized cupcakes. It will make even more mini-sized cupcakes, but fewer of the jumbo-sized ones. Cover and refrigerate any leftover batter. When you are done baking the first batch, let the pan cool for 15 minutes, then fill it with the rest of the batter. You may need to bake this new batch 1 to 2 minutes longer than the first one.

If you have a convection oven, check the cupcakes after 8 minutes. You can tell when they are done if a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean. Well-done cupcakes will also \"spring\" back when touched on the top. Regular-sized cupcakes will need 15 to 20 minutes. Mini cupcakes will need 10 to 15 minutes. Jumbo cupcakes will need 20 to 30 minutes."

Then, dip the top of each cupcake into the frosting. Give the cupcake a slight twist as you pull it back out. To make your frosting colored, add a few drops of liquid food coloring, and give it a quick stir with a fork or whisk. To make the cupcakes more interesting, dip them into a bowl filled with chopped walnuts, colored sugar, or sprinkles. [3] X Research source Mix and match the frosting.

If it is too thin, add some more confectioner's/icing sugar. [4] X Research source To make colored buttercream, stir in a few drops of food coloring. You can use a spatula to spread the buttercream on, or an icing bag to pipe it on. If you want to create a swirling effect with more than one color, just stack the colored buttercreams on a piece of cling film and roll it, sandwiching them before applying."
