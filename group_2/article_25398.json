      "content": "You kinda flirt sometimes. When you’re feeling a certain way about someone, it can be hard not to flirt a little. You give each other compliments that are a little more intimate than “I like your hair.” You tease each other, joke about dating, or even wipe stray bits of food off each other’s mouths without even asking. [6] X Research source There’s a part of you that wishes the flirting was real, though. Sometimes, you might feel a little awkward afterward when you realize what you’re doing, and that’s an even bigger sign you’re falling for them."

When there’s something missing, or something on your mind, it tends to come up often in conversation, usually because one of you is hoping to talk about it. Or, it can feel too dangerous to talk about, and so topics like romance, dating, or significant others never ever come up. If you’re tiptoeing around it, it’s usually because you want it, but you’re afraid of messing things up. [8] X Research source"

If your world suddenly becomes technicolor and you want to burst with joy when they walk in the room, you probably have romantic feelings. Having a tangled ball of feelings is a sign of romantic interest, too. Just thinking about them might make you feel excitement, anticipation, butterflies, longing, and nervousness all at the same time. [9] X Research source If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try to clear your mind and reflect on your emotions. Imagine that your feelings are like a pie. As you slice into it, think of each slice as a distinct emotion and identify it. When in doubt, trust your gut. If one person dramatically affects your mood and emotions more than your other close friends, there’s a good chance you have romantic feelings for them. View the attraction in the context of your life. Are you going through a rough patch or separation with a current partner?

If you do, you can be sure that you have deeper feelings for your friend. Even if you have romantic feelings for them, you might want to move on if you think dating them wouldn’t be as fulfilling as your connection as friends.

If you spend time alone in a setting that’s like a date, but isn’t officially a date, your friend might catch on to those vibes. And if you want to be direct and honest with your feelings, it’s best to do this in private. Or, wait for the next time you’re hanging out together alone, when you won’t have anyone else distracting you, to have a talk about your feelings. You could also tell them via text or over the phone, but it’s more personal and honest to say it face-to-face."

Move past the awkwardness by telling your friend that the situation is low-stakes, and that you don’t expect anything, but that you need to get your feelings off your chest. That way, they don’t feel pressured to give any particular answer. For example: “I’m happy being friends, if that’s what you want, but I just had to say something.” “This doesn’t change anything between us, if you don’t want it to. I just wanted to be open and honest with you.” “Don’t feel pressured to say anything, I just had to say something, otherwise I worry it would get between us.”"

Dicken recommends giving the situation a little time to play out. “It might be awkward for a little while,” she tells us, “but then, if the feelings were unrequited, most likely it would go back to some version of normal after an amount of time.” Let your friend think things over, and let them answer in their own time. Wait about 1–2 weeks to reach out to them afterward, if you’re nervous. That gives you both time to sort out your feelings. If they don’t bring it up, they’re probably trying to move past it, and that’s okay! You’ve still got a friend for life."
