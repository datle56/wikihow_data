      "content": "Add ½ teaspoon (2 g) of baking soda. Sprinkle the baking soda over your slime and use your hands to knead it in until it’s not sticky anymore. If it still feels sticky, add ⅛ teaspoon (½ g) more and keep kneading. [1] X Research source Careful not to add too much baking soda or it will make your slime less stretchy ! Knead the slime thoroughly before adding more."

      "content": "Alternatively, add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of contact solution. Pour the contact solution over your slime, then work it in with your hands until the slime doesn’t feel sticky anymore. If that doesn’t cut it, add another ¼ teaspoon (1 ¼ mL) of contact solution. [2] X Research source Add contact solution just a little bit at a time. Too much will make your slime rubbery. If your slime recipe used liquid starch as an activator instead of contact solution try adding more liquid starch instead."

      "title": "Try adding 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of baby oil.",
      "content": "Try adding 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of baby oil. Baby oil is a common ingredient in shiny slime recipes, and it can also make your slime less sticky. Knead the baby oil into your slime until it’s all mixed in and the slime doesn’t feel sticky anymore. [3] X Research source Don’t add more than 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of baby oil or your slime may become goopy and lose its stretchiness (and nobody wants that!)."

      "content": "Knead your slime more—sometimes that’s enough to make it less sticky! If you don’t want to add anything else to your slime, keep kneading it. It helps the ingredients combine better and carry out their chemical reactions, meaning less stickiness. Press the slime with your hands and fingers, stretch it out, form it back into a ball, and press it out again. Continue doing this until your slime feels less sticky. [4] X Research source"
