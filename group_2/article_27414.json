      "title": "Combine the water and grated soap.",
      "content": "Combine the water and grated soap. Add 2 cups (470 ml) of water and ¼ cup (9 g) of soap flakes to a medium sauce pan. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together so the soap is mixed throughout the water. [1] X Research source Soap flakes are usually sold in the laundry aisle at grocery stores. You can substitute soap shavings for store-bought flakes if you prefer."

    {
      "title": "Heat the mixture until the soap melts.",
      "content": "Heat the mixture until the soap melts. Place the saucepan with the water and soap on the stove. Allow the mixture to slowly heat on medium until the soap melts completely, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. When all of the soap has melted, remove the pan from the stove and allow the mixture to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. [2] X Research source Do not allow the mixture to come to a boil on the stove. If it starts to boil, reduce the heat. Stirring the mixture as it heats can help the soap melt more quickly."

    {
      "title": "Mix in the vinegar.",
      "content": "Mix in the vinegar. Once the soap and water mixture has cooled for several minutes, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the pan. Stir well to ensure that the vinegar is fully incorporated. [3] X Research source You can substitute fresh lemon juice for the vinegar if you prefer. Both will help cut grease when you’re washing dishes. The amount of vinegar you should add to the soap depends on how thick the mixture is. If it is extremely thick, add approximately 2 tablespoons (30 ml) to help loosen it up. If the soap mixture is already liquidy, just add approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml)."

      "title": "Cool the mixture completely before transferring to a soap dispenser.",
      "content": "Cool the mixture completely before transferring to a soap dispenser. Allow the soap to sit in the pot until it is completely cooled, which may take 15 to 20 minutes. Next, pour the soap into a soap dispenser or pump bottle, and place beside your kitchen sink. [4] X Research source It’s often easier to transfer the soap from the pan to the dispenser with a funnel."

      "title": "Heat the water and grated soap until the soap melts.",
      "content": "Heat the water and grated soap until the soap melts. Add 1 ½ cups (353 ml) of water and ¼ cup (9 ml) of tightly packed, grated castile bar soap to a medium saucepan, and place on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the mixture to heat until the soap completely dissolves, which should take 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the stove. [5] X Research source Stir the mixture as it’s heating to help the soap dissolve more quickly."

      "title": "Add the liquid castile soap, some washing soda, and glycerin.",
      "content": "Add the liquid castile soap, some washing soda, and glycerin. Once the soap has dissolved completely and the mixture is off the heat, mix in ¼ cup (60 ml) of liquid castile soap, 2 ¼ teaspoons (10 g) of super washing soda, and ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) glycerin. Stir well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. [6] X Research source Washing soda is usually found in the laundry aisle of large grocery stores. If you can’t find it locally, you can order it from a variety of online stores."

    {
      "title": "Allow the soap to set.",
      "content": "Allow the soap to set. Leave the soap mixture in the pan, and let it sit for 24 hours. Stir it periodically during this period to get a feel for the consistency. The soap will thicken up over time so it’s okay if it’s a bit runny. If it seems too thin, though, you can warm the soap up, mix in additional washing soda, and let it set again. [7] X Research source If you’re adding extra washing soda, start by mixing in ¾ teaspoon (3 g) and letting the soap sit again. If it’s still not thick enough, mix in the washing soda in ½ teaspoon increments (2 g) until it’s the right consistency. If your soap has chunks or lumps, smooth it with a blender or an immersion blender."

    {
      "title": "Mix in the essential oils and transfer the soap to a soap dispenser.",
      "content": "Mix in the essential oils and transfer the soap to a soap dispenser. When the soap has reached your desired consistency, add 15 to 40 drops of your favorite essential oil. Stir well to ensure that the oil is blended throughout the soap for a fresh fragrance, and pour it into a soap dispenser for use beside the kitchen sink. [8] X Research source You can use any essential oil that you like, but citrus oils, such as lemon, lime, and orange, are particularly effective in cutting grease. Juniper and lavender are also good options."

      "content": "Combine the Borax, washing soda, vinegar, and castile soap. In a large bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon (2 g) of Borax, 1 tablespoon (14 g) of washing soda, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of white distilled vinegar, and ½ cup (120 ml) liquid castile soap. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are well blended. [9] X Research source Borax is a natural mineral that’s ground down into a powder and used in cleaning products, such as dish soap and laundry detergent. You can find it with washing soda in the laundry aisle of most grocery markets. If you want your dish soap to have a scent, you can use a scented castile soap, such as lavender, peppermint, citrus, or tea tree."

Pour 2 ½ cups (600 ml) of water into a medium saucepan, and heat on the stove on high until it is boiling, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the stove, and gradually pour the Borax mixture into the water, whisking after each addition to fully mix the soap. [10] X Research source If you want your soap to have a stronger scent, add 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil, such as lavender or tea tree, and mix well. It’s okay if your soap is thin and liquidy. It will thicken up as it cools."
