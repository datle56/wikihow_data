      "content": "Cut out 2 pieces of wax paper that are more than 2 ft (0.61 m) long. On a flat surface, roll out a sheet of paper . Then, use scissors to cut 2 lengths that are each a little more than 2 ft (0.61 m) long. [1] X Research source Wax paper is ideal for making sky lanterns because it's lightweight and translucent. Alternatively, use kite paper or butter paper."

      "content": "Glue the pieces of paper together along one of the long edges. Align the 2 pieces of paper side by side, so that the long edges overlap by about 0.5 in (13 mm). Then, glue these edges together with a glue stick to make 1 larger sheet of paper. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Glue the short ends of the paper together to create a cylinder.",
      "content": "Glue the short ends of the paper together to create a cylinder. Grab an edge of the paper perpendicular to the seam you just created, then fold it over to meet the opposite edge. Apply glue to 1 of the edges, and press it onto the other edge, overlapping them by about 0.5 in (13 mm). You now have a large paper cylinder. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut out a square piece of paper about 7 in (18 cm) on each side. The square piece of paper will be the top of your sky lantern. Make sure each side is about 7 in (18 cm) long, to overlap the edges. [4] X Research source Alternatively, set the cylinder upright on another piece of wax paper, and trace a square around the circular base, about 1 in (2.5 cm) wider than the base itself."

      "title": "Glue the square over one of the open ends of the paper cylinder.",
      "content": "Glue the square over one of the open ends of the paper cylinder. Place the cylinder upright on the square sheet of wax paper. Then, glue each of the edges of the square upward onto the sides of the cylinder. [5] X Research source After you’ve glued the edges upward, fold the corners flush with the cylinder and glue them down, as well."

      "title": "Measure and cut a length of wire equal to the cylinder’s circumference.",
      "content": "Measure and cut a length of wire equal to the cylinder’s circumference. Lay the cylinder on a flat surface so the open end is completely flat. Then, measure the length of the open end with a tape measure, and double the length to find the circumference. Measure and cut a piece of bare, thin wire that's about 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the circumference. Bend the wire into a ring shape, overlapping the ends by 1 inch (2.5 cm), and twist the ends together. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach 2 perpendicular strips across the wire circle. Cut 2 lengths of wire that span the diameter of the circle, and then some. Then, twist 1 end of 1 length to any point on the circle, and wrap the other end on the opposite side. Do the same for the other length, making the 2 cross at the center. These pieces of wire will hold the fuel you’ll use to light and launch your sky lantern. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Glue the wire ring inside the open end of the paper shell. Take the paper shell and hold it so the open end is facing up. Then, insert the wire ring inside the paper shell so it’s about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) away from the edge of the open end. Working your way around the ring, fold the edges of the paper down over the ring and glue them down to secure the ring in place. [8] X Research source To more neatly fold the edges, cut a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) slit into the edge of the paper every 4 in (10 cm) or so before folding and gluing. Once the lantern is assembled, spray it inside and out with a sparing layer of fire-retardant spray to fireproof it."

      "content": "Melt unscented candle wax in a pan over the stove top. Place 1 medium-sized, unscented candle in a saucepan on the stove over medium-low heat. Let it melt completely, stirring every couple of minutes. Candle wax will serve as part of the fuel for your sky lantern. [9] X Research source Leave the melted candle wax on the lit stove top until you’re ready to use it so it doesn’t harden. Once melted, fish out the wick with a fork and throw it away; we won’t need it."

Once the cloth is covered with wax (after about 1 minute), use a pair of tongs to lift it out of the pan. Let the cloth strip dry for 2 minutes. [10] X Research source"

Then, wrap the cloth strip around the middle of the wire frame and tie several knots. Continue tying knots until the whole strip is bundled up in the center of the frame and the ends are no longer sticking out. [11] X Research source Alternatively, dip a paper towel square into the wax, then remove it and let it dry. Then, poke a hole through the square and tie it to the center of the wire frame with a bit of string."

      "title": "Light your sky lantern in a safe outdoor location, away from trees.",
      "content": "Light your sky lantern in a safe outdoor location, away from trees. Find a large, open area free of vegetation, like a dirt field, to light your lantern. Sky lanterns are a fire hazard if they’re not lit in a safe place under the right conditions. Never launch your sky lantern indoors, and always check the weather before you light your lantern. If it’s going to be windy or rainy, wait and light it on a different day. [12] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Call your local fire department to check if sky lanterns are legal in your area—they may be outlawed in your state. Sky lanterns are illegal in Washington, Louisiana, Maine, and most states where fireworks are also illegal. [13] X Research source Avoid lighting your lantern beneath trees or powerlines, or next to tall buildings."

Keep holding it once it's lit, until you feel it pulled upward. [14] X Research source The lantern traps the hot air from the fire inside it. Hot air rises, pulling the lantern upward with it."

      "content": "Release your lantern. Once you feel your lantern being pulled upward, it’s ready to launch. Gently let go of your lantern and watch as it soars into the air. [15] X Research source Give your lantern a gentle upward push to help it climb into the sky. Your lantern may eventually burn up, or run out of fuel and fall to the ground. If you can, retrieve it and toss it in the garbage, or hold onto to it to keep the memory! Alternatively, tie a bit of fishing line to the wire frame of your lantern to use it like a kite. Be cautious of the lit fuel when reeling it back in."
