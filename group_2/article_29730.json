      "title": "Measure and cut the wood.",
      "content": "Measure and cut the wood. The basic shape of the rabbit cage is made up of two wooden frames connected by four posts. Purchase 2 in (5.1 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) wood from your local hardware store and use a wood saw to cut them to the appropriate lengths. Once completed, the cage will measure 6 feet (1.8 m) long by 3 feet (0.91 m) wide and 2 feet (0.61 m) tall, which is enough for 2 or 3 medium sized rabbits. You will need 4 pieces that measure 3 feet (0.91 m) in length, 4 that measure 2 feet (0.61 m), and 4 that measure 6 feet (1.8 m). You will also need one piece of plywood that measures 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2 feet (0.61 m). You can either cut that yourself or purchase a piece of that size from your local hardware store. Always wear eye protection when sawing wood."

      "content": "Use screws to connect a 3 ft (0.91 m) piece to a 6 ft (1.8 m) piece. Lay one of the 6 ft (1.8 m) pieces of wood on the ground on its side. Then position a 3 ft (0.91 m) piece perpendicular to it on one side, so the two pieces create the shape of an L. Use screws and a power drill or electric screwdriver to bind the two pieces together in this position. Use screws that are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long to ensure they penetrate through both pieces of wood. You can purchase wood screws at your local hardware store."

      "title": "Screw another 3 ft (0.91 m) piece to the other end of the wood.",
      "content": "Screw another 3 ft (0.91 m) piece to the other end of the wood. Position another 3 ft (0.91 m) piece of wood at a perpendicular angle to the 6 ft (1.8 m) piece you already used, but this time on the opposite side so the three pieces of wood form a U shape. Then secure the third piece in place with screws. Make sure you position the 3 ft (0.91 m) pieces of wood on both sides of the 6 ft (1.8 m) piece in the same way so they match."

      "title": "Attach another long piece to the short ones, creating a rectangle.",
      "content": "Attach another long piece to the short ones, creating a rectangle. Grab a second 6 ft (1.8 m) piece of wood and lay it on its side across the two extended 3 ft (0.91 m) pieces. With all four pieces laying on the ground, the wood should now take the shape of a rectangle. Use screws to attach the second 6 ft (1.8 m) piece of wood to the others to create the rectangle shape. Insert two screws into each corner to ensure the frame is strong and stable."

      "title": "Repeat that process to create another wooden rectangle.",
      "content": "Repeat that process to create another wooden rectangle. Follow the same steps above when building a second frame that matches the first one. These two frames will serve as the top and bottom of the rabbit cage. Repeat the steps exactly to ensure both frames are a perfect match for one another. Once finished, you will have two matching wooden rectangular frames."

      "title": "Lay one rectangle flat on the ground.",
      "content": "Lay one rectangle flat on the ground. This frame will serve as the bottom of the cage. Make sure you lay it down in an area where you have sufficient room to work, but it doesn’t have to be where the cage will remain permanently. [1] X Research source Once finished, the frame will be small enough to move with a friend. If you are building the cage indoors, make sure there’s enough room around the frame for you to easily move around to each of its four corners as you work."

      "title": "Screw the remaining 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces of wood upright into all four corners of the rectangle.",
      "content": "Screw the remaining 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces of wood upright into all four corners of the rectangle. The 2 ft (0.61 m) pieces of wood are posts that will hold up the second frame as the top of the cage. Place the 2 ft (0.61 m) piece upright inside the four corners of the frame that’s on the ground, then use two 3 in (7.6 cm) wood screws on each post to secure them to the frame. Align the posts so that they are standing perfectly upright before screwing them into place. Mount all four posts to the bottom frame before moving on to the next step."

      "title": "Lower the other wooden frame onto the upright pieces of wood.",
      "content": "Lower the other wooden frame onto the upright pieces of wood. Ask a friend to help you lift the second wooden frame up so you can slide it over the upright posts attached to the bottom frame. Position the upper frame so the posts are inside all 4 corners and lower the frame until the posts and the top of the frame are flush or even. [2] X Research source Once you have the frame positioned, you and your friend will have to hold it in place until it is secured."

      "title": "Have a friend screw the second frame into the top of the upright posts.",
      "content": "Have a friend screw the second frame into the top of the upright posts. Have your friend insert a 3 in (7.6 cm) wood screw through the upper frame and into each upright post to hold it in place. Once those first 4 screws are in, you and your other friend can let go of the frame. Then add an additional 3 in (7.6 cm) screw to each corner to ensure it’s secure and stable. [3] X Research source You may be able to use just 1 screw per corner, but 2 will be sturdier. With the screws in place, the basic frame of the cage is complete."

      "title": "Lay the plywood down onto the lower frame and secure it with screws.",
      "content": "Lay the plywood down onto the lower frame and secure it with screws. A rabbit cage should include an area that’s elevated from the ground and offers the rabbits shelter. Lay a piece of plywood that measures 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2 feet (0.61 m) across the bottom frame on one side. Then use wood screws to secure it into place. [4] X Research source This step will create a small portion of the cage with an elevated floor. The remainder of the cage floor will be open to the ground."

      "title": "Place a rabbit shelter on the plywood.",
      "content": "Place a rabbit shelter on the plywood. You can purchase pre-made rabbit shelters from your local pet store, but there are a number of inexpensive alternatives. Any overturned plastic container with a hole cut for a door can serve as a rabbit shelter for inside your cage. [5] X Research source The shelter will give the rabbits a place to hide from rain or intense sunlight. It is easier to put the shelter in place before enclosing the cage, but you’ll still be able to access it from the bottom when the cage is complete."

      "title": "Unroll your screen over the top of the box.",
      "content": "Unroll your screen over the top of the box. Just about any metal screen material or wire chicken fence will do for the sides of your enclosure. Purchase a roll of your choice in screen material from your local hardware store and then unroll it across the top of your rabbit cage to cover the entire opening. Choose a screen or mesh material with openings that are smaller than a rabbit will be. You will need at least 24 feet (7.3 m) of screen material, but you’ll want to purchase a bit more than that to ensure you have slack to work with."

      "title": "Use a staple gun to secure the screen to the top of the box.",
      "content": "Use a staple gun to secure the screen to the top of the box. Lay staples across the wire of the screen and into the wooden frame. Secure the screen to the entire top of the cage by placing a staple every 4 inches (10 cm) or so, while keeping the screen taught across the top. [6] X Research source Be sure to keep the screen pulled tight over the frame as you stable it in place to avoid creating any loose portions a rabbit could escape through. You can purchase a staple gun and staples at your local hardware store. DIY specialist, Sarah Fogle, offers a few tips to make sure your staple gun doesn’t jam. She says, “First, be sure to note the end of the staple gun where the staples are supposed to come out of. This is where the “legs” of the staple should come out first. The tool is often marked with an arrow of where the staples will come out.” She instructs that you load your staple gun from the back, by first lifting the latch that holds the spring into place. Then, load a full sleeve of joined staples. Insert the spring into place, and close the latch so that the spring is compressed into place."

      "title": "Snip away any excess screen material with shears.",
      "content": "Snip away any excess screen material with shears. Use wire cutters or metal shears to cut the screen that hangs over the sides of the frame away. Cut the screen so no metal extends beyond the wood; otherwise, it may snag your clothes or scratch you as you walk past the cage. [7] X Research source You can also use pliers to fold any bits of metal extending out from the frame back onto itself so no sharp points are sticking out. Cut the screen you secured to the top away from the roll so you can use the roll to cover the rest of the cage as well."

      "title": "Wrap screen around the sides of the box and secure it with staples.",
      "content": "Wrap screen around the sides of the box and secure it with staples. The easiest way to secure the screen to the sides of the cage is to lay the cage frame on its side and roll the screen out over it just as you did with the top. Staple the screen in place, using one staple every 4 inches (10 cm) or so, then rotate the cage and do the same for the next side. Repeat this process for all four sides until the cage now has a screen secured over everything but the very bottom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut away any excess material after the screen is secured.",
      "content": "Cut away any excess material after the screen is secured. Use your shears or wire cutters to remove all the excess screen material hanging off of the sides you covered. The cage will not be completely enclosed except for the bottom. This open bottom is by design, so you can lift the cage up to get to the rabbits rather than installing a door. [8] X Research source If you choose to screen in the bottom of the cage because you’re worried about animals digging their way in or out of the cage, consider zip tying the screen in place so you can remove it and gain access to the interior of the cage when necessary."

      "content": "Place your rabbits in their new home. With the cage flat on the ground or floor, lift up the opposite side from the rabbit shelter. Have a friend hold the cage up while you place your rabbits inside , then carefully lower the cage back down to enclose them in. [9] X Research source To clean the cage, have a friend lift up the end opposite from the rabbit shelter and remove the rabbit. Then you can turn the cage onto its side or even upside down for easy cleaning. To give the rabbit food or water in the cage, lift up the same end to slide the bowl in."

      "title": "Is an indoor or outdoor cage better for my rabbit?",
      "content": "Is an indoor or outdoor cage better for my rabbit? In general, an indoor cage or hutch is best for your pet bunny due to environmental concerns, potential brushes with predators, and other animals with diseases. One major incentive for indoor cages is that rabbits don’t have sweat glands and can quickly overheat, so keeping their environment at around 70 degrees is recommended. [10] X Research source If you choose to set up their hutch outside , you should place it in a shady spot and include a small shelter to shield them from the elements. If the temperature drops below 40 degrees F (4 degrees C) or rises above 75 degrees F (24 degrees C), bring your bunny indoors. Outdoor hutches should also be elevated a few feet off the ground and fenced in to protect your pet rabbit from predators like raccoons."

      "title": "How much room do rabbits need in a cage?",
      "content": "How much room do rabbits need in a cage? While it does depend on the size and breed of your bunny, rabbit cages should offer a significant amount of room for rabbits to move around and tend to their necessities. Rabbits should be able to roam in their cages a bit, and there should also be enough space for a water bottle, food bowl, and litter box. [11] X Research source Airflow is very important when considering your rabbit’s home, so having enough room to install fans is ideal. Regardless of how roomie their cage is, rabbits should be let out to exercise for about 4 hours a day."

      "title": "What other items do rabbits need in their cage?",
      "content": "What other items do rabbits need in their cage? Rabbits need bedding, a litter box, a hide box, a hay rack, a water bottle, a small pellet dish, and toys. If you’ve rabbit-proofed your home and your pet is allowed to roam around, toys can be kept outside the cage on padded yoga mats, if you don’t have carpet. [12] X Research source If your bunny is indeed allowed to play inside your home, be sure to install 3-4 foot high baby gates to prevent them from hopping over."

      "title": "How often should I clean the rabbit cage?",
      "content": "How often should I clean the rabbit cage? You should let your rabbit out of its cage and clean the cage diligently about once a week. Remove all the bedding, litter, food, and water containers, discarding disposable items in exchange for new ones. Empty the litter box and wipe down the cage with a rabbit-safe cleaner or disinfectant solution. Rinse off all the cleaning chemicals and let the cage dry for several minutes before re-introducing your bunny to its home. You should do some light maintenance and cleaning every day, like spot cleaning the litter box and bedding, as well as getting rid of soiled materials or uneaten food. You can use gentle dish soap to regularly clean the waterspout."
