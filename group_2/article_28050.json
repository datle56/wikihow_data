      "content": "Crush ice to your blender . You can add a little bit of ice to make a personal snow cone, a moderate amount of ice to serve a few people, or you could fill the blender with ice to create many servings. Be sure to follow the directions that came with your blender for best results. Depending on your blender, you might have many different settings to choose from when crushing your ice. In many cases, the puree feature will give you finely crushed ice, which is ideal for snow cones. You might like your snow cones with larger bits of ice. If so, you should blend your ice for a shorter period of time. Extra fine ice can be achieved by running the ice through the blender for longer. If you don't have a blender, you can put your ice in a heavy duty plastic bag and smash the ice with a rolling pin, hammer, or tenderizing mallet. You could also drop your ice repeatedly onto a hard surface to crush this ice, though this may take some time. [1] X Research source You can also make your snow cone out of fresh, clean snow. You should exercise caution when doing this, though. Some snow may contain impurities that are unhealthy to consume. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the ice from your blender. You can leave your ice in the blender and scoop it out for the snow cones, but you should be careful that no one accidentally cuts themselves on the blades at the bottom of the blender. To prevent this, you may want to pour or scoop your ice from the blender into a bowl. [3] X Research source For especially large parties, you might have to prepare several blender's worth of ice and put it in a bowl for serving. You can keep your ice frozen until you're ready to serve it by keeping the blended ice in your freezer. You shouldn't leave your blended ice in the freezer for too long. If you do, it may refreeze leaving you with a bowl of solid ice."

Sprinkle your choice of syrup over your shaved ice then add sweetened condensed milk liberally until you reach the desired level of sweetness. You may find this works easiest when using a squeeze bottle or a container with a spout. [11] X Research source An example recipe you might try at home uses 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 2 cans of chocolate syrup (or 2 squeeze bottles), 8 cans of evaporated milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Combine these ingredients in a bowl, chill the mixture, and then you can drizzle it over your crushed ice. You can adjust the amount of syrup and sweetened condensed milk to suit your tastes. Another alternative you could use in place of sweetened condensed milk is marshmallow fluff. [12] X Research source"

Add fresh or frozen fruit to your blender and hit the puree button until your fruit reaches the desired consistency. Then add the fruit to the top of your snow cones. If you have berry flavored syrups, you might consider making a berry medley puree. Add blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries to your blender, blend, and you'll have a tasty snow cone topper. If you've made a fresh fruit puree, you can freeze this to give it the same consistency as your crushed ice. Simply make your puree and allow this to freeze in your freezer overnight. Depending on how much it hardens, you may need to run it through your blender again. [13] X Research source"
