      "title": "Measure the spots for the curtain rod brackets first.",
      "content": "Measure the spots for the curtain rod brackets first. This will make measuring the height for the valance easier. Make sure you put the spots for the curtain brackets at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the edge of the window on either side. Put the curtain bracket markings at least 4 inches (10 cm) from the top of the window, as this will ensure they hang properly and make the windows look long. Use a red pen to mark the spots for the curtain rod brackets so you do not confuse them with the markings for the valance brackets. Check that the valance brackets are double the length of the curtain rod brackets. So if your curtain rod brackets are 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, make sure you use valance brackets that are 4 inches (10 cm) long. Make sure the center of the rod is directly above the center of the window upon installing. The center of the rod will be where the center of the valance hangs."

      "title": "Mark the location for the first valance bracket.",
      "content": "Mark the location for the first valance bracket. Place the first bracket for the valance outside of the curtain rod marking, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the curtain rod marking. Use a blue pen or pencil to mark the location."

    {
      "title": "Mark the location for the second valance bracket.",
      "content": "Mark the location for the second valance bracket. Measure from the first marking to the other side of the window. Place the marking for the second bracket 1 inch (2.5 cm) outside of the curtain rod marking. The length between the two markings should be the same length as the valance you are using. Measure the valance and then measure the distance between the two markings to ensure they match."

    {
      "title": "Use a level to confirm the two markings line up.",
      "content": "Use a level to confirm the two markings line up. Hold the level between your hands and place it horizontally at the level of the two markings. The bubble in the middle of the level should appear centered. This is how you know the two markings are at the same height."

      "title": "Install the curtain rod brackets.",
      "content": "Install the curtain rod brackets. Use the drill to screw in the brackets for the curtain rod. Work one bracket at a time, lining up the screws for the bracket with the marking you made on the wall. Put the curtain rod brackets up first so you can use them as a guide when you put up the valance brackets. If you already have curtains up over the window, you can skip this step."

      "title": "Use the power drill to screw one of the valance brackets into the wall.",
      "content": "Use the power drill to screw one of the valance brackets into the wall. Line up the bracket with the markings on the wall. Hold the bracket in place with one hand and drill the screw into the holes on the bracket with the other hand. The valance brackets will require screws, rather than nails. You will need to use a power drill to secure the screws into the wall properly."

    {
      "title": "Drill in the other valance bracket.",
      "content": "Drill in the other valance bracket. Once you put in the first valance bracket, drill in the second bracket. Line up the bracket with the markings on the wall and secure the screws with the drill. The brackets should appear level and at the same height, on the outside of the curtain rod brackets."

      "title": "Hang the curtains.",
      "content": "Hang the curtains. Thread the curtain onto the rod and then hang the rod in the brackets. Adjust the curtain so it is distributed evenly across the rod. Put up the curtains first so they can hang behind the valance."

      "title": "Slide the valance onto its rod.",
      "content": "Slide the valance onto its rod. Hold the valance in one hand and slide the rod through it. The valance should hang flat off the rod."

      "title": "Put the rod onto the brackets and hang the valance.",
      "content": "Put the rod onto the brackets and hang the valance. Place the rod on the brackets for the valance. The brackets should be sturdy enough to hold the valance. The valance should hang down straight, just outside the curtain rod."

      "content": "Use a steamer to smooth out wrinkles on the valance. If you notice any creases or wrinkles in the valance, run a clothing steamer over them to remove them. The valance should lay flat and even over the curtains so it can add style and detail to the window. [1] X Research source"
