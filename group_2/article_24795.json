      "title": "Learn your size for heels.",
      "content": "Learn your size for heels. Many people wear different sizes for heels than they do for flats, which can make getting your size right tricky! Try on heels a half-size larger than your usual size to see if they fit more comfortably. [1] X Research source Try on different brands to see which ones fit you best. That will help you walk with comfort and ease, so your heels will be less likely to slip. [2] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. In addition, wearing shoes that fit poorly can lead you to suffer from blisters, cramped toes, and a lack of foot support. [3] X Research source Katie Quinn. Stylist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020."

      "content": "Buy platform or wedge heels. Stiletto heels look great, but they’re much harder to walk in. Buying wedge heels or heels with a platform sole will level your foot out and make it easier to walk. This will make it much easier for your foot to stay securely inside the shoe!

      "title": "Look for shoes with straps.",
      "content": "Look for shoes with straps. Sometimes, the actual shape of your shoe can prevent slipping. If you’re having problems with your feet slipping out of your heels, try picking shoes that will make them stay put. Ankle straps, T-straps, and Mary Janes help keep your foot firmly in place.

      "title": "Pick closed-toe shoes.",
      "content": "Pick closed-toe shoes. Over the course of a day, gravity and moisture can make your feet slide down into the toes of your shoes. If you’ve got open toes, your toes can slide down so far that they actually poke out, leaving lots of space in your heel! Try buying closed-toe shoes to keep your toes inside your shoe.

      "title": "Skip lotions and skin treatments for your feet.",
      "content": "Skip lotions and skin treatments for your feet. Slipping is often caused by damp feet sliding down into the toes of your heels. If you regularly treat your feet to lotions or foot masks, they could be adding to your body’s natural moisture and creating a slick, oily surface inside your shoe. Try skipping the treatments on the days you plan to wear heels. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle talcum powder on your feet. If your feet sweat often, try adding a thin layer of talcum powder to your soles or the inside of the shoe to dry them out. Be careful to brush off any extra powder on the tops of your feet!"

      "title": "Spray your feet with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray your feet with hairspray. Before putting your heels on, give your feet a quick spritz of hairspray. Spray about a foot away and focus on the bottoms and sides of your feet. This will help hold your heel in place. [8] X Research source Some people may find this method a little sticky and uncomfortable. Try this at home before going out."

      "content": "Wear no-show foot liners or tights with soles. Wearing footwear can prevent sweat and moisture from building up in your shoe. Buy no-show foot liners to wick away sweat. They can also take up space inside your shoe and keep your foot inside. For winter, you can buy tights with built-in soles. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Line the backs with double-sided tape. If your heel keeps slipping out, try adding a bit of double-sided tape to the inside back of your heels. Be sure to keep the roll of tape with you if you’re going out--it can lose its grip after a few hours. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Add heel grips.",
      "content": "Add heel grips. Many companies make special foam grips to prevent heels from slipping off. They usually look like small crescents, and you can stick them to the inside back of your shoes. These are especially helpful if your shoes are just a little too big. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Stuff the toes of your heels. If you’re wearing closed-toe heels, try stuffing a bit of tissue or moleskin into the toe to prevent your feet from sliding downward. Try this at home first before going out--if you overstuff your shoe, you can give yourself foot pains or blisters. [12] X Research source"

Simply buy the one closest to your shoe size and cut it to fit the dimensions of your shoe. You can buy insoles at most groceries or pharmacies, but moleskin may have to come from a cobbler or sewing supply store. [13] X Research source"
