      "content": "Capricorns are perfectionists at heart, even in romance. If you’ve been seeing a Capricorn, you could try gushing about another couple. If you make a point of mentioning qualities you admire in another pair, it could definitely make her a bit jealous. Her competitiveness will take over, and she’ll want to have all of those positive things you mentioned -- but with you! [2] X Research source If you mention that this couple really listens to each other, that’s exactly what she'll want to achieve in your relationship. So, you should comment on something you believe could positively impact your relationship. Try to make sure the emphasis isn't on your own relationship's problems. Instead, just focus on positives in the couple you've mentioned. You also should probably try to avoiding picking a compliment that relates to something she's already insecure about."

      "title": "A Capricorn will be super competitive, even about your romantic history.",
      "content": "A Capricorn will be super competitive, even about your romantic history. These women are driven by wanting to be the best in everything. She’ll be determined to make you see her as the perfect partner, even if you’re not officially together yet. So complimenting an ex’s strengths will definitely make her jealous. [3] X Research source Be casual, subtle, and gentle when using this strategy. Your compliment shouldn’t directly prey on the insecurities of the Capricorn woman. Proceed with tons of caution. Women of this sign can handle some jealousy here and there. However, if she suspects you’re still interested in your ex, she’ll probably bolt. For example, wear a piece of clothing bought for you by an ex-partner. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and say something simple, like, \"You know, my ex and I had our differences, but she sure knew how to pick out a shirt. She had a good eye for style.\" A comment like this will definitely get under a Capricorn's skin."

      "title": "A Capricorn wants to know that she’s your most accomplished connection.",
      "content": "A Capricorn wants to know that she’s your most accomplished connection. Casually mentioning that your colleague is super organized or that your friend is really responsible may seem innocent enough, but to a Capricorn , this sounds like a challenge. A Capricorn wants to be appreciated for her accolades and her killer work ethic. If you openly admire someone else for one of these reasons, she’ll definitely become a little jealous. Don’t put her own accomplishments down in the process. She needs to know how much you respect her, and she’ll definitely walk away if she questions that."

      "content": "Capricorns want to be right .. .all the time . If she’s caught up in a debate at a dinner or party, choosing the other arguer’s side will definitely get her attention. She’ll be annoyed that you think someone else has made stronger points than her. This will also probably make her a bit jealous. [4] X Research source Don’t take this too far by insulting the Capricorn woman’s argument. Focus on strengths in the other person’s logic. If you’re already in a relationship with her, consider choosing a different tactic. A Capricorn woman will need to know that you respect her opinions and intellect, and she won’t stick around if she's not sure that you do!"

      "title": "Capricorns, like anyone, won’t want to see their crush flirting with someone else.",
      "content": "Capricorns, like anyone, won’t want to see their crush flirting with someone else. Try being a bit flirty with another person at a party. This will work best if it’s done in front of other people. Capricorns are super invested in how they're perceived by their circle. If she’s going to get jealous of someone you’re hitting on, it’ll most likely be when you’ve got an audience for it! If you’re already in a relationship, consider a different strategy. Capricorns expect to be totally respected in their partnerships, and she probably won’t stand for your very public flirting."

      "content": "To Capricorns, stimulating conversation is like a love language. Enjoy some quippy or intellectual chat with another person to make her a bit envious. She’ll see that you’re capable of having exciting, intelligent conversations (which will be impressive to her!). [5] X Research source It'll also make her want to be the person you’re having those conversations with, resulting in a little jealousy. This should work whether you’re already in a relationship or not. But if you are already together, don’t go overboard. If you give tons of time and energy to just one person for an entire evening, the Capricorn could end up being more than jealous. She might just be done with you!"

      "title": "A Capricorn will be super jealous of anyone you’re cheering on in life.",
      "content": "A Capricorn will be super jealous of anyone you’re cheering on in life. She wants to know that the people she cares about will support her while she reaches all of her impressive goals. If you spend a little extra time supporting the ambitions of someone at work, especially someone high-achieving and clever, this could definitely make her jealous. [6] X Research source Keep this effort to a minimum. Capricorns are logical masters of-self control. If you’re in a relationship and she sees that you’re there for someone else more than for her, she'll see that as an issue worth ending the relationship over."

      "content": "Capricorn women care a lot about the opinions of others. If you give everyone in the room personalized attention but her, she’ll feel like you’re rejecting her in front of a crowd. This could cause her to feel some envy. Definitely avoid being rude or unkind. Don’t ignore her if she approaches you. Instead, focus on casually seeking out conversation with as many people as you can, besides the Capricorn in question."

If you’re in a relationship with her, she’s going to be super invested in your achievements. When you receive a big promotion at work, she’ll absolutely want to be the one to toast you at your big dinner. [7] X Research source Seek out others to celebrate your accomplishments now and then. She’ll be envious of the people you choose to surround yourself with. [8] X Research source Avoid overdoing this. If she starts to believe you aren’t sharing things equally in your relationship, she’ll hit the road."

      "content": "A Capricorn expects others to spend as much time on her as she does on them. Having a relationship that’s equal in support, affection, and time spent is super important to this sign. Reduce the amount of time you dedicate to her in a given week. In the best case, she’ll start to miss your intellectual conversation and companionship, without feeling slighted. [9] X Research source Don’t pull back too much. She’s super observant, so she’ll notice the small changes. There’s no need to try to be really obvious! If you go cold too quickly, this will just make her want to leave the relationship. A Capricorn person can be afraid of rejection. [10] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019."

She wants to be the most successful person in the rolodex of every person she knows. If she’s not that person to you, she’ll be jealous. Introduce her to friends of yours that you know will impress her with their careers, their wealth, or their wit. This will make her envious!
