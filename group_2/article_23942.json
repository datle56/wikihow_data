      "content": "Measure the room to be carpeted. Take these measurements to your carpet dealer to make sure you get an ample amount of carpet for your job. Be sure to tell them that you are carpeting over concrete since that requires different carpet material as well as slightly different tools than carpeting over wooden surfaces."

      "title": "Prepare for the dealer's questions.",
      "content": "Prepare for the dealer's questions. Typically, you'll be asked some basic questions about the room and your intended use for the room. These questions are designed to help you pick the most appropriate carpet, and are good questions to ask yourself anyway. It helps to give some thought beforehand so you don't have to make a hasty decision. A dealer may ask: Are there a lot of windows in the room? Will there be heavy or light traffic in the room? Do you have kids or pets? Is there direct access from outside? How large is the room? Dealers will also typically try to sell you on Stainmaster, Teflon, and Anti-Static technology at various levels of expense to you. Remember, the decision's up to you. Get something that'll serve your purpose, but don't get pushed into expensive options you don't want."

      "content": "Select a carpet that will stand up to the concrete. Make sure the entire carpet is constructed of synthetic products only. Some carpet is backed with jute, which is too absorbent to use on concrete. If you're not going to install your carpet on a subfloor, you'll need to make sure that you're picking a kind of fiber that will stand up to concrete's tendency to collect moisture. Consider carpet made from olefin face fiber. A chemical-resistant fiber that will stand up to aggressive cleaning solutions like bleach, this might not be the softest or most attractive carpet, but it will last. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide on a style of carpet.",
      "content": "Decide on a style of carpet. You can choose between patterned or solid carpet, as well as a light or dark color. You can also choose tight or loose fiber loops and pick between a solid or mesh subsurface. Typically, the carpet rule of thumb is that light carpet can seem to create more space in a smaller room, while a darker shade of carpet can add coziness to a bigger space."

Ignoring the problem now could result in a costly and expensive project down the road, especially if you end up with harmful mold and end up having to tear out the carpet and repeat all your hard work. Rent or buy a moisture reader to test the humidity yourself. You should do this a week or more prior to carpet installation day to allow plenty of time for the waterproofing to be done."

You should also use a liquid nail glue along with the nails for a secure fit. Leave a gap the thickness of the carpet's pile between the gripper strip and the wall. This is where you will tuck the edges of the carpet during installation. Tack strip is also known as gripper rod (UK), carpet gripper, Smooth edge (Can), tack strip, and gripper edge. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can use glue-down carpet, rather than tack strips."

As a novice, you might want to avoid using a power stretcher, since they can overstretch or even rip carpet. They are hydraulic, heavy, and very expensive."
