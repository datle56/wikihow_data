      "content": "Rest the limb with the hematoma. Make sure you rest the affected area during the first 24–72 hours of developing the hematoma. This will prevent any further bleeding and allow the area to heal. [3] X Research source Some physicians recommend that you rest a lower limb that has hematoma, such as your leg, for at least 48 hours. The duration of the rest period is dependent on the extent of the hematoma."

This will decrease the pain and swelling of the hematoma. [4] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source To do an ice massage, freeze a plastic foam cup of water. Hold the cup and place a cloth or paper towel over the affected limb, then apply the ice. Never apply ice or an ice pack directly to the skin, as this increases the risk for a thermal burn or frostbite. After the first 48 hours, you can use a heated compress, such as a heating pad or a very warm washcloth, two to three times a day to help your body reabsorb the blood from the hematoma."

      "content": "Compress the hematoma to reduce any swelling. Use a compression wrap or a compressive elastic bandage over the hematoma until it appears less swollen. You can find compression wraps and compressive elastic bandages at your local drugstore or pharmacy. [5] X Research source You should maintain compression on the area for at least 2 to 7 days. Make sure the compression bandage is applied properly and is snug but not cutting off blood circulation to the limb. A wrap that cuts off circulation will trigger throbbing in the area or skin color changes, such as becoming a deeper purple or blanching entirely."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is a very effective pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle and take no more than 2 pills at a time. Repeat this dosage every 4 to 6 hours. Naproxen sodium (Aleve) is another anti-inflammatory medication. Take this medication every 12 hours as needed for pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an effective pain reliever that can be used to ease any discomfort or pain. If you have a bleeding disorder, avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, as these medications can interfere with blood platelets and prolong your bleeding."
