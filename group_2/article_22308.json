      "title": "Rest your voice.",
      "content": "Rest your voice. Depending on the severity of the damage, you should rest your voice for one to five days. To rest your voice you must avoid any kind of speaking, as well as activities that may strain your vocal cords like strenuous exercise and heavy lifting. If you must speak to a large group, consider using a microphone or megaphone.

      "content": "Gargle for 20 seconds. Take a sip of the liquid and tilt your head back. Allow the liquid to go as far back in your throat as possible without swallowing it. Softly blow air from the back of your throat to start gargling. Make sure to spit out the liquid once you finish gargling. You can also simply sip your tea and let it coat your throat. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For each session, gargle three times. Gargle every two to three hours throughout the day. Make sure to gargle before you go to bed. This way the herbs and honey can soothe and treat your vocal cords while you sleep.

This will enable your vocal cords to rest and heal after the procedure.

Vocal cord repositioning consists of moving your vocal cords closer together by moving tissue from the outside of your vocal box toward the inside. Reinnervation consists of replacing the damaged vocal cord with a healthy nerve from a different area of your neck. A tracheotomy consists of making an incision in your neck to create an opening to access your windpipe. A tube will be inserted in the opening to allow air to bypass the damaged vocal cords."
