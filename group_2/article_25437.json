      "content": "Using your own WhatsApp account, start paying attention to your girlfriend's Status updates. WhatsApp Statuses are text, photo, video, and GIF updates that disappear automatically after 24 hours. [1] X Research source You can see your girlfriend's Status by tapping the Status tab at the bottom of WhatsApp and selecting her name. Is she sharing quotes, memes, text, or song lyrics that indicate she's going through something you're not privy to? Ask her about her Status updates if they seem suspicious."

      "title": "Ask to look at her phone.",
      "content": "Ask to look at her phone. The best way to find the proof that you need is to ask her to show you her WhatsApp chats. If your girlfriend is using WhatsApp to cheat and hasn't deleted incriminating conversations, you'll probably find the proof that you need by reading her conversations. If she is not willing to let you look at her chats, that doesn't always mean she is cheating—she could just want privacy and autonomy, which is fair. [2] X Research source It's normal and healthy for people to have close friendships outside of their partnerships. If your girlfriend is communicating with someone you don't know and she says that the person is just a friend, she could be telling the truth. Try to avoid the temptation of looking at her messages without her permission. If she isn't cheating and you overstep your boundaries, this could cause irreparable damage to your relationship."

      "content": "If you don't have time to use her phone for long, read her chats on the web. Even if you only have access to her phone for a minute or so, you can use it to log into her WhatsApp account on your computer so you can read her messages without having her phone in your hand. She will see a notification each time you log in to her account on the web, so do this at your own risk if you're looking at her phone behind her back. Here's how to set this up: In a web browser on your computer, go to https://web.whatsapp.com . Open WhatsApp on her phone. Tap the menu icon (Android only) and select Settings. Tap Linked Devices . [3] X Research source When the camera screen appears, position the QR code in your browser in the camera viewfinder. This will log you in to her account."

However, it's possible for her to change the contact names in WhatsApp so they'll be different from how they appear in the phone contact list. If you see any contacts in WhatsApp that look suspicious, such as symbols or emojis instead of names, tap a conversation with that contact, tap the name at the top of the chat, and then take note of the phone number. [4] X Research source Compare that phone number to her phone's contact list to find the real identity of that person. [5] X Research source"

Scroll down and look for \"Disappearing Messages.\" If it says \"Off\" beneath it, messages are not set to disappear automatically. If it says a time like 24 hours or 7 days , any messages either person in the chat sends to one another will automatically delete after that time period."

If it's an Android, open the File Manager app (it could be called My Files or Files ) and go to Internal Storage/WhatsApp/Media/folder .

While nowadays it's common for people to be extremely connected to their phones (even bringing phones into the bathroom), most people eventually put them down. If your girlfriend used to put her phone down on the table, counter, or nightstand but now only keeps it in her pocket or under her pillow, she could be worried that you'll look through her messages or calls. [11] X Research source If your girlfriend is being secretive about who she's talking to or what she's doing, ask her about it. If she's open to explaining herself, that's a good sign. If she's not open to talking about things or you get the sense that she's lying, it's possible that she could be cheating. Keep in mind that your girlfriend might just be having private conversations with friends or family. If she thinks you're the snooping type, this could lead her to feeling like she needs to be more secretive about those conversations."

When your girlfriend is using her phone in your presence, does she angle herself away from you to deliberately prevent you from seeing what's she doing? Does she keep her phone face-down all the time so you can't see her notifications? She could just be doing something private, like looking up something embarrassing on the internet or gossiping with a friend. But it also could mean that she's hiding something from you . [12] X Research source If she's texting or chatting a lot when you're supposed to be spending quality time together, gently request that she be more present when you're together.
