      "content": "Measure, mark, and cut two triangular slits in your paper. On a flat work surface, set out a piece of 12-by-18 inch white construction paper. You will also need a pencil, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. To create the two slits: Along one of the two 18 inch sides, measure and mark the following lengths in order: 6 ¼ inches, 1 inch, 3 ½ inches, 1 inch, and 6 ¼ inches. The two 1 inch sections will serve as the bases of the two triangular slits. To create the legs of the two triangles, measure and mark a 3-inch line from each end of the 1 inch base. Cut out the two 3-by-3-by-1 inch triangles. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the hat. To form the hat, you will make four folds. The first fold will create the brim. The other three folds will create the back of the bonnet. Create a 2-by-18 inch fold along the paper’s uncut edge. Fold down the center flap (the section between the two triangular slits). Fold the outer two sections over the center section so that they overlap. Staple the outer two sections together or run a piece of scotch tape along the seam. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a hat pattern or cut out your own.",
      "content": "Create a hat pattern or cut out your own. On a flat workspace, set out a piece of black poster board, a ruler, a pencil, and a pair of scissors. While you can create your own hat shape, you may also use the measurements listed below. To create the pattern, lightly draw the following lines on the poster board: Draw a 5-inch (12.7 cm) horizontal line near the top of the black poster board. This line will form the top of the hat. Draw two 10 inch (25.4 cm) angled lines from the ends of the 5 inch (12.7 cm) horizontal line. These two lines should be angled out towards the respective edges of the poster board. Connect the two angled lines with a horizontal line. This line will form the base of the hat and should be parallel to the 5 inch (12.7 cm) line. Draw one 1 inch (2.54 cm) vertical line up from each end of the base line, so that the 1 inch (2.54 cm) lines are perpendicular to the base line. Connect the top of each 1 inch (2.54 cm) line to the 10 inch (25.4 cm) lines with a horizontal line. This will create the illusion of a hat brim. Cut out the hat along the lines."

      "content": "Measure, cut, and attach a paper headband. A headband will attach to the backside of the hat. To create the headband: Measure and mark three 1-by-10 inch (2.54-by-25.4 cm) strips of black poster board. Carefully cut out the strips. Staple two of the strips together at the ends. Wrap the two strips around your head. If the band does not wrap around your head, add the third strip. Place the hat upside down on the table so that the pencil marks are facing up. Lay the band across the base of your hat and center it. Staple the band to the center of the hat. [5] X Research source"

Inside the first square, create a 2-by-2 inch (5.08-by-5.08 cm) square. There should be a 1-inch (2.54 cm) edge between the two squares. Cut out the larger square and then cut of the smaller square. Glue the square to the center of the hat. In addition to the gold buckle, you can add a brown band that sits just above the brim of the hat. [6] X Research source"

Ask a friend to mark where the two bands overlap. Take the headband off, match up the two marks, and staple the ends together. If there is a lot of excess paper, you can trim the ends of the band.

      "content": "Create a historically correct pilgrim costume. Contrary to popular belief, pilgrims didn’t dress in all black or accessorize with gold buckles. While they wore black and gray clothing to church on Sundays, the puritanical pilgrims wore colorful clothing throughout the week. Instead of gold buckles, which were extremely expensive and not popular at the time, the pilgrims laced up their pants and shoes with leather ties. If you want to dress as an everyday pilgrim, wear simple, colorful clothing, shoes that tie, a collar, and a hat or bonnet. [12] X Research source"
