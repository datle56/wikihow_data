Leave the top edge alone, or you won't be able to put any money inside. For a crisper finish, run your fingernail along the fold to sharpen the crease. If you don't have any glue or double-sided tape, you can use regular tape or even a stapler. This won't give you a very neat finish, however, but it will do if you just need something to hold your money."

Turn the envelope over so that the plain, seam-less side is facing you, and decorate it with stamps or stickers. If you are artistic, you can also draw something or write a message. If this is for the Chinese New Year, consider drawing the current zodiac on the envelope. You can also draw bamboo or coins, both of which are common symbols of prosperity.
