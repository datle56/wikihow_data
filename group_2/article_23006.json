      "content": "If this was mutual, give yourself about a month to move on . The goal here is to sort things out for yourself and take some time to heal, reflect, and move on. Roughly 4 weeks of time alone should be enough to get back into the normal rhythm of the single life . It might feel messy and strange at first, but after 30 days you may find yourself feeling much better. [1] X Research source While 30 days is a good rule of thumb, everybody is different. Some people move on really fast after a breakup, while other people take a long time. If 30 days pass and you still aren’t ready, it’s totally okay to extend your period of no contact."

      "content": "Let your ex know what you’re doing to smooth things over. If the breakup really was smooth and you know you might want to reconnect with your ex as friends in the future, feel free to tell them what you’re doing. You can just shoot them a text and explain why you’re going to go MIA for a while—it shouldn’t be a big deal. [2] X Research source You could say, “Hey, just a head’s up, I’m going to block you on social media for a while and I won’t answer the phone. You didn’t do anything wrong or anything, but I just need some space to focus on me if that’s okay.”"

If the two of you were together for 6-12 months (or longer), give yourself at least 60 days before you think about reaching out. You’re probably going through a lot if you’ve broken up with someone you were with for a while, and it’s okay if it takes a little longer to process that. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Some relationships end with a bit of chaos, so don’t rush things. Give yourself roughly 3 months to recover before reaching out. If the relationship ended in a shouting match or the two of you were throwing insults back and forth, it can take extra time to let the anger and frustration go—and that’s totally okay! Once the anger subsides, you’ll have plenty of time to sort out your other feelings. [6] X Research source If the breakup was kind of dramatic and sudden, you may want to reach out after a week or two. While that’s always an option, it’s still probably best to take a few months to cool off. [7] X Research source If they reach out first to repair things and you want that as well but it hasn’t been at least 90 days, go ahead and tell them. Say something like, “Hey, I do want to reconnect and repair things, but I also kind of need time to cool off. Please give a few weeks to figure out how I feel before we reconnect.”"

It gives you time to get some perspective and figure out just how rewarding life can be without your awful ex. You deserve better, so don’t look back until you’re absolutely clear that’s what you want. [8] X Research source If you were with an abusive person or they had a tendency to gaslight you into thinking things are your fault, it can cross some wires in your head.

But if you really do want to reach out in the future (like… far future), look to see if something has dramatically changed before going through with it. If they were an alcoholic, they should be in treatment. If they were verbally abusive, they should be in anger management. Don’t return to someone who treated you wrong if they refuse to change. [10] X Research source Just to clarify, this may take years. Don’t plan on reaching out to a toxic ex any time soon—even if you really, really want to."

It’s a good move—especially if it feels like maybe your ex was on the fence about breaking up. Wait 1-2 weeks for them to realize how empty their life is without you. Then, send them a text or call them to see how they’re doing. [11] X Research source If they hit you up in the meantime, let them know you need some time to figure out what you want.

You don’t want to make them despair, but your ex also shouldn’t feel like they hold all the cards. If this is going to work, it’s because your ex broke up and regrets the decision. But if you just come right out of the gates saying how empty you are without them, they may not feel like they need you the same way you need them. [12] X Research source"

One way to figure out if you’re “done” with the no contact rule is to ask yourself, “If I found out that he/she/they fell in love and started going out with someone new, would I be upset?” If the answer is that you’d feel nothing at all, you’re done!

You’ll want to reach out and fill that void left by your ex. If you don’t contact them and you get past that urge, it will be easier tomorrow. If it is easier, your no contact rule is working! Each week, you should find yourself thinking less and less about your ex. Eventually, you’ll get past the pain and come out stronger on the other side.
