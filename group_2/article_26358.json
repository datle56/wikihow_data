      "content": "Go with boxy, structured clothing. When you’re picking out clothes to wear, go for boxy fits that aren’t super form-fitting. Loose T-shirts, structured jackets, and slim-fitting pants or jeans are all great staple items to go for. The more structured fit of your items will make your shoulders look bigger and your chest look broader. [1] X Research source If you’re buying a suit, you can go for more of a fitted, figure-hugging cut."

      "content": "Stick with T-shirts for your casual, everyday wear. Whereas women are expected to combine a variety of tops, many men tend to reach for the T-shirt. Many men wear T-shirts of their favorite bands, or with artwork from their favorite TV shows and movies. If you want to give off an athletic appearance, consider buying plain white, gray, or black shirts. Sportswear would also be a good choice for an athletic male look."

      "content": "Purchase relaxed fit pants to pair with your shirts. Most men can be seen wearing blue jeans, navy slacks, and khakis.

These will give you a solid foundation to build multiple boyish or manly outfits. [2] X Research source Be sure to pick pants that fit comfortably.

      "content": "Get a suit and tie for formal occasions. For formal, business, and even some party occasions, it is appropriate to wear a suit and tie. Whether this is a simple blazer and overcoat, or a personally tailored tux, suits are an easy way to give off a male appearance. [3] X Research source Transforming the common female body into a male look often means minimizing your hips and emphasizing your shoulders, so opt for coats with shoulder pads to accentuate the appearance of a masculine build. Loud colors like green, pink, and teal are extremely uncommon among male formal wear. In order to pass as male, you will have better luck with suits in shades of navy or gray. Don’t worry if you can’t purchase a suit right now. You really only need one if you’re going to a fancy party or a business event. Most men don’t wear suits in everyday life unless they work for a very professional company."

A packer is something that is used to make a realistic bulge in your pants; it’s totally optional, but it can make you feel a bit more masculine. You can put an object in your underwear and leave it there throughout the day or when you’re out and about. There are lots of ways to pack, including: [11] X Research source Rolled up socks. Just put them in your pants or boxer shorts near your crotch area. If you're worried that it'll move out of position, getting boxer shorts made for trans men might be a good option. Packers.

      "content": "Make your voice sound lower and more masculine. If you have a higher voice, don't strain yourself going super low. Instead, aim for a more monotone version of your natural voice. You can also try to sharpen your \"s\" sounds and avoid a vocal fry at the end of your sentences. [13] X Research source Vocal fry refers to the creaky, deepened, elongation of vowels at the end of your sentence (it kind of sounds like you’re asking a question, even when you’re not). Try to make your sentences full stops instead of tapering off at the end."

      "content": "Greet people with handshakes and high fives. You can still hug your friends, but when you meet new people, it’s better to go for a firm handshake or a casual high five. If you’re shaking someone’s hand, grip it firmly and maintain eye contact. If you’re going for a high five, keep an eye on the other person’s elbow to land on your target. [15] X Research source For more casual settings, you could also try a fist bump. If you are going to give someone a hug, try doing the “bro hug.” Lean in and use one hand to pat your friend’s back a few times as you hug, then pull away quickly."
