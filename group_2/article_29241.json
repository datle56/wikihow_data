      "title": "Cut the beef chuck and chill it in the freezer for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Cut the beef chuck and chill it in the freezer for 1 hour. Get out 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of beef chuck (a roast cut of beef) and set it on a cutting board. If you prefer, use pork shoulder or another combination of meats, such as turkey or chicken breast. Cut the meat into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes and spread them on a plate or baking sheet. Transfer the plate or baking sheet to the freezer and chill the meat until it becomes crunchy on the surface. Avoid freezing the meat until it's solid. This would make it difficult to grind. To save time, ask your butcher to grind the beef chuck for you. Then you can skip freezing and grinding the meat the first time. Verify that the meat is ground chuck when you purchase it."

      "title": "Combine the spices in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Combine the spices in a small bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to stir them until the spice mixture is combined and then set it aside while you grind the meat. You'll need to mix together: 1 teaspoon (3 g) of granulated onion 1 teaspoon (3 g) of granulated garlic 2 ½ teaspoons (15 g) of kosher salt 1 tablespoon (7 g) of sweet paprika ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of white pepper ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground coriander ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground nutmeg"

      "title": "Grind the beef chuck.",
      "content": "Grind the beef chuck. Put the finest or smallest plate on your grinder and remove the beef chuck pieces from the freezer. Run all of the cubes of meat through the grinder so the ground meat falls into a clean bowl. Work quickly to keep the meat cold. If your butcher already ground the chuck for you, skip this step. To prevent the meat from warming too quickly, you can put the grinder in the fridge or freezer while you're preparing the spice mixture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the ground chuck with the spices.",
      "content": "Mix the ground chuck with the spices. Add the spice mixture to the bowl with the ground chuck and use your hands to combine them. Dip your hands in a little of the ice-cold water to prevent the meat from sticking to your fingers. [1] X Research source Ensure that the spices are evenly mixed into the meat so the hot dogs will be uniformly flavored."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze the meat and a food processor bowl for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Freeze the meat and a food processor bowl for 15 minutes. Cover the bowl with the spiced ground chuck and put it in the freezer. The meat needs to chill before you process it again. You'll also need to put a food processor bowl in the freezer to chill. You can set up your food processor while the meat's chilling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend the meat with the water in a food processor for 5 to 6 minutes.",
      "content": "Blend the meat with the water in a food processor for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the meat and food processor bowl from the freezer and spoon it into the bowl. Pour in 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of ice water and blend the mixture. Then gradually mix in the remaining 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of ice water as you blend the meat for 5 minutes. The mixture should become thick and very smooth. [2] X Research source If you're concerned that the meat mixture will separate, try working in smaller batches and divide the total amount of water between the batches. Then combine the batches once you've blended all of the meat."

      "content": "Soak 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0 m) of sheep casing for 1 hour. Since most sheep casings are packaged in brine, fill a bowl with warm water and put your casing into it. Leave the casing to soak and change the water at least 2 to 3 times as it soaks for an hour. Changing the water frequently will help flush the salt out from the casing. The sheep casing should be soft and easy to handle once it's finished soaking."

      "title": "Rinse the casing and put the stuffing attachment on your meat grinder.",
      "content": "Rinse the casing and put the stuffing attachment on your meat grinder. Remove the sheep casing from the bowl of water and run it under cool water to remove traces of salt. Then put the stuffing attachment on the end of your meat grinder. [3] X Research source If you can, chill the stuffing attachment while the casing soaks. The spiced meat mixture should also be chilling while you're preparing the casing."

      "title": "Attach the casing to the stuffer and place a pan of water directly below it.",
      "content": "Attach the casing to the stuffer and place a pan of water directly below it. Grease the stuffing attachment with a little shortening and tie a knot at one end of the casing. Slide the open end of the casing onto the attachment until the tied end is at the tip of the stuffing attachment. Then place a rimmed baking sheet under it and pour enough water to come 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) up the side of the pan. [4] X Research source The water in the sheet will help the meat-filled casing slide away from the stuffing attachment while you're working. Use any size baking sheet. Keep in mind that the longer the sheet, the more room the meat-filled casing has to move."

      "content": "Fill the stuffer with the meat and turn the machine on. Remove the chilled meat from the refrigerator and transfer it to the sausage stuffer. Push down firmly to remove as much air as you can. Then turn your mixer on so it begins to push the meat down through the nozzle into the casing. [5] X Research source Try to work quickly so the meat stays cold and the hot dogs hold their shape."

      "title": "Fill the casing and prick it to remove air pockets.",
      "content": "Fill the casing and prick it to remove air pockets. Once you've pushed all of the spiced meat into the casing, turn off the machine and firmly pull the casing from the attachment. Tie the end tightly at the end of the filled casing and use a sausage pricker to poke any air pockets you see. [6] X Research source It's important to remove pockets of air since these will cause the hot dogs to spoil quickly."

      "content": "Twist the filled casing into individual hot dogs. Determine how long you want the hot dogs to be and then pinch the casing to create a gap. Twist at that spot 2 to 3 times to separate one hot dog from the next. Continue to twist off at even lengths. [7] X Research source You should be able to get about 15 hot dogs that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long."

Once you've twisted the filled casing into individual links, take a sharp knife or kitchen-only scissors and cut in between them to separate the hot dogs. Put them in a container and refrigerate them until you're ready to parboil them. [8] X Research source"

Simmer the uncovered hot dogs for 25 minutes. [9] X Research source Parboiling will cook the hot dogs just enough so they hold their shape. Then you can finish cooking them on the stove or grill. Avoid boiling the hot dogs over high heat or the casings could burst."

Let the hot dogs stay in the ice water for about 5 minutes. Then remove the hot dogs from the ice water and put them in a container until you're ready to finish cooking them. [10] X Research source You can cover and refrigerate the parboiled hot dogs for up to 1 week."

When you're ready to finish cooking the hot dogs or if you'd like to cook store-bought hot dogs , decide if you want to boil them in a pot of water, toss them on the grill, or slice and sear them in a skillet . [11] X Research source To ensure that the hot dogs are fully cooked, insert an instant-read meat thermometer. The hot dogs should reach 145 to 150 °F (63 to 66 °C)."

You can use any type of bun such as potato, whole-wheat, gluten-free, or oat. Consider warming the buns in a 200 °F (93 °C) oven for about 10 minutes. To make the hot dogs easier to fill, consider slicing them in half lengthwise before putting the hot dog on the bun."

To store leftover, fully-cooked hot dogs, put them in an airtight container without the buns and condiments. Refrigerate them for up to 3 or 4 days."
