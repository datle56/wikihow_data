      "content": "Make lists. Lists are one really useful way to be organized and to make sure that you know when and how everything needs to come together. You'll be less likely to lose track of the details when you have them written out and kept somewhere that you see every day (a lost list is about as useful as a lead balloon). [2] X Research source Have a long-term list and a short-term (weekly or daily) list so that you are able to plan for things in advance. When the items on the long-term list come up, put them on your short-term list, but this way you won't be surprised by anything in your schedule. Once you've completed an item on your list, check it off. That way you'll know that you actually did do it and you won't be in a dither trying to remember whether you've completed each step of a certain list item."

      "content": "Keep to a specific schedule. If you're running around willy nilly and each day is a different mess of times and items, try to sort it into a routine that follows the same general rhythm. [3] X Expert Source George Sachs, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Your brain will be quicker to notice when you've dropped the ball on a detail than when each day is a hodgepodge of different things. [4] X Research source Make sure that you go to bed and get up at the same times each day. For example, you go to bed at 10:30 pm every night and get up at 7:30 am every morning. This way your body will be in a single routine and you'll be getting enough sleep so that your memory will be working better anyway."

      "content": "Limit distractions. Distractions come in a variety of forms: your family, your friends, that annoying coworker who won't stop talking, everything ever on the internet, even being hungry. When you're distracted and you're trying to pay attention to the details of a project or your homework, you're not going to be able to recall things as easily and you're more likely to forget the details. [5] X Research source Try to work in an area that is conducive to focus; not too hot, with good lighting and fewer people coming in and out (for school, a nice corner in the library is usually a good choice; at work, do your best in your office or cubicle to be cool and well-lit). Put your phone on silent and tell your friends and family members not to call you when you're working unless it's an emergency. [6] X Research source If you're working at home, avoid working in your bed and try to have a designated, organized workspace. [7] X Research source For your annoying coworker, if you can keep your door closed do that, otherwise simply say to them \"I'd love to catch up, but I really have to get this project finished. I'll come by and chat with you in a bit.\" Or you can tell them to go away, depending on what your relationship with them and your co-workers is like."

      "title": "Don't multitask.",
      "content": "Don't multitask. Multitasking spreads your attention out over a variety of items instead of focusing it on one specific item, which means that you end up unable to give full attention to each item and you won't be able to get all the details in order. [8] X Research source Using the list that you've drawn up, you can go from project to project, giving each your full attention without checking your phone and your Facebook and planning what you're going to eat for dinner. If you find yourself doing things like planning for dinner or wondering whether you've paid your bills, write down your idea or concern (you can add it to your list) and return to the project you're supposed to be working on. This way you know that you will remember to take care of the concern and you don't have to obsess over it. Sometimes you have to multitask, or you have to conserve your energy by letting some of the details of a project slip because you have so much to do. Focus your attention on the most important projects so that they get your attention to details, while giving less attention to the less important projects."

To help improve your attention to detail and to keep your memory strong, you'll want to engage in at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Your exercise routine could be as simple as walking to the grocery store after work, or biking to and from work (remember to bring your work clothes with you in case of rain or mud). You could do 30 minutes of yoga, or go for a run, or even just put on some music and dance."

      "content": "Take breaks. A good way to keep your brain sharp and willing to focus on the smaller details is to allow it to take breaks. Make sure that you schedule them around the same time each day and try for 10 to 15 minutes each. This will give your brain a chance to relax in time for the next project. [10] X Research source A break can be something as simple as stretching and taking a short walk around your office, or going for coffee down the street. When you find that you are getting really distracted or sleepy, this is a good time to find a place to do a little exercise, like jumping jacks, to get the blood flowing."

      "content": "Practice using memory cards. There are good ways to practice paying attention to the details so that your brain stays sharp and engaged. One of these ways is by using memory cards. You'll gather a group of pairs (start small, maybe 8-10 pairs) and place them face side down. Flip two over, look at them, and turn them face side down once more. Each time you find a pair, remove it from the game. [11] X Research source Your ability to remember where the cards are on the table will help you to pay attention to the details in all the different parts of your life. You can also play this game with a friend (especially once you're really good and you can show off your impressive skills!)."

Mathematics is a subject that requires a lot of attention to detail (after all, if you get one number wrong the whole answer ends up being wrong) and are a great way to improve your attention to detail.

      "content": "Memorize an image. Look closely at a scene (you can do this anywhere: at work, on the bus, at a coffee shop) and close your eyes. Recall as many details about the scene as you possibly can. The more you practice the better and more attentive to the details you'll become. Another easy way to do this is with an unfamiliar photograph. Look at it for a couple seconds and then flip the photograph over. Recall as many of the details as you can. Repeat this exercise with a different photograph each time. Memory sketches are similar to the memorizing an image exercise. Look at a scene for about a minute and then turn away. From memory, sketch what you saw in the scene, or make a list of the things you saw. When you've finished, compare what you saw with what was actually there."

Close your eyes and take deep breaths all the way down into your belly. Focus on your breathing. When you find distracting thoughts coming into your head, acknowledge them but do not focus on them. Return to your breathing by saying to yourself \"Breathe in, breathe out.\""
