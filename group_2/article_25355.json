Here’s an example of a genderfluid person: Eli is a genderfluid teenager who uses he/she/they pronouns. On Monday, they are wearing a skirt paired with a crop top and a cute pair of Mary Jane shoes.

You might be familiar with pronouns already, but for clarification, gender pronouns are what we use to refer to someone with besides their name. Pronouns can affirm someone's gender, reduce dysphoria, and are part of gender expression. Many genderfluid people use all pronouns or certain sets of pronouns, such as she/he/they or he/xe. Whatever works for you and makes you comfortable is perfectly fine. Common pronoun sets include she/her, they/them, and he/him. If you're comfortable with this, you can use neopronouns, such as ze/hir, xe/xem, or ne/nem."
