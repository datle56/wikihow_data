      "title": "A gym crush is someone at the gym you’re attracted to.",
      "content": "A gym crush is someone at the gym you’re attracted to. You may see the person a few times a week or every time you go to the gym, but you’re always happy when they’re at the gym at the same time as you. You may not have spoken to them or even know their name, but something about them keeps catching your eye and you want to get to know them more. It’s completely normal to have a gym crush and feel attracted to someone while you’re working out. Exercising gives your body similar sensations of romantic attraction, so people are more likely to develop crushes and show more interest during a workout. [1] X Research source You may even have a gym crush if you’re already in a relationship. Finding other people attractive when you’re with someone else is really common and it’s not a problem as long as you don’t act on it."

      "content": "Wait until they’re between workouts to approach them. If your gym crush is currently in the middle of their exercise routine, then they’re probably really focused and don’t want to be interrupted. Even after an intense workout, they may want a little time to themselves to cool down. Wait until they're done working out, approach you first, or when you’re about to leave the gym before making your move. [2] X Research source If you two lock eyes or are working out next to each other and already have a small connection, then feel free to start a conversation ."

      "content": "Smile and make eye contact when your gym crush is nearby. Whenever you see your gym crush and they look over at you, try looking them in the eye to show that you’re into them. When you meet each other’s gaze, offer them a warm smile as a subtle way to let them know you’re interested in them. [3] X Research source Even though you feel closer to a person when you make eye contact with them, staring for a long time may make your crush feel a little uneasy."

      "title": "Make small talk to break the ice.",
      "content": "Make small talk to break the ice. At first, just try introducing yourself to your gym crush or let them know you’ve seen them around recently. You could even ask about an exercise you saw them doing so you build a friendly rapport. Keep it casual and avoid telling your gym crush that you like them right away so you don’t make them feel uncomfortable. “Hey, I think we made eye contact on the gym floor. I just wanted to say hi.” “What did you think of that class we took yesterday? My arms still hurt from all those pushups.” “I’m not familiar with that exercise you were doing earlier, but it looks like the perfect addition to my routine. Where’d you find it?”"

      "title": "Offer or ask for help with heavy equipment.",
      "content": "Offer or ask for help with heavy equipment. If your gym crush is lifting heavy weights or on a new machine, don’t be afraid to step in and ask if they want you to spot them. Alternatively, if you want to make your gym crush more into you, go up to them and ask for their help with a machine or weights. That way, you can chat about the exercise right when you’re finished."

      "title": "Give them a compliment that’s not about their body.",
      "content": "Give them a compliment that’s not about their body. When you give a compliment , mention a piece of clothing they’re wearing or how well they did at the workout. From there, you can transition into a deeper conversation and get to know your crush a little bit better. Just avoid comments about the person’s body or physique because that could make them feel uncomfortable.

I love their style.” “Wow, you have such good stamina. You’ve been on the elliptical the whole time I’ve been here!” “I can’t believe you just did all those reps. It must have taken so much hard work to build up that strength.”"

      "content": "Pose a friendly competition between the two of you. If you want to be a little playful with your gym crush and have something fun to do together, see if they want to be a little competitive. See who can perform more reps of a certain exercise or have a race on the treadmills to stay fit and flirty at the same time. Try posing it as a fun question like, “How fast can you run a mile? I bet I can do it 30 seconds faster!”"

      "content": "Respect their personal space if they seem uninterested. Some people just want to focus on exercising when they come to the gym rather than flirting and meeting others. If your crush cuts conversations short, doesn’t make eye contact, or tries to physically distance themselves from you, then apologize for misreading the situation and leave them alone. Treat the person with respect if they deny your advances, and avoid trying to flirt with them again. [5] X Research source You may say something like, “I’m sorry, I’ll let you get back to your workout,” before walking away."

      "content": "They walk past you repeatedly. If your gym crush keeps passing in front of you to switch between equipment or fill their water, they may be trying to catch your attention. If your crush makes eye contact and smiles at you when they pass by, it’s a good sign they’re into you."

If your gym crush says anything nice about your outfit or goes out of their way to tell you that you did a great workout, they may be trying to flirt and make you feel good about yourself. Compliments are a sure sign that the person is interested and is trying to flirt with you. [8] X Research source If someone only compliments your appearance or body, then they may only be interested in you physically.
