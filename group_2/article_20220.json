It specifically is targeting the back of your arms and shoulders. [8] X Research source To get the most benefit from this exercise use parallel bars. Place one hand on each bar and grip tightly.

Bend them so they are facing backwards while keeping your arms parallel to your body. Lower until your upper arms are about parallel to floor. Push yourself back up to the starting position. Lower again to start another rep."

You can choose lower amounts of repetitions or higher amounts of repetitions. Studies have shown that higher reps build more muscle mass. [12] X Research source High volume sets, three to six, with repetitions ranging from six to 12, tend to increase muscle size. When you begin your workout to help build a bigger upper-body, focus on a higher amount of repetitions with each exercise you do. Higher reps do build strength, but not as much as lower repetitions. If you want to build mass and strength include a combination of both high and low rep exercises. [13] X Research source"

Compound exercises are those that typically use free weights or body weight and recruit multiple joints and muscles to perform. These types of exercises typically are the best for building more mass. [14] X Research source Exercises like deadlifts and squats are examples of compound exercises. Isolation exercises are those that target only a small group of muscles - like bicep curls. These are great for more fine toning or tweaking, not to build mass. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Train your upper-body every other day. When you're doing any sort of physical activity, it's important to include time for rest. This is particularly true when you're targeting a specific set of muscles. Rest is the time where your muscles get stronger and increase in size. This doesn't actually happen during the activity itself. Take rest days during the week in addition to making sure you do not work your upper-body each day. Aim for every other day or 2-3 days a week of upper-body training. When you do not rest and recover properly, you can suffer muscle fatigue, poor performance and poor results."

      "content": "Include cardio. Although cardio doesn't do much to bulk up your upper-body, it's still an essential activity to include in any workout. It's typically considered a good idea to include about 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio each week. Many activities can count towards \"moderate intensity\" including jogging, running or doing an aerobics class. However, consider activities like rowing that increase your heart rate but also are working multiple muscles in your upper-body."

      "content": "Increase your calories. In order to see significant gains in muscle mass and muscle size you'll need to increase your overall calorie intake. Eating very light or following a low calorie diet won't support increased muscle mass. You don't need to eat large quantities of extra calories daily, but you do want to have a little surplus. This could be anywhere from 150-250 extra calories daily. The extra calories will go to support your body through exercise and the recovery and repair process of your muscles. Consume these extra calories from wholesome, nutritious foods. Go for lean protein, whole grains or a fruit or vegetable. Try not to get extra calories from sugars, fats or processed foods."

[16] X Expert Source Shira Tsvi Personal Trainer & Fitness Instructor Expert Interview. 7 January 2020. It's typically recommended to consume about 0.8 g of protein per kg of body weight. However, if you're working on body building you may need more protein or about 1.0 g per pound of body weight. [17] X Research source To find your body weight in kg, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. For example if you weight 150 lbs your weight in kg is about 68.1 kg. Choose a variety of lean protein sources like: eggs, poultry, lean beef, tofu, seafood, nuts or low-fat dairy products."

      "content": "Refuel appropriately. Another very important part of your work out and goal to increasing muscle mass is refueling after your workout. Without proper nutrition after your lifting session, you might not see the gains you're looking for. Within an hour of completing your workout, you need to refuel. Waiting longer isn't advisable. Your window for the best recovery is 30 – 45 minutes after your workout. [18] X Research source Refuel with higher carbs and a significant amount of protein. You need to replace the energy you used during the workout in addition to getting in the protein to help your body repair and restore the muscles you worked. Go for a protein shake, protein bar with a piece of fruit, a small meal (like baked chicken and sweet potatoes), chocolate milk or trail mix."
