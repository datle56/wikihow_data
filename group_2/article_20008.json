      "title": "Time travel",
      "content": "Time travel in the game. Time travel involves abusing the time cycle by traveling forward two days, and then rewinding two days, thus speeding up the natural process. This way, you hit the natural cycle of animals moving out. Be careful, time travel has other consequences. It is possible that using this method will result in you losing a villager that you don’t want to move out, especially if you are not vigilant in checking with all of the villagers to see if anyone is moving. To check with all of the villagers, simply talk to each one, preferably multiple times, by pressing “A” to see if there’s any new gossip or someone brings up moving out. If a villager looks at you in disbelief, then walks up to you, speak to them, as they might say they plan to leave. Remember, before attempting to get any villagers to move out, you must have at least eight villagers already moved in. All this really means is that if you just started the game, you’ll need to wait a few days for the population to naturally increase before you can convince anyone to move out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignore them.",
      "content": "Ignore them. This is a very easy method to achieve. Simply ignore the villagers who you want to move out. Don’t talk to them, but continue playing the game and letting time progress. Hopefully, another villager will tell you that the villager you’ve been ignoring is thinking of moving out soon, and you’ll know it worked. Be careful: If you talk to the ignored villager after hearing they're going to move out, no matter what you say, the villager will then decide to stay instead of leave. For example, if you’ve been particularly mean to a villager lately and ignoring them, the option “Good luck!” might be replaced with “Who are you?!” which then prompts that animal to stay."

    {
      "title": "Talk to them a lot.",
      "content": "Talk to them a lot. Playing favorites, although the opposite of ignoring villagers, seems to also produce results in terms of getting residents to move out. To accomplish this, simply talk to the villager multiple times a day, more than any other villagers, by pressing “A.” After some time, they will appear uneasy and say they have spoken to you too much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recruit.",
      "content": "Recruit. As mentioned before, if you have fewer than or equal to eight villagers, other villagers will naturally want to move in. This happens naturally. However, you can recruit specific characters by participating in villager trade or making use of the campsite public works project."
    },
    {
      "title": "Build the campsite.",
      "content": "Build the campsite. If you do, animals will visit your town on occasion, and they can often be convinced to move in. The campsite is available in your list of public works. Just sit in your mayor chair and choose it from the list of public works to build. After the campsite is built, it can't be demolished, so choose its location carefully! The campsite takes 59,800 bells to build but it doesn't have to be payed in one go. Don't confuse the campsite with the campground, the campground is an addition from the Welcome Amiibo update which allows you to buy exclusive items AMD get villagers through amiibo cards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Time travel.",
      "content": "Time travel. If you want a specific villager, you can again make use of time travel. This requires that you check your town every day when you think someone should be moving in. What you want to be looking for is a post that designates a new villager is moving in. It will have their name on it. If it’s a villager you want, rejoice and move forward. If not, travel back in time, reload the game, and you should have a different villager’s name."
