Common symptoms include flaky skin (dandruff), itching, red skin, scaliness or crusting of the skin, greasy patches, and hair loss. [3] X Research source Inflammation leads to red patches and high fatty acid content, which can make the skin greasy and yellow in some people. [4] X Research source Clark GW, Pope SM, Jabari KA. Diagnosis and Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis. Am Fam Physician. 91(3), 2015:185-190. In infants, it is common on the scalp and can present as red, dry scaly plaques, or in more severe cases as thick white or greasy yellow scales. Other skin diseases, such as fungal infection, psoriasis, dermatitis, and lupus, may resemble scalp eczema. However, these differ based on the location and layers of the skin involved. [5] X Research source Clark GW, Pope SM, Jabari KA. Diagnosis and Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis. Am Fam Physician. 91(3), 2015:185-190. If you aren’t sure whether your symptoms match those of scalp eczema, see your doctor. S/he can help you determine the cause of your symptoms and whether they are severe enough to require treatment."

      "content": "Know the causes of eczema. In addition to decreased oils and moisture present, doctors believe that a certain kind of yeast, Malassezia furfur, has a role in causing seborrheic eczema. Malassezia yeast is usually present on the outer surface of the skin. In those with scalp eczema, this yeast invades the superficial layers of skin and secretes substances that increase fatty acid production. This leads to inflammation and enhances production and dryness of skin, which causes the skin to flake. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your eczema is atopic, meaning that your family has a tendency to develop eczema, yeast may not be the culprit. Doctors believe that many people with atopic eczema have a faulty skin barrier due to a changed gene within the skin’s structural proteins."
