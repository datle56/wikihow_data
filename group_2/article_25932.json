In disagreements, Taurus often digs in and refuses to budge, which mellow Libra will find hard to deal with. Taurus, remember that your Libra hates conflict and may struggle to assert himself. Give him space to express his perspective, and don’t give up on the conversation, no matter how stubborn you are. Libra, avoid criticizing a Taurus woman during a conflict; this can trigger her stubbornness. Use your diplomatic instincts to find a compromise that will satisfy both of you.

Taurus, your Libra guy is likely hesitant because he values his freedom. Take a little time to focus on yourself and let him work through those emotions before you write off the relationship for good. Libra, ask yourself whether waiting around is really helpful.
