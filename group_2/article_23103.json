      "title": "Before you start, prepare your materials.",
      "content": "Before you start, prepare your materials. This method involves mixing baking soda with white vinegar to create the gas that will asphyxiate the rodent. As well as the vinegar and baking soda, you will need to prepare a sealable plastic container, a sealable plastic bag, a hose to connect the two, and a separate container to mix the vinegar and baking soda, such as a glass or jug. Asphyxiation by CO2 is the only method approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association which uses common household materials. These guidelines are meant for vets not ordinary people, so think about whether you are qualified to carry this out without causing undue pain and suffering for the rodent. [1] X Research source Fasteners, ties and clothes will be needed to secure the different containers. The plastic container is the euthanasia chamber for the rodent The plastic bag is the CO2 chamber where the gas is produced."

    {
      "title": "Prepare the CO2 chamber.",
      "content": "Prepare the CO2 chamber. Put the baking soda into the bottom of the bag, and then place the separate container with the vinegar into the bag, without spilling it. When you combine the baking soda and vinegar later, the reaction produces the gas carbon dioxide (CO2), which the rodent can't breathe. The ratio of vinegar to baking soda will vary by the size of the container you are using. Getting the correct concentration of CO2 is key to its humaneness. You want to create a 30%-40% concentration of CO2 in the euthanasia container to cause the rodent to lose consciousness. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Prepare the euthanasia chamber.",
      "content": "Prepare the euthanasia chamber. Taking care when you handle the rodent, place it into the airtight plastic container. Tupperware containers work well. Adding some nesting material can make it a little more comfortable and perhaps put the rodent somewhat more at ease. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Connect the two with the hose.",
      "content": "Connect the two with the hose. Affix the hose to the top of the bag, and secure it with a rubber band or tie and then put the other end in the plastic container with the rodent. Use a cloth or towel to block of the area around where the hose enters the container to make it airtight."

      "title": "Slowly pour the vinegar over the baking soda.",
      "content": "Slowly pour the vinegar over the baking soda. Once it is all secured you should begin carefully pouring the white vinegar over the baking soda, to create the CO2 which will then travel through the short hose to the plastic container. Pour around half of the vinegar, and then observe the rodent. The rodent should quickly pass out and die. Once it becomes unresponsive, pour the rest of vinegar over. Carbon dioxide exposure that uses a gradual fill method like this is less likely to cause pain. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Set up a traditional spring trap . To set up a trap like this, place bait within the specified area, ensuring that the rest of the trap is clean. Doing this will make it more likely that, when tripped, the trap will close fully. Then, place the trap at right angles to a wall with the bait nearest the wall. [6] X Research source The rodent should have a clear path to the trap. The bait should be changed regularly."

      "content": "Check it regularly. You should check the traps every morning, and be prepared to dispose of any dead rodents straight-away. Carefully remove them from the trap, place in a plastic bag, and then place that bag in a second bag, and throw it away into a secured bin. Always use gloves when you are doing this, and you can use a household disinfectant to clean the trap. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a small-calibre, low power gun or air rifle. More powerful guns carry the risk of ricocheting or shooting through the rodent. They may also spread biological material further than smaller guns, causing a bigger mess and a greater health hazard. Low power air guns (12fpe), that are .177 calibre are considered the most appropriate. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Be sure you have a clear sight of the rodent. A rodent running free is very difficult to catch, but they are easier to corner. If they are cornered, sitting still in a crevice, shooting it with an air-powered BB gun can be an effective and quick way to kill the rodent. [10] X Research source This is only envisaged in an emergency situation. Most of the time setting traps in the normal way is preferable to shooting a rodent."
