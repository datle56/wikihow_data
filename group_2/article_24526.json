      "content": "There is no solid proof the Tooth Fairy exists, but she could be real. Just because there's no scientific proof of her existence, it doesn't mean she isn't real! Even if she’s not real in a literal sense, she has certainly touched the hearts of the many children who believe in her. While parents may pretend to be the Tooth Fairy to encourage their children to believe in her, some parents have reported finding money or other gifts under their kids' pillows in exchange for their baby teeth, and they weren't the ones who put it there! As to whether fairies exist in general, there's also no hard evidence to suggest they do, but that doesn't mean they don't. In fact, in many cultures around the world (especially in Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and Scotland), belief in fairies and elves is taken very seriously. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The modern Tooth Fairy originated in 1908 in the Chicago Daily Tribune . Though myths about teeth have abounded for centuries, the Tooth Fairy herself seems to have originated in a “Household Hints” item in the Tribune by Lillian Brown. Brown claimed that children who know about the existence of a Tooth Fairy who will take their tooth away in the night and replace it with a gift would be much more willing to lose a tooth or let it be removed .

      "content": "Versions of the Tooth Fairy have existed for centuries. Though our modern idea of the Tooth Fairy seems to have been created in 1908, versions of the myth have long been prevalent in cultures around the world. Many of these historic depictions portray a figure (often a mouse) who buys baby teeth from children. The myth of the Tooth Fairy (or tooth mice) may stem from other tooth-related myths of the Middle Ages. For instance, in medieval Europe, children were required to burn their baby teeth after they fell out, or else they would spend eternity searching for their baby teeth in the afterlife. [3] X Research source It was also believed that if a witch got ahold of one of your teeth, they could assume total control over you."

      "content": "Try to determine if they want the truth, or if they want to keep believing. Some children will pose questions, but they don’t want the real answer. Instead, they may want your reassurance that the Tooth Fairy does, indeed, exist. You can determine whether they want the truth in a few ways: Ask a probing question back to get a sense of what they’re really asking. For instance, if they ask point-blank if the Tooth Fairy is real, say, “What do you think?” or “Why do you ask?” Consider their age. If they’re still in preschool, they may have heard a rumor the Tooth Fairy isn’t real and be coming to you for reassurance to the contrary. If they’re 7, on the other hand, they may have suspicions the Tooth Fairy isn’t real and want to discuss it rationally. If you determine they want to keep believing for a little longer, you can reinforce their belief with a simple, “I believe in the Tooth Fairy, don’t you?” or “Don’t you remember how she left a 5-dollar bill for your front tooth last month? Of course she’s real!”"

Even if they’re having doubts, it can still be devastating for them to hear once and for all that the Tooth Fairy doesn’t exist, and that their parents have been pretending the whole time . [14] X Research source Try something like, “Greta, we’re so sorry to tell you this, but the Tooth Fairy has been Mom and me this whole time. I know this might be sad for you to hear.” Explain your reasoning behind the charade. Consider sharing your own childhood experiences believing in the Tooth Fairy and remind them how much fun it was to hide their tooth and find a gift the next morning. Know that your child is unlikely to be traumatized by the slow realization that the Tooth Fairy isn't real. They may be more likely to be devastated if told outright, without asking.

They may laugh at the absurdity of the situation, get mad at you for misleading them, or become upset and cry, sensing they’ve lost something important. Or they might not respond right away at all and need time to think it over. Try to be receptive to their response no matter what it is. If your child has put the evidence together that the Tooth Fairy isn't real themselves, they may feel a sense of triumph that they've figured it out. Discovering that childhood mythological figures are pretend is a big part of childhood development on its own! [16] X Research source Remember that just because the truth is out doesn’t mean the magic has to totally die. They’ll likely still appreciate getting a gift in exchange for their teeth, and if they have younger siblings, you may want to ask them not to spoil the truth!"

      "content": "Kids typically stop believing in the Tooth Fairy around age 5. One study that interviewed children found that they mostly stopped believing in the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus when they got to the age of 5 or so. This may be because it’s around that age that kids gain the cognitive ability to question the “evidence” their parents give them of these mythical characters’ existence. [17] X Research source However, it may also be that parents simply stop trying as hard to maintain the illusion of the Tooth Fairy once their kids reach the age of 5 or 6, making it easier for the kids to figure out the truth. Curiously, adults interviewed for the same study reported believing in the Tooth Fairy and Santa for longer—until they were almost 9 years old. (But it’s possible they wanted to believe they believed for longer than they really did.)"
