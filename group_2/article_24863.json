      "content": "Divide the entire match into games and sets. A tennis match consists of either 3 or 5 sets. A tennis player must win 6 games in each set to win the set and at least 2 sets more than the other player to win the match. Each of these match divisions has French words you probably want to become familiar with, although the words themselves aren't typically used when calling the score. A game is le jeu (luhr zhuh). A set is la manche (lah mahnsh). A match is le match (luhr mehtch). Note that this doesn't follow the traditional rules of French pronunciation because the word \"match\" is borrowed from English in this context."

      "content": "Use French number words for points scored in each game. The system of scoring a tennis match is unique among sports. The first point in a game is 15, the second is 30, the third is 40, and the fourth (if there is one) is the game point. A player must score at least 2 points more than the other player to win a game. If the game is tied, most tennis games progress through deuce (a tied score of 40-40), advantage, and then game point. To keep score in French, use the following words: Pas de point (no points): 0 zéro (zee-rroh) Premier point (first point): 15 quinze (kanz) Second point (second point): 30 trente (trahn) Troisième point (third point): 40 quarante (kah-rrohn) Quatrième point (fourth point): Jeu (zhuh)"

      "content": "Say the game score before each serve following a point. Unless you're playing in a professional or competitive context with an official scorekeeper, it's the server's job to repeat the score before they serve the ball. The server's score comes first, followed by the receiver's score. If the score is tied, use partout (pahrtooh) or A (ah) after the server's score. This is the same as saying \"15 all\" or \"30 all\" in English. For example, for a score of 15-30, you would say \"quinze – trente.\""

Instead of saying \"zéro – zéro,\" at the start of the new game the server (or scorekeeper, at professional or competitive matches) calls out the score in the set so far. For this, you'll need to know how to count to at least 7 in French. Use the following French number words, depending on the number of games each player has won in the set so far: 0: zéro (zee-rroh) 1: un (uh) 2: deux (duhr) 3: trois (twah) 4: quatre (katrr) 5: cinq (sank) 6: six (sees) 7: sept (seht)"

If the players battle to 40-40, this is referred to as \"deuce,\" or égalité (ay-gah-lee-tay) in French. [3] X Research source If the server scores a point after égalité , the score would be avantage service (ah-vahn-tazh sehr-vees). If the server scored again, that would end the game. On the other hand, if the receiver scores, you are back to égalité . If the receiver scores a point after égalité , the score would be avantage dehors (ah-vahn-tazh duh-ohr). After égalité , you don't use any numbers to call the score, just whichever of these three phrases is appropriate."

[4] X Research source Once one of the players wins a set, the game score is absorbed into the point for that set, so those numbers don't have to be repeated again. At the end of each set, the set score also starts over. You don't have to repeat the score for the previous set. If you're keeping score on paper, you would simply enter the points for each set on the score sheet."
