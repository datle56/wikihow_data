      "title": "Gather a pen, aluminum foil, a cotton swab, scissors, and some tape.",
      "content": "Gather a pen, aluminum foil, a cotton swab, scissors, and some tape. Lay these items out on your workspace. With just these supplies (and a few drops of water), you can make a stylus for your iPad. [1] X Research source When you get your foil, be sure you have enough to wrap it around the pen a few times."

      "title": "Unscrew the pen cap, remove the ink chamber, then reattach the cap.",
      "content": "Unscrew the pen cap, remove the ink chamber, then reattach the cap. Unscrew the cap at the tip of your pen, then remove the ink cartridge to make space for other components of the stylus."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut your cotton swab.",
      "content": "Cut your cotton swab. Use your scissors to cut the cotton swab in half. You should be left with two pieces that are roughly the same size, each with a fuzzy tip and shorter stem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert one piece of the cotton swab into the pen.",
      "content": "Insert one piece of the cotton swab into the pen. Push the stick end of a cotton swab half into the tip of the pen cap, leaving the head of the cotton swab exposed. This will be the “point” of your stylus."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the cotton swab to the pen.",
      "content": "Tape the cotton swab to the pen. Wrap tape around the point where the cotton swab and the pen meet to secure it in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the pen in aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Wrap the pen in aluminum foil. Encircle the pen several times with your aluminum foil, making sure the cotton swab is in contact with the foil. Otherwise, your stylus will not work! In this case, the foil acts as a conductor for that electricity to and from your finger, sending it through the head of the cotton swab. This means that if you are not touching the foil, or the foil is not touching the cotton swab, your stylus will not work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the aluminum foil down.",
      "content": "Tape the aluminum foil down. To prevent your foil from uncurling, tape the edge down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wet the end of the cotton swab.",
      "content": "Wet the end of the cotton swab. Sometimes, your iPad might have some trouble recognizing your stylus. In that case, simply wet the end of the cotton swab, and your stylus is ready to go. Wetting the end of the cotton swab will increase its conductivity, making your stylus more easily recognizable by your iPad."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw away!",
      "content": "Draw away! When testing out your new stylus, be sure you’re holding the aluminum foil. Also, don’t be afraid to apply some pressure when you’re using it."

    {
      "title": "Grab a plastic highlighter, 3 feet of bare wire, a small piece of conductive foam, some electrical tape, pliers, and scissors.",
      "content": "Grab a plastic highlighter, 3 feet of bare wire, a small piece of conductive foam, some electrical tape, pliers, and scissors. While some of these items are less common than those used in the other method, they are still quite inexpensive, and the stylus will be recognizable without using water. [2] X Research source Before you begin, make sure you are not using insulated wire. To act as a proper conductor, the wire must be stripped."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the inner parts of the highlighter.",
      "content": "Remove the inner parts of the highlighter. Unscrew the end of the highlighter to remove the ink well, then use your pliers to remove the tip, making space for the components of the stylus."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull your wire through the highlighter.",
      "content": "Pull your wire through the highlighter. Insert your wire into the highlighter, leaving some extra wire out the tip and the end for later use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wind your wire around the foam.",
      "content": "Wind your wire around the foam. Wrap your wire around one end of your conductive foam. This wire is responsible for providing conductivity to and from the foam and keeping it secure, so make sure you wrap it tightly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the wire at the back of the highlighter to secure the foam.",
      "content": "Pull the wire at the back of the highlighter to secure the foam. Use the wire hanging out the back of the highlighter to bring the conductive foam to the tip of the marker. Pull in enough foam that about ¼ inch is still exposed for the tip of the stylus."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the remaining wire around the highlighter.",
      "content": "Wrap the remaining wire around the highlighter. Cover the outside of your highlighter with the rest of the wire. Be sure to wind it down the entire marker, otherwise the stylus won’t work. As mentioned in the previous method, the wire serves as a conductor between the iPad, the foam, and your hand, so you have to be touching the wire when using the stylus."

    {
      "title": "Trim the foam tip.",
      "content": "Trim the foam tip. Use your scissors to shape the tip of your stylus however you please."

      "title": "Try out your brand new stylus!",
      "content": "Try out your brand new stylus! If it does not work, make sure your wire is properly attached to the conductive foam tip, and that you are touching the wire while using it. Also, do not be afraid to apply pressure with the stylus to help the iPad sense it."
