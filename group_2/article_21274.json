      "content": "Use regular mascara instead of waterproof types. While waterproof mascara is popular for its durability, it’s also tough to get off. You’ll have to do a lot of scrubbing, which can break off your lashes. Waterproof mascara also dries out your lashes. It’s best to skip this product overall. [1] X Research source You can wear waterproof mascara for special occasions, as long as you don’t use it every day."

      "content": "Remove your eye makeup every day. Eye makeup can dry out your lashes and even make them fall out over time. Never leave your mascara or eyeshadow on overnight. Use a gentle makeup remover every night before bed to remove any makeup you have on during the day. [2] X Research source Be gentle when you remove your makeup. Scrubbing could irritate and damage your eyelashes as well."

      "content": "Go makeup-free as often as you can. Since makeup can damage your hair follicles, it’s best to skip the makeup as often as possible. This gives your eyelashes a break and can prevent damage. [5] X Research source If you still want to wear makeup every day, then try removing it as soon as you’re home instead of waiting until you go to bed. That way, you’re increasing the amount of time that your eyelashes can breathe."

      "content": "Stop rubbing your eyes. This is very tempting and everyone rubs their eyes occasionally. Do your best to resist the temptation, though. Constant rubbing can damage your eyelashes and even pull them out. It’s best to rub as little as possible. [6] X Research source Rubbing is also bad for your eyes overall, since it can spread bacteria. If you do have to touch your eyes, always wash your hands first. If you have very itchy eyes and feel tempted to rub them a lot, you might have a problem like chronic dry eyes or allergies. See an eye doctor to get to the bottom of it."

Make sure you follow a healthy diet full of proteins, fresh fruits and vegetables, and iron so your eyelashes grow in strong.

While you might not think makeup can expire, it definitely can, and you could be sabotaging your eyelashes by using old mascara. Expired mascara can case bacterial growth and infections. In general, get rid of makeup after 2-3 months to prevent any problems. [9] X Research source Also make sure you don't have any allergies to the products you use.

      "content": "Avoid getting eyelash extensions. You might like accentuating your lashes with extensions, but this is a bad idea if you’re trying to encourage growth. Eyelash extensions can damage your lashes and follicles, which can make the hairs fall out faster. Skip the extensions and let your lashes grow by themselves. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source You could use extensions for some special occasions. However, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll lose a few lashes when you take your extensions off, so you might want to skip them altogether. If you do use extensions, always confirm that the glue doesn’t have any ingredients that you’re allergic to. Otherwise, your follicles could get inflamed.

[13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Latisse isn’t approved for pregnant women or people younger than 18. Since Latisse is a prescription-only medication, don’t share it with anyone else who doesn’t have a prescription for it. There are also over-the-counter eyelash growth serums, but these aren’t regulated and have mixed results. If you want to try one of these, ask your dermatologist first.

Squeeze the bottle and apply it to your upper eyelash line on each eye. Don’t get any on your lower lash line, because it isn’t meant for use there.

You’ll have to use Latisse continuously to maintain a thick and long lash appearance. When you stop, your lashes will probably return to their normal look.

Pick one of these and dip in a clean mascara brush. Then apply it to your eyelashes the same way that you put mascara on. [19] X Research source Some advice also says that conditioning your lashes can help them grow faster, but there isn't much medical evidence that this is true. Thicker oils like coconut oil can actually clog your follicles and inhibit lash growth. Instead, use a thinner oil like olive to avoid any problems.
