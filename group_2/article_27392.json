      "content": "Stop calling or texting him. If you are constantly calling and texting him, he won’t have any time to think about missing you. Take a break from the daily phone time, and wait for him to call or text. When you stop calling or texting, he’ll wonder why, and this will cause him to start thinking about you and missing you. [1] X Research source When you're not talking to him, carry on with your day. Go to class or work, spend some time doing hobbies, or watch TV. Do something to keep you from checking your phone, which will make you less likely to respond if he has texted or called you.

      "title": "Wait some time before returning his calls or text messages.",
      "content": "Wait some time before returning his calls or text messages. When we like someone, we typically jump at the chance to return their phone calls and text messages because we’re so excited. If you want a guy to miss you, you need to create that moment of longing for your response. When he calls you, don’t answer, and let it go to voicemail. Wait a few minutes, and then call him back, telling him you couldn’t answer because you were really busy. After receiving a text message, wait about 5 to 10 minutes before responding. This will give him time to start longing for your response, and make him start thinking about what you might be doing without him. You don't always have to, but every once in a while make the texts and phone calls you do have with him brief and to the point.

If you usually go to dinner for dates, invite him on an adventure like rock climbing one day. This spontaneity will excite him and keep him guessing at what you’ll want to do next. Don’t always be telling him how you feel and what you are thinking, let him wonder about you. You want to keep him guessing!

If you spend every minute of the weekend with him, start carving out time to spend away from him. Spend a Friday night at home alone or with friends instead of hanging out with your man.
