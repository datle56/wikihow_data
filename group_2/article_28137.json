      "content": "Slip a faceted bead onto a headpin. [2] X Research source You can use the standard teardrop shape, or something more interesting, such as a ball, heart, or star. For best results, use a crystal or glass bead; it will catch and reflect the light much better than a plastic one. This only works for beads that have a hole going straight up and down through them, and not for the pendant-style beads."

Cut the head pin with a pair of wire cutters (you can use jewelry making wire cutters here).Next, grip the tip of the headpin with your pliers, and roll it towards the bead to form a loop.

It may seem as though you are using more glue than necessary, but clear glue tends to shrink a lot as it dries. [9] X Research source Do not use a clear, industrial-strength glue for this; you want to be able to remove the suncatcher from the lid when you are done. White school glue may also be used, but your finished suncatcher may look cloudy and not sparkle as much. [10] X Research source"

To make a more interesting looking suncatcher, experiment with different sizes and colors. Make sure that the flat size of the gems is facing down.
