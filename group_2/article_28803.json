      "title": "Combine castor oil with olive oil.",
      "content": "Combine castor oil with olive oil. Use 1 part castor oil to 2 parts olive oil as a base, though you may vary this ratio depending on your own skin needs. The castor oil functions to clean your skin, and the olive oil serves as a restorative carrier oil. You can also substitute hazelnut oil for castor oil, and sunflower or another light-weight oil (such as canola) for the carrier oil. [1] X Research source To apply oil cleansers to your skin, pour a small amount into your cupped palm. Rub your hands together, then apply to your skin with your hands using smooth, circular strokes. Massage for 1-2 minutes until the oil has soaked in. For a deep clean, leave the oil on your skin for up to 10 minutes. Follow by draping a steaming wet washcloth over the area. Leave the washcloth on your skin for about a minute, or until it cools."

      "content": "Make a blend of honey, castile soap, and oil. Combine 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup liquid castile soap into a liquid soap dispenser. Add 3 tablespoons of distilled hot water and 2 tablespoons of almond oil. Put the lid on and shape the bottle well so that all ingredients are combined. This mixture will be good for up to 6 months, but you'll need to continue shaking every day or so to prevent clogging. [2] X Research source You can also substitute avocado or another nourishing oil for the almond oil. To apply, press down on the dispenser and fill your palm with the liquid soap. Rub your hands together, creating a lather. Then, rub the soap gently onto your skin. Repeat as necessary until the oily skin has been completely covered with soap, then rinse with warm water. Dry by pressing a soft towel to your skin."
