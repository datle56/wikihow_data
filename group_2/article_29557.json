      "content": "Cut 4 even pieces of string. Unwind the string and cut off a strand that is approximately 1 foot (0.30 m) long. Unwind the string. Lay the cut strand next to the unwound string as though it were a ruler. Cut the second strand the same length as the first. Cut 2 more strands in the same manner. You could also use a 12 inch ruler."

      "content": "Attach 1 string to each corner. Gather and twist the napkin’s top left corner ½ inch from the edge. Tie 1 string tightly around the gathered corner—create the knot near the top of the strand. Repeat this process on every corner, making sure to tie all of the strings at approximately the same spot. This will result in long tails that are the same length."

      "content": "Tie the strings together and attach a weighted object. Gather all four strings together 2 to 3 inches above the bottom and tie the strings in a knot. Select an object to add weight to the parachute, such as a rock, an action figure, or paperclips. Use the 2 to 3 inch (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tails to secure the object to the parachute."

      "content": "Drop your paper parachute. Now that you have created your paper parachute, it is ready for action. Decide where you will drop your parachute from—this may be over the banister of your stairs, from a play structure, or even from the top bunk of a bunk bed. You may even simply throw it up into the air. Once you have reached the top of your launch zone, release the parachute and watch it glide to the ground."

      "content": "Observe the speed of your parachute. Note the rate at which your parachute is falling? Is your parachute falling quickly to the ground or gliding slowing to the ground? If it is moving towards the ground at a rapid pace, the weight it too heavy or the parachute sail is too small. Try attaching a lighter object to your parachute, such as a feather or paperclips, or create a larger sail. If your parachute is moving too slowly towards the ground, the weight is too light or the parachute sail is too big. To change the speed, attach a heavier item to your parachute, like a rock, or create a smaller parachute sail. Feel free to experiment with different weights and sail sizes."

Set the pieces on the edge of your work space. Place 1 piece of tape on the top left corner—place ½ inch on the top of the tissue paper, fold the tape over, and adhere it to the bottom of the tissue paper. Insert the reinforced corner into a hole punch and create a hole. Repeat this process on the remaining corners. The tape will reinforce the corner and prevent the tissue paper from ripping.

If you wish to change the speed of you parachute you can alter the weight or the parachute sail. If the parachute is moving too quickly, the weight is too heavy or the sail is too small. Try attaching a lighter weight object, such as a paperclip chain or even a feather, or create and attach a bigger parachute sail. If your parachute is moving too slowly, the weight is too light or the sail is too large. Swap the light weight object for something heavier, such as an action figure, or create and attach a smaller parachute sail. Feel free to experiment with different weights and sail sizes."
