      "content": "Purchase everything you’ll need. Grooming your Shih Tzu at home requires a few specialty items that you will need to purchase. Most of the items can be easily found at your local pet store or grocery store. You will also need some other items that you probably have lying around the house, like towels and a hairdryer. You will need to purchase a dog brush, preferably a curry brush with rubber teeth that will be gentle, but effective, on your dog’s coat. You should also get some dog nail trimmers and some electric hair clippers (made for use on dogs). Purchase some shampoo that is specially formulated for use on dogs. Human shampoo can be irritating to your dog’s skin, so never use it on your dog. You can purchase varieties of dog shampoo that specialize in sensitive skin or certain types of dog hair. There are also formulas made just for puppies."

To groom your dog safely at home, you’ll need to find an area that they can’t escape from. If you want to do the grooming outside to minimize the mess, make sure it’s in an enclosed space like a garage or a fenced-in yard. If you want to groom your dog inside, consider using your bathroom so you can close the door to keep the dog in. You’ll also have easy access to water in the bathroom for when you bathe your Shih Tzu. Put some towels down on the floor to keep you and your dog from slipping and to minimize the mess. Additionally, be sure to put down a nonslip surface in the sink or bathtub to protect your pup from slipping and hurting itself. Only groom your dog outside if the weather permits. Weather that is too hot or too cold could make your dog uncomfortable."

Gently brush your dog’s face, especially its muzzle, as food tends to get stuck in this when it eats. Then rub the brush down its legs softly, again moving from the base of the hair to the tips. You should feel free to brush your Shih Tzu every day, but try to do it at least two or three times a week at a minimum."

Start at the bottom (the tips of the matted hair) and use the brush to gently work out the tangles a little bit at a time. Work on little pieces at a time and keep unraveling the hair as you make your way up to the base. But remember that the best way to deal with tangles is to do preventative care that ensures they never develop in the first place."

You can use your fingers, if they are clean, or a soft cloth to remove the mucus. Be gentle and careful not to poke your dog in the eyes. You can also use a hairbrush (or a small pair of scissors, depending on the intensity of the mat) to get rid of any bits of matted fur. If you leave the rheum on your Shih Tzu’s eyes for too long, it can discolor the hair around your dog’s eyes. This is especially true if your dog has lighter colored hair."

You can either let your dog air dry at this point or you can use a hairdryer on the dog to fully dry your pup’s coat. [5] X Research source Be sure to use the lowest setting on the hairdryer when drying your dog. If you use a warmer setting, it could burn your dog’s skin. Sometimes dogs are afraid of the noise that the hairdryer makes. Try introducing the dog to the noise slowly at first before you start using it on the dog."

[9] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. This kind of product can be purchased at any pet store. Pour a few drops of the solution on a cotton ball and gently rub it on the skin and hair around the dog’s ears. Then fold the dog’s ear back over and massage the ear from the top side to get the cleaning solution all over the surface. Then use a clean cotton ball to wipe up any remaining moisture from the cleaner. At this point, you can take a fine comb (preferably the one you used to comb the dog’s face) and gently comb the hair in and around the dog’s ears. This will also help prevent any mats from forming. When using the cotton balls, make sure you don’t get them too deep into the dog’s ear cavity. To clean your Shih Tsu’s ears, it is easiest to place the dog on its side on a flat surface. Always check your dog's ears immediately after a walk to make sure that no twigs, grass, or other debris are in its ears. These items could work their way deeper into the dog's ears if not removed."

Gently slide the toothbrush around your dog’s mouth and try to scrub (again, gently) its teeth and gums. Start slowly and work your way up to longer sessions while your dog gets used to the new process. Brush your dog's teeth daily. If your dog has trouble adjusting to the toothbrush, you can purchase a finger brush that slides onto your finger to use in the beginning. This will help your dog get used to the process before you transition to a real dog toothbrush. Again, be sure to purchase toothpaste that is intended for use with dogs. Human toothpaste contains ingredients that can be toxic if ingested by dogs."
