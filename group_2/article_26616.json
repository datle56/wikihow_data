Individuals who suffer from conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure often become resistant to insulin, which actually causes the body to produce more insulin. These high insulin levels have been linked to increased eye pressure. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To solve this problem, patients are advised to avoid certain foods that can trigger an abrupt increase in insulin levels.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Over time, glaucoma can lead to vision loss. Glaucoma is usually treated using a combination of eye drops and oral medications. However, if these measures don't work, surgery will be necessary to lower pressure in the eyes. Surgery for glaucoma helps to improve the flow of fluid within the eyes, lowering eye pressure as a result. Sometimes, a single surgery will not be enough to adequately relieve eye pressure and treat glaucoma. In this situation, a follow-up surgery may be necessary. There are several types of surgery used to treat glaucoma, depending on the severity of the condition."

[15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Another type of laser surgery is iridotomy. This type of laser is used in people with very narrow drainage angles in the eyes. During this procedure, a small hole is created on the top part of the iris to allow for the drainage of fluid. If laser iridotomy doesn't work, peripheral iridotomy may be done. This procedure involves removing a small part of the iris to improve fluid drainage. This type of surgery is relatively rare."

High eye pressure (medically known as ocular hypertension) is difficult to diagnose as it does not show any visible symptoms such as redness or eye pain.

Tonometry. This procedure is used to measure intraocular pressure in the eyes and gauge whether the level of pressure is still within normal limits. The eye is numbed and then an orange dye is inserted to help the specialist identify the level of pressure. A machine is used to measure the pressure in the eye by applying pressure to the eye.
