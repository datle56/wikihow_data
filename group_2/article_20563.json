      "content": "Know your state's definition of abandoned vehicles. Different states have different qualifications that need to be met in order to consider a car abandoned. Make sure the car is officially an abandoned vehicle before making any attempts to obtain the title. A motor vehicle is a vehicle that has been left unattended on the property of another person. However, a certain amount of time must pass before it can be considered abandoned. Timeframes vary by state and sometimes even by county. In New York, for example, the vehicle must remain unattended for at least 96 hours before it's considered abandon. [1] X Research source You can find out the qualifications in your state either by visiting your local Department of Motor Vehicles or browsing the local DMV website."

      "content": "Look over your options in regards to an abandoned vehicle. The process for obtaining a title is different in each state. Make sure you know what your legal rights are in regards to an abandoned vehicle in your state. If the vehicle was not found on your property, it will most likely be towed and then held by an automobile business. If the owner does not reclaim the vehicle after a certain timeframe, and the vehicle is worth less than a certain fee, the vehicle will be considered unclaimed. The timeframe and value varies by state. Once a vehicle is marked unclaimed, it will likely be sold at a public auction to the highest bidder. If you purchase an unclaimed vehicle at an auction, you will receive the vehicle and the title shortly after your bid is collected. In some states, even if the vehicle is found on your property it might still be auctioned. This is usually if the vehicle is worth more than a certain amount. You should always contact local authorities before trying to claim a title on an abandoned vehicle. [2] X Research source In other states, you can purchase the vehicle from the original owner if it's found on your property. The owner might also opt to simply transfer the title to you. Check your state's DMV website to see what the policies are in your area in regards to the possibility of obtaining an abandoned vehicle's title."

In this case, you can take the owner to small claim's court. Contact a small claim's court in your area and explain the situation. Someone at the court house should be able to explain the process of filing a claim to you. If your case does not pan out in small claims court, you can obtain a writ of execution from the county clerk which you would then bring to the sheriff's office. You should bring this alongside a copy of the car's DMV record and a letter from you indicating the car can legally be seized. You may be able to then obtain the title by entering a credit bid to the state. You should only go the small claim's court route if the vehicle is found on your property."
