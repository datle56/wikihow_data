      "content": "Lay out all of your supplies in front of you so they’re easily accessible. Grab a clean syringe , a tourniquet , an alcohol wipe , a cotton ball or tissue, a bandage, and a secure container with a lid. When you’re self-injecting, you need to be totally focused on what you’re doing—you don’t want to be scrambling around and looking for supplies. Always try to do self-injections in a safe, clean place when you aren’t crunched for time (like right before work). [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Arms are the best, followed by hands, legs, and feet. Focus on your upper forearm in particular—the vein that runs along the center of your elbow is the best option for self-injection. The 2 other veins that run along both sides of your forearm are also viable injection sites. If necessary, you can also self-inject in your hands, legs, and feet. [5] X Research source Your hands and feet are really far from your heart, so the injection wound will take longer to heal. Leg veins have a higher chance of forming clots, which can lead to serious circulation issues and major health complications. [6] X Research source Warning: Avoid self-injecting your medication into your neck or groin area. Both of these injection sites contain major arteries (the jugular and femoral, respectively), and it can be deadly to pierce them by mistake. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure the tourniquet 2-4 in (5-10 cm) above the injection site. Using both hands, wrap the tourniquet strap around the base of your upper arm. Instead of tying a knot, tuck 1 end of the strap beneath the wrapped section of the tourniquet. When you’re ready to remove the tourniquet, simply pull on the tucked-in end of the strap to undo it completely. [8] X Research source If you’re injecting into your hand, ball your hand into a fist and roll your wrist forward so the veins are more visible. As a general rule of thumb, aim for the veins that are closer to your wrist—these are easier to inject into. [9] X Research source Two condoms tied together can work in a pinch if you don’t have a tourniquet on hand. [10] X Research source Tip: Before applying the tourniquet, hold out your arm and rotate it in big circles for 20-30 seconds. This helps more blood flow into your arm, which makes the vein easier to find . [11] X Research source"

      "title": "The blood in your syringe should look dark red (not bright red).",
      "content": "The blood in your syringe should look dark red (not bright red). Extend the plunger slightly and watch for a little bit of blood to fill your syringe. If the blood looks dark red, you’ve successfully hit a vein and are ready to continue with the injection. This process is also known as “registering.” If no blood is in the syringe: Gently remove the needle, undo the tourniquet, and press on the injection wound with a cotton ball or tissue. Then, redo the tourniquet and try again at a different injection site. If the blood in the syringe is bright red: You’ve likely hit an artery instead of a vein—remove the needle carefully and undo your tourniquet. Then (if you can), lift the injection site so it’s above your head. At this time, press on the wound for 10 minutes with a tissue or cotton ball to stop the bleeding. If the bleeding still hasn’t stopped after this point, get medical help right away. Warning: Always make sure your needle is in a vein before you inject any medication. If you inject into tissue outside of the vein, you could develop an abscess (a severe skin infection). [14] X Research source"

If you need to inject medication a lot, wait until this container is full of old needles before tossing it out.

Move at least 1 in (2.5 cm) away from your old injection site so that part of your vein has a chance to heal. To be extra safe, switch to a different arm or part of your body to prevent a particular vein from developing a lot of scar tissue (or even collapsing).
