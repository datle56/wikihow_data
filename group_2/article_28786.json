For example, if you're making a chore chart for your roommate who is generally busy in the morning but free in the evening, you chart his chore-work for evening hours. Chore charts can be as general or specific as you like. For those who have difficulty finding time to do chores, you may want a very specific chore chart and schedule. Some people find it easier to assign chores to a day, or even week. In this case, the person who has to do the chore will have an entire day or week to check off the chore from the chart.

      "content": "Divide and conquer. Not only will splitting up the chores you have make less work for everyone, it will also give a sense of solidarity to all involved. Even if you're a parent who doesn't need a chore chart, listing your many chores next to the responsibilities of your kids might gain you more appreciation for all the work you do. This is a great technique for children who are resistant to chores. Once they see how much work you do next to their few around-the-house tasks, they'll likely be less difficult. Allow some flexibility with chore assignments. If someone particularly hates a specific chore, maybe a less hated one can be exchanged for it."

The seven columns to the right will be where the chore-doer marks whether the chore has been finished or not. These seven columns can be much smaller than your first. If you have five chores, you should have at least six rows. The topmost row will be for days of the week, so you'll need one more row than your number of chores. [4] X Research source"

In the topmost row, skipping again the upper leftmost box, write the days of the week.

However, if you want to do the marking yourself to keep the chore doer honest, you can use the same procedure when you are informed the chore is complete. For example, when the chore doer's bed is made, you'll put a check mark in the box to the right of \"Make Bed\" in the corresponding column for the day of the week. For children especially resistant to chores, you may want to do a brief inspecting of the work before you hand out a check mark."

Then, when each child completes a chore, you can write a check mark in the appropriate color. For chores that alternate doers per day, week, or a similar situation, you might want to use initials to mark the chore complete and keep track of order. For example, if Billy takes out the trash Tuesday but Susan is expected to on Thursday, initials would clearly indicate both whose turn it is and chore completion."

In this case, you can improve accountability and squash excuses by writing out chore \"recipe\" cards. Simply: Write down all parts involved in doing the chore on card stock and punch a hole in its upper left hand corner. Put a binder ring in the punched corner. Leave the card in the room where the chore will be done. Attach the binder ring somewhere obvious, but out of the way. Maybe on the arm of a lamp, or onto a rung of a chair that sits off in the corner. For rooms that have multiple chores, you can collect several cards on the same binder ring."
