      "title": "Take your measurements.",
      "content": "Take your measurements. You will measure most accurately if you are unclothed. Measure your waist by wrapping a vinyl tape measure around it. Measure the distance from your waist to where you want the hem of the skirt to fall. For example, measure just above or just below your knee depending on your preferred skirt length. Check the distance from your waist to your shoulder. Wrap the tape measure around the widest part of your bust."

If the unpicked stitches left large holes in the fabric, then trim the edge off of the bedsheet so that the holes don't look unattractive when you're wearing the dress. Save the fabric and use it to make ties for the dress later."

Draw a straight line from the left base of the semicircle toward the outside edge of the paper. This line's measurement should equal the length of your skirt plus an additional 2\" (5 cm) for seams. Draw a second line on the right side. The second line should have the same measurements as the first. Draw a second semicircle from the tip of the left line to the tip of the right line."

Draw a line equal to the distance between your shoulder and waist on the paper. Add 2\" (5 cm) for seams. Measure the distance from your hips to the widest part of your bust. On the line that you just drew, measure the same length, starting at the bottom of the line. Make a dot on the first line to mark the location of your bust on the pattern. Draw a line through the dot that you just drew. The length of the line should equal one-fourth of your bust measurement plus 2\" (5 cm) for seams, and the dot should be at the midpoint of the line. Draw a line at the base of the shoulder-waist line that is perpendicular to the shoulder-waist line. This line should be one-fourth of your waist measurement plus 2\" (5 cm) for seams. Rough-sketch the front half of the shirt. Sketch as though you are looking at the shirt from the side. Curve the sides inward slightly to give it a natural shape. Sketch the back of the shirt. The sketch should be approximately equal in size to the front with a section scooped out of the top."
