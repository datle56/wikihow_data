      "title": "Pick an appropriate sock.",
      "content": "Pick an appropriate sock. For a smaller heating pad , use a mid-calf sock. For a larger heating pad, use an over the calf or knee sock. Use a sock that’s 100% cotton. Choose a thick sock with a tight weave to protect your skin from the hot rice and to prevent the rice from seeping out. It’s important to use cotton, because it won’t burn or melt in the microwave. Make sure the sock material doesn’t have metal threads in it, such as silver or copper, as these can ignite in the microwave. Don’t use socks that have holes, as the rice will fall out. For a larger homemade heating pad, use a small pillowcase instead of a sock."

In place of rice, you can also use other dry grains, such as: Beans Barley Flaxseed Whole corn (not popping)"
