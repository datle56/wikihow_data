Also ask about her schedule to grab her attention. You can give her some options like: [1] X Research source ”A new brewery opened up. I was thinking about checking it out. How does your Friday look?” “Want to grab some sushi or some Peruvian coffee? Are you free Saturday?” “I’d love to take you out to my favorite live music spot. Are you off on the weekend?” Reader Poll: We asked 658 wikiHow readers which type of location they’d prefer for a first date, and 50% of them said a coffee shop. [Take Poll]"

When you show up, she’ll know you’re great with logistics. [2] X Research source Figure out how much time it’ll take to shower, groom, and get dressed. First impressions are important.

After food or drinks arrive, get more creative and go for questions about her opinions. She’ll love that the spotlight is on her. Start with simple ice-breakers like: [3] X Research source ”So, you’re in accounting! What’s that like? Is it really punching numbers all day, or is that just a myth?” ”Okay, so we covered work. But what do you do to unwind?” “What’s your hot take on streaming standup shows? Is it better to just go to one in person?”"

Then, briefly look at her lips and any physical features that stand out. Test how open she is to any kind of touch. A low-key hand placement on her arm is just enough to kick off some chemistry. [4] X Research source If she quickly looks at your lips, she might be seriously interested in you. If she’s very affectionate, try out just one suggestive form of touch. Put your hand on her knee. Use subtle compliments. For example, you can say, “This is so funny… that guy over there won’t stop checking you out!”"

It feels like we’ve been following each other for ages now.” “I’m not sure if you could tell by now, but I’m extremely interested in you. You’re insanely smart and attractive.” “I’m just putting this out there—and it’s totally cool if you’re not feeling this—but I feel a strong connection with you.”"

Maybe we can head to my apartment and dive deeper into this topic?” If she isn’t ready to come over, tell her you’re cool with that. You’re way more likely to earn her trust."

I’ll show you some of the best quotes.” “I watched all these videos on craft cocktails, but I’ve never actually tried mixing one.

For example, you can share some thoughts like: [9] X Research source “Oh, yeah! This band is great. I actually saw them live a couple years ago.” “The lyrics are intense, huh? That’s always been so interesting to me, since the vocals are so chill and relaxed.” Music also fills the silence. It’ll keep your date engaged when both of you think about what to say."

For example, you can say, “Here are some pictures of my trip to Nepal. Where would you like to travel to?” See where she sits to check her comfort level. She may sit far away, or she might get right next to you. You can also put on a movie. If she hugs your arm while you watch it, she might be trying to give you a strong signal of interest."

All I know is that I’m really enjoying myself.\" [11] X Research source “You’re so fun to have around, and I could listen to you for hours.” You can also ask her a question like, “What do you think you’re in the mood for right now?”"
