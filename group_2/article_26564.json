      "content": "Pick a quiet area that will help you stay focused. It is usually best to study in a place that is relatively quiet so that you can focus. There are many great places where you can study, both at home and in public. [1] X Research source Your bedroom can be a great place to study. Just make sure you have a desk in there. Studying on your bed may make you sleepy. If you don't have a desk in your room, try working at the kitchen table or at a computer desk somewhere in your home. Ask your family to keep their voices down. Try a public, school, or university library. These often have desks in quiet areas where you can just study. You might even be able to book a study room for a few hours. Some people study well with a little bit of ambient background noise. If you feel this might help, try studying at a cafe. Reader Poll: We asked 374 wikiHow readers which study space they found most effective for staying focused and productive, and 47% of them said, a quiet library cubicle. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Find study partners with similar habits. Get to know people in your class and take the time to ask them about their study methods. Look for a potential study partner who likes to study around the same time of day as you do and who uses similar methods of learning. Ask them if they'd like to study with you sometime, which will make the process less isolating and boring. For instance, if you prefer to study in the library at night, seek a study partner who does the same. Ask fellow students about their study habits by saying something like, \"I always need to set up in a library to study properly. What works for you?\" Avoid studying with friends or classmates who will be a big distraction."

You can mark these accomplishments in intervals of time or by the quantity of study material covered. Decide on specific rewards ahead of time, whether they be edible treats, entertainment, or leisure activities. [12] X Research source Choose a reward that won’t take too long to enjoy. For instance, you might reward yourself for every two hours of studying by watching a half hour sitcom episode. If you reward yourself with a snack, opt for something healthy and energy-boosting like fruits, vegetables, whole grain crackers, cheese, yogurt, and almonds. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Break your material down into smaller chunks to avoid burnout. Studying too much information at once can cause you to feel overwhelmed. Instead, separate your notes into smaller sections. Each time you master a section, you'll feel a sense of satisfaction! [14] X Research source For example, instead of trying to memorize all of your equations, focus on 1 or 2 at a time. Add more only once you have mastered the previous ones. If you're studying history, break up your notes according to event, historical figure, or time period. For example, you might study 10 years at a time or focus on the consequences of 1 historical event. You can organize your breaks around these smaller chunks. This will help you rest a little more while you learn your material."
