      "content": "Collect a bunch of songs you and your guests will love. Create a playlist on a music app like Spotify or iTunes for your party. Think about your general audience to help choose the music. You could also reach out to people coming to your party to ask what they’d like to listen to. Add your songs to the playlist so all you have to do is hit play once the party gets started. [1] X Research source You can also check out some of the premade playlists on Spotify or iTunes and either use them or add songs from the list to your own playlist. Another option is to hire a DJ to handle the music for your party."

      "content": "Have them ready so you don’t have to play bartender during the party. Use a large pitcher or a punch bowl and mix together a giant version of a cocktail you want to serve at your party. You could also make a few different drinks to give people some variety. Have them ready in advance of your party so all you need to do is place them out and let people serve themselves! [2] X Research source A basic rule of thumb for stocking up enough alcohol for a party is to have 3 bottles of wine for every 4 people or 3-4 cocktails per person. [3] X Research source Try making tasty party classics like rum or tequila punch, margaritas, or sangria. If you want a non-alcoholic option, a big bowl of punch is always a hit. Be sure to add a ladle if you’re using bowls!"

      "content": "Finger foods and small appetizers can liven up any party. Hearty but simple appetizers such as finger sandwiches, pizza, and bruschetta are sure to be a hit. For simple protein choices, go with small but tasty options like meatballs, chicken wings, or even sushi. Dips and spreads are also a simple item that you can pair with things like chips or crunchy fresh vegetables. If you’re hosting 10-12 people, go with about 5 appetizer choices. For about 25 people, put out 9 choices, and for 50 or more guests, serve around 13 appetizer selections so everyone has plenty to snack on. [4] X Research source If you have a bunch of people coming and you’re worried about running out of food, stock up on cheaper items like potatoes and bread so everyone has enough. Come up with a menu that reflects the energy of the party you want to throw. [5] X Research source For instance, if you’re having a fun, casual get-together, you could put together a menu that includes sandwiches, french fries, crunch veggies to snack on, and lots of tasty dips."

      "content": "Start the party off on a high note for each person. Avoid any awkwardness and make your guests feel immediately welcome by greeting them at the door. Offer them a drink, and point them toward the food so they feel comfortable and relaxed. [6] X Research source While the party is getting started, hang out by the front door so you can greet each person as they arrive. For instance, you could say something like, “Hey Tom! It’s great to see you. Do you want a beer or a soda? The snacks are in the kitchen. Come on in and have some fun!”"

      "title": "Let them know about any special events or rules.",
      "content": "Let them know about any special events or rules. If you have any fun events planned such as a karaoke competition or a dance off, let your guests know about them so they don’t miss anything. Additionally, if you have any ground rules such as no underage drinking, or if there are any rooms that you don’t want people to go into, tell people as soon as they get to your party so everyone knows. [7] X Research source You can also make sure that anyone who’s drinking has either a designated driver or a way to get home such as a ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft."

      "title": "Connect like-minded people so they can have fun together.",
      "content": "Connect like-minded people so they can have fun together. Help them get the conversation going by giving each person a little bit of info about the other. Once the ball gets rolling, you can leave them to talk and get to know each other. [8] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “Hi Chris, this is Anna. Anna this is Chris. I think both of you guys are super into CrossFit, right?” Stick to easy, open-ended questions that encourage people to talk. You could ask something like, “How do you guys like the wings? What do you like to cook?”"

      "content": "Make sure they’re having a good time and don’t need anything. Walk around during your party and ask people if there’s anything that you can get them. Remind them where things like the bathroom and kitchen are, as well as any special events or games you have planned. If someone seems like they may have had too much to drink, try getting them some water and make sure they have a safe way to get home. [9] X Research source You want everyone to have fun, but you also want your guests to be safe!"

      "content": "Choose easy-to-explain games that you can break out at a moment’s notice. If your party is starting to lose a little steam, kick things up a notch with a fun game like “Never Have I Ever,” “Truth or Dare,” “Charades,” or even “Musical Chairs.” Get everyone who wants to play involved and don’t stress too much about winners and losers—just keep it fun! [10] X Research source You can also try the “Telephone” game where you gather people in a circle and whisper a phrase in another person’s ear. They can then whisper it to another person and it goes around to the last person to see what the phrase has changed into. If you’re feeling a little daring, you could even try playing a classic game of spin the bottle."

Once the party is going, just let it go. Grab some food and a drink and have some fun yourself! [11] X Research source"
