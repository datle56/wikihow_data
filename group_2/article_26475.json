Allocate 15% to 20% of your daily caloric intake to lean proteins (go for a higher percentage if you’re physically active most days of the week).

Women under 50 and men under 70 need 1,000 mg of calcium and 600 IU of Vitamin D every day. Women 50 and up and men 70 and up should aim to get 1,200 mg of calcium and 800 IU of Vitamin D daily. [3] X Research source Protein-rich Greek yogurt , cow’s or nut milks, and low-fat cheeses can make you feel full and reduce calcitriol, a hormone that tells your body to store more fat. Choose unsweetened or minimally sweetened yogurt over sweeter (flavored) versions. If plain yogurt is just too plain for you, add some fresh blueberries or raspberries. Fresh mozzarella, feta, goat’s cheese, and cottage cheese are all great choices. Non-dairy products like green vegetables (like collards, kale , broccoli rabe, soybeans), orange juice, english muffins, soymilk, and cereals also add to your daily intake of calcium and vitamin D."

Always keep healthy snacks in your bag, desk, or car (anywhere you might be when mid-morning or afternoon hunger strikes). Packaged protein and snack bars tend to have tons of added sugars, unhealthy fats, and processed ingredients. Read the labels carefully to check portion sizes and ingredients lists.

Feeling good will help you get through these 2 weeks since you’ll be cutting calories and moving a lot more—it can be tiresome but don’t give up! Always talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program. If you are new to exercise, start slow and easy until you can work your way up to 30 or 40 minutes.

Start with simple and well-known exercises like bicep curls , push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls, lateral raises , and chest presses. Do 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps.
