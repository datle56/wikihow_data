      "title": "Determine your investing goals/timeframe.",
      "content": "Determine your investing goals/timeframe. Before really considering what stocks you should invest in, you need to think about when you might need or want the money you invest back. If you only have money for the weekend, then maybe you’re better off going to the casino. If you are in the market for mid to long term investing, however, the stock market may be right for you. If you are in it for the long haul, then maybe a mutual fund or IRA is best. If you only have a couple months then maybe Apple or another tech stock is a worthy buy. It all depends on the market when you start."

      "title": "Select stocks from your watchlist that you believe are a worthy investment.",
      "content": "Select stocks from your watchlist that you believe are a worthy investment. Take a look at your watchlist as well as the “People Also Bought” section and the popular lists to see what stocks are priced where. If you see that Microsoft is at a 52-week high, then maybe wait for it to become a little cheaper. By the same token, if a stock is at a 52-week low, wait for it to have an upswing before investing. Some companies can have long periods of growth while others trade nearly horizontal (meaning that their periods of rising and falling are relatively short)."

      "content": "Look at the average price paid by users. Look at the price that people paid, on average for the stock you are considering investing in. If it is below, it is often a better buy than to buy it above average, or even at peak. There are some circumstances where this could be profitable in the long run (recently AMD had several weeks of high percentage gains in a row) but often this is not the way to invest. Look for stocks that are at, near or below their average price paid by other users."
