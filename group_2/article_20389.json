Look for an opportunity to confidently introduce yourself, and see if you can strike up a conversation with him. [7] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. One of the easiest conversation topics is school. If you are in the same class with him, talk to him about a difficult homework assignment or an upcoming test. You may find out that he loves history class, or is not fond of gym. If there is an upcoming assembly meeting, grab a close friend to be your wing-person, and go sit next to your crush at the assembly. This will give you an opportunity to not only get to know your crush, but maybe get to know some of his friends as well. Don’t feel obligated to talk about the lovely weather, instead, try talking about something that genuinely interests you or that you are passionate about. This will help you portray more confidence in what you are saying, and give insight into your personality."

Friendships and relationships take a lot of work and effort to blossom and maintain. So if you talked to him in class, continuing talking to him in class, or even in the hallways between classes. After a few conversations, maybe even casually exchange phone numbers, become friends on social media, or send him an instant message online. Use whatever method you are comfortable with to keep the conversation going. Don’t be overly pushy. Sometimes, a guy just might not be interested in pursuing a relationship or even a friendship with you. If it seems like he is not interested in making conversation with you, it might be best to cut your losses and move on. Don’t play emotional games, or try to stir up drama to get him to notice you. You might successfully catch his attention by doing this, but immature games and acts will become tiring over time. [8] X Research source"

This will show your crush that you are interested in his life as a whole, and not just him. There is a reason your crush hangs out with certain people, so you might just wind up making a new group of friends in the process. An easy way to do this would be to sit with them at lunch. You don’t have to go by yourself if you are nervous. Grab a friend or two to join you and take some of the pressure off. Also have your crush get to know your friends as well. Just because you are interested in someone romantically, does not mean you stop hanging out with your friends.

[14] X Research source If you are unsure of a guy’s orientation, take the time to get to him before you ask him directly. It might come up casually in conversation, or a topic you both are talking about might open up an opportunity for you to ask. Just use your best judgement to protect yourself, and respect his preferences. Don’t worry about getting trapped in the “friend-zone.” Some of the strongest relationships form from a solid friendship. If the both of you are meant to be more than friends, it will happen. What is important is that you respect each other’s wishes, and take the time to get to know each other. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell him how you feel in person. Even though it may seem scary or nerve wracking, your feelings will sound more sincere and real if you tell him in person. Messages sent over social media or via text tend to sound flat compared to spoken words. Invite him to a place you two normally hang out at, take a deep breath, and tell him how you feel. Practice what you want to say to him ahead of time. Try doing this in front of a mirror and keep eye contact with yourself. This will help work out some of the nervous feelings you might have for when you tell him in person. Respect his feelings. If you confess your feelings and he tells you he wants to just remain friends or is not ready for a relationship, you need to respect his feelings. You cannot force someone to like you romantically if they don’t. While it may hurt at first, try and continue your friendship with him. Even though he may not want to be your boyfriend, he can still be a really good lifelong friend if you want him to be."
