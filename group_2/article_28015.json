      "content": "Delete old and unused files. Go through your folders, like Photos and Documents, and trash what you don’t need. Having about 95% of your hard drive taken up by files means your computer doesn’t have the space it needs to store information, like temporary files for programs. You can sign up for Cloud services like Google Drive to store your pictures and videos so they don’t take up space on your computer. This will help to speed up your Mac or your Windows computer and reduce lag on Sims 4."
