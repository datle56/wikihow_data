      "content": "Reduce your house number to a single digit with addition. Add together the individual digits of your address number to find your house numerology number. If you get a double-digit number, add those digits up as well. Continue until you get a single-digit number. This final sum is your numerological home or address number. [1] X Research source Example: For an address at 1615 Candy Street, add 1 + 6 + 1 + 5 = 13. Then, add 1 + 3 = 4. This house’s numerology number is 4. If your home number has a letter, include it in your calculation. For example, the house number 12B is calculated as 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Each letter has a matching number: 1 (A, J, S) - 2 (B, K, T) - 3 (C, L, U) - 4 (D, M, V) - 5 (E, N, W) - 6 (F, O, X) - 7 (G, P, Y) - 8 (H, Q, Z) - 9 (I, R). If you live in an apartment, use your apartment number instead of the building address. If your address is 180 Harvard Ave, Apt 4D, only add 4 + 4 = 8 . If you live on a numbered street (for example, 5th Avenue), do not include the street in your calculation."

[9] X Research source Number 4 homes are great for those who enjoy stability and activities like investing, gardening, or spiritual education. [10] X Research source Things move slowly in a number 4 house, so they challenge people who crave adventure. If you're living in a number 4 house, balance your time between work and play."

They may be isolating for people who enjoy being around others, having material possessions, or who struggle with addiction when alone."

That doesn’t mean anything bad about your home, but you may have an extra obstacle to overcome. [21] X Research source Number 13 is linked to laziness and self-indulgence. This debt may be paid with hard work and improved self-control. The number 13 may mean your home needs a lot of structural or maintenance work. [22] X Research source Number 14 indicates an excessive enjoyment of life using tools like food, alcohol, and sex to avoid responsibility. You may have to repay this debt by reigning in impulsive tendencies and practicing modesty. [23] X Research source Number 16 represents challenges like difficulty developing meaningful relationships or sabotaging existing relationships. Put extra effort into your relationships and abstain from behaviors that would betray your loved ones. [24] X Research source Number 19 may show previous patterns of being a bully or hurting others for one’s own gain. If your house has this energy, work hard to care for others and spread kindness however you can. [25] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a house number inside your door to change your home’s energy. For example, if you live in a number 2 home but want a number 6 home, add the number 4 to the inside of your door. Since 2 + 4 = 6, a number 6 house is now yours! [28] X Research source You may feel incompatible with your house’s personality, or its numerological meaning may not match your life. If moving isn’t an option, this is a good alternative. To learn more, life coach and numerologist Camber Hill recommends using numerology to find your friends’ house numbers so that “you begin to build…an opinion about [those] number[s].”"
