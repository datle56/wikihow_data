      "content": "Refill a large container as you go to keep a regular water supply. If you have a very large, RV-like van it may have refillable water tanks. If not, purchase a 5 or 10 liter (1.3 or 2.6 US gal) water bottle and refill it as needed for drinking water, basic hygiene, and other uses. Water fountains can be found easily in local parks and rest areas, or you can fill up for a few cents per liter at a grocery store. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Visit a gym to shower and exercise. If you are living in a van but sticking around the same city, purchase a gym membership. This will allow you to take regular showers and to exert some energy that may be built up from living in a small space. If you are living on the road, most gyms offer day passes for a few dollars.

      "content": "Do your laundry at laundromats or campsites. Although hand washing your clothing is an option, it is less time-consuming and tedious to use washers and dryers whenever possible. Visit laundromats for relatively cheap laundry services. For a few extra dollars, you can also opt to spend a day at a fully-equipped campsite featuring laundry facilities. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay warm with an insulated sleeping bag and hot water bottle. Your best best for staying warm in your van during cold spells is to get an insulated sleeping bag designed for zero degree weather. As an alternative, try layering a thick woolen blanket under a foil thermal camping blanket. Hot water bottles can provide heat for hours without a need for any fire or electricity. You can fill your hot water bottle with water heated over a campfire, or hot water from the sink in a public restroom. Thermal sleeping bags and camping blankets can be purchased at camping stores."

      "content": "Tell your loved ones that you plan to live in a van to get their support. While it is possible that friends and family will judge you for deciding to live in a van, it is important to inform them about this life change. They may be able to offer help and support if you need it, such as a place to park your van occasionally. Be positive and confident when you tell them to alleviate any concern or worry about your new lifestyle. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Forward your mail to family or friends, get a P.O. box, or use commercial carriers. Ask friends if you can have your mail forwarded to their address so that they can send important correspondence to you. If this is not a possibility, you can rent a P.O. box at your local post office to receive general mail. To receive parcels, you can arrange to have them sent to a local commercial carrier like Fedex or UPS store for a fee. [6] X Research source Unlike P.O. boxes, you can receive mail and parcels from all carriers with a UPS box. Call commercial carriers to arrange the service before ordering any packages."

      "content": "Park in the lots of 24-hour businesses if residential areas aren't an option. Hotels, motels, 24-hour grocery stores, and other businesses that are open all night will provide you with a good free parking option. Aim to drive into the lot when it is already relatively late to avoid attracting attention, as parking overnight may be frowned upon by management. Park in a discreet place, out of the way of customers' vehicles, and avoid creating any kind of disturbance. [9] X Research source Staying close to a 24-hour business will also offer security in the event that you need assistance."

      "content": "Add insulation to the van to maintain a comfortable temperature. Insulation will help you retain warm air in your van on cold nights and cool air inside during hot weather. Purchase styrofoam or polystyrene panels to attach to the interior walls of your van. Because these are rigid and will miss corners or curved spots, purchase insulation sheets to cover the gaps. [15] X Research source While you can insulate the interior of your van with insulation sheeting only, combining the panels and sheeting is a much more cost-effective option. Use spray-on or brush-on adhesive to attach insulation to the walls of your van. Flexible blanket insulation is also an option, but it is bulkier."

      "content": "Install a composting toilet. A composting toilet is a good option for adding a portable toilet to your van. Composting toilets trap waste in an airtight drum, where it is composted and later deposited into the soil. If used properly, these toilets should be relatively odor-free. [16] X Research source There are several different models of composting toilets available. Opt for a lighter model with a locking system that will hold the compost drum upright while you are driving the van. Follow the instructions on your composting toilet carefully when installing it in your van."
