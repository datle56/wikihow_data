      "content": "Place your rug on a flat surface. Before ironing your rug, set it on a level surface. Place your rug on your kitchen floor, living room floor, or any flat, clean place close to a power outlet, as you’ll need somewhere to plug in your iron. [1] X Research source If your rug is dirty, shake it out or vacuum it first to ensure you don’t press in any stain-causing dirt or dander."

      "content": "Grab a clean, white towel to protect your rug during ironing. You’ll need a clean, white towel to protect your rug fibers from melting as you run your iron across the rug. Don’t use a colored or patterned towel, as the colors may transfer onto your rug when heated under the iron. [2] X Research source You can use an old towel or rag, so long as it’s clean and white, to prevent staining or color transfer as you iron."

      "content": "Fill up your iron with water, plug it in, and set it to medium heat + steam. After you’ve filled up your iron to the fill line with water and plugged it in, set the dial to medium heat with steam. You can do this by turning the dial clockwise—there should be a picture of a cloud to represent steam, which is the setting you’re going for. [3] X Research source If your iron cord is too short or far away from an outlet, use an extension cord for a full range of mobility and a more effortless ironing experience overall."

      "content": "Lay the white towel flat across the top of your rug. You’ll be moving the towel across the entirety of the rug throughout the ironing process, so make sure to set it flat, on top of your rug, in a position that works for you. You can work horizontally or vertically—the important thing here is that you never allow the iron to touch the rug without the towel protecting it. [4] X Research source Ironing directly on top of your rug will burn or melt a hole in it."

Pull and re-position the towel as you progress across the rug, applying even pressure in short strokes. [5] X Research source For stubborn wrinkles, apply and hold more pressure for a maximum of 10 seconds in that area. Repeat this technique until the wrinkle lies flat."

If you purchased a rug, got it home, and laid it on your floor only to notice its creased and wavy appearance, don’t worry! One of the easiest ways to correct these waves is to re-roll your rug in the opposite direction it came in. [8] X Research source For example, if you purchased a rug that was rolled with the top facing outwards, roll up the rug with the bottom facing out this next time. Be sure to slowly roll up the rug to maintain a tight, even cylinder—rug rolling is easiest with the help of a friend!"

The best weather for laying your rug out in the sun to remove wrinkles is a warm, sunny day between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit (24-27°C). The sun will gently heat the fibers of your rug, much like an iron, so they lie flat and uniform. [12] X Research source A warm day with a little humidity is also a great option, as the moisture in the air will help the fibers of your rug to soften and relax."
