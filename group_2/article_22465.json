      "title": "Know the signs of cataract growth.",
      "content": "Know the signs of cataract growth. Cataracts develop over time and the key is to treat them early. As a dog owner, make sure to inspect your dog’s eyes on a regular basis. Look for any indications of a cloudy appearance or a color change. If your dog already has cataracts, watch to see if the impacted area grows or changes in shape. [1] X Research source Be sure to tell cataracts apart from lenticular sclerosis. This is a normal condition in older dogs, where the lens develops a bluish-colored haze. It does not seem to affect vision significantly. Cataracts, on the other hand, are white, opaque, and diminish vision. [2] X Research source You may also notice other physical signs of cataract growth, such as loss of balance. Your dog may appear a bit clumsier and could run into furniture. If your dog has diabetes mellitus, be aware that cataracts are a common complication in dogs. Keep an eye on their diabetes-related symptoms. If you notice that your dog is losing weight or experiencing more frequent urination, then take them to a vet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Take your dog to the vet.",
      "content": "Take your dog to the vet. A vet is the only person who can truly diagnose a dog with cataracts. Your vet will likely inspect your dog’s history. They will also ask you about the symptoms that you’ve observed thus far. They will perform an extensive physical exam on your dog as well, focusing on the ocular region. [4] X Research source Depending on what the vet sees, they may also order a series of tests and bloodwork, especially for diabetes. Before a surgery is scheduled, your dog may get an ultrasound of its eye area too. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your dog antioxidants and vitamins.",
      "content": "Give your dog antioxidants and vitamins. Talk with your vet before giving your dog anything. But, it may be helpful to offer your dog some additional nutritional support to help it fight off the development of cataracts. You can add oral antioxidants to your dog’s food. You can also mix in healthy oils, such as cod liver oil. Under your vet’s supervision, you can also add in herbs, such as bilberry. Bilberry is believed to assist in eye strength by developing a link between the eyes and the liver. Human pilots have been known to take bilberry supplements. [6] X Research source Making healthy changes to your dog’s diet in general may slow the process of cataract growth as well. For example, use a food processor to liquefy green vegetables and mix them into your dog’s food. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider acupuncture therapy.",
      "content": "Consider acupuncture therapy. Once your dog’s been diagnosed with cataracts, you may want to start experimenting with canine massage and acupuncture therapy. Your vet may be able to suggest a reputable therapist. Ask the acupuncturist to focus specifically on the areas of the body associated with vision problems. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that this is an untested alternative therapy. There is no definitive evidence to show that acupuncture helps to prevent or delay cataracts. This type of touch-therapy is also not a good option for dogs that suffer from anxiety. The process of massage may be more stressful to them than soothing."

      "title": "Continue to monitor the cataract.",
      "content": "Continue to monitor the cataract. Once you’ve noticed the cataract and taken your dog to the vet, then you’ll need to consider how to proceed. Your vet may ask you to observe your dog’s eyes for a certain period of time and to write down any noticeable changes. Also, whether you choose surgery or not, you will want to get used to paying attention to the condition of your dog’s eyes. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider surgical treatment.",
      "content": "Consider surgical treatment. Surgery is currently the main treatment option for dogs suffering from cataracts. However, the surgery is invasive and requires an extensive recovery. Most vets will only recommend that healthy dogs go through the surgery. The surgery can also be costly, starting at around $1,000 and going upwards depending on the care that is needed. [10] X Research source The ultrasound tests that the vet performs will also need to show that your dog is a good candidate for surgery in the ocular region. Your dog’s retina (rear eye area) must be healthy. In dogs with good health, around 90 percent recover their vision post-surgery. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Know the dangers of untreated cataracts.",
      "content": "Know the dangers of untreated cataracts. If you leave your dog’s cataracts untreated, then it is likely that their vision will continue to deteriorate. They may lose their vision entirely due to the development of glaucoma. The cataract may also start to shift position in the eye, causing a great deal of pain. Whether you choose surgery or not, it is important to develop an observation and treatment plan for cataracts. [12] X Research source Part of the treatment plan may be discussing the eventual need for pain medications with your vet. It is good to plan ahead and keep these in stock in your house in case your dog goes through a particularly bad spell."

    {
      "title": "Stick with the same routines.",
      "content": "Stick with the same routines. Whether your dog is recovering from surgery or is facing deteriorating vision without surgery as an option, make a habit of following the same basic routine of care every day. Feed your dog at the same time. Try to play with them at around the same time. This will help your vision-impaired pet know what to expect. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use aromas to teach navigation.",
      "content": "Use aromas to teach navigation. A dog who suffers from impaired vision will naturally come to rely more on their sense of smell. Play into this by using two signal aromas in your household-one for “good” and one for “bad.” Vanilla, for example, can be your good aroma. Wipe a few drops of vanilla scent on their food area and around the door frames to help with navigation. [14] X Research source Bitter apple or peppermint could be your bad scent. Use this to warn against hazard areas, such as the edges of a fireplace."

      "title": "Keep the home environment the same.",
      "content": "Keep the home environment the same. Avoid moving furniture around or making any major changes to the outlines of your living space. Make sure to keep your dog’s personal area the same as well by not moving their crate or food and water bowls around."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place foam on any sharp edges.",
      "content": "Place foam on any sharp edges. Get down on your dog’s level and try to navigate around the house. Look for potential hazards in the form of sharp, low edges. Cover these edges with roll-out foam pieces. These foam barrier protectors are available online and in stores for babyproofing, but can also be used for pet proofing and safety."

      "title": "Help your dog get adjusted to wearing a cone or plastic collar.",
      "content": "Help your dog get adjusted to wearing a cone or plastic collar. After your dog’s surgery, they will have to wear a protective cone or collar. In order to make your dog’s postoperative life easier, get them adjusted to wearing a cone by having them wear the cone a bit before surgery. Ask your vet for a protective cone that you can put on your dog for a portion of time each day (you can decide the amount of time). That way, your dog won’t be frightened by the cone when it is placed on them after surgery."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice confining your dog to help them prepare for after the surgery.",
      "content": "Practice confining your dog to help them prepare for after the surgery. Like wearing the cone, confining your dog to a small space where they can heal is a necessary part of the post-op process. After the surgery, they will have to rest so that they do not injure themselves further. Introduce your dog to their crate before the surgery so that they are not confused or scared by it after the surgery has occurred. To get your dog used to the crate, try placing their food bowl in the crate. You can also put a treat in there to increase their desire to go in. When your dog is used to going into the crate for food, try closing the door for a short period of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Schedule a physical exam for your dog at least four weeks before the surgery.",
      "content": "Schedule a physical exam for your dog at least four weeks before the surgery. Because the surgery will require your dog to be put under anesthesia, you should set up an appointment to have your dog physically checked out. Doing this will help to make sure that your dog is physically fit for the surgery. The check-up should include a blood examination, blood pressure monitoring, and an evaluation of your dog’s clinical history. [15] X Research source If your dog is diabetic, it is especially important to have blood work done before the operation. You should also consider having a urinalysis done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your vet about pre-op preparations.",
      "content": "Talk to your vet about pre-op preparations. Some veterinarians recommend a preoperative treatment that involves anti-inflammatory eye drops. These drops may be given to your dog two weeks before the surgery, and may increase in frequency in the days before your dog’s operation. Your dog will also need to fast for at least 12 hours prior to surgery. If your dog is diabetic, ask your vet about the steps you should take to prepare it for surgery. Only feed the dog if the vet advises it, for example – there is a danger the dog could vomit while under anesthetic."

    {
      "title": "Restrain your dog using a harness.",
      "content": "Restrain your dog using a harness. During your dog’s recovery period, you will want them to wear a harness, not a collar. A harness will even out the pressure from your control movement, whereas a collar will add pressure to the head and eye area, potentially interfering with recovery. Also, remember to be extra gentle when maneuvering your dog via their harness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit the amount of exercise your dog gets.",
      "content": "Limit the amount of exercise your dog gets. Just like a human recovering from surgery, your dog should take it easy in the days following their procedure. Rest is the most important thing so that their body can heal. Encourage your dog to relax by laying down on the floor beside them. Build up to taking slow walks around the neighborhood. To limit your dog’s movement, you may also want to place them in a crate. However, make sure to only do this for short periods of time or your dog’s muscles could cramp, slowing recovery even more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your dog the medications prescribed by your vet.",
      "content": "Give your dog the medications prescribed by your vet. Make to keep all of the hospital paperwork nearby, showing exactly how much medication to give your dog and when. Give your dog the complete course of medication, even if they look better after a few doses. Your vet will most likely prescribe topical antibiotic eye drops that your dog should take for three to four weeks. This will help to keep your dog’s eye from getting infected. Make sure to wash your hands before applying a medication to your dog’s eye area. This will help to prevent the spread of germs. Carefully watch your dog’s reactions to their post-op medications. For example, if your dog tries to furiously rub its eyes after the drops, then talk with your vet about other options. You can expect to see some mild swelling around the eye area. A limited amount of clear discharge from the eye is also normal. If you notice anything concerning, contact your vet."

    {
      "title": "Be aware of the potential complications.",
      "content": "Be aware of the potential complications. It is a good idea to know the warning signs to watch for in the post-surgery period. Keep an eye on your dog over time to make sure that they do not exhibit any signs of infection, such as smelly eye discharge. Your dog may also respond poorly to anesthesia, so make sure that your dog becomes more clear-headed over time. [16] X Research source"
