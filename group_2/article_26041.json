If your curtains are wider than the lining fabric, you may need to sew together 2 lengths of lining fabric. To join the lining fabric, add 0.8 in (2 cm) to the width and sew them together lengthwise. You'll have a 0.4 (1 cm) wide seam in the middle)."

Measure the header tape so it's as wide as your lining and add 2.4 in (6 cm) so you can fold over the edges at the ends. Cut the tape and lay it on top of your coated lining fabric so the tape runs along the top edge. Pin the tape in place and fold 1.2 in (3 cm) of the tape under at both ends. If you're using non-coated lining fabric that could fray, fold over 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) along the top of the lining fabric before you pin the tape in place."

Fold the curtain sides over the liner and iron them in place according to the tape manufacturer's instructions. Iron-on tape can make your curtains appear stiff, so try sewing the liner if you prefer a more natural drape. Most iron-on tapes won't be sturdy enough to support the weight of the curtains and liners, so only use this for very light fabrics."
