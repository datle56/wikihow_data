This will probably be the most effective and simple way of conserving battery life between charges. If you don't plan on answering the phone while you're sleeping or after business hours, just turn it off."

[1] X Expert Source Josef Storzi Apple & Mobile Phone Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. If your battery is low, avoid keeping the screen on while following navigation instructions, don't watch videos, and stay away from games and apps with lots of animations. [2] X Research source If you do have to use the screen, reducing the brightness will conserve more battery power. Use a black background if you have an AMOLED screen. It will use less power because AMOLED screens only light the pixels needed for an image—if an image is completely black, all the pixels are off. When not in use, the screen is likely set to turn off after a certain amount of time. You can decrease the amount of time your smartphone's screen stays illuminated by visiting How to Adjust the Screen Timeout on an Android Phone or How to Change Auto Lock Time on an iPhone. If you're using an iPhone, disable the Raise to Wake feature so your screen doesn't come on automatically when you lift it. You'll find this setting in Settings > Display & Brightness ."
