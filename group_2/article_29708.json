      "content": "This is a key part of getting a pup to poop. If you’ve just been taking your dog out on the patio or in the alley, they’re going to be less likely to go poop. Take them on a proper walk to some grassy areas where they can sniff around and find a good spot to go. Routine is extremely important for a puppy, so take them out at regular intervals every day. Puppies typically need to go out every 2-3 hours. If they don’t poop after a long walk, take them on another one in a few hours. Do not stress yourself out if it takes 3-4 walks to get them to poop. Don’t rush your pup! All that sniffing may seem like they’re just wasting their time, but it’s important when it comes to finding the right spot to do their business."

      "content": "Physical activity helps activate your dog’s gastrointestinal system. If a walk alone isn’t enough and your pup still has some energy in them, play some fetch or run around. After 15 minutes of play time or so, try taking them out on another walk. They may suddenly have to poop. [1] X Research source Regular exercise is extremely important for a puppy. Play with them regularly throughout the day—preferably before going on your walks."

      "content": "Give your pup some belly rubs to encourage a bowel movement. Outside, try rubbing your dog’s belly gently in a circular motion. If your puppy is a little constipated, rubbing their belly can help things along and encourage their digestive track to “get moving” so that they feel the urge to have a bowel movement. Try doing this for a few minutes to see if it helps. Try doing this every few blocks or so on a walk. It may take multiple belly rubs to get your dog to go. Some people believe that rubbing clockwise is ideal, while others believe counterclockwise is better. Try both if you aren’t getting any results."

      "content": "If your puppy has a normal pooping spot, go there if you haven’t yet. Taking a puppy on brand new routes with every walk can be confusing for them, and your pup may not know they’re supposed to poop if they’re in a new space. If your puppy tends to go in a specific area, take them there and keep returning. They’ll eventually associate the spot with pooping. If possible, keep returning to a quiet, secluded area where your pup can relieve themselves without getting distracted."

      "content": "Buy some plain, canned pumpkin and add it to your dog’s food. Pumpkin is incredibly high in fiber, and it’s actually really good for your dog’s stomach. Add 1-4 tablespoons (about 15-60 g) of canned pumpkin to your dog’s normal food. Take them out for a walk an hour or so later.

The pie filling contains ingredients that are toxic for dogs."

      "content": "Cold water on a dog’s rear end may trigger a bowel movement. Fill a spray bottle with cool water and spritz your dog’s anus 1-2 times using a wide nozzle setting. The cold water should make your puppy’s sphincter to contract, which is actually what happens when they make a normal bowel movement. Once your dog flexes their anal muscles, they may start to defecate. Take the bottle with you on a walk and try doing this a few times whenever you go to their normal pooping spot. Alternatively, you can hold an ice cube up against their backside. Wipe your pup’s backside when they’re done. Your puppy likely won’t appreciate a damp backside."

      "content": "This one might be a little gross, but it should work if they’re constipated. Throw on some latex gloves. Hold your puppy’s stomach with your nondominant hand and then use your gloved, dominant hand to gently press on the sides of your dog’s anus. If you feel something firm, they’re probably constipated. Gently push in a bit towards your dog’s stomach and then pinch inward like you’re picking up a penny. Do this 3-5 times and your puppy may poop. [3] X Research source People traditionally do this with paralyzed or chronically ill pets who struggle to relieve themselves on their own, but you can try it with a pup if you can get them to stay still. Alternatively, you can gently wipe around the dog’s anus with a baby wipe to try and stimulate their muscles. [4] X Research source Do not insert any fingers into your puppy’s anus or force them to stay still if they’re in discomfort."

If your puppy isn’t fully housetrained and they just aren’t relieving themselves on a walk, give them a little time in their crate. [5] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source A puppy won’t urinate or defecate where they eat or sleep, so if you simply think they just need a little more time to need to go, this is a safe move. It can take time for a puppy to figure out that they’re supposed to poop on a walk. If you want to ensure that they relieve themselves outside, a short break in the crate may help. Only do this if your puppy is crate trained. You don’t want to force a pup into their crate or cause them distress."

When it comes to food, constipation tends to have more to do with a lack of fiber than the inclusion of any specific ingredients.

A little occasional constipation is no big deal, and dogs can actually hold their bowels for a surprisingly long time. However, if it has been over a day without your dog taking a bowel movement, take them to a vet. There are a variety of diseases or disorders that may make a puppy constipated and while it’s usually no big deal, it’s worth getting a checkup. [10] X Research source Try not to worry. It can take a while to get used to your puppy’s needs and constipation isn’t normally the end of the world. The odds are high that this is just a dietary issue. A vet may prescribe a stool softener, or perform an enema to relieve your pup. They’re likely going to suggest a change in diet, as well."
