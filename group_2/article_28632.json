      "content": "Gather your materials. Before you start creating your costumes, you will want to gather all of your materials. Gather: A skirt, petticoat, or tutu that fits you. Start with a solid cother like white or blue. Blue feathers or boas Hot glue gun Leggings and a tank top Craft mask or a homemade mask"

      "title": "Start with a petticoat, skirt, or tutu.",
      "content": "Start with a petticoat, skirt, or tutu. You will want to start with a solid color that will emphasize the blue of the feathers. You will want to pick the colors of a bluebird, such as blue or white. Avoid garish colors (green, orange, red)."

    {
      "title": "Attach the feather boas to the bottom of the skirt.",
      "content": "Attach the feather boas to the bottom of the skirt. Use a hot glue gun to attach the boa, starting from bottom hem and working toward the waistband. Apply a line of glue all the way around the bottom edge of the skirt and press the feather boa into the glue until the entire bottom edge is covered. Continue to wrap the boa upward in a loose spiral to create a feathered look. Note that if the petticoat or tutu has a fringe at the bottom, you should glue the feather boa above this fringe. Do not overlap the fringe with the boa. If you want a more elaborately feathered skirt, repeat this procedure with a second feather boa in a slightly different shade of blue. Glue this feather boa around the bottom of the skirt, directly above the boa at the bottom. You can repeat this once more with a third feather boa in yet another shade of blue. Let the glue dry before you continue."

      "title": "Create a simple mask that covers the eyes.",
      "content": "Create a simple mask that covers the eyes. Take a desired material (such as blue felt or poster board) and trace a mask around your eyes, forehead, and over the bridge of your nose. Cut the shape out. Make sure you cut holes large enough so that you can sufficiently see out of. Thread a piece of ribbon or elastic on the sides of the mask. You will want to poke a hole using a pair of scissors or hole puncher to do this. Or, to skip the above steps, you can purchase a simple craft mask at a craft store that you can then decorate."

      "title": "Adhere the feathers to the mask.",
      "content": "Adhere the feathers to the mask. Use hot glue. Do this when the mask is not on your face. [1] X Research source Start at the outside corner of one eye hole. Use a hot glue gun to glue the feathers so that they fan out diagonally from this corner. Move in toward the inner corner of the same eye hole. Glue more feathers so that they fan outward to the same side, overlapping the previous layer of feathers but not the eye hole itself. Repeat this procedure with the other side of the mask. Trim a few feathers down to 1 inch (2.5 cm) lengths. Glue these pieces in the center of the mask, covering the overlap space between the two previously feathered halves. Let dry."

      "content": "Put together the rest of the outfit. Now that you have the feathery parts done, you need to dress with a good foundation outfit. Try and stick with colors that will not stand out but will create a good background for your feathery accouterments. For example, you could try wearing a leotard to bring more attention to your craftiness. Or, try and wear leggings and a tank-top. You can wear simple black shoes, or if feeling more adventurous, try and mirror a bird's legs by wearing orange leggings/shoes."

      "content": "Combine all the elements. Everything should work together and you should look like a pretty blue bird! The blue feathered skirt corresponds to the bluebird's blue feathered tail, and the blue mask similarly corresponds to the bluebird's blue face. A chest of a bluebird is usually a mixture of tan and white, which is why a tan boa or white tank top may be used instead of blue ones. A blue shrug or sweater represents the blue wings of a bluebird."

Acquire: Brown, gray, and black fabric - enough to stretch from the finger on one hand to another. You want it wide enough to make a cape to attach feathers Additional fabric to create enough feathers to attach to your wings A circle template to make large enough hole for your head. A standard dinner plate is a good size Hot glue Ribbon or elastic Sewing machine or needle and thread A plain gray sweatshirt you do not mind cutting/gluing things to (cheap ones can be found in consignment shops or craft stores) Gray sweatpants A craft mask or a homemade cut-out mask from craft board, foam, or fabric"

From this, cut out a basic wing shape. [2] X Research source Position a dinner plate face-down over the center top of the fabric. Trace around half the edge using chalk, then cut this portion out. This dip will be positioned around your neck when you wear the wing cape. Place a straight edge at the corner of your neckline. Run it downward diagonally at a 20 degree angle (approximately) until you reach the edge of the cape. Trace this line and repeat on the other side. Cut along the two lines. This will be the top of your cape. Create a zig-zag line all around the bottom of the cape. Sketch out a half circle extending from one end of your wing to the other. Draw alternating triangles and inverse triangles around this curve until you reach the other side. Cut along this line. This completes the top wing of your wing cape."

Trace along the neckline and top edge of the wing using chalk, but extend the edge past that of your gray wing by the length of your triangular zig-zags. Cut along these lines, then make your zig-zag pattern on the bottom edge of the black wing. When you make the zig-zag pattern for this wing, the triangles and inverted triangles should alternate in opposite order. In other words, when you line up the two wings, you should see a black triangle in the gap left by every inverted gray triangle. [3] X Research source"

Sew one end of each piece to either corner of the neckline, on the side of the black wing. Each length of ribbon should be long enough to wrap around your neck once. Instead of sewing, you could attach the ribbon using a hot glue gun. This step completes your wing cape."

You will need to cut enough feathers from desired fabrics to completely cover this patch of material. [4] X Research source Cut out a patch of almond-shaped material for each feather. Each feather should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Divide the width of the shirt by 2 inches (5 cm). This number is the number of feathers you will need per row. Multiply the row count by three for your total number of black feathers. Multiply the row count by two for your total number of gray feathers."

You will alternate back and forth between black rows and gray rows, and should start and end with black rows. Start with the bottom row. The bottom of each feather should just barely extend below the bottom hem of the shirt. Gradually work your way up, row by row. The feathers of each row should slightly overlap those of the row below it. Line up each feather so that they lie side by side within each row."

[6] X Research source After cutting out the mask and the eye holes, cut out two rings made with gray craft foam. The inside of each ring should be large enough to fit around each eye hole.

Note that you need to draw the beak from a side view, rather than a top view. The base should be somewhat rectangular, but the beak itself should appear as a hooked or curved triangular shape. Your beak should be large enough to attach to your sweatshirt and make the hood of the black sweatshirt look like the bird’s head. The size may be dependent on if you are an adult or a kid."

Place the beak on the top of the hood, just above the opening, and sew the base of the beak onto the hood. Since felt doesn't fray, you do not need to turn the material inside-out as you work. Make sure that your seams are neat and even, however, to prevent the work from looking messy. The beak should be positioned in the center of the hood and should hang over the face area when you put the hood on your head."
