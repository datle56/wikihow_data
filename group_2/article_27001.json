Then, measure out 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of room-temperature water from the tap. Add the water to the glue and stir them together. [1] X Research source You can use a spoon, spatula, or craft stick for stirring. If you want to double the recipe, use 1 cup (240 ml) of clear PVA glue and 1 cup (240 ml) of room temperature water."

Then, measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of warm water and add it to the bowl with the Borax. Stir the ingredients until the Borax powder dissolves. [2] X Research source The Borax mixture will look a bit cloudy, but don't worry! The slime will be clear. If you're creating a double batch, use 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) of Borax powder."

Keep kneading the slime for several minutes until the consistency is exactly how you want it. [5] X Research source The longer you knead the slime, the more rubbery it will become. You can leave the slime in the bowl while you knead it. The slime will have a few air bubbles in it at this point, which is totally normal!"

If you want the air bubbles to go away so that the slime is crystal clear and looks like glass, don't play with it yet. Transfer it to a plastic zipper baggie or container with an airtight lid and let it sit for 1-2 days. [6] X Research source The longer you leave the slime in the container, the clearer it will become. Be sure to wash your hands before and after playing with the slime to keep it looking clear. The slime will last several weeks if you store it in an airtight container. Toss it out and make a new batch when it gets cloudy or dirty!"

If you want the slime to be absolutely clear, like glass, transfer it to an airtight container and let it sit for 3-5 days before playing with it. The longer you leave the slime in the container before playing with it, the clearer it will look. As long as you store your slime properly in a plastic baggie or airtight container after playing with it, it should last for several weeks! Throw away the slime once it starts looking dirty or cloudy."
