      "content": "Select a suitable paste. You can either make your own paste or use a ready-made paste. Plain flour and water makes an ideal paste and is non-toxic and made in a jiffy. See below for the recipe. Alternatively, you can use wallpaper paste as a ready-made solution - just follow the instructions on the package for making it. To make your own flour and water paste: [1] X Research source Add 1/2 a cup of flour and then a cup full of water. Mix until smooth. Create a thin paste that is about the consistency of double cream. Some recipe variants suggest adding one tablespoon of sugar to the mixture, though if you're going to do this, make sure to use plain (all purpose) flour."

      "title": "Cover the mould in petroleum jelly.",
      "content": "Cover the mould in petroleum jelly. Be sure to cover it thickly. This is important because it helps to get your project off the mould. If you don't have enough covering the mould, the project may break as you try to remove it. (Or if the shape affords it, cover with plastic wrap, making sure it is covered completely, securing it with tape, if necessary, in a place that won't be covered by the paper strips). [4] X Research source If using wallpaper paste, it will not stick to the plastic wrap."

      "content": "Leave the first layer to dry for an hour or two. After the mould is completely covered, prepare a second layer. Leave the double layered project overnight to dry. This will allow the base of the bowl to harden thoroughly. Keep in a warm, dry spot."

Repeat until the mould is covered with paper to about the depth of 1 - 2 cm (.39\" - .78 \"). [6] X Research source This may take many days for drying but it is an important step to ensure that the bowl retains it shape, strength and is not at risk of getting mildew from poor drying. Keep testing with your finger during the drying stages to check for any moist spots."
