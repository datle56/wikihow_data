      "content": "Pay attention to heartburn. The stomach is a very acidic environment because it must mix and break down food while fighting off harmful bacteria and viruses. Unfortunately, the esophagus cannot handle acidic material. A hiatal hernia can cause backflow of food into the esophagus, which results in a burning sensation. Since this occurs near the heart, it's called heartburn. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"
