      "content": "Combine vinegar, Epsom salt, and dish soap in a sprayer. Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of distilled white vinegar into a garden sprayer or spray bottle. Add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of liquid dish soap and 2 cups (546 g) of Epsom salt and stir the mixture to combine it. [1] X Research source Apple cider vinegar works in a pinch if you don’t have standard vinegar. [2] X Research source Household white vinegar usually contains 5% acetic acid, which works best on young weeds that have just sprouted. If you have older and more established weeds you’re trying to get rid of, use horticultural vinegar with 30-50% acetic acid. [3] X Research source Some horticultural vinegar needs to be diluted so it’s less likely to harm microbes or small animals in the soil. Follow the directions on the package, or use a mix of 4 parts vinegar to 1 part water. [4] X Research source If you don’t have Epsom salt, regular table salt works just as well. You can also leave the salt out of the recipe, though it may not be as effective."

      "title": "Spray the vinegar on the weeds on a warm, sunny day.",
      "content": "Spray the vinegar on the weeds on a warm, sunny day. Wait until the morning of a bright and sunny day so the vinegar weed killer is most effective. [5] X Research source Spray the weeds so the leaves are evenly coated with the vinegar solution. [6] X Research source Hold off on applying weed killer if it’s supposed to rain within the next 24 hours because it may rinse off and become ineffective. If you use a more concentrated horticultural vinegar, wear long sleeves, pants, gloves , and safety glasses since the liquid can cause irritation."

      "content": "Reapply vinegar after 2 weeks if the weeds survive. Large and perennial weeds may need additional treatments to completely kill the top growth. If the weeds you sprayed still look green and healthy, then spray them again with the vinegar solution on a sunny day. [7] X Research source If it rained, wait 1-2 days until the leaves are dry before you reapply the vinegar."

      "content": "Vinegar generally kills weeds within a few hours or within a few days. Vinegar starts breaking weeds down right away, so the smallest and youngest growths may be gone within 2 hours. Weeds that are a little larger may take a couple of days to completely wither and die out. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Vinegar is a non-selective herbicide, so it can kill any plant it comes into contact with. When you apply vinegar weed killer, use the “stream” setting on your spray bottle or sprayer so the solution is only directed at the plants that you want to get rid of. [9] X Research source Vinegar is a great choice for removing weeds from cracks in sidewalks and driveways because there’s less risk of harming other plants."

      "title": "Pull weeds by hand to remove the root.",
      "content": "Pull weeds by hand to remove the root. Wait until after it rains so the soil is soft and the roots are easier to pull out. Put on a pair of gardening gloves, pinch the weed as close to the soil as you can, and slowly pull the weed so the roots come out of the soil. Toss the weeds in a garbage bag so the seeds don’t spread anywhere else. [10] X Research source If you have trouble pulling weeds by hand or if you’re weeding a large area, then dig them out with a trowel , garden fork , or hoe ."

Then, slowly pour the water onto the weed that you want to get rid of. Pour the entire kettle onto the weed so it wilts and dies. [11] X Research source Reapply boiling water after 7 days if the weeds your treated are still alive. Boiling water will also kill grass and other plants it touches, so be careful where you pour it. Use boiling water to treat weeds growing in sidewalk cracks."

      "content": "Mow your lawn to stop weed growth in your yard. When you mow your lawn , the mower blades damage the leaves and stems of unwanted weeds as well. Damaged plants have a harder time competing for water and sunlight, so the weeds start to die out. [12] X Research source Weeds may still put up new shoots, but mowing them before they have a chance to grow prevents them from spreading more seeds."

      "content": "Cover weeded areas with cardboard and compost. “If the weeds are a real problem, put down overlapping layers of newspaper or put down overlapping layers of cardboard first,” says Barkan. He continues, “Then, building up with compost over the cardboard will smother the weeds.” Barkan notes this is especially important for preventing weeds in raised garden beds."

      "content": "Mulch over exposed soil to block weeds. Barkan explains that “ Mulching is a great strategy if you go very thick with your mulch. If you’re preventing weeds in landscape, add 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of mulch over the soil. The mulch blocks light from the weed seeds in the soil and keeps them from sprouting on the surface.

      "title": "Apply chemical herbicides sparingly.",
      "content": "Apply chemical herbicides sparingly. Chemical herbicides are either pre-emergent (used before the weeds sprout), or post-emergent (used for weeds that have already grown). Because the chemicals can drift onto other plants or run into the soil, avoid using them unless you’re unable to get rid of weeds using other techniques. [14] X Research source Many herbicides target specific types of weeds, so the one you use depends on what plants you’re trying to get rid of. Herbicides that contain glyphosate, such as Roundup , work for killing any type of weed, but they may also damage grasses and other plants you want to keep.

      "title": "Use solar sterilization to kill weed seeds the year before planting.",
      "content": "Use solar sterilization to kill weed seeds the year before planting. Barkan explains that “solar sterilization [is] killing the weeds using the heat of the sun and blocking sunlight from getting to the soil.” He recommends placing landscaping fabric over the soil the year before you intend on planting to kill all the weeds in the soil below it."

      "title": "How does vinegar work to kill weeds?",
      "content": "How does vinegar work to kill weeds? Vinegar contains acetic acid that burns through the waxy coating on plant leaves, which makes it easier for them to dry out. When the acid comes into contact with the foliage, the leaves start to brown and die off. [16] X Research source The added salt in vinegar weed killer is also toxic to plants and prevents them from absorbing other nutrients in the soil. [17] X Research source Dish soap helps the weed killer stick to the weeds better so it doesn’t drip or run off."

      "title": "What are the easiest weeds to kill with vinegar?",
      "content": "What are the easiest weeds to kill with vinegar? Vinegar is more effective against young weeds and annual growths that have more foliage. Broadleaf weeds are larger and have more surface area, so the vinegar stays on the leaves for a longer time. Vinegar is especially effective if the leaves angle up and away from the stem. Some common weeds you can kill with vinegar include: [18] X Research source Crabgrass Foxtail Ragweed Dandelion Plantain Chickweed Mugwort Wood sorrel Quackgrass"

      "title": "Does vinegar kill weeds permanently?",
      "content": "Does vinegar kill weeds permanently? Vinegar can completely kill small, young weeds that are annual growths. However, vinegar mostly kills leaves and foliage, but it won’t reach the roots of older and more established plants. Unless you remove or kill the roots, there’s a chance the weeds will come back.

      "title": "Does vinegar affect the soil?",
      "content": "Does vinegar affect the soil? Acetic acid in vinegar doesn’t stay in the soil, but it may still kill helpful microbes and beneficial insects when you first apply it. Additionally, using a lot of vinegar can change the pH of your soil so it’s more acidic, which may affect how well some plants grow. [20] X Research source Frequently test the soil's pH using a pH probe or test strips to make sure it’s within the required range for the plants you want to grow. If your soil is too acidic, you can adjust the pH by mixing in lime , baking soda, or wood ash . The salt in vinegar weed killer stays in the soil and can make it difficult for new plants to grow."

      "title": "How do you store vinegar weed killer?",
      "content": "How do you store vinegar weed killer? Keep the vinegar solution in a sealed container with a lid. Label the container “vinegar weed killer” so you know what it is at a glance. Keep the container wherever you store other lawn or gardening products, like a garage, closet, or shed. Avoid keeping the vinegar weed killer in your sprayer because it could damage metal parts over time. Empty your sprayer and run clean water through it when you’re finished spraying for the season."
