      "content": "Examine your fake nails each morning for signs of damage. Make it part of your morning routine to check out each nail. Look at and feel each nail to see if any are starting to come loose. If you notice an issue, apply a small dot of glue as a touch-up before you start your day. Note the date when you applied your press-ons, so you know when it might be time to remove them. After 2 or 3 weeks you should take them off as they'll have started to grow out."

      "content": "Carry nail glue and a nail buffer with you at all times. If a nail pops off, use the glue to secure it back in place right away. This will preserve your overall manicure since you won't feel the need to remove your fake nails prematurely after one comes off. [2] X Research source Bring a nail buffer so that you can buff down the surface of your nail plate before reattachment. Consider also carrying a travel-sized nail polish remover pad. You can use this to wipe off any glue that remains before reapplying the nail."

      "content": "Moisturize your cuticles daily to keep them soft, healthy, and attractive. As your nails start to grow out, a little gap will form between the base of the fake nail and your natural nail fold. Dry cuticles will draw attention to this gap. Massage a dot of cuticle oil into your cuticles once a day to keep them healthy and hydrate the nail plate as it grows out. [3] X Research source Keeping your cuticles moisturized will also help prevent hangnails. [4] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. You can also moisturize your hands with lotion to keep your skin soft and supple, and to better show off your nails."

If you're careful, you can keep your fake nails on for weeks. Whether you're getting dressed, using your keys, or lifting objects, use slow and deliberate hand movements.

      "content": "Soak your fingertips in warm water or acetone to remove the fake nails. Follow the instructions on the glue you used for the correct procedure. You'll typically just need to soak the nails in a bowl of warm water, acetone, or another product that's compatible with the adhesive. After soaking, the glue will have dissolved and the nails will come off. [9] X Research source Don't peel or pop the fake nails off.

You can pick out an inexpensive set, especially if you're experimenting with different looks. Choose a set that covers the whole fingernail, not just the tips.

      "content": "Pick fake nails that match the width and curve of your natural nails. The fake nails in press-on sets come in multiple widths from 9 to 18 mm (0.35 to 0.71 in). Measure your natural nails to see if yours are on the narrower or wider sides of the spectrum, or somewhere in the middle. Try to find fake nails that mimic the curve of your fingernails, whether they're mostly flat or have a pronounced arch. Place a tape measure or ruler across the widest part of your nail to gauge the width. The nail size is often printed on the back of the nail. Once you find the right sizes for each fingernail, write them down or make a note in your phone for future reference! [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick short or extra-short fake nails instead of long nails. Fake nails come in a variety of lengths, from extra-short and short to medium, long, and extra-long. The sizes aren't generally identified by a numerical length, but the shortest possible set will last longest. Choose press-ons that barely extend past the pad of your fingertip. [13] X Research source Shorter press-ons can be just as stylish as long, pointy talons. They'll be more durable and practical for everyday wear. You're less likely to risk having a short fake nail pop off when you do your laundry, for instance. But it's easy to get a long nail caught on something, especially if you're not used to having long nails."

      "content": "Choose a set of nails with rounded or square tips. Fake nails come in a variety of shapes, from square and oval (or “squoval” ) to more fanciful shapes like almond, stiletto, and coffin. Pick tips that closely relate to natural nail shapes, such as rounded or square tips, to extend the lifespan of your fake nails. Square-tipped nails can be easily re-shaped and rounded out, whereas oval nails can't be reshaped or squared off as easily. [14] X Research source Steer clear of pointed nail shapes like stiletto, coffin, and almond press-ons. The sharp tips can more easily catch on things and you'll risk dislodging a nail. Pointed nail tips also require more length, but this will shorten the lifespan of your press-ons."

While adhesive strips can be useful for keeping fake nails on for a short period of time, a professional grade liquid nail glue will help keep your press-ons in place for weeks. [15] X Research source Look at the packaging to make sure the glue is compatible with the type of nails you've selected, and consider the pros and cons of different drying times. If you're new to the process of applying fake nails, select a glue with a slower setting time so that you can make last-minute adjustments.

Make sure to eliminate any residue left from previous nail treatments as well. Nail polish remover will dry out your nails a little, but that will actually help the glue for the new nails stick better. If you wash your hands after removing the old polish, dry them thoroughly and spray a dehydrator spray on your nails before applying any nail glue."

Once you've matched a fake nail to each fingernail, rest it on top of your natural nail to make sure it's longer than your natural nails. Your natural fingernails shouldn't stick out beneath the fake ones, so trim them down with nail scissors as needed. Follow up by buffing down jagged edges with an emery board."

Apply gentle pressure with the cuticle pusher and press the cuticles towards your nail fold. The clear strip of skin should be pressed back at the nail fold, rather than extending far across your nail plate. Don't apply cuticle oil at this stage as it can interfere with nail glue."

      "content": "Use a nail buffer to add texture to the surface of your nail plate. The hard, top part of your nail, known as the nail plate, is typically smooth but will hold onto fake nails better if you roughen up the texture slightly. Gently go over the surface of your nail with the coarsest side of a 3-way nail buffer to add a little texture. Don't use a harsh nail file or emery board, since this can damage your nails."

      "title": "File each fake nail down to match the shape of your natural nails.",
      "content": "File each fake nail down to match the shape of your natural nails. Use a metal nail file to buff down the sides and bases of the press-ons until they perfectly match the shape and curve of your natural nail bed. Then, file down the tips to achieve your desired shape and length. You can use nail scissors to trim down tips that are too long. For the smoothest finish, use a nail file that's about 180 grit. If it's too rough, you could end up with ragged edges on your nails. [17] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. If it seems like you need to do a lot of filing and shaping to customize the nails, consider looking for another style or brand that provides a better fit right out of the box.

Working with one finger at a time, squeeze a small dot of glue first onto the underside of the fake nail and then onto your nail plate. Place the glue in the center of each natural and fake nail. Within the inside of the press-on, apply the dot of glue where your natural nail will sit. Try not to get any glue on the tips where the fake nail will extend past your natural nail."

      "content": "Press the fake nail onto your fingernail, sliding it towards your nail bed. Apply steady pressure to disperse the glue between the natural and fake nail. Push the nail towards your nail bed, lining it up without any free space. This way, you won't see a gap when your nail starts to grow out. Work quickly if you've chosen a quick-dry glue. Or, if you've opted for a slower-setting formula, make any necessary adjustments and then leave your finger alone to prevent accidentally nudging the fake nail out of alignment."

      "title": "Allow the glue to dry completely before moving onto the next nail.",
      "content": "Allow the glue to dry completely before moving onto the next nail. The glue must set completely before you use your hands. For the best results, allow each nail to set completely before moving on to the next finger. Refer to the instructions on the glue for drying times. Finish your entire hand and then move onto the next one. Refrain from touching anything (including your phone!) while the glue is setting. You can set up a TV show or some music before applying the first nail so you don't feel tempted to mess with the controls."

      "content": "Paint on a clear hardener topcoat once all the nails have set. Press-on nails are prone to bending. To prevent this, apply one coat of a press-on nail hardener product over the fake nails. Its clear, glossy surface will give your nails a nice glossy finish.
