      "content": "Make sure that your modem will work with your Internet subscription. While rare, some modems encounter issues when paired with a specific Internet company (e.g., Comcast). Double-check your modem's compatibility with your current Internet subscription before buying (if possible). Calling your ISP is usually the best bet to figure this out. If you find that your modem won't work with your current subscription, try to exchange the modem for a different one that will work, or switch your Internet subscription."

      "title": "Decide on a place to mount the modem.",
      "content": "Decide on a place to mount the modem. The modem should be relatively high up (e.g., on top of a bookshelf), and it will need to be close enough to the cable output that you can connect it without stretching or bending the cable. You'll also need to have a power outlet nearby."

      "title": "Make sure that you have all of the required cables.",
      "content": "Make sure that you have all of the required cables. A modem generally requires a coaxial cable to connect to the cable output, as well as a power cable to connect to an electrical outlet. Both of these cables should come with your modem, but if you bought it used, you may need to find replacement cables. [2] X Research source If you plan on attaching the modem to a router, you will also need an Ethernet cable. Consider buying a longer coaxial cable if the one that you have is too short to allow you to mount your modem properly."

      "content": "Attach the modem to a router. If you have a Wi-Fi router that you want to use in conjunction with your modem, plug one end of an Ethernet cable into the square port on the back of the modem, then plug the other end into the \"INTERNET\", \"WAN\", or similarly labeled square port on the back of the router. As long as the router is plugged into a power source, the router should immediately light up. Give your modem and router at least five minutes to boot up before attempting to connect to Wi-Fi . You can also connect your computer directly to your modem via Ethernet if you have an Ethernet port enabled computer (ex. A PC or Ethernet Adapter for most Macs)"
