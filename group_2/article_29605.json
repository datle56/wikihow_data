      "content": "Buy about 4 to 5 yards (3.7 to 4.6 m) of tulle or crinoline. This should be enough for most petticoats. Crinoline is stiff and typically comes in white, although sometimes you can find it in black too. It is great if you want structure and volume. Tulle comes in more colors, but it isn't as stiff as crinoline. It's a better option if you want something that looks pretty. [1] X Research source If you want less volume at the top of the skirt, consider using chiffon for the top tier. The fabric is smooth and will feel more comfortable too. [2] X Research source You can also use taffeta if you want to give the skirt more volume. [3] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 16 June 2021."

      "content": "Measure the length of your skirt and subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm). Find the skirt or dress that you want to wear over the petticoat. Measure the skirt from the waist seam down to the bottom hem. Subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) and remember this new measurement; you'll use it in the next step. [4] X Research source If you are wearing the petticoat with a dress that does not have a waist seam, measure down from the narrowest part of the waist instead. Petticoats are typically 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter than the skirt or dress worn over them."

      "content": "Divide your measurement by 3, then add 1 inch (2.5 cm) for the seams. This will give you the width for each of the 3 tiers on your petticoat. For example, if your skirt is 25 inches (64 cm) long, your petticoat would be 24 inches (61 cm) long. Divided by 3, each tier would be 8 inches (20 cm) wide. After you add 1 inch (2.5 cm) for the seams, the final width will be 9 inches (23 cm). [5] X Research source"

You will need 1 2-yard (1.8-m) piece for the top tier, 1 4-yard (3.7-m) piece for the middle tier, and 2 4-yard (3.7-m) pieces for the bottom tier. You will be sewing the 2 4-yard (3.7-m) pieces together for the bottom tier. [6] X Research source Use your width measurement from the previous step for the width of the strips.

When you are done, you'll have a strip that is about 8 yards (7.3 m) long. [7] X Research source Match the thread color to the fabric as closely as possible.

Fold the ribbon over the bottom edge of your fabric strip and secure it with pins. Sew the ribbon to the strip as close to the edge as possible. Use a thread color that matches the ribbon and a straight stitch. You'll have a 1/2-inch (1.3-cm) ribbon hem when you are done. [8] X Research source Remember to remove the pins and to backstitch. For a nicer look, use a ribbon color that matches the fabric. This step is not absolutely necessary, but it will give your petticoat a nicer finish and prevent it from the hem feeling scratchy against your legs. [9] X Research source"
