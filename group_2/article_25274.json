      "title": "Damaged mufflers may emit dangerous gases.",
      "content": "Damaged mufflers may emit dangerous gases. If the muffler has a hole, it can cause dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide to leak into the cabin of a vehicle. This colorless, odorless gas is a product of the combustion process. Mild exposure to carbon monoxide can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Prolonged carbon monoxide exposure can lead to unconsciousness and death. [1] X Research source Additionally, many homeowners' associations, cities, restaurants, and apartment complexes have laws against loud noises from defective mufflers. If you have a broken muffler, you may face fines or refusal of service until you get the muffler fixed. A damaged muffler can also cause a car trip to be noisy and uncomfortable."

      "content": "Use a car jack to raise the car and examine the muffler. [3] X Research source Inspect the muffler for any holes and rust. Visible rust on the outside may indicate an even worse problem on the inside of the muffler. Look for water dripping, as well; if it’s dripping from several places, holes may have formed from rust. Minor surface rust may be normal if it does not penetrate the metal. Some condensation does occur inside a muffler, and some manufacturers include a small drain hole."

      "content": "A damaged muffler could cause the engine to overheat. Check the engine’s temperature after the car has run a while. If the car overheats, it may mean there are problems with your car's exhaust system. If the muffler is damaged or has come apart, this could cause a partial blockage and cause the engine to overheat or lose power. Take your car to a mechanic if you suspect your car has a defective muffler."
