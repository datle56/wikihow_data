      "content": "Head the ball. Your risk for head injuries increases when you passively allow the ball to hit you. When the ball arrives within heading distance, you need to propel yourself towards the ball in order to actively hit it. This series of movements begins at your hips: As you bend forward at the hips, thrust your head and chin forwards and drive your arms backwards. Hit the ball with the center of your forehead along your hairline. In a game situation, you may need to jump up to reach the ball. [3] X Research source"

Offensive headers used to place the ball low in the goal; diving headers are executed when the ball is too far out in front of your foot to kick with any appreciable force; glancing headers are used to fake out the goalie. [11] X Research source Offensive headers: Effective offensive headers are kept low and directed towards the ground. Head the ball down and away from the goalie. Diving headers: When you dive towards the ball, the momentum of your entire body propels the ball towards its target. As you dive at the ball, focus on contacting the ball with your forehead and directing the ball towards the goal. Try to land the dive on your chest and arms. Do not break the fall with your wrists. Glancing header: This cross-body header is used to fake out goalies. In order to execute this header effectively, you must learn how to direct the ball with your forehead. If you want to head the ball to the left, try to hit the right side of the ball; if you want to head the ball to the right, try to hit the left side of the ball. Do not use the side of your head to hit the ball. [12] X Research source"
