Are there any local noise ordinances that might interfere with your work? Do you need permits to do anything? How close are you to a residential area? Will loud noise be an issue? Make sure you are not violating any local noise ordinances or HOA rules. If you are renting, are there any specific rules you need to follow? Are you allowed to use your space for commercial uses? Do you need to do anything to isolate the sound to prevent noise complaints?"

      "content": "Consider what you will be using your studio for. Think about what your goals are and what you want to do with your studio. Consider the following: Space: Do you need space to record live bands or choirs, or do you just need some space to compose and do some vocal work? Equipment: How much equipment do you need? Do you need space for a mixer board? What gear do you already have? Do you need space for a drum kit or a grand piano? Do you have a stack of amplifiers? How many mics and cables do you need? Where will you store all of this? Special considerations: Are there any technical specifications you need (i.e., sound isolation, reverberation, frequency responses, etc.)? Workflow: What do you imagine yourself doing on a typical day? Will you be recording a live band? Will you spend most of your days mixing and engineering?"

      "content": "Set a budget. Now that you have some goals in mind, it’s time to start setting a budget. Keep in mind that building a studio almost always costs more than you expect. Be willing to adjust your goals to fit your budget. Be prepared to go a little above what you want to spend, and keep your goals realistic. When you are starting out, you may not have the budget for the most state-of-the-art equipment. That’s okay because your first clients probably won’t have the budget for a top-of-the-line studio either. All of that will come in time. \"All recording studios have different prices,\" says Adams. \"The best thing I can say is you get what you pay for.\""

      "title": "Find a good location.",
      "content": "Find a good location. The best recording studios are in windowless, well-insulated rooms. Depending on the size of the group you want to record, the room should at least be able to hold a small table or desk for your computer and interface. There should also be room for the performers and, possibly, a small room for an isolated vocal booth. Avoid rooms with lots of outside noise. Aim for the quietest space possible. You don’t want a great take interrupted by your neighbor’s lawnmower. In general, bigger is better. You should try to find a room that won’t be too cramped. Make sure it has space for several musicians and all their gear. Pay attention to the floor. Ideal rooms will have hardwood, concrete, or tile flooring, which is better for acoustics. Carpeting will absorb high-frequency sounds but not low ones. [1] X Research source It may also get worn down by high foot traffic. Pick a room with good overall acoustics. This usually means a larger room with fairly high ceilings, asymmetrical walls, and irregular surfaces for sound dispersion."

      "title": "Consider a suite of rooms, if possible.",
      "content": "Consider a suite of rooms, if possible. Full-scale recording studios usually have at least two rooms for production. One of these is called the “live room,” and another is the control room. [2] X Research source There may also be one or more small rooms called booths or “isolation booths” for vocals, horns, woodwinds, and other acoustic solo instruments. In professional studios, musicians perform in the \"live room.\" It is usually separate from the \"booth,\" where single musicians or vocalists can be acoustically isolated for very clean takes. The engineer does the recording, editing, and mixing of the takes in the control room. In many homes, suite setups won't be possible. You may only have space for a live room. At most, you may be limited to a small live room and control room. Closets can often be converted into small isolation booths as well."

      "title": "Map out the basic setup.",
      "content": "Map out the basic setup. There's more to a recording studio than just microphones and musicians. In most studios, there are two major systems. You’ll need to understand and organize these according to your interests and the projects you intend to record. The recording system. This takes in audio from instruments and microphones and records it either digitally (using a computer or digital recorder) or to tape. The monitoring system. This includes an amplifier and speakers for the musicians and recording engineer to listen to the recording as it is being performed, as well as after the recording to do mixing and editing. [3] X Research source You can set up a home recording studio on a pretty small budget. At the very least, you’ll need a computer, a DAW, an audio interface, studio monitors, one set of headphones, one mic, a few cables, and one mic stand. You can put together a basic setup for about $400. You probably don’t want to go much lower, though, or the music quality will suffer."

      "content": "See if any renovations need to be done. Once you have found a suitable space, see if there’s anything that needs fixing or renovating. If it doesn’t have a production room, you may need to build a divider wall. If it doesn’t have a vocal isolation booth, you may need to make one. You may also need to do some additional soundproofing. Test to see how far sound travels from the outside. If you are too close to a residential area, you may get noise complaints, which can shut you down. If it’s too noisy outside, you may need to build additional walls to isolate the sound. Make sure there are no damp or crumbling walls. You don’t want anything that could be a health hazard or that may damage your equipment. Make sure your studio space is secure. You are going to be storing thousands of dollars worth of equipment in this space. Musicians will also be trusting you with their equipment. Make sure you are able to keep all this safe and secure so it doesn’t get stolen."

      "content": "Design a signal pathway. In the professional world, audio systems of any kind can be illustrated by drawing a signal path. This follows the audio signal from beginning to end to show the user exactly what is being done to the sound in a particular system. For a typical beginner’s studio, the signal path follows a basic plan. The signal starts at the input source (i.e., the instruments and microphones). From there, it goes to a recording interface—a device that plugs into a computer and converts the analog sound waves into digital data. From the computer interface, the signal will go into the digital audio workstation (DAW) software. It is here that the recorded sound can be edited or mixed. The signal next goes into an audio or recording interface to be returned into an analog signal. Lastly, the analog signal comes out through the monitor system."

      "content": "Decorate your studio. This may seem trivial, but you don’t want your studio space to feel sterile and clinical. You are going to be spending hours a day here. You want your space to be comfortable and inviting. You don’t have to spend a ton of money. A decent paint job, some basic wall decorations, maybe some string lighting, and some furniture from IKEA will go a long way."

      "title": "Choose recording software.",
      "content": "Choose recording software. All modern recording studios use computer software to edit audio. Digital audio workstations (DAWs) vary greatly from one maker to the next, but one is usually included with the purchase of a recording interface. Mac users benefit from the inclusion of GarageBand on modern Macs, while PC users can use one of many free alternatives like the free version of Pro Tools, Pro Tools Intro. Linetsky uses Ableton Live's unique Session view feature to build and arrange his ideas. Pro Tools Artist is another common DAW. It is a basic home recording program with limited features. Pro Tools Studio and Pro Tools Ultimate are professional-grade recording programs and have become something of the standard for commercial studios. [4] X Research source Other DAWs include Cubase, Logic Pro, Ableton Live, Adobe Audition, FL Studio, and Reaper."

      "content": "Get a computer that is suitable for music production. You’ll need a computer with decent hardware for audio recording capabilities. Check the recommended system specs for your DAW and make sure your computer meets (or surpasses) those requirements. At the very minimum, you will need a PC with: 64-bit operating system Intel, AMD or ARM processor with at least 4 cores, preferably 6 or 8, released in the last 7 years At least 8 GB of RAM, preferably 16 GB or more Plenty of USB ports (at least USB 3) At least 500 GB of storage space Some external storage space to save your projects It's important to have a separate computer for recording. Don't use your personal computer with all your pictures, games, and music on it. DAWs require a lot of space."

      "title": "Select an interface for your studio.",
      "content": "Select an interface for your studio. Audio interfaces are also called AD/DA Converters, which stands for “Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog.” These interfaces convert analog sound into a digital signal to be processed by your computer and turn the digital audio back into analog sound on the monitors. They are an essential part of any good recording studio. Some entry-level interfaces include Emu’s 1212M, ESI’s Julia, and M-Audio’s Audiofile 192. These models offer quality sound for a modest price. [5] X Research source A good quality recording interface typically costs around $150. Monitors (such as the immensely popular KRK Rokit series) start at roughly $300 for a pair. Higher-grade interfaces like the Focusrite and Audiofire series, Fireface 400 and 800, and Lynx models will cost more, up to a couple of thousand dollars. Linetsky uses a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 to record and produce his music."

      "title": "Get some high-quality microphones.",
      "content": "Get some high-quality microphones. Typically, most recording studios have some combination of dynamic and condenser microphones for performers to use. Dynamic mics are better for louder sounds and are more durable. They are used for guitar amps, drums, and other loud sources. Condensers are more delicate and expensive but also more detailed, bright, and clear-sounding than similarly priced dynamics. A good dynamic or condenser microphone costs $80-$200. Shure mics are a popular brand. Your recording interface needs phantom power if you're using a condenser mic. This is usually a button or switch labeled \"+48\" and powers the electronics inside the microphone. If this feature is not available, most microphone preamplifiers can supply power and will be more affordable than buying a new interface. Dynamic mics do not require power. They can simply be plugged into an interface and used with no preamplifier. In some cases, they sound better with a preamp, however. Some mics also have USB outputs. While these can be plugged straight into a computer, they tend to be of lower quality. Electric instruments will also plug straight into a DI unit or Direct box, which connects to the computer via USB."

      "content": "Look into audio plug-ins. Can't afford the best amps, synths, and effects? VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plug-ins are software modules that expand the functionality of your DAW. Most DAWs are compatible with VST plug-ins and often come with a couple of their own. VST plug-ins can add various audio effects, such as reverb, delay, EQ, autotune, virtual guitar amps, and more. VSTi plug-ins have a MIDI input that allows you to add MIDI sounds and voices. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Have some musical instruments on hand.",
      "content": "Have some musical instruments on hand. Most studios assume musicians want to play their own gear to get a more accurate recording. However, it’s a good idea to have a couple of instruments on hand as a backup in case they forget or if something malfunctions. Try having a variety of gear around. Amps, effects pedals, and guitars are good. You can also invest in a guitar amp VST plug-in set, such as Neural DSP. If you have more money, also consider keyboards and synthesizers, drums, or even a piano. Have a few different guitar types for different styles. If you are going to be creating music in a purely software instrument environment, it is advantageous to have a USB MIDI keyboard or controller, as these will give you the tactile feel of a musical instrument such as a piano, which can greatly aid creativity."

      "title": "Be frugal when buying gear.",
      "content": "Be frugal when buying gear. Like music itself, music production is an art and not a science. The price tag on your gear does not always lead to better quality. Low-end equipment in today's amateur home studios would have been unthinkable to top studio engineers just a few decades ago. Get what you need first. You can always add more equipment or upgrade your equipment later on. You can record radio bangers on a home studio setup. Expensive gear can lead to great recordings, but don't let that hold you back from making great music. Take advantage of free software. Native Instruments, Ohmforce, Camel Audio, SSL, and other respected audio companies offer free virtual instruments and effects. Consider using old analog gear. Most studios are digital these days, but the really good ones still have analog gear you can work into your rig. If you want to put your studio on the map, consider adding a plate reverb unit or a reel-to-reel tape machine. You can record on one of these and bounce the audio into your DAW when you're done. These kinds of sounds can't be replicated digitally. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Soundproof the live room.",
      "content": "Soundproof the live room. Soundproofing does two things: It makes the room quieter by blocking out outside noise, and also improves the sound quality on a recording by absorbing excess acoustic ambiance. [8] X Research source Professional soundproofing can be expensive. Acoustic foam or panels work if you have money to spend but may run you significant costs for a large studio. One inexpensive way to reduce sound is in the selection of the studio space. Try to select a live room without windows and with heavy, thick walls or thick insulation. [9] X Research source If you are on a budget, get some blankets or foam padding to cover up any windows and doors to reduce background noise. Adding mass to the walls, like foam, also helps to increase the room’s sound absorption. This should reduce echoes."

      "title": "Prepare a vocal booth",
      "content": "Prepare a vocal booth . Most studios set aside space specifically for vocals. Vocals can be hard to record. They should be recorded standing up, which makes it easier for the singer to sustain a good sound. The mic should also be at a comfortable height. The vocal booth is an isolation booth, so it should be acoustically isolated. Make sure to soundproof it as best you can. The mic itself should have a pop filter to protect it from saliva and to filter out sharp sounds called plosives, which are usually caused by hard P, T, and S sounds. If you don't have a pop filter, you can buy one for $10 or $20 , or try making a pop filter yourself . If your mic is directional so that only one side picks up sound, turn it so the side of the mic is facing the vocalist. His mouth should be about 10-15 cm away from the mic when singing. This distance shouldn't be altered too much, as it will cause the recording to sound off."

      "title": "Set up the instrumentalists in the live room.",
      "content": "Set up the instrumentalists in the live room. You'll want mics to be just far enough from the sound source (i.e., acoustic instruments or amplifiers) so that they don't hinder the musicians. This typically doesn't involve a pop filter of any kind. If you have a small instrumental mic, use that. Instructions are usually included in the user manual. Use component mics or a single mic above the drums. Recording drums will vary according to the type of sound you want and what kind of gear the musicians come with. The best drum sound comes from single mics that clip onto individual components. You can then put these on the same channel in the DAW."
