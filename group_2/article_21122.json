      "content": "Get the attention of a guy on the dance floor. Unless you already know the guy you want to dance with and he’s led you to the dance floor, you'll have to hit the dance floor on your own first. You can take a trusted friend or two with you so you’re more comfortable, or just do your own thing. [1] X Research source The key is to look like you’re having fun to catch someone’s eye and encourage them to dance with you. To show interest in a guy , give him a few quick or medium-length glances. You can tell he’s interested if he looks back, smiles, or keeps glancing at you. [2] X Research source Don't look around like you're desperate to dance with someone, even if you've found your target. Instead, let the guys see what a great time you're having, and they'll come to you!"

      "content": "Move closer to the guy and “accidentally” bump into him. Once you've found your guy, and maybe even locked eyes with him from across the room, you and your friends can start moving closer to him. Make this a natural, gradual move, and wait for him to come closer to you. Keep dancing, making eye contact , and giving him occasional smiles to show interest. If you’re feeling bold, you can “accidentally” bump into him to make the first move. [3] X Research source Make your way over to him during the course of a song. Maintain a little distance as you move closer so you don’t crowd the guy."

    {
      "title": "Brush up against the guy to communicate that you want to grind.",
      "content": "Brush up against the guy to communicate that you want to grind. If the guy hasn’t approached you or directly asked you to dance at this point, you have to initiate things. Step in front of him so you lock eyes, then spend a minute dancing in front of him. You can let your body brush against him by dancing super close and then pulling away slightly, or by lightly brushing against his arms or shoulders. Move to the beat and slowly turn so he can start dancing behind you. [4] X Research source If he still doesn’t get the memo, you can be direct and say something like, “You’re cute! Want to dance?” or “I love this song. Do you want to dance together?”"

    {
      "title": "Position yourself in front of the guy, facing away from him.",
      "content": "Position yourself in front of the guy, facing away from him. Typically, the guy stands right behind the girl and puts his hands on her hips while grinding. However, you can leave a few inches to a foot between your bodies if you don’t know him or don’t want to get too raunchy. [5] X Research source You can also tilt your upper body away from your partner so it doesn’t feel so intimate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your knees and sway to the beat.",
      "content": "Bend your knees and sway to the beat. Both you and the guy should bend your knees slightly so you’re able to swing your hips and grind against each other. Move back and forth, swaying your hips to the same beat as your partner. Keep an eye on their hips and shoulders to get in sync with them quickly. Grinding is all about following your partner’s lead and having fun. “Following [them] can help you feel more confident when you are dancing,” according to professional dancer and instructor William Orrock."

    {
      "title": "Move your hips and butt in a circular motion.",
      "content": "Move your hips and butt in a circular motion. Following your partner’s lead, rotate your hips and butt in a continuous circular motion, keeping your knees slightly bent at all times. Your hips should move in the same direction as your partner’s. If you're feeling bold, you can touch the his pelvic area with your butt as you move it from side to side. [6] X Research source However, you set the rules and control how far things go! “You can get better at rolling your hips by practicing a figure 8 motion,” says Orrock. “Keep your hip rotations between the width of your shoulders and more side to side, and tilt your pelvis forward and backward to understand how to move directions.”"

      "title": "Move your arms and chest to the beat of the music.",
      "content": "Move your arms and chest to the beat of the music. Look ahead or slightly down as you work your arms and chest, moving your hips in sync with your partner. You can bring your arms down so they’re on your knees or near your waist, or wait for your partner’s hands to land on top of yours or around your waist as you continue to dance. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Move from side to side to bump and grind.",
      "content": "Move from side to side to bump and grind. Dance to the left, continuing your circular motions, while the guy moves to the right, so you can look up and see him. You can switch places and move to the right while he moves to the left, and keep moving back and forth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn around and face your partner while you grind.",
      "content": "Turn around and face your partner while you grind. Turn around to face the guy, instead of turning your back to him, and place your arms around his neck. This is called front grinding—it's a little raunchier and sexier. Let him put his hands on your hips as you continue to move your waist in a circular motion. Move your hands away from his neck and up and down his chest. Then, turn back around again. You can even place your fingers in the guy’s belt loops for a few seconds to spice things up!"

    {
      "title": "Get low and touch the floor as you grind.",
      "content": "Get low and touch the floor as you grind. If your back is to the guy, move your hands down to the floor (or near it), while slowly raising your butt higher in the air. This is an intimate move that will make any guy go crazy, as long as you feel confident and you’re having fun!"

    {
      "title": "Perform a slower grind to be more sensual.",
      "content": "Perform a slower grind to be more sensual. Don't be intimidated if a slower song comes on at the club—you can use the same moves you used to grind to fast-paced music, just at a slower speed! The slow grind is even sexier if you lock eyes over your shoulder or place your hands on top of your partner’s. To make things hotter, put more pressure on your partner while grinding."
