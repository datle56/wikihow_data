      "content": "Combine the yeast with water, sugar and flour and leave to rise. In a medium sized bowl, measure in the yeast and mix in a pinch of sugar, a pinch of flour and ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of warm water. Leave the yeast in the bowl to rise for about ten minutes. The sugar and flour help the yeast to rise. When the yeast rises, it will expand and have a foamy texture."

      "content": "Combine the flour, sugar, cardamom, coconut milk and yeast mixture. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients, excluding the cooking oil. The mixture should form a dough. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Knead the dough with your hands.",
      "content": "Knead the dough with your hands. Take the dough out of the bowl and kneed it on a clean counter or cutting board. Kneed gently for a minimum of 15-20 minutes until all the ingredients are incorporated and the dough is soft and smooth. [2] X Research source If the dough is still sticky, it means that you should continue kneading."

    {
      "title": "Leave the dough to rise.",
      "content": "Leave the dough to rise. After kneading the dough, place it back inside the large bowl and cover it with a clean cloth. Leave the dough to rise in a warm place for around eight hours, or overnight. This gives the dough enough time to fully rise. [3] X Research source When the dough is double its original size, it means that it has finished rising. If you live in a warm or tropical area, the dough may only need a couple hours to rise. Keep checking on the size of your dough if you are unsure how long you should leave it."

      "title": "Divide the dough into five balls.",
      "content": "Divide the dough into five balls. After the dough has finished rising completely, divide it into five equally sized balls. Treat the dough with a light hand and do your best not to squash or over-handle it. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Coat the dough balls with flour and let them rise. After you have made your five balls of dough, sprinkle flour on a counter or cutting board and gently roll the balls in the flour to coat them. Then cover the balls with a clean cloth and let the dough rise for 15 minutes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll out each ball and shape them into circles. Sprinkle more flour onto the cutting board, then use a rolling pin to roll each ball until flat. The flattened balls should now roughly look like circles. Use your hands to cup and shape the dough into circles if they are misshapen. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the dough circles into quarters. Use a sharp knife to cut each circle into quarters. You will have 20 triangular pieces of dough, which you will now fry up and make into your mahamri."

      "content": "Pour the oil into a wide, deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the dough is prepared, pour the cooking oil into a deep frying pan. Make sure to pour at least three inches of oil into the pan. Try to use a cooking oil with a high smoke point that is meant to be used in deep frying. Peanut oil, for example, has a high smoke point, while olive and vegetable oil do not."

      "title": "Test the oil.",
      "content": "Test the oil. When frying mahamri, it’s essential that the oil is hot enough to properly fry the dough. To test whether or not the oil has heated completely, tear off a small corner of dough from one of the triangles and drop it into the pan. If the dough stays at the bottom of the pan for a couple seconds, then comes to the surface of the oil and starts to puff up, the oil is hot enough for frying. [7] X Research source If the scrap of dough immediately rises to the top of the oil after you drop it in the pan and does not change size, you will need to keep heating the oil. Check after another five minutes to see whether the oil is ready."
