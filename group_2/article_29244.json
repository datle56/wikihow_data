      "content": "Add your second flat sheet on top of the blanket. Lay it with the finished side facing down toward the mattress. Align the top of this sheet with the placement of the first sheet at the top of the mattress. [4] X Research source The top of the sheet should align with the edge of the mattress at the headboard. Flatten the top sheet with your hands and pull it taut at all corners. This decorative top sheet is placed face down on the mattress so that, when you fold your flat sheet over the duvet, you’ll be able to see the pattern or embroidery on the sheet."

Fold them another 6 inches (15 cm) down toward the foot of the bed. [5] X Research source The sheets should now have two folds, and the blanket should have one. This method is called triple sheeting. Use your hands to smooth out the sheets and blankets and eliminate any wrinkles . For the first fold, you should only be folding the two sheets—not the blanket."

      "title": "Fold in the corners of the bed.",
      "content": "Fold in the corners of the bed. Make a hospital corner by tucking in all three sides of the bed, then taking all three layers at one corner and pulling them taut. The excess fabric at the corners should form a triangle shape. Bring the leftover fabric down and over toward the foot of the bed, making an envelope-like look. Then, fold the remaining fabric under the mattress. [6] X Research source To get a nice envelope look, run your finger down the side of the bed at a forty-five-degree angle. Do this while pulling the sheets taut with your other hand. This creates an imaginary triangle. Fold the triangle portion of sheets at the bottom under your mattress. Tuck in the rest of the sheets and smooth to remove wrinkles. Do this for both sides of the bed."

[7] X Research source For an even fluffier look, throw the comforter on your bed and let it float down on top of your sheets. If you prefer to use a duvet cover, make sure that each corner of the comforter correctly aligns with the inside of the cover."

Then, place square decorative pillows on the bed, followed by a long lumbar pillow . Slightly unfold your duvet cover or comforter so that it meets the pillows. [8] X Research source Ultimately, the amount of pillows and styles you use is up to you. The only requirement is to use the same number for each side of the bed and place them symmetrically."

Or, depending on the size of your throw, fold the blanket into a rectangle and gently lay it on the duvet cover toward the bottom third of your bed.

White is a symbol of luxury and relaxation, and it looks clean and sophisticated. [11] X Research source However, not everyone likes the harshness of white bedding, and it can be challenging to keep clean. Choose another relaxing color or palette for your bedroom decor. Try soft blues and greens, light pinks, warm neutral browns, or even a cool-toned gray. [12] X Research source The most important rule when designing a bed in the hotel style is to stick to a relatively monochromatic color scheme without any loud or clashing patterns."
