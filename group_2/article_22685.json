      "content": "Standouts are Hinge users in your area that get a lot of attention. Don't be surprised if you find your Standouts especially attractive, or if they have especially funny and amusing profiles. Standouts receive a lot of likes, but they also align closely with the preferences you have set for yourself on Hinge. [1] X Research source Your Hinge Standouts refresh each day, but you may see recurring faces. That is because Hinge believes you both have common interests/preferences. If you keep seeing a Standout over and over, it may be a sign that you are compatible!"

      "content": "Tap the star icon to view your Standouts. You can find your Standouts on Hinge by tapping the star icon on the bottom of your screen. You can then scroll through your deck of Standouts and tap on each user to view their full profile."

      "title": "Tap the Rose icon on any photo or prompt.",
      "content": "Tap the Rose icon on any photo or prompt. You can reach out to a Standout just as you would any other user, with one key exception. You can only reach out to Standouts with a Rose. Once you tap on the Rose, you can craft a response or simply send the Rose. These go immediately to the top of your Standout's deck of likes."

      "title": "Although you can reach out to a Standout with a Rose, it may not always be the best idea.",
      "content": "Although you can reach out to a Standout with a Rose, it may not always be the best idea. There are mixed opinions on Roses and whether it is weird to send them, and your Standouts may eventually appear in your usual deck of Hinge users. It may take a while until you see them there, but it might be worth waiting so you can reach out with a normal Like as opposed to a Rose."

    {
      "title": "Follow your heart.",
      "content": "Follow your heart. Of course, if you see a user in your Standouts and you feel strongly about their profile, feel free to send them a Rose! You get one free Rose a week, and Roses do not carry over, so sending one to a Standout you particularly like is a completely valid way to use your weekly free Rose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your best photos.",
      "content": "Use your best photos. Because Standouts are the people Hinge users are most interested in, you'll want to put your best face forward—literally. Choose a profile photo that's well-lit, attractive, accurate to real life, and shows off your best features. Your remaining profile photos should show your personality and interests, and help tell the story of who you really are."

    {
      "title": "Use simple Hinge prompts.",
      "content": "Use simple Hinge prompts. Hinge prompts are designed to start conversations. If you're using prompts that Hinge users find interesting and easy to respond to, you'll receive more responses. More responses = more activity, which makes you more likely to become a Hinge Standout."

    {
      "title": "Make your profile likeable.",
      "content": "Make your profile likeable. Add content to your Hinge profile that other people with similar interests are sure to Like. This includes photos—pet photos and pictures of cool travel destinations are always popular options. Be relatable, be honest, and watch the likes pour in. The more likes you get, the more often you'll appear in other peoples' Standouts."
