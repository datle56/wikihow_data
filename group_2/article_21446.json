Use your late teenage years and early 20s to start becoming more and more like the adult version of yourself. Your interests, talents, and skills will give you some sense of who you will become, so it's important to take your mid-to-late teenage years to explore those talents and dream your biggest dreams. What do you want to be? Who do you want to be? Explore yourself. Use these years to play in bands, play sports, act in drama, paint, and read for pleasure. Explore things for which you have natural skills, as well as things you know nothing about. Try new hobbies and activities that are available, like photography or dance. You might learn that you're really great at something you never gave yourself credit for."

Are you studying what you want to study and providing yourself a plan for the future? Do you want to start making money as soon as possible? Are you going to take your band on tour and live like a rock star? Are you going to travel?

Find local universities and colleges that might be a good fit, and find colleges that would be dream schools. Find out about how much it will cost, how much your family will be able to afford, how much you'll need to reserve with student loans, and the different cost breakdowns for different schools. If you want to start working , spend time developing a budget for yourself, setting financial goals, and learning what kinds of jobs will be available to you to make the kind of money you'll need.

If you tend toward laziness, or tend to sweat the small stuff, or tend to procrastinate, these things shouldn't be a surprise by the time you reach your twenties and get ready to enter the work force. A teenager can get away with ignoring these things and calling it \"youth.\" But an adult needs to get real and be honest about shortcomings, challenges, and places for growth. Growing up takes work.

But growing up doesn't mean that you have to abandon your youth entirely, it just means that you have to control your childhood tendencies and learn to harness that youthful energy into more mature goals and ambitions. Recognize your childlike tendencies so you can use them to your advantage. [6] X Research source Child mode is chaotic . A child is disorganized, unprepared, and usually running a million miles an hour in the wrong direction. Childhood is chaos. While many adult lives are busy and full, chaos–the lack of control or structure for that stress and business–is a sure sign of child mode. Identify the parts of your life that are chaotic and channel your energy into organizing them. Child mode is helpless . Someone needs to tie a child's shoes, feed the child, and offer emotional support. An adult is more self-reliant, capable of raising their own children because of an increasing degree of selflessness. As you grow up, work to become more capable of doing things yourself, and rely less on others. Child mode is resentful . In child mode, you may grow to seethe in anger when another coworker gets a promotion and you don't, or when an old fling from high school gets married. Resent is the child mode equivalent of a temper tantrum. If you don't get your way, you can bury that frustration and let it grow into resentment and anger, like a child does, or you can express your frustration in a healthy way, reckon with the situation, and move on."

But adults need to act like adults. People need to know they can rely on you. Always treat friends, family, and coworkers with respect. Treat people the way you want to be treated.
