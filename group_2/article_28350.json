      "content": "Dab a light eyeshadow in the inner corners of your eyes. Rub an eyelid primer onto your lids and let it dry for about 1 minute. Pick out a shimmery white or tan colored eyeshadow and dab a small, fluffy brush into it. Pat the color onto the inner corners of your eyes to make them look brighter and wider. [1] X Expert Source Cordelia Frost Makeup Artist & Gothic Blogger Expert Interview. 30 July 2021 Keep the shadow to the inner corner, not on your actual eyelid. [2] X Research source You can also use pale pink or light orange eyeshadow to match the rest of your look."

      "title": "Add a medium shade of eyeshadow to the center of your eyelid.",
      "content": "Add a medium shade of eyeshadow to the center of your eyelid. Pick out a shade of eyeshadow that’s in between your lightest and darkest shade. You can use a light brown, tan, pale purple, or dusty pink eyeshadow to complement the look you’re going for. Pat it into the center of your eyes to bridge the gap between the dark and light shades of shadow. Bring the shadow up to your eyelid crease to make your eyes look larger. [3] X Research source If you chose tan, try pairing it with brown or beige. If you chose pink or light orange, try going with pale purple or dusty pink. You don’t need a ton of the medium shade since you’re mainly using it to fill in the gaps between your other 2 colors."

      "title": "Pat a dark colored eyeshadow onto your outer eyelids.",
      "content": "Pat a dark colored eyeshadow onto your outer eyelids. Pick out a dark brown, purple, or gray shade of eyeshadow to put onto your outer eyes. Gently pat it from the center of your eyelid out toward the edge of your eyelid from your lash line to the crease of your eyelid to make your eyes look larger. [4] X Research source If you used tan and brown, try going with a chocolate brown for the darkest color. If you went with a pink or orange combo, try using dark purple or dark orange. Avoid using black eyeshadow for the outer corners of your eyes, as it can close them off and make them look closer together."

      "title": "Line the outer half of your lower lash line with dark shadow.",
      "content": "Line the outer half of your lower lash line with dark shadow. Take the same eyeshadow you used for your outer corners and drag it down to your lower lash line. Use it to line just underneath your lash line from the outer corner to the center of your eye, but don’t go beyond that. [5] X Research source Adding too much darkness to the inner corner of your eyes can make them seem closer and smaller. Blend all of the colors together with a large, fluffy brush."

      "content": "Draw winged eyeliner from the center of your eyelid outwards. Grab a liquid black eyeliner and start lining right above your upper lash line from the center of your eye outwards. Drag the eyeliner out in a wing that’s about as long as your eyebrow to extend your eye shape outwards. [6] X Research source A long wing will make your eyes look larger and further apart."

      "content": "Swipe mascara onto the lashes from the center of your eye outwards. Take your mascara wand and use it mainly on the lashes from the center of your eye outwards on both your bottom and top lashes. You can add a little bit of mascara to the inner lashes as well, but try to focus on the outer ones to open up your eye shape. [7] X Research source Try using an eyelash curler beforehand to give your lashes some extra lift. You can also trim a set of false lashes and glue them to the outer edges of your top lash line."

As you do, brush the hairs upwards and outwards to make your eyebrows look fuller and more defined. [8] X Research source Most eyebrow pencils have a spoolie on one side that you can use."

      "content": "Fill in your eyebrows with a matching eyebrow pencil to make them bolder. Grab an eyebrow pencil that matches the shade of your eyebrows. Use short, small strokes to draw in the lines of your eyebrow from the beginning to the end. This will give your brows more definition and width. [9] X Research source You can use the spoolie on your eyebrow pencil to brush your brow hairs back into place as you work on them. You may have to test out a few different colors until you find the shade that works for you."

      "content": "Emphasize the arch in your eyebrows as you fill them in with pencil. Use your pencil to make a slight arch above the outer 1/3 of your eyes. Widen the arch slightly to make it more prominent, if you can. [10] X Research source A higher arch will extend your eye shape outwards."

      "content": "Extend the tails of your brows about 1 cm (0.39 in) longer than your eyes. Using your same eyebrow pencil, drag the tail end of your eyebrows down just slightly so that they’re about 1 cm (0.39 in) longer than your eyes. Drag the line downwards toward your ears instead of straight out. Don’t go overboard, as a super long eyebrow can make your eyes look droopy. [11] X Research source A longer eyebrow widens your face, making your eyes look further apart."
