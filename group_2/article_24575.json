      "content": "A jellyfish cut is a hairstyle with a bob on top and long layers underneath. The bob is round and distinct, while the bottom is long, often with curled ends. The bob is unblended and the long bottom is disconnected, creating a look that’s similar to a jellyfish. The jellyfish cut draws inspiration from the Japanese hime or princess cut , of the Heian era. [1] X Research source The jellyfish cut has been worn by popular anime characters like Hinata Hyuga from Naruto and Maki Zenin from Jujutsu Kaisen . While a jellyfish cut usually sports curled ends, a hime cut is usually worn straight. The hime cut also sports dramatic layers in the front while the jellyfish cut sports them all around.

      "content": "Ask your stylist to cut a short, round bob while leaving long hair underneath. Bring a few photos of the jellyfish haircut so they know exactly what you’re looking for. Once you show them the photos, let them know that you want your hair cut into two distinct sections. On top, ask for a short, round bob. For the bottom, ask them to keep your hair long. The round bob on top will add movement, making the legs of your jellyfish cut more flexible. If you want layers in your hair, ask that your stylist does a layered or feathered cut. Both cuts spread out the volume, with the layered cut helping refine your face shape and the feathered cut accentuating your jawline and cheekbones. [3] X Research source For more definition, ask your stylist to use a texturizer."

On the top layers, hair stylist Danielle Chiz suggests using a blowout brush , which can dry and smooth your hair at the same time. Curl the ends of the bottom layers for a classic jellyfish style. A voluminous jellyfish haircut is great for oval faces. The high volume makes for a big look that compliments the rounded pointedness of an oval face. It’s great if you want to even out your face and sport an edgy cut."

      "content": "Straighten your hair for an edgier look. Apply a heat protectant , then straighten the bob and ends of your hair using a straightener. This look elongates round and diamond-shaped faces. It provides a curtain for the edges of your face and has a lot of top volume, which draws the eyes up and creates the illusion of length. Straightening your hair also adds length near the bottom, making the face appear longer. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear pigtails for a cute, playful style. Simply split your hair into two sections (one on either side of your head) and use a hair tie to secure each side. Go for low ponytails for a cute look or high space buns if you want to include the hair that's in the bob on top. If you have a rounder face and want to wear pigtails while still keeping it covered, the jellyfish haircut is a good style for you. Hide the pigtails behind the edges of the bob for a sneakingly striking look."

      "content": "Get regular trims to maintain the shape. When you visit the salon, let your stylist know that you want to keep the length but tighten the bob. Maintenance is fairly simple, as the top will need to be cut more frequently to maintain the shape, while the bottom can be trimmed anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on how fast your hair grows. [6] X Research source To keep the cut’s shape, roughly blow dry while brushing with a cylinder hairbrush , making sure to flip the ends to maintain the shape of the top section. Then, apply a texturizing spray so the layers are able to pop."
