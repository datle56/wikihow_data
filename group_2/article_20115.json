      "content": "Get some distance. Even if you’re determined to get your ex back right this second, you’ll need to step back to get a bit of distance and perspective first. One important reason to do this is that, if your ex is really saying you’ll never get back together, you probably shouldn’t try to force it or you’ll only make the situation worse. Getting some distance from the situation will also help you have a better sense of what went wrong and how you can fix it. Take at least a week or two to cool off and to be able to think more rationally about the situation instead of acting with your emotions. Take this time to be on your own, write in your journal, and deal with your feelings. This can help you approach the situation with more of a plan and less intensity. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you want this to work. Once you take some time away from your ex, you need to ask yourself whether or not getting him back is really what you want. If he’s really saying you’ll never get back together, he may have a good reason for it, whether it’s because you did something to break his trust or he’s just not really there emotionally. Whatever the reason, you have to understand that if you really want to get someone who is saying never back, that you’re setting yourself up for quite a challenge and that it has to be worth it. You don’t want to sign yourself up for a failing mission. If you really think there’s absolutely no chance that you’ll get your ex back, then you have to ask yourself if you’re just setting yourself up to get crushed again. However, if you really think your ex and you are meant to be together and that you were driven apart because of a misunderstanding, then you should get ready to make things work again."

      "content": "Figure out what went wrong. If you want to win your ex back, then you have to understand whatever it was that made the relationship go sour in the first place. If your relationship did not work, there were problems in it. Maybe you had intimacy issues, maybe you were too flirtatious, maybe your boyfriend had trouble communicating—whatever the issue, you have to make sure it’s not an irreconcilable difference but something that can be fixed. Until you understand what the problem is, you can’t go and make things better. Of course, if the problem really was some kind of an irreconcilable difference, then you have to ask yourself if there’s a way for you and your ex to be able to accept it and to move on. Think long and hard. You may think that the real issue in the relationship was one thing, when your boyfriend saw things completely differently. Maybe you think you broke up because you didn’t spend enough time together, but the real reason is because your boyfriend felt like you weren’t opening yourself up to him. [2] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 447 wikiHow readers who've considered rekindling a relationship with their ex, and 53% of them agreed that their biggest concern was making the same mistakes and getting hurt again. [Take Poll] By figuring out what went wrong the first time, you can avoid making the same mistakes the second time around."

      "content": "Work on improving yourself first. It may be that one of the reasons you broke up was because you had some personal issues to address. If you are dealing with insecurity, a lack of communication skills, the inability to open up, problems with boundaries or listening, or any other factors that can keep you from really enjoying a relationship, then you have to work on improving those things about yourself first. This can take a lot of time, but it’ll make you more ready for a healthy relationship with your ex. Remember that if you’re not happy with yourself, then you can’t be happy in a relationship. Work on feeling happy with the person you are before you’re ready to share that person with someone. [3] X Research source Of course, you don’t have to be 100% in love with yourself to be in a relationship, but you have to let your confidence come from within, not from another person, or you’ll only be disappointed in yourself when your next relationship is over."

If you’re feeling a bit lost or confused about what happened between you and your ex or what to do next, then turn to a trusted friend to get another perspective on the situation. This friend can be especially helpful if he or she knows both of you, because the friend can help you see something about your relationship you didn’t realize before; your friend can also help you find the best way to get your ex back. Having another perspective on your relationship can help you see things you didn’t see before, even if you may not want to hear the truth. Talking to someone about your situation can also help you feel more confident about moving forward and less alone. You can consider therapy as well."

Though you don’t want to wait forever to start trying to get your ex back, you don’t want to rush things if he really can’t even stand the sight of you. If you really hurt him and he’s having a hard time even looking you in the eye, then it’s probably not the time to start making small talk with him. However, if you’re around him and see that he’s comfortable talking to you or at least saying hi to you, then you may be able to cautiously move forward. If you’ve really hurt your ex and feel like he won’t talk to you until you can show him how sorry you are first, then you may want to write him a meaningful letter if he refuses to listen to what you have to say. Though time can’t heal all wounds, it can certainly lessen the intensity of negative feelings. Though you may be impatient to get back with your ex, know that your chances of making it work will actually improve if you let enough time go by for him to forget or not care as much about some of his negative feelings towards you."

You don’t have to be too obvious about it to make him see that you’re confident and capable without him. If you’re hanging out with your girlfriends and your ex is in the same room, try not to look his way or act like you care about what he thinks of you. Focus on enjoying your conversations and on having a great time without looking his way. Though you shouldn’t fake a laugh just to make him jealous, you should be open to cracking up and having a great time without him even if he’s watching.

While you shouldn’t use other guys who like you just to make your ex jealous, there’s no harm in flirting a bit if you make it clear it won’t really lead anywhere.

Be friendly, open, and keep things lighthearted, at first; there’s no need to jump into an intense conversation about why your relationship ended when you’re just trying to get on solid footing again. At first, get comfortable hanging out with your ex in a group, and then see if spending time together solo, even if you’re just running a quick errand together, can be the best way to move forward. Read your ex’s body language when you start talking again. If he turns away from you, keeps his arms crossed over his chest, or refuses to make eye contact, then he may not be ready to start spending time together again."

Whatever your main issue was, you have to show him that you’ve changed and that he’ll be able to change too; if he thinks that you’ll just fall into the same bad habits if you got back together, then he’ll be much less likely to want to travel down that road. If your main issue was communicating, then be frank and open when you talk to each other. If he thought you were too clingy, then make sure you give him space this time around.

You have to be smart about reading the signs that tell you whether or not he’s ready to have you back, or even to try to date you again.

If your issue was not spending enough time together, for example, then make sure you don’t book up your social calendar and leave out your boyfriend this time around; if your issue was snapping at each other in public, make sure you both work on making each other feel better, not worse about yourselves when you’re out together. Though you don’t want to bring up the past all the time, you should both be on the same page about how to move forward and to avoid whatever it was that caused you to drift apart the first time around. You should be comfortable with checking each other and saying, “Hey, remember how much trouble we had with this the first time around? Let’s find a way to move past it…” Of course, nobody’s perfect, and it’s natural that you both may fall into old habits.

Be honest with yourself. Do you feel like you’ve given it your all and it still isn’t working? If that’s the case, then you should be proud of yourself for making an effort and get ready to move on. Even if your relationship ends, don’t look at it as a waste of time or emotional effort. Every relationship helps you learn how to communicate with others and how to deal with problems, and no matter what happens, you’ll have more strength and knowledge going into your next relationship."
