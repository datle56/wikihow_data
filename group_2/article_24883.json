If you need to step away from your computer for a while but you want your status to stay Active , one of these apps may do the trick. This is a good option if setting your computer to stay awake isn’t working on its own. Try installing an app such as Wiggler (for Microsoft) or Jiggler (for Mac). You can also buy physical mouse jigglers that plug into your computer if installing software on your work machine isn’t an option. [11] X Research source"
