      "content": "Place 1 lb (16 oz) of dried cannabis and 1 US gal (3.8 l) of food-grade alcohol or isopropyl alcohol (if not ingesting) in a bucket. Indica cannabis strains make the best and most effective Rick Simpson oils. When you've added all of your cannabis to the bucket, pour in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of the alcohol. Break up any larger chunks of cannabis with your wooden spoon before you add the alcohol. Make sure your bucket can hold at least 2–3 gallons (7.6–11.4 l). If you are going to ingest the oil internally, be sure that you use food-grade alcohol, such as an Everclear or over proof rum, rather than isopropyl alcohol."

      "content": "Set up a rice cooker in a well-ventilated area. Fumes may emit from the rice cooker as the solvent is dissolved. Because alcohol is highly combustible, avoid any and all flames, stovetops, sparks, and cigarettes while you're heating the solvent.

Close and turn on your rice cooker to 210–230 °F (99–110 °C). [6] X Research source Although you can heat your alcohol in a crock pot, it is not recommended. If your mixture heats to over 300 °F (149 °C), the cannabis will burn and become unusable. Save the rest of your alcohol for later. As the alcohol evaporates, you will slowly add more until you have poured in the entire solvent. [7] X Research source"

You may need multiple syringes to siphon out all of the oil. Store Rick Simpson oil in the syringes until you are ready to use it."

If you have high blood pressure , for example, see a doctor alongside using alternative health treatments."
