      "content": "Use olive oil no more than once a week before you take a shower. Olive oil has a natural cleansing action. It’s great for gently cleaning the hair and scalp. Set aside a day or night when you don't need to go anywhere. You'll want to let the olive oil sit in your hair to get the full effect, and your hair may remain somewhat greasy even after you rinse out the oil. [2] X Research source Don't shampoo your hair before using olive oil: the treatment will work better as a conditioner if your hair is clean, but not shampooed. Shampoo is an astringent, and it will strip your hair of oils. [3] X Research source It is okay to wash your hair and condition it before using olive oil. However, the most effective tactic is to apply the oil first, then rinse your hair afterward."

[4] X Research source You may also use a pot on the stove, but you'll need to be extra-vigilant to make sure that it doesn't overheat!

      "content": "Consider mixing the olive oil with almond oil and egg. This may lend your hair more shine and help replenish lost nutrients. You may also consider combining olive oil with other essential oils like almond oil, tea tree oil, and jojoba oil. [5] X Research source Try making a mixture using the following increments: 1 egg. Consider using the whole egg, not only the yellow part, because the whites contain compounds that stimulate hair growth. [6] X Research source The egg-white is even more important if you have acne or skin deficiencies. 1 teaspoon of raw almond oil. This step is optional, but it really helps to smooth your skin and hair. This is especially important if you're using a high-acidity olive oil. 1 spoonful of olive oil. You can even make it 1.5 or 2 spoonfuls."

      "title": "Rub the olive oil all over your hair while it is dry.",
      "content": "Rub the olive oil all over your hair while it is dry. Pour the oil on your head and massage thoroughly throughout, from scalp to tip. Use a liberal amount; don't skimp on the oil! Make sure to do this in the bathroom or somewhere else that's easy to clean. Ideally, stand in the shower, the tub, or outdoors, and don't wear any clothes that you don't want to get oily. There's a good chance that some of the oil will spill!"

      "title": "Leave the olive oil in your hair for 30-60 minutes.",
      "content": "Leave the olive oil in your hair for 30-60 minutes. Put a plastic bag or foil around your hair to retain the oils. If your hair is long, bundle it up on top of your head, to help keep a little heat in (similar to bleaching hair). The bag or foil will help keep oil off of things if you sit down and help keep some of the heat in. This consistency in heat will help the olive oil saturate the hair and also give your scalp a good moisturizing! [7] X Research source To speed up the process, stretch a shower cap or foil over your hair and take a warm shower. The steam and heat will help your hair absorb the olive oil more quickly."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out the olive oil.",
      "content": "Rinse out the olive oil. After the oil has been in your hair for 30-60 minutes, it's time to rinse! Take the bag/foil off and undo your hair. If you haven't done so already, hop in the shower and run warm water through your locks. Do not use shampoo for this shower. Again, shampoo can strip the oils from your hair, reversing the healthful effect of the olive oil treatment. Conditioner is okay."

      "content": "Let your hair air dry. Your hair may feel a little greasy while it dries; that's why it's good to do this on a day off. This extra little step will add to the health factor, especially if you use a lot of hot tools on your hair. If everything is done right, your hair should feel a bit more full and flexible."
