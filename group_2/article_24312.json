      "content": "Your package can’t be delivered due to a problem with the address. When the US Postal Service (USPS) tracking system shows an “Insufficient Address” status, it means the mail carrier couldn’t read the address or important information is missing, and they do not know the correct information. [1] X Research source When tracking your package , this status usually appears closer to the end of the package’s journey because the USPS can often route mail with missing information to the correct city and state. In some cases, your local mail carrier is so familiar with where people on their route live that they can deliver the package without the correct address."

      "title": "An incomplete address is the most common cause for this status.",
      "content": "An incomplete address is the most common cause for this status. When an address has an incorrect zip code, no street directional, or misspelled street names, it’s more difficult to route it to the right part of your city. This is why you often see the “Insufficient Address” status near the end of the package’s journey. Occasionally, a package is given this status when there’s not enough postage or the recipient has moved without filing a change of address. Other reasons for an “Insufficient Address” status are: Missing apartment, unit, or suite number Incomplete city name Missing street number Invalid postal abbreviations for state, street, or city Smudged address label"

[2] X Research source There’s often a window between when the package is marked “Insufficient Address” and when it’s rerouted. If you contact the Post Office during that window, you may be able to get the package before it’s rerouted. It’s worth getting in touch with the USPS even if your package has not reached a distribution center in your city. They may be able to hold the package or update the address for you. If you call the Customer Care number, enter your 5-digit postal code when prompted. Then, press 3 for “Delivery Issue” to be connected with a Customer Care Representative in your area. The USPS Customer Care Center is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 8:30 PM ET and on Saturday from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM ET. Visit the USPS Locations page to find your local Post Office. Type in your city and state or zip code and click search for a map showing locations in your area. Hours for your local Post Office are also available on the Locations page."
