      "title": "Indirect characterization reveals character traits through descriptive language rather than directly stating them.",
      "content": "Indirect characterization reveals character traits through descriptive language rather than directly stating them. It’s essentially a way for writers to describe a character without directly listing their traits; they use a character’s thoughts, actions, speech, and appearance to uncover new details about them in the story. It's indirect characterization whenever you learn something about a character without that new information being stated outright. [1] X Research source For example, take a look at the following lines: “Maeve couldn’t stop fidgeting. She paced back and forth, trying not to stare at the clock.” These lines show that the character, Maeve, is anxious and restless—but they don’t say that plainly. Instead, they use the character’s actions to reveal her traits!"

    {
      "title": "Speech",
      "content": "Speech This type of indirect characterization is all about characters saying things that reveal details about themselves. They might say something about themselves or make a statement offering insight into their values and perspectives. The way they talk or their tone of voice can also tell you a lot—about their attitude, personality, and how they interact with people. [2] X Research source For example: In A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, Scrooge says, “A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” Scrooge is describing Christmas and his hatred of it. His words also demonstrate Scrooge’s greed—because he hates the idea of giving money to someone else, even on a holiday that’s all about generosity."

    {
      "title": "Thoughts",
      "content": "Thoughts A character’s thoughts (and the way they think overall) can show readers the type of people they are—their traits, values, and fears. Thoughts happen only in the character’s mind, painting a picture of the character for the reader alone. [3] X Research source For example: In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, the author writes “He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.” Based on the narrator's (Nick’s) thoughts, you can tell how badly Gatsby wants to impress Daisy with his house—and, in turn, how deeply Gatsby cares for Daisy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Effect",
      "content": "Effect “Effect” refers to the effect a character has on others—how they react to that character and what sort of interactions the character has. How do other characters view that character? How do they interact? Does the character in question seem agreeable, or do they clash with other characters? [4] X Research source For example: In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone by JK Rowling, the author writes, “[Malfoy] turned back to Harry. ‘You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.’ He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it. ‘I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,’ he said coolly.” Harry’s reaction to Malfoy shows readers that Malfoy himself is the “wrong sort”—he’s rude, condescending, and acts superior to others."

    {
      "title": "Action",
      "content": "Action You can also tell a lot about a character through their actions. After all, as the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words! That’s why this is often considered the most powerful form of indirect characterization: it shows readers who characters really are at their core. [5] X Research source Another example from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby : “At two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.” In this excerpt, Gatsby sends a “greenhouse” of flowers to Nick’s house to impress Daisy, showing his nervousness and desperation to make a good impression."

    {
      "title": "Looks",
      "content": "Looks Even a character’s appearance and looks can tell readers about their personality. A basic description of physical traits (like their hair color or height) isn’t enough, though; the description should actually have an implication about their character traits or behavior. [6] X Research source An example from Philip Pullman’s The Golden Compass : “Lord Asriel was a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seemed to flash and glitter with savage laughter.” Even though there’s some direct characterization (tall, powerful shoulders), the indirect characterization is stronger: Asriel’s “fierce dark face” and eyes that “flash and glitter with savage laughter” paint him as cold, dangerous, and intelligent. Together, these types of indirect characterization form the acronym “STEAL.” Knowing that can help you remember each type (and how they work)."

      "title": "The Hound of the Baskervilles",
      "content": "The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle : \"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,\" said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. \"I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.\" [7] X Research source In this quote (wherein Sherlock Holmes is talking to John Watson), Holmes describes Watson as a “conductor of light” and thanks him for “stimulating” Holmes’ own genius. Thus, the quote indirectly shows readers that Holmes is truly brilliant but can also be condescending, even toward people he genuinely cares about (like Watson), and considers himself much more intelligent than Watson."

      "content": "The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins : “Prim!” The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my muscles begin to move again. “Prim!” I don’t need to shove through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me. “I volunteer!” I gasp. “I volunteer as tribute!” This excerpt shows Katniss volunteering to take her sister’s place in the Hunger Games, conveying her intensely protective nature as well as her bravery."

      "content": "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee : “Scout, simply by the nature of the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally. This one’s mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don’t you let ’em get your goat.” [8] X Research source In this excerpt, Atticus’ words to his daughter can also tell readers plenty about Atticus himself: he’s principled, has a strong moral compass, and wants his kids to understand those principles, too."

      "title": "The Yellow Wallpaper",
      "content": "The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gillman : “John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster. You see, he does not believe I am sick! And what can one do?” …”Personally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good. But what is one to do?” [9] X Research source The Yellow Wallpaper is about a woman’s (the narrator’s) descent into madness as recorded in her journal entries. In this entry, readers can sense her feelings of helplessness and neglect. She has her own opinions about what she needs to feel well again, but her husband won’t listen to her."

      "title": "Direct characterization means openly describing a character.",
      "content": "Direct characterization means openly describing a character. Thus, the difference between direct and indirect characterization is whether the writer is straight-up describing a character or implying something about them. When using direct characterization, you can describe the character’s appearance or traits exactly; you’re not trying to include them more subtly in the story. [10] X Research source For example, say you find the following passage in a story: “Johannes was cunning and cruel, but nobody had the guts to challenge him.” That’s direct characterization—because Johannes’ traits (cunning, cruel) are listed directly rather than being indirectly described."

      "title": "Characterization alone is how writers define and create their characters.",
      "content": "Characterization alone is how writers define and create their characters. It encapsulates direct and indirect characterization; each represents a different method of capturing and deepening a character’s personality, making them feel unique and easily recognizable from all the other characters in a story. Essentially, characterization is what writers use to tell readers who their characters are. [11] X Research source Without characterization, characters can feel stale, boring, unrealistic, or like cookie-cutter figures instead of unique and interesting people."

    {
      "title": "Include indirect characterization when it works for the story.",
      "content": "Include indirect characterization when it works for the story. You don’t have to force indirect characterization into every scene and paragraph! This literary device works best when it happens naturally. So, when you’re writing a story, wait until there’s an opportunity that’s important to the narrative (rather than inventing extra scenes or flashbacks just to emphasize a character trait)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to the details.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the details. Details are where you can find the most opportunities for indirect characterization! When you’re writing a character , think about their mannerisms, body language, how they dress or present themselves, and what their facial expressions look like. It’ll paint a clearer picture of your character and make them seem more realistic . [12] X Research source For example, if your character gets stressed easily, you might describe them grinding their teeth or running a hand through their hair when they encounter a problem. Stevens has an additional tip on writing compelling descriptions of characters: people watch! “You can observe humans, our interactions, our manners, and our habits. And those are important…to note because those little elements make for great character descriptions.”"

    {
      "title": "Describe characters through their living space and lifestyle.",
      "content": "Describe characters through their living space and lifestyle. Similarly, think about the details of their living space. Is their home neat or messy? Minimalist or cluttered? Do they stick to a routine or do things differently every single day? You can show people what your character is like by detailing their living habits and space. For example, a rigid and proper character might have a totally immaculate living space with nothing out of place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your character’s actions and reactions to show who they are.",
      "content": "Use your character’s actions and reactions to show who they are. As mentioned above, a character’s actions (and reactions) are powerful—and speak volumes about their personality. Consider your character’s actions and reactions carefully in every scene and make sure each one is true to their established personality, because that’s where their traits and values will really shine through. [13] X Research source Of course, dialogue (and how the character treats others when they speak) can also help define their personality."
    },
    {
      "title": "Portray a character’s traits consistently throughout the story.",
      "content": "Portray a character’s traits consistently throughout the story. In other words, don’t just indirectly characterize a trait once; find ways to keep demonstrating that trait as the story continues so readers can pick up on the pattern. One instance of something isn’t likely to make much of an impression, whereas repetition can make a personality trait really stand out. For example, say you want your character to be stubborn. In that case, write several scenes in which they act stubborn—that way, readers can see it’s a consistent trait!"

    {
      "title": "Save the direct characterization for key details you want to reveal quickly.",
      "content": "Save the direct characterization for key details you want to reveal quickly. Even though we’re focusing on indirect characterization, both types have a place in stories. Direct characterization is usually more concise overall, so it works best when used to quickly establish details about a character early in the story (or recap things later for readers). Then, you can expand on those details later. [14] X Research source For example, in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice , Mr. Bennet directly describes Elizabeth (the main character) as having “something more of quickness than her sisters,” meaning she’s sharp, witty, and clever. Then, throughout the book, there are indirect examples of Elizabeth’s intelligence and wit, as seen through her actions, words, thoughts, and other characters’ reactions to her."

    {
      "title": "Consider how you can support direct characterization in the story.",
      "content": "Consider how you can support direct characterization in the story. There’s nothing wrong with using direct characterization—but after you do, think of ways to back it up. For example, if you describe a character as brave, how can you show readers they’re brave later (through actions, words, or reactions?) Include imagery and indirect characterization after the fact to support your initial description! [15] X Research source Going back to the example, if you describe your character as brave, you might include a scene in which they stand up to a bully or risk themselves to help someone else, even though it’s dangerous."

    {
      "title": "Use a narrator’s voice to make your descriptions more colorful.",
      "content": "Use a narrator’s voice to make your descriptions more colorful. Narrators have a voice of their own, whether they’re a part of the story or just an observer. So, look for ways to give that narrator’s voice some personality— describe characters using the narrator’s unique perspective (rather than describing them impartially). Trying to learn new writing styles? According to Stevens, you can use narration and point of view to do that as well. She recommends you “try changing your point of view” to change up your writing style. Thus, this can be an exercise in writing style and literary devices! Adopt a point of view in which you can give a more unique and colorful description of characters—one you may not have tried before."

    {
      "title": "Read more stories with indirect characterization in them.",
      "content": "Read more stories with indirect characterization in them. This can help with more than just your understanding of indirect characterization; Stevens adds, \"Reading will always be the number one way to improve your vocabulary.” So, whether you want to learn new words, familiarize yourself with literary devices, or gain more insights into storytelling in general, reading is the way to go. Try writing down a few indirect characterization examples you like best. That way, you can refer back to them when you need to! You can do the same thing in terms of vocabulary; write down words you want to use, descriptions you think are particularly well-done, and anything else that could be a source of inspiration."

      "title": "Indirect characterization helps writers describe characters realistically.",
      "content": "Indirect characterization helps writers describe characters realistically. Where direct characterization delivers all the answers straight to the reader, indirect characterization lets readers draw conclusions based on the character’s thoughts and actions. By forcing the reader to engage more with the story, indirect characterization makes the experience more realistic, personal, and interesting! [16] X Research source Think about real life: a lot of the time, you learn about people by observing them and interacting with them. In literature, indirect characterization works the same way. Characterization is crucial to any narrative story, and having both types of characterization (direct and indirect) creates a more well-rounded and fleshed-out character overall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Indirect characterization is a vital writing tool for describing characters.",
      "content": "Indirect characterization is a vital writing tool for describing characters. It’s used to subtly make implications about a character’s core traits rather than directly listing them, usually through that character’s actions, words, thoughts, and appearance—as well as other characters' reactions. In writing, indirect characterization is often used alongside direct characterization, which means directly stating a character’s traits. Both types of characterization are essential to a story: indirect shows and direct tells . Using them together creates a more realistic and well-rounded character! For example, you might use direct characterization to quickly establish details about a character at the beginning of a story, then later use indirect characterization to showcase those details throughout the narrative."
