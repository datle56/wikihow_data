      "content": "Be kind and loving to yourself . It is important to show kindness and love for yourself as you work to get past hurtful emotions. This can take time, but doing things like taking good care of yourself, saying uplifting things to yourself, and showing self-compassion can help. Give yourself a compliment every day, such as by looking in the mirror and finding something positive about your appearance. For example, you might say to yourself, “My hair looks so shiny and beautiful today!” Show self-compassion to yourself such as by writing an understanding letter to yourself from the perspective of a friend. In the letter, say encouraging things to yourself like a good friend might do. For example, you might say something like, “I know how hard this experience has been for you, but I am so proud of you for working towards healing! You have so much strength and it amazes me every day!”"

      "content": "Release regret . You may feel guilty or regretful for “wasting” your time in this relationship, or for allowing yourself to be treated disrespectfully. It can become easy to feel the sting of regret and hold onto it. Yet, recognize that you cannot change your past. Regardless of how strong or deep or hurtful your regret feels, there comes a time when you recognize that the pain regret causes you detracts from your life and it’s time to release it. [2] X Research source Regret keeps your focus in the past. Keep yourself in the present and work toward a positive future. Create a mantra or positive phrase that reminds you to let go of regret. Say, “Sometimes I make mistakes. I am still capable, smart, loving and lovable.”"

      "title": "Let go of shame",
      "content": "Let go of shame . You may feel ashamed about the abuse. Perhaps you fear talking to other people about your experience for fear that they may judge you or think differently or less of you. Shame makes you feel like something is “wrong” with you, or that you are unworthy or undeserving of things or feelings that other people have such as love, happiness, and success. Shame can hurt you and make you feel lesser-than and affect your self-confidence. If the abuser shamed you by saying “You’re nothing, nobody likes you, you’ll never survive in the world,” stop believing those lies as soon as possible. You are just as deserving as those around you. Try rewriting the things that your abuser told you into positive messages, such as, “You are kind, intelligent, and sensitive. Your friends and family love you and deserve to be happy.”"

      "content": "Forgive . Forgive yourself for any guilt or shame you have about being in an abusive relationship. And when you feel ready, forgive the abuser and release this person from your life. Holding onto anger, bitterness, or rage only serves the other person for still having control over you.

It doesn’t mean you let the person “off the hook” or that you’ll immediately stop being angry or hurt. It means letting go of the negative feelings you have for your own personal freedom.

Cherry ice cream or chocolate?” As you gain confidence making simple decisions, you may start to feel more confident about making more difficult decisions.

Finding affordable care can be a challenge sometimes. Try calling your insurance company (the number should be on back of your card) to find out about your mental health benefits and providers in your area. You can also check with your employer to find out what is offered by your employee assistance program (EAP). Another option is to check area women's shelters because they usually provide free counseling or resources/referrals to affordable mental health care. If there are any colleges in your area, then you can call and ask if they have any M.A. or PhD psychology or counseling students who offer free counseling. If none of these options work, then you may also try contacting local places of worship because some clergy are trained to provide counseling. If you need immediate help, then call emergency services or visit an emergency room. You may be admitted to the hospital for an inpatient evaluation."
