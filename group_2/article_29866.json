      "title": "Look for a wide wool blanket or tarp.",
      "content": "Look for a wide wool blanket or tarp. To make a simple stretcher, you will need a long, wide tarp or a wool blanket. Try to find a tarp or blanket that is at least 8 feet wide and 8 feet long (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters), as you will need to fold it to make the stretcher. [1] X Research source If you cannot find a large blanket, you can try putting together two smaller blankets so they are at least 8 feet by 8 feet (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find two poles.",
      "content": "Find two poles. While you don't need to use poles to create a simple stretcher, they will make your stretcher sturdier. You will also need two poles that are of equal length and at least 8 feet long (2.4 meters). Look for wooden poles that are at least two inches thick, as this will ensure they are sturdy. You can use wooden poles that you cut down from a tree and shave down to be the same length and width. Or you may use metal poles. [2] X Research source Make sure the poles are equal in length, as you do not want a lopsided stretcher. The poles should also be sturdy enough to hold some weight, as they will act as supports for both sides of the stretcher. If you do not have poles, you can make a very simple stretcher with just a blanket."

    {
      "title": "Get duct tape.",
      "content": "Get duct tape. You may decide to have a roll of duct tape on hand in case you want to secure the stretcher with the tape once you have put it together. If you are using a wool blanket, you may not need duct tape to secure the stretcher, as the friction between the two ends of the wool blanket will keep it in place. If you are using a tarp, you may decide to use the tape to secure the stretcher. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Spread the blanket on an even surface.",
      "content": "Spread the blanket on an even surface. Start by spreading out the blanket or tarp on an even surface, such as the floor. Make sure no corners are folded over and the blanket is laying flat. You may also place the two poles next to the blanket so they are easy to access. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the length of the stretcher.",
      "content": "Measure the length of the stretcher. You will first need to check that the blanket and the poles are around the same length. This will ensure there is no extra material hanging off the sides of the stretcher. Measure the length of the stretcher by placing one of the poles on the blanket lengthwise. If the pole is not in line with the end of the blanket, you may need to fold over the end or both ends of the blanket so the blanket is around the same length as the poles. You may make the blanket about one to two inches shorter than the length of the poles so some of the pole sticks out on either end of the blanket. This will make it easier to hold and lift the poles once you use the stretcher."
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine the width of the stretcher.",
      "content": "Determine the width of the stretcher. Once you have confirmed the length of the blanket, you will need to determine how wide the stretcher is going to be. Start by placing one pole lengthwise about two feet from the edge of the blanket. Then, consider how wide you want the stretcher to be. If you are trying to fit someone who is of average weight and height, you may place the other pole lengthwise two feet away (0.7 meters) from the first pole. [5] X Research source If you are trying to fit someone who is a bit bigger or wider, you may space out the poles so there are three feet (0.9 meters) between the two poles. Try not to make the distance between the two poles too big, as you will need enough material on either side of the poles to fold over the poles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the blanket or tarp over the poles.",
      "content": "Fold the blanket or tarp over the poles. Now that the poles are in place, you will take one end of the blanket and fold it over the poles. It may only cover one of the poles and lay just behind the second pole. This is fine. Make sure the blanket lays flat over the poles. [6] X Research source Then, take the other end of the blanket and fold it over the other pole. The two ends of the blanket should overlap each other. Make sure the poles stay straight lengthwise as you fold over the blanket. If you are not using poles, then you will wait until the person is on the blanket before doing anything to the sides.

    {
      "title": "Secure the stretcher with tape, if necessary.",
      "content": "Secure the stretcher with tape, if necessary. The two ends of the blanket should create enough friction to stay together on their own. If you want to make sure the stretcher is secure, you may use duct tape to secure the two ends of the blanket or the tarp. You may use one long strip of tape to keep the two ends of the blanket or the tarp together. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the stretcher next to the injured person.",
      "content": "Lay the stretcher next to the injured person. To put an injured person on the stretcher, you should first move the stretcher so it is only a few feet away from the injured person. If the person is on a bed or a raised area, try to place the stretcher just below the person. This will make it easier to transfer the person to the stretcher."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the person onto the stretcher.",
      "content": "Lift the person onto the stretcher. Tell the person, “We are going to move you onto the stretcher now.” You may then need someone to help you carefully slide or lift the person towards the stretcher. If the person is able to lift themselves up with their arms, they may do so and lay themselves down on the stretcher. If the person is lying down on a bed with a sheet, you may have the person cross their arms over their chest. Then, you may have someone help you lift the sheet the person is lying on, cradling the person, and place it on the stretcher. If the person has any head injuries, have a third person hold the person's head steady as they are lifted so their head does not shift or move around. Place the person in the middle of the blanket."

      "title": "Have two people raise the stretcher.",
      "content": "Have two people raise the stretcher. Once the person is situated on the stretcher, you should have one person raise the back end, closest to the person's head, with their body facing forward. The other person should raise the front end of the stretcher, closest to the person's legs, with their body facing away from the person on the stretcher. [9] X Research source Then, you may count together \"1, 2, 3\" and lift the person on the stretcher on \"3.\" This will make it easier to lift the stretcher evenly and bring the person to safety. If you are not using poles, then you will need two people on each side of the blanket. Have the partners on each side roll up a few inches of the blanket on their side until the roll is thick enough to grasp and hold onto. As one unit, all four people will lift the blanket together to transport the person. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Carry the person in the stretcher.",
      "content": "Carry the person in the stretcher. You and the other person may try to coordinate your movements so the stretcher stays even and steady. This could be done by counting each step you take together out loud or by trying to find a rhythm to walk to so you are both walking at the same pace. [11] X Research source Make sure you keep a good grip on the stretcher poles and the person carrying the other end of the stretcher does the same. You do not want the injured person in the stretcher to be bounced around, as this could lead to further injuries."
