    {
      "title": "Get a disposable camera.",
      "content": "Get a disposable camera. They're about 20 bucks at Walmart. Disposable cameras from Kodak are easier to open, so if you are purchasing a camera for this project make sure to use a Kodak. Feel free to use the camera normally before attempting this project. Instead of handing the camera to a photo developing service, you can extract the film and give that instead. There is a window on the top of the camera showing how many photos you have left. Make sure this is empty before attempting this project, otherwise you will waste the film."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open up the disposable camera.",
      "content": "Open up the disposable camera. Remove or cut the label surrounding the camera. The seam is on the side, which is the side which needs to be cut. Pry the enclosure open with a flathead screwdriver. There should be a clip on one side that needs to be carefully opened. Make sure to use the camera before disassembling the device, otherwise you will destroy the film. A disposable camera automatically winds the film into the can after you take each shot, so all photos you take will be safe. If you took all the pictures, there should be no film sticking out of the can. Make sure the flash is discharged before disassembling the device. Press the shutter button to discharge the flash."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the battery out.",
      "content": "Take the battery out. A disposable camera contains a capacitor used for the flash, which can cause electric shock even after the battery is removed. A capacitor is cylindrical and has two leads (wires sticking out of it). Discharge the capacitor by shorting the leads using an insulated screwdriver."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take out any non-electrical parts.",
      "content": "Take out any non-electrical parts. Take the film can out of the device. You can hand this can to a photo shop to get it developed. If you didn't take any pictures, all the film will be wrapped around another spool and it will be more difficult to remove. You will also destroy a perfectly good film roll. Make sure you took all the pictures before disassembly."

      "title": "Take two strips of metal.",
      "content": "Take two strips of metal. You're going to need metal that is highly conductive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap or solder the ends of the metal strips to the wires leading up to the capacitor.",
      "content": "Wrap or solder the ends of the metal strips to the wires leading up to the capacitor. The capacitor is cylindrical, often black or blue. It will have text printed on it, showing voltage (V) and microfarads (ÂµF). Make sure the capacitor is discharged before touching anywhere around it. Short the leads using an insulated screwdriver."

      "content": "Put the battery in carefully."
    },
    {
      "title": "Charge the flash.",
      "content": "Charge the flash. There is a button which is used to charge the capacitor. Hold this button to charge the mechanism."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test it on a piece of metal.",
      "content": "Test it on a piece of metal. Touch the ends of the wires to any conductive material and the capacitor will discharge into it. Make sure you are not touching the metal in any way. Do not touch electrical ground. If you are grounded and accidentally touch the metal, there will be a direct path to ground through your heart and you will die. You do not need to press the shutter button. The exposed wires are live at all times when the flash is charged. Be careful to avoid leaving this around in it's charged state as it can be dangerous."
