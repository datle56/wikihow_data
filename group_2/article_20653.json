      "title": "Set your budget.",
      "content": "Set your budget. You will be responsible for the entire cost of the project. Before you proceed, you need to know how much money you can afford to spend and have the financing in place. You can have the money yourself or you can gain access to the funding through bank loans, but either way, you will need to have enough money to set aside for buying and fixing a home. Determine an overall budget and let the Scott brothers guide you from there. For instance, if you can afford to spend $75,000 total, prepare this basic figure without worrying how much to set aside for buying the house and how much to set aside for renovating it. The show's hosts will be able to help you with those figures. Budgets usually range anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000. [1] X Research source The Scott brothers usually finish on budget, but they have been known to go several thousand dollars over budget on rare occasions."

      "title": "Know what you want.",
      "content": "Know what you want. Determine what you hope to find when searching for a new home. Classify which features are “must-haves” and which features you can afford to compromise on. Make a list of important features, including everything from location to individual room size. The more you know about what your ideal home would look like, the closer you can get to achieving it. Some features, like a certain amount of yard space or a decent school system, cannot be easily changed even if you renovate. Mark these down and determine which ones are features that you cannot budge on and which you would be willing to give up if necessary. Knowing which features you must have will help the Scott brothers find the right home for you if you are selected for the show. Go through your remaining list and look at all the features that can be changed through renovations. Mark down which of these features you must have and which you can sacrifice if you do not have enough money. Knowing which of these features are absolute necessaries will help the Scott brothers figure out what to focus on as they plan their renovations, should you be selected."

      "content": "Know what to expect. Prepare yourself for what the Scott brothers might require of you. You will probably need to help with the renovations, especially if you have a fairly small budget. Expect to knock down walls and to work within the show's time frame. Familiarize yourself with the show before applying. Study episodes of the show, including each couple's background story and how much participating couples are expected to help with. Understanding the background story will help you to tailor your application so that you stand out to the show's producers. Knowing how much work you will be expected to contribute will keep you from being thrown off guard if you are selected."

[2] X Research source Check under the \"About\" section of the page for information about whether or not the show is currently accepting applications. Take note of the geographic area currently eligible. Casting is almost always restricted to a certain area. Since the show is based in Canada, casting is most often open to residents of Vancouver or other regions of Canada. Occasionally, though, the show does open up opportunities for residents in the United States. The show also has a Twitter feed that you can monitor for similar updates.

      "content": "Show some enthusiasm. In order to be chosen for the show, you will need to show considerable personality and dedication. As you describe your situation, you should also be prepared to demonstrate your willingness to participate. The vast majority of people on the show end up helping with the renovations. If you are unable to do so, make sure to have willing friends and family who can help. Let them know what your budget is. This information is not strictly necessary, but providing it lets the Scott brothers know what to expect and also lets the casting director know that you are serious about making things work. Consider mailing in a video application. [5] X Research source Take footage of your current living space and explain in a voice-over why you need something more. Upload the video online and e-mail the link. A video is a good way to convey excitement and demonstrate your personality."

      "content": "Watch out for special opportunities. [6] X Research source Sometimes, Property Brothers will put out a casting call for those who are only interested in updating their current home rather than those who are looking to buy. These opportunities are rarer, but they might make it possible for you to get help on an even tighter budget than usual. These applications should be e-mailed to: bvbcasting@gmail.com Check the eligibility requirements. The show will still restrict applications by geographic location. In addition, there may also be limits on the style of home. Include complete contact information. This includes your full name, home address, phone number, and e-mail address. Provide information about your situation. You should include a short description about your family's living situation, needs, and desires. You should also describe what property enhancement ideas you have. Attach photographs. You should include a recent picture of everyone living in the home, two or three pictures of every room in the house, at least one picture of the front of the house, and at least one picture of the back of your house."

      "content": "Wait to be contacted. If you are chosen for the show, the producers will contact you. Oftentimes, you will hear back from the show within a week if they are interested. On occasion, though, it could take a couple of months before you get a reply. Response time mostly depends on the number of applicants. You may not receive a rejection e-mail if you are not chosen for the show. If you have not received a reply by the time the application process closes, your home has not been selected."

      "title": "Understand your commitment.",
      "content": "Understand your commitment. You will likely be asked to sign a contract before appearing on the show. You are completely responsible for the cost of buying your home and renovating it. You will not need to pay the Scott brothers, however, nor will you need to contribute to their travel expenses. A large portion of the initial responsibility for finding the home will also fall to you. The producers may ask that you find a real estate agent in your area who can find fixer-up homes in decent neighborhoods, especially if you live outside of the show's usual filming area. You will need to be prepared to work on the show's schedule. This means being able to move out of your current home and into your new home within a few months. For instance, if you are selected for the show by late September, you can expect to be filming by late December."

Drew Scott will work with you and your real estate agent to determine a particular house will make sense financially.
