      "content": "Consider the typical shadow box contents. Many people use seaside objects such as shells, coral, pebbles. Some people make entire doll house/storefront/miniature scenes within shadow boxes. Others prefer nature objects: gumnuts, leaves, herbs, flowers, seeds, pods, etc. Take a look at other potential options below. Collectibles: Stamps, spoons, coins, stickers, etc. Scrapbooking: The shadow box provides an great display case for scrapbook elements of all kinds. Insects: Do you have a butterfly or beetle collection? A shadowbox is perfect for displaying them. Be kind to the wildlife though; a paper or photographic collection can be just as interesting Militaria: Medals, insignia, buckles, awards, badges, etc."

Arrange the actual objects on a sheet of paper about the same size as the inside of the frame, or draw the outline of the object onto blank paper to guide your arrangement later."

      "title": "Choose a frame that has deep sides.",
      "content": "Choose a frame that has deep sides. If it doesn't have deep sides already, it won't work well for the purposes of this box. You can buy a shadowbox frame on the Internet or an arts and crafts store. You can even make your own if you want. It’s really just a picture frame."

      "title": "Make the backing rest.",
      "content": "Make the backing rest. The backing will sit at the back of the frame, resting on four pieces of inserted balsa wood. Start by measuring the edges of your picture frame. Now use these measurements to mark and measure out four pieces of the balsa wood. They should fit inside the inner edge of the frame, about 3mm/ 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.3 cm) shallower than the frame sides."

      "title": "Cut the balsa wood.",
      "content": "Cut the balsa wood. When cutting, make sure the balsa lengths are the same length as the frame. Make the width lengths slightly shorter, as they need to slip inside the two other longer lengths. Trust your measurements."
