Interpolation can be used for such things as finding a logarithm or trigonometric function value or for the corresponding gas pressure or volume for a given temperature in chemistry. [2] X Research source Because scientific calculators have largely replaced logarithmic and trigonometric tables, we’ll use as our example for finding an interpolated value that of finding the pressure of a gas for a temperature whose value isn’t listed in the reference table or as a graph point. For the equation we’ll derive, we’ll represent the value that we want to find a corresponding value for as ‘’x’’ and the interpolated value we want to find as ‘’y’’. (We’ll use these labels, because on a graph, the value we know would be plotted on the horizontal, or x-axis, and the value we’re trying to find would be plotted on the vertical, or y-axis.) Our ‘’x’’ value will be the temperature of the gas, which for this example will be 37 °C (99 °F)."

      "content": "Find the closest values below and above the value of x in the table or on the graph. Our reference table doesn’t give a gas pressure for 37 °C (99 °F), but it does list values for 30 °C (86 °F) and 40 °C (104 °F). The gas pressure at 30 °C (86 °F) is 3 kilopascals (kPa) and the pressure at 40 °C (104 °F) is 5 kPa. Because we’re representing the temperature of 37 °C (99 °F) with ‘’x’’, we’ll represent the temperature of 30 degrees as ‘’x 1 ’’ and the value of 40 degrees as ‘’x 2 ’’. Because we’re representing the pressure were trying to find with ‘’y’’, we’ll represent the pressure of 3 kPa at 30 °C (86 °F) as ‘’y 1 ’’ and the pressure of 5 kPa at 40 °C (104 °F) as ‘’y 2 ’’."

      "content": "Find the interpolated value mathematically. The equation for finding the interpolated value can be written as y = y 1 + ((x – x 1 )/(x 2 - x 1 ) * (y 2 - y 1 )) [3] X Research source Plugging in the values for x, x 1 , and x /2 in their places gives (37 – 30)/(40 -30), which reduces to 7/10 or 0.7. Plugging in the values for y 1 and y 2 at the end of the equation gives (5 – 3) or 2. Multiplying 0.7 by 2 gives a product of 1.4. Adding 1.4 to the value of y 1 , or 3, gives a value of 4.4 kPa. Checking this against our original values, 4.4 falls between 3 kPa at 30 °C (86 °F) and 5 kPa at 40 °C (104 °F), and because 37 is closer to 40 than it is to 30, the result should be closer to 5 kPa than it is to 3 kPa.
