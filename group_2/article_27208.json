Obtain flint by breaking gravel with your hand or a shovel. Get the iron ingot (the \"steel\" part) by mining a piece of iron ore using a stone pickaxe, then smelting the ore into an iron ingot with a furnace. Create a crafting table by gathering wood, constructing wood planks, and using the wood planks to build the table."

Avoid walking over the floating gravel that can generate in the Nether. The last thing you want is for a ghast's fireball to update those blocks while you’re on them.

Fortunately, you can use fishing rods, to pull the ghast towards you. Be careful, as they “will” still be shooting at you, which will create holes in the ground and light it (and you) on fire. Fire resistance potions are practically necessary for this part. Because of how close you have to be to the ghast in order to hook it on your rod, you won't be able to dodge their constant fireball assault.

When lightning (naturally) spawns, a block is randomly chosen within any loaded chunks for it to strike, so it's a good idea to build multiple target and spread them out, thereby increasing the chance of one getting struck.

The specific mob doesn't matter, although it's best to avoid using Creepers or Villagers as your targets since these turn into Charged Creepers and Witches respectively when struck by lightning. This won't work if the mob is underneath a block; they must be directly exposed to the sky, Don't use other flammable blocks like wool or wood for the platform, as those will be almost immediately put out by the rain."
