      "title": "Build a winning streak.",
      "content": "Build a winning streak. Building a winning streak is essential to improve your MMR as the more wins you have in a row, the more likely your MMR will improve. It's recommended to keep playing if you are having a good day and your games are going quite well. However, if you start losing, then it's time to stop the games for the day. You should always have that mentality that you are going to win the game and don't give up if your teammates are feeding. Try to always pick your best roles and champions so your performance is at its best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dodge lost games.",
      "content": "Dodge lost games. Dodging games technically helps you improve your MMR. Sometimes you will need to dodge unwinnable games. That doesn't mean that you have to dodge every single game, only dodge those games where you have trollers in your team and you think that is nearly impossible to win. You can always check if your team is good or not by checking their op.gg statistics. It's safe to say that dodging games when your team is flaming in the champion selection is very recommended. It is correct that you will lose a little amount of LP but at least your MMR won't be affected by it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Duo with higher MMR.",
      "content": "Duo with higher MMR. If you're for example Platinum IV and you're going against Gold players then you clearly have a bad MMR. When you Duo Queue with a player who got has good MMR than yours then you are going to improve the average MMR for your team, which is going to get you more LP when you win games and less LP when you lose games."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy coaching services.",
      "content": "Buy coaching services. To get a better MMR and win games more consistently then you should consider trying sites that provide coaching and boosting services. Using such services will help you improve as a player and make the game a little easier for you as true professionals will help you improve your mistakes and let you know what goes wrong and makes you lose games."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn from the pros.",
      "content": "Learn from the pros. Watching professional players play the game at a high level allows you to gain substantial experience that you should apply in your games. There are a lot of League of Legends streamers such as Jankos, TFBlade, and Faker. Make sure to have the urge to learn and improve while watching those streams as it is impressive how much knowledge and experience you can gain from only watching."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have good communication.",
      "content": "Have good communication. Since League of Legends is a team game then that means that communicating with your team is super important to winning games. The team that has more effective communication is the team that is most likely to win the game. To improve your communication, make sure to call out the position you would like to play before the game starts. You could also reveal to your team certain information that could add value to their game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Master a champion.",
      "content": "Master a champion. Try to play with a champion and get the most out of that champion. Some players like to play different champions and do not perform that well and the reason for that is because they are not used to that specific champion and are only playing it to try it. One-tricking a champion will allow you to learn every aspect of that champion and make you perform better in games. Building a good champions pool should be very efficient if you use this method."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch your own VODs.",
      "content": "Watch your own VODs. Learning is always a part of improving. When you lose a game, don't go ahead and queue again, but rather watch your VODs and learn from your own mistakes. \"Why did I die\" and \"what should I have done better to win this game\" are questions that could help you improve your next game so make sure to answer those questions yourself before jumping into the next round."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be greedy with resources.",
      "content": "Be greedy with resources. Being the MVP of your game should be your number one. This means that you should farm as much as you can, take as many camps as possible, and as many resources as your team can give you. You only have one factor you can truly control, yourself, so that means you should make yourself as strong as possible, because you know you can carry but you can't be so sure about your teammates, your teammates can be a gamble sometimes, so your best bet is on yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Believe in yourself.",
      "content": "Believe in yourself. You should always have the winner mentality meaning that you shouldn't go in a game with the \"I'm going to lose\" mentality. Motivate yourself and your team so you can win games. Confidence is quite important even in games so always do your best, encourage yourself that you have got what it takes to win games, and watch how it goes for you."
