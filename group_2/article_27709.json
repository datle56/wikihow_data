      "content": "Sleep in braids for loose or tight waves. When your hair is damp, apply a small amount of styling serum to your fingers and work it through your hair. Divide your hair into however many sections you like and braid each section tightly. You can braid your hair in 2 or more French braids, cornrows, or individual 3-strand braids. Secure the bottoms of each braid with an elastic hairband and sleep on the braids. [1] X Research source In the morning, undo your braids and comb your fingers through your hair. Apply volumizing hairspray to get the curls to stay. For tight waves, divide your hair into many sections and make 6 to 10 small, tight braids when you braid your hair at night. For loose waves, braid your hair into 1 or 2 braids to sleep in."

      "content": "Make pin curls with mini spiral buns. When your hair is damp, take a strand however thick you like, and twist it from top to bottom. When the twist is all the way to your roots, wrap the twist in a circle against your scalp and pin it down with 2 bobby pins crossed over each other. Make these mini buns all over your head, and go to sleep with them in. [2] X Research source Remove the buns in the morning and watch your curls unfold. Spray them with hairspray to make them last for the day. You can make the buns as big or small as you like; use more hair in each twist for bigger buns and looser curls, and less hair in each twist for small buns and tighter curls."

      "content": "Wear a sock-bun overnight for loose curls. When your hair is almost dry after your shower, apply styling serum to it and secure it in a high ponytail with an elastic hairband. Take a sock-bun and put all of your hair through it, then divide your hair in half. Wrap both sections tightly around the sock bun on either side, and secure the ends to your roots with a bobby pin. [3] X Research source Release your hair from the sock-bun in the morning and spray it with hairspray to get your curls to hold. You can purchase sock-buns at beauty supply stores or online, or make your own by cutting the toe out of a sock and rolling the sock up into a thick circle. Keep in mind that a sock bun works best with long hair."

      "content": "Roll your hair in soft curlers overnight for various sized curls. Purchase soft curling rollers at a beauty supply store. Choose small rollers if you’d like tighter curls, or large roller for loose waves. Wrap your damp hair in the rollers before bed and secure them in place with clips. [4] X Research source Some rollers come with securing clips, which are often easier to use than bobby pins or other hairclips overnight. Others are bendable and you can simply bend them to keep them in place. Unroll your hair from the rollers in the morning and spray your hair with hairspray for curls that last all day."

      "content": "Buy a 1 in (2.5 cm) iron for short or medium length hair. If your hair is only a bit past your shoulders or shorter, you should use a thinner 1 in (2.5 cm) iron for your hair. A thicker one may not give you the amount of curls that you want. [5] X Research source Shop for curling irons online or at beauty supply or department stores. A larger 1.25 in (3.2 cm) thick iron is best to use on hair that’s past shoulder-length. Using a thinner iron may not curl all of your strand each time you roll it up."

Use volumizing mousse or hairspray to coat most of your hair with a thin layer.

      "content": "Set the iron temperature according to your hair’s thickness. If you have a curling iron that allows you to change the temperature, you should set your iron at a lower temperature if you have fine hair. Putting too high of heat on fine hair can cause damage to it. For thick hair, set your iron at a higher temperature so the heat gets all of your hair with each time you roll it. [7] X Research source If your hair is fine to medium thickness, or is color-treated, set your iron to 200 °F (93 °C) or below. For thick hair, you can set the temperature to 200–300 °F (93–149 °C)."

Grab a section of hair between your fingers and wrap the entire strand vertically around your iron once it’s finished heating. [8] X Research source If you have an iron with a clip, you’ll probably want to wrap your hair from the bottom, making sure to clip the very end of your strand in the same direction as you are wrapping the strand up. If you have a wand iron, you can start either at the top or bottom of your hair. For looser waves, start toward the top wherever you want the waves to start and wrap your hair around the wand, leaving a bit of hair out at the ends. For tighter curls with a wand iron, start winding at the bottom and use the upper parts of your hair to cover the ends and keep them close to the iron."

For tighter curls with more volume, wrap your hair horizontally around the iron and hold it in a horizontal position.

Unfortunately, this does not make your hair curlier, but it does damage it. 8-10 seconds is plenty of time to heat each curl around your iron. [10] X Research source You can always go back and redo a curl if you find that it’s not holding well. Try applying more mousse or hairspray to that strand before re-curling it."

Take a bobby pin (or a single prong clip or duckbill clip) and gently insert it into the curl close to your head to keep the curl up while it cools. [11] X Research source You can leave your curls pinned up as you finish curling the rest of your hair with your iron to save time and keep those finished curls out of your way."

When you’re finished curling your hair, release each pin from your curls and coat your hair with a layer of hair spray to get them to hold. High-strength or “fortifying” spray will help hold your curls in place longer. [12] X Research source If you have very fine hair, be sure to get just a thin layer of spray on your curls. Your hair won’t need much spray to hold it, and too much spray can actually weigh fine curls down and make them come out. Try an anti-humidity hairspray if you live in a warm, humid climate to keep your curls in when you go outside."

Hair that’s been colored, relaxed, or in any way chemically altered within a month of getting a perm carries extra risk of damage and of the perm not taking to your hair how it’s supposed to. [14] X Research source Some stylists will not apply perms to hair that has been colored or chemically treated at all. Call ahead to find out the perm policies at your salon. Perms can sometimes cause your hair to look lighter in color. Talk to your stylist about whether or not this is a possibility on your hair type. Remember that perms last about 6 months, depending on your hair length and texture. They don’t really fade out, they have to start to grow out."

      "content": "Get a digital or “hot” perm for looser curls on thick hair. There are 2 main perm options: digital or “hot” perms and cold or alkaline-compound perms. Hot perms prepare your hair first with a relaxing treatment, then heated rods are applied and the temperature is monitored depending on your hair’s length and thickness. [16] X Research source Digital perms only work on thick hair. They produce looser wave-like curls and not ringlets. The overall process of a digital perm takes about 3-4 hours and is more expensive than cold perms. Digital perms potentially cause less damage to your hair than cold perms, and you need less styling products to help keep the curls in place."

In this type of perm, your hair is soaked in an alkaline compound and then wound tightly around rollers to create ringlets. Cold perms can get curls closer to your roots and work on any hair type. [17] X Research source While cold perms are less natural-looking at first, they do relax a bit eventually. You have to use curl-enhancing products more frequently on a cold perm, but the overall process is shorter and more affordable."

      "content": "Wait 2-3 days before shampooing freshly permed hair. After your perm, your hair needs time to adjust to the chemicals and damage done to it during the perm. Your curls also need as much time as possible to set; washing them too soon can cause them to come out a bit. [18] X Research source Use curl-enhancing shampoos, conditioners, and styling products on your permed hair. Use a conditioner containing protein to help your hair recover nutrients lost during the perm process."

Only dry it enough so that it’s not dripping, and allow it to finish air-drying. [19] X Research source If you got a cold perm, apply curl-enhancing cream or solution to your hair while it’s still damp and allow it to air dry. Avoid heat drying or straightening your hair with a flat-iron when it’s permed. Too much heat can damage permed hair."

However, to keep the curls that are there looking bouncy and healthy, you should trim your hair in 3 months.
