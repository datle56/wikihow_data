This is a relatively safe way to store condoms as well, as they're less susceptible to damage. An Altoids tin, toiletries bag, an unused jewelry box, or a coin purse are all good places to hide condoms. One downside to this method is that if someone wants a mint or some change, they may find the condoms. It might be a good idea to keep the container in a discreet place as well.
