You can be approved for Snap Star status once you've shown that you create high-quality content and have grown a large audience. [1] X Research source Snap Star status adds a gold star next to your profile if you are approved and verified, which adds authenticity to your profile, business, or brand. [2] X Research source The gold star is similar to the blue check mark on other social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. As Snapchat decides who qualifies as a Snap Star on a case-by-case basis, you are not guaranteed Snap Star status. Once you have a Snap Star, you'll be eligible to have your content featured across Snapchat.

Snapchat does not have a form you can fill out to be verified on the platformâ€”instead, Snapchat automatically awards users with Snap Star status once they meet the criteria. However, you may be able to get verified by informing Snapchat that other users are duplicating or stealing your content. In this case, Snapchat may consider giving you a Snap Star to help protect your account and content. This will work best if you're a known creator with a substantial number of views. If you can't prove that you need to protect your brand or intellectual property, Snapchat will likely reject you. Creating a public profile may help you manage your content."
