      "content": "Ancient Chinese people wore long nails as a sign of wealth. Men and women of the upper classes grew their nails long to show that they didn’t have to do manual labor, which would break longer fingernails.

      "content": "Artists use a long pinky nail to keep their hand off the canvas while painting. When painting, an artist often needs a steady hand for intricate work. Some artists grow their pinky fingernails and brace them against the painting so they don’t have to rest their hand on the paint to steady it. Famous television artist Bob Ross was known to have a long fingernail he used for this purpose. [4] X Research source Artists also use a Mahl stick, a wooden stick with a weight on one end, to prevent their palms from touching the painting’s surface. They rest their hand against the Mahl stick instead of growing out a fingernail. [5] X Research source"

The Polished Man campaign takes place in October and asks participants to paint any nail blue to show support and raise money for prevention and recovery programs.

      "content": "Some men clean their ears or noses with long pinky nails. While you shouldn’t stick anything into your ears or nose, that doesn’t stop some people from doing it. That is especially true if your ear or nose feels dry or itchy. However, a sharp fingernail can damage the nose's delicate lining, leading to bleeding or an infection. [9] X Research source Sticking a fingernail in the ear can scratch the skin of the ear canal or even rupture the eardrum, so it’s not recommended. [10] X Research source"
