      "content": "Brush the baking powder onto your wet nails. Dip the brush into the baking powder, then gently sweep the brush over the wet nail polish. The powder will stick to the polish. Dip the brush into the baking powder each time before you brush your nail with it. If you don't do this, the bristles will get caught in the wet polish and become ruin. [1] X Research source Make sure that your nails are evenly coated with the baking powder. If there are any gaps in the powder, there will be gaps in the matte effect. Make sure that you are using a soft-bristled makeup brush. If the brush is too stiff, it may cause streaks in the manicure."

You can apply this topcoat over any manicure to make it matte. If you want to make regular matte nail polish, you will need a solid-colored polish and cornstarch or cornflour. If you want to make a custom color, you will need a clear nail polish. You will also need matte eyeshadow, skin-safe mica powder, or cosmetic pigment powder into it.

If you are working with eyeshadow, scrape it out of its pan first, and then smash it up using the end of a pencil or brush. Mica powders and pigment powders should already be fine and not have any clumps. You will need only a few pinches of cornstarch or cornflour.

If you are using eyeshadow, mica powder, or cosmetic pigment powder, consider adding in a little bit of cornstarch or cornflour.
