      "content": "Strike up a conversation. Conversing is a very effective way to get to know somebody and to see if they share the same interests as you do. Starting a conversation or just a quick chat will also help you know whether they are into you or not. Just don't push it. Keep it interesting. Talk to them on a regular basis making small talk, but occasionally talk about more serious things or engage in a lengthy conversation. If the conversation naturally deepens and you start to share secrets or dreams, you will bond. Listen a lot, and respond compassionately. Don't make the conversation all about you. [1] X Research source Maybe you should go for broke. Consider it, anyway, when the time is right. Tell your crush how you really feel. Lay all your cards on the table at once. Just make sure you two are alone and that you say it as casually as possible. [2] X Research source Try to be in the same groups if you go to the same school. Always smile at your crush but not too eagerly. Do it just enough to get them to smile back and walk over to you. Ask for their Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook because it's less obvious than asking for a phone number, but you'll have the details.

      "content": "Send your crush flirtatious signals, and see if they respond. Try to send signals verbally and through body language . These signals of interest will let your crush know (consciously or subconsciously) that you are crushing on them, and they might just catch feelings for you. [3] X Research source Give small hints with your body language. This may happen on its own. Watch for signs that your crush is doing this too. Open up to your crush, and don't be afraid to show the person your vulnerable side. You need to let your crush know (wordlessly) that they are special. Laugh a lot. Get a little flirty . Say the person's name. People love hearing their name being said. Compliment the person. Don't forget to be kind and awesome. Touch your crush in a flirtatious way, not in a creepy way. Touch the person's arm. It will show that you like them, but it will not make them think you want to date them if they do not want to. Just lightly touch their shoulder, or give them a high-five, or even a hug goodbye. Bite your lip, coyly smile when they tease you, run your fingers through your hair, and blink more than usual.

      "content": "Make eye contact . These things just happen. Getting someone to notice you is hard, as is keeping their attention. If you want someone to notice you, make eye contact, but not for too long. It's sort of like playing with a small pet and dangling a string in their faces. Pulling the string back and forth keeps their attention. [5] X Expert Source Cristina Morara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. This doesn't mean you stare at your crush constantly. That can give anyone a big creep factor. To make eye contact with your crush, you should glance at them, smile, and then put your head down or look away shyly. This will give them a hint that you like them without freaking them out. [6] X Research source Eye contact also conveys confidence, which is appealing to most people because it's a way of building intimacy. People who are in love have more eye contact, studies show.

      "content": "Create a friendship , and be around your crush more. It is very common for two friends/best friends to fall in love or fancy each other after being friends for quite a long time. Knowing what your crush's hobbies, interests and turn-offs are will boost your chances of becoming their partner. [8] X Research source Try talking to them as a friend first. If you approach the person as a crush, they will only see you as someone who likes them. This could potentially be problematic if they don't like you because they will be less likely to want to get to know you. Become friends first, and then later try to pursue them. Make sure they feel comfortable around you, through communication. Get to know them and let them know you (what you like, what you don't like....etc.) This determines whether you are compatible or not."

      "content": "Spend more time with the person. Hang out with them. Not one-on-one yet, but maybe ask your crush and one or two other friends to go to the park or come over to play video games or something. This way, you can see and interact with each other in a more natural environment. [9] X Expert Source Cristina Morara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. Do activities together. The more you interact, the more they'll think of you. It's a no-brainer! Eventually, you could ask your crush if they wanted to do something casual with you one-on-one. Maybe it's a sport or a movie. Figure out what interests them and ease into the suggestion."

      "content": "Don't push it too far too fast. Apart from having an unhappy or forced relationship, pushing things too fast could also ruin the bond you've already created, which could lead to losing them as a friend as well. Be patient! Clinging is one of the things people dislike most in a relationship. Give your crush their space, and let any relationship unfold at a natural pace. Do not stalk the person. Not only is this inappropriate, but it can be illegal â€“ and it doesn't work. Do not flirt uncontrollably with the crush. Do not make sure you hear everything about this person, either. Don't try to be around them constantly. If they ever did like you, this will put them off. Hang out together, have fun and talk. If it's meant to be, it'll happen. If not, there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Don't try to make your crush love you. Love is not a game."

      "content": "Be a person they can depend on. They say the best relationships consist of the best of friends! Get to know your crush, and they'll get to know you. More importantly, let them know they can trust you and turn to you. Help the person out whenever your crush needs help or support and be there for the crush at the right time. Be attentive to their wants and needs. If your crush forgets lunch one day and you can afford to get them a snack or share your lunch, they'll greatly appreciate your kindness and compassion. Make them a priority, and be there when they really need it. Be the kind of person they can rely on because you do what you say you will do. Be affirmative. Make your crush feel good about themself."

Watch some more sports games so if they start talking about sports with your friends, you'll actually know what they're talking about. [10] X Research source If your crush loves older music, ask what their favorite song is. Then, listen to the music, and see if you can find similar songs they might also like. All you can do is be yourself around your crush, and see how the cards play out. Remember to pay attention to your crush's likes and dislikes and to be aware of their feelings and their interests, but don't adopt interests that truly bore you."

      "content": "Look your best but, most importantly, be your natural self. Be honest with yourself and think: How neat and self-caring are you? Do you take care of your body? Don't be egotistical and self-centered, but do try your best to look good. Have a sense of fashion. You don't have to be a top-notch fashionista, but keeping your look up-to-date and funky will most definitely help catch your crush's eye. Looking fresh never hurt anybody. Maybe pick one day a week to dress up a little bit, but make it normal and not too forced Look decent and approachable. If you wear dirty, sloppy clothing, your crush may not want to talk to you. If you are going to buy some new items for your wardrobe, make sure they are your style. Figure out what matches your personality and accents your best points. Make sure that you smell good and are clean. You might want to try wearing a light fragrance. Have a distinct scent. Wear perfume/cologne, put on deodorant, brush your teeth and chew gum."

      "content": "Smile a lot, and keep a positive attitude. People want to be with people who seem happy and fun, not grouchy and negative. Your attitude can go a long way. The person you have your eye on is more likely to be kind if you have open posture, smile, and welcome them warmly, either by waving or smiling mischievously. Act happy to see someone, but not so happy they think that you're stalking them. Animals do this to human beings all the time. They act happy to see you, and people become happy to see them. People even look forward to seeing them. It really works. Try to be nice to everyone and don't say bad things about other people. What goes around, comes around. They will notice how you treat other people. Ego and arrogance is never appealing. Be associated with positive things. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Be confident in yourself. Don't change who you are or make excuses. Game playing and people who shape-shift to become someone they aren't will turn people off. People like a bit of mystery, and they are drawn to confident people. Have a life outside of them. The more you do, the more interesting you become. Don't forget to also look cool but interesting. The more interesting you become, the more intrigued your crush will become about you. Whether it's your body shape or your witty comebacks, you have a strong suit. Figure it out, and once you do, work on bringing it out. If you have to change yourself to get your crush to like you, they're probably not worth it. Most crushes don't last more than four months, and someone better might come along. If someone takes your crush don't go crazy."
