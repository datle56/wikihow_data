Mixing your henna powder with an acidic liquid, such as lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, until it is smooth assures that the henna powder releases its dye most effectively. If you are using more than 20g henna powder, adjust your acidic liquid accordingly. For example, you would mix 1 ¼ cups acidic liquid to 100grams henna powder.

Avoid using neutral liquids such as water, or other kinds of liquids including coffee or tea. These liquids will not render the most intense color from the henna. If you are using fresh juice, make sure to strain out any pulp so it doesn’t end up in your mixture. Make sure your mixture is smooth. If you notice that it is lumpy or has bits of dry powder, add small amounts of your acidic liquid until you reach the consistency of a smooth yogurt."

This will appear as a dark band within the mixture."
