      "content": "Consider avoiding sex during an outbreak. Your partner will be most likely to pass on the infection to you during an outbreak. If you want to avoid becoming infected yourself, talk to your partner about avoiding sexual activity during an outbreak.

      "title": "Use condoms or dental dams.",
      "content": "Use condoms or dental dams. Using condoms or dental dams during sex can reduce the transmission rates of genital herpes. Keep in mind herpes can affect parts of the skin not covered by a condom or dental dam so such protective methods do not completely eliminate the risk. [2] X Research source Be aware that herpes can be spread by both vaginal or anal sex. Use of latex condoms can greatly cut down on transmission rates of genital herpes. Transmission rates are reduced by 30 â€“ 50% when latex condoms are used properly. Dental dams may not provide as much protection as condoms but can still be effective at preventing the spread of herpes. Herpes can be spread through oral sex. Both the giver or the receiver of oral sex can contract herpes during the act; therefore, to be safe, you should also use condoms or dental dams during oral sex if you want to prevent the virus from spreading.

They will not protect against STDs, but can reduce friction and therefore limit the number of outbreaks. Lubrication will also help keep condoms from breaking during use. Products like KY jelly or AstroGlide are available at most drug stores."

      "content": "Be open to different types of sexual activity. You may not be comfortable with genital-to-genital contact if your partner has genital herpes. That's okay. There are many other ways to have a fulfilling sex life with your partner even if you're refraining from certain sexual activities. Activities like mutual masturbation do not pose a transmission risk. You could also consider genital stimulation via hand, as long as you wash your hands shortly after contact. Experiment with your partner with alternative sexual practices. Be creative and find out what feels right for the two of you. If you share sex toys, make sure you thoroughly clean the toys or use fresh condoms after use. This can prevent the spread of the herpes virus. [5] X Research source"

Your doctor can prescribe antiviral pills. Some people take the medication every day, but if your partner's outbreaks are rare, their doctor may recommend your partner only take the medication during outbreaks. Medication is not the proper course of treatment for everyone with herpes. Only a qualified medical doctor will be able to tell your partner if medication is the right choice for them."
