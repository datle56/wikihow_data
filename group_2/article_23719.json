Eat meals together when you can. The more emotionally connected you are, the easier it will be to increase your libido. [1] X Research source In fact, nurse practitioner Susannah Kerwin suggests \"finding something to laugh about together, since shared, positive moments can naturally help boost your libido.\" Don't get stuck in the dinner-date routine either. Make a point of going on unique dates with your partner and trying new activities."

      "content": "Divide up household chores. If a single person is responsible for cleaning, cooking, and taking general care of the family, then this can be quite exhausting for them. Splitting up tasks in the household can make both partners feel well rested and appreciated. It also creates a sense of partnership and cooperation that can extend into the bedroom. For example, try to split up meal preparation so that both of you are cooking and cleaning together. You should also split up your childcare responsibilities."

      "content": "Focus on your partner during 15-20 minutes of meditation each day. Find a quiet place where you can sit undisturbed. Close your eyes and concentrate on breathing evenly in and out.

[2] X Research source Keep your thoughts positive during this daily meditation. Envision your partner smiling, not yelling. Expand your meditation to include a consideration of what you particularly enjoy about your partner or your favorite memories with them.

      "content": "Talk with your partner about your sexual desires. This is an especially important step if your libido doesn't exactly align with that of your partner.

      "content": "Schedule times for sex. This sounds exactly the opposite of the spontaneous romantic tryst, but it can actually work.

Women, in particular, are known to get a libido boost by anticipating these sexual periods. [7] X Research source While the scheduling can remain consistent, what you actually do in the bedroom can be as a creative or traditional as you both prefer.

      "content": "Give each other a full-body massage. This is a way to feel less hurried and to spend time arousing one another pre-sex.

Not only does this increase blood flow, it can relax you both and lead to more, better sex. [8] X Research source Don't worry if you aren't sure how to give a massage. You can't make a mistake if you ask your partner for feedback as you go along. You might say, “How does this feel?” You can also watch professional massage videos online, or even take a class at a local college, if you want to expand your skill set."

      "content": "Include at least 15 minutes of foreplay before sex. Arousal isn't simply a switch that you can turn off and on.

[9] X Research source Foreplay also helps to get your body ready for intercourse, which can make the actual act more pleasurable.
