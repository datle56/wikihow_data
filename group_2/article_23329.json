      "content": "Check for a spotted coat. The Bengal breed’s most distinctive physical feature is their beautiful spotted coat, though sometimes their coats will be marbled. These cats have inherited these spots from their leopard ancestors. All Bengals will, without exception, have a spotted coat. [1] X Research source Bengal cats usually have a shine or shimmer to their coat that is most visible in direct sunlight. Breeders often call this the “glitter” effect."

      "content": "Look for the right color pattern. All Bengals have spotted coats, but they can come in a variety of colors. The most common color pattern is a brown or golden background color. But these cats can also come in cinnamon-sorrel colors, gray-beige, charcoal, silver, or blue color patterns. Sometimes the spots link together to resemble more of a striped patterns, but these are still considered Bengal cats. This is often called a marbled pattern variation. Bengal cats also have a striped black-tipped tail."

      "title": "Notice the large, athletic build.",
      "content": "Notice the large, athletic build. Bengal cats are usually quite large and lean. They have an athletic build and very rarely develop the saggy belly that many other cat breeds get when they gain a little extra weight. [2] X Research source Bengal cats typically weigh between 8 lb (3.6 kg) and 15 lb (6.8 kg) once they reach their adult weight."

      "title": "Watch for active behavior.",
      "content": "Watch for active behavior. Bengal cats are descendants of wild Asian leopards, so it is in their nature to be active and energetic. They have a penchant for playing and exerting large amounts of energy. Bengals spend more time playing and less time napping than many other breeds of domestic cats. If your cat seems quite docile or lethargic, it is unlikely that the cat is a Bengal."

      "title": "Notice if the cat is affectionate.",
      "content": "Notice if the cat is affectionate. Despite their wild ancestry and feral appearance, Bengal cats are very affectionate towards humans – especially their owners. They love to cuddle and play with their family members and spend much of their time engaging with humans. [3] X Research source A Bengal cat will not be reclusive or aloof. It will spend most of its time around the humans and other animals of the household."

      "title": "Listen for their distinctive meow.",
      "content": "Listen for their distinctive meow. Bengal cats are quite vocal and loud, more than many other breeds of cats. They regularly communicate with their owners about what they want and how they feel. They will not hesitate to let their owner know if their litterbox needs cleaning or if they want more food. [4] X Research source Even though Bengals express themselves often, their meow is actually more of a gruff little bark sound than an actual loud meow."

      "content": "Consult a reputable breeder. Well-respected Bengal breeders will be able to provide you with a guaranteed Bengal kitten with documented Bengal ancestry. They may even be able to advise you about a cat you already have to determine whether or not it is a true Bengal cat. [5] X Research source To find a reputable breeder, you should consider looking for recommendations from Bengal breed organizations. The International Cat Association has a list of approved Bengal breeders. Most Bengal cats that are available for sale are at least 5 generations down from the original wild Asian Leopard Cat ancestor. This is because of limitations on breeding Bengal cats. The first generation Bengal is called an F1 Bengal. It will be closer in personality to its wild ancestry. However, most Bengals offered for sale will be bred through several generations of domestic cats to give them the traits we expect from house cats. Your cat will still be wild and exotic, but it won't be a wild animal. [6] X Research source"
