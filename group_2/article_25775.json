Other examples include: 9x1 turns into 10x1-1 = 9, 9x8 turns into 10x8-8 = 72, 9x27 = 10x27-27 = 243."

Reduce the multiplier by 1 for the first digit of the answer (the 10s digit). Then find the number that forms 10 with the multiplier, to give you the second digit of the answer (the 1s digit). For example, for 9 x 4, focus only on 4. Reduce it by 1 for the tens digit: 3. For the units digit, consider that 4 plus 6 makes 10, so the digit to use would be 6. Your answer is 36."
