      "content": "Look for the “thumbprint of God.” Many Turkish Vans have a distinctive mark between their shoulder blades that is often referred to as the “thumbprint of God.” Keep in mind that not all Turkish Vans have this small, thumbprint-shaped mark. Without other distinctive, breed-specific characteristics, the presence of the mark alone does not necessarily mean a cat is a Turkish Van. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Look out for signs of intelligence.",
      "content": "Look out for signs of intelligence. Turkish Vans are extremely intelligent. They thrive when presented with challenging tricks, games, and puzzles. Try giving the cat a puzzle game and see how quickly it can solve it! Try a simple game. Take a small plastic bottle and cut a couple of small holes in it. Then, place some treats or kibble in the bottle. In order to get the food, the cat will need to learn to roll and move the bottle so that the treats fall out of the holes."

      "content": "Consult an expert. If you think you have a Turkish Van on your hands, but are still unsure, consult an expert that specializes in cat breeds. This can be a breeder of Turkish Vans. You can also talk to your veterinarian for suggestions. Be aware that without pedigree papers, it can be difficult to officially determine if you really have a Turkish Van, though you may be reasonably sure."
