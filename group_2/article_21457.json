    {
      "title": "Start growing the sprouts.",
      "content": "Start growing the sprouts. Yams aren't grown from seeds like most other vegetables - they grow from slips, which are derived from the sprouts of adult yams. To grow sprouts, cut a yam in half and submerge one portion in a glass of cool water. Insert toothpicks at three points around the middle of the yam and suspend it over the container, half-submerged in the water. [1] X Research source Make sure the yam you choose looks healthy. If you notice discoloration or lesions on the skin, your yam could be diseased, which means its sprouts could be diseased, too. Choose a yam variety like TDA 291 or TDA 297 that is resistant to Scorch, a fungal disease that causes spots and lesions. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the sprouts warm.",
      "content": "Keep the sprouts warm. The growth process requires warmth, so place the glass near a heat source. If possible, position the glass near a window so that the sprouting yam gets sunlight as well. Otherwise, place it near a heater to absorb warmth that way. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let sprouts develop.",
      "content": "Let sprouts develop. Refill the water in jars or glasses if necessary to keep the submersion level of the yam consistent. Wait for sprouts to form on the yam; this will take a few weeks. Once sprouts are leafy, take each one and gently twist it off of the yam. [4] X Research source Each yam can produce up to 50 sprouts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Root the slips.",
      "content": "Root the slips. Lay each sprout in a shallow container, with the bottom half of the stem submerged in water. Allow the leaves to hang out over the rim of the container. Over the course of a few days, you should see roots emerging from the bottom of each sprout. When the roots are about an inch long, they are then slips that are ready to be planted. [5] X Research source Slips can also be purchased online."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loosen the soil.",
      "content": "Loosen the soil. To ensure that the roots don't meet resistance as they expand, make sure that the soil is very loose and well-drained where you want to plant the yams. When the ground starts to dry in the springtime, till the soil is approximately 8 to 12 inches deep and remove debris (i.e. rocks, root pieces, etc.). Spread compost or manure over the soil and till it approximately 8 inches into the ground, to improve the soil's structure.Rake the area, spray it with water, and let it sit for 2 or 3 days before planting. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make space.",
      "content": "Make space. Ensure that you have enough room to accommodate the slips that you'll be planting. Large tubers need a lot of space to grow, as do the vines of the plants, which grow vigorously. Ideally, you should leave approximately a meter of space between each plant. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the right temperature.",
      "content": "Wait for the right temperature. Yams do not grow well in cold temperatures, so it's best to wait until a few weeks after the last frost to plant your slips. Mid spring is the ideal time to do so. Yams require a long growing season, so don't wait too long into the spring or summer to get started."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bury the slips into the soil.",
      "content": "Bury the slips into the soil. Dig holes about 4\" or 5\" deep and 3\" wide (approximately 10 or 12 cm deep and 7-8 cm wide). Place slips in the holes (dug about 8 to 10 inches apart), positioned with the roots pointing down and the leafy tops above the soil. Very gently fill the holes with soil, being careful not to jostle or bruise the slips too much. [8] X Research source Press the soil down lightly to get rid of any air pockets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Water the plants generously.",
      "content": "Water the plants generously. Newly planted slips should be watered every day the first week, every second day the second week, and less and less as they grow. Be generous in hydrating them but pay careful attention to the crop to avoid waterlogging. Yams thrive in sunlight, so if the soil gets dry, adjust the watering schedule accordingly. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fertilize the plants.",
      "content": "Fertilize the plants. Use a fertilizer during the growth period to help improve the state of the produce. Purchase a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen, an element that can compromise root development, and is high in phosphorus. It is best to fertilize the crop every two to four weeks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stake",
      "content": "Stake the plants. Yam plant vines are not sturdy and require support in order to produce a large yield. Keep an eye on the plants and stake the mounds approximately 4 weeks after the vines first emerge. Use bamboo canes as support for these yam vines, which can grow up to 10 ft. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Watch out for diseases.",
      "content": "Watch out for diseases. Your yams may fall prey to different pests and diseases from time to time. Keep an eye out for the following conditions when growing your yams and choosing your sprouts: [11] X Research source Yam mosaic disease. Caused by aphids, this condition results in yellow and light green discoloration on the leaves. To prevent this disease, keep the growing area free of weeds and use disease-free slips. If you notice diseased plants, remove them immediately. [12] X Research source Dry rot disease. This condition causes light yellow lesions on the outer skin, eventually turning the entire yam black. Use disease-free slips to prevent dry rot. If your yams have this disease, soak them in hot water for an hour post-harvest to lessen the effects. [13] X Research source Mealybugs. This insect looks like a white, cotton-like oval. Mealybugs can hinder growth and attract ants. Treat mealy bugs by removing infected plants and using insecticide sprays for large infestations. [14] X Research source White scale insects. These insects create tiny white scales on the skin of yams and can slow growth. Treat infected plants with insecticidal soap. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep an eye on the plants.",
      "content": "Keep an eye on the plants. Yams typically take about 14 weeks to mature. They should be harvested when the tops of plants start to go yellow and wither. Harvesting generally occurs in autumn."

    {
      "title": "Remove yams from the soil.",
      "content": "Remove yams from the soil. Use a pitchfork or similar gardening implement to gently dig into the soil and remove the tubers from under the surface. Start digging a safe distance from the stem. Be careful not to pierce the skin of the yams when removing them from the ground. [16] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cure your yams.",
      "content": "Cure your yams. Refrain from washing yams after harvesting. Instead, sort yams into boxes or baskets to cure them before storage. Curing can be done in approximately 2 weeks. To do so, place yams in a warm, dark place with some ventilation and leave them undisturbed. This process will allow bruising and wounds on the yams to heal, and seal out rot bacteria. [17] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Store your yams.",
      "content": "Store your yams. Once harvested, yams can be kept for several months. Store yams in a cool, dry spot like a kitchen cabinet. There are multiple ways to cook yams, so look up yam recipes and enjoy the fruits (or root vegetables) of your gardening. [18] X Research source"
