      "content": "Create the heart using red playdough. Start by rolling a small red ball about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) wide and thick. Now, lay a finger vertically down the middle and press down gently to create a small indent. Press down firmly on the top to create another more prominent indent as if it were an apple. Finally, press firmly against the bottom-right of the apple shape to create a small, less prominent indent. [1] X Research source Leave the left side of the top indent (the right ventricle) slightly taller than the right side (the left ventricle). Remember that the left side is actually the right ventricle and vice versa. If you get confused, imagine the heart inside your body!"

      "content": "Attach a small tube of red playdough to the top of the right ventricle. Roll a cylindrical piece of red playdough about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long to act as the aorta. Once you're done, attach it to the top of the left bulge (right ventricle). Create a curve in the tube about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the heart that runs down over the right bulge (left ventricle) and tails off to the right. [2] X Research source Use a playdough knife to make a small incision into the end of the cylindrical piece to represent the center tubing of the aorta."

      "content": "Connect a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) tube vertically to the bottom of the heart. Right now, the top tube is the aorta extending from the top of the heart. Now, make a smaller tube piece about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) long and connect it to the bottom of the heart—this is the bottom of the aorta. Make sure the small tube runs directly across from the top tube, as if both of them make one single piece running through the heart."

[3] X Research source Create 3 small holes in the tips of the tubes using the tip of your playdough knife or a toothpick. These represent the circular inner tubing of the arteries."

      "content": "Run a tube of blue playdough right across the aorta. Roll a tube of blue playdough about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long—slightly smaller than the aorta tube. This is your heart's left vein. Now, connect one end to the base of the aorta extending from the top of the heart. Run it to the right horizontally over the portion of the aorta that extends to the right. If it's easier, break the blue tube into 2 pieces and attach them individually. Start by running one from the bottom of the aorta up to the center of the heart, and the other extending from this point to the right over the remaining section of the aorta."

Now, attach it to the back-left of the heart (the right ventricle) so that only the top and bottom of the tube are visible. Wrap the top of the tube over the heart and toward you.

The size of the cup isn't too important, as long as it can hold at least 1 cup (240 mL) of water. If you have something larger, go for it! You can use a beaker instead of a cup for similar results. Add a few drops of red food coloring for a nice effect!"

Try to make them roughly the size of your straws' diameter or slightly smaller. Be sure to create each hole on opposite edges of the balloon about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.

Gently press one of your fingers down onto the center of the balloon, which acts as the heart. Each time you press down, the water—acting as the blood—from the cup is pumped through the straws and into the sink. [9] X Research source The cut part of the balloon acts as a valve that stops the blood from moving back down the straw into the previous chamber."

      "content": "Remove the balloon neck from the straw and press down on the balloon. After pumping the heart without a valve, nothing keeps the blood from moving down the straw. This prevents the blood from moving through the heart and into the body! Remember that the balloon neck is your heart's valve. This example shows how 1 chamber of your heart works with its valve. But inside your body, there are 4 chambers and 4 valves!"

Standard straws usually have a diameter of about 0.36 inches (0.91 cm), which is roughly the size of a 11 ⁄ 32 inch (0.87 cm) drill bit. Attach the drill bit to your electric drill and create 2 holes in one of the caps about equal distance apart. To create the holes, place the cap onto a flat surface with the top facing upward. Now, aim the drill into the center of the cap and apply downward pressure while squeezing the drill's trigger. [10] X Research source Each hole should be big enough for your straws to slide through.

Mark the left bottle as the atrium of the heart, the second as the ventricle, and the third as the lungs (or body). Your fingers act as the heart's valves. You can skip this step if you'd like, but it helps to better understand the function of each part of the model."

Now, squeeze the ventricle and watch the blood flow into the body! Afterward, let go of the left straw connector and pinch the right straw connector between the ventricle and the body while keeping the ventricle squeezed. Now, watch the blood move from the heart to the ventricle! [17] X Research source Repeat this process to pump blood from the heart into the ventricle, and then distribute it into the body! When the blood in the heart is low, remove some from the body and distribute it back to the heart. Now, you can start the process over."
