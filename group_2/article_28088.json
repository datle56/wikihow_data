Process the fruit until it is pureed smooth. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a food processor, you can puree the fruit in a blender."

Add the pureed fruit, 1 cup (79 ml) of water, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons (43 g) of honey to a small saucepan. Place it on the stove over medium-low heat, and heat it until it reaches a simmer, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.

      "content": "Whisk the gelatin into the mixture. Once the mixture reaches a simmer, sprinkle 4 teaspoons (12 g) of unflavored gelatin over it. Use a whisk to mix it in, stirring constantly. [3] X Research source Add the gelatin to the mixture slowly. If you dump it in all at once, it can form a glob that you won’t be able to get rid of."

      "content": "Return the mixture to a simmer. After the gelatin is incorporated, continue heating the mixture on medium-low. Allow it to come back to a simmer, stirring often to ensure that the ingredients are combined. [4] X Research source The mixture’s texture will change as the gelatin melts in. Instead of have a grainy, jelly-like consistency, it will become smooth and glassy."

      "content": "Remove the mixture from the heat and strain it to remove hard bits. When the gelatin is fully melted in, take the pan off the stove. Pour into a heatproof measuring cup through a sieve to remove any hard bits of fruit or gelatin and discard the solids. [5] X Research source If there are any bubbles on the top of the mixture after you’ve strained it, remove them with a spoon."

      "title": "Pour the mixture into molds and chill them for several hours.",
      "content": "Pour the mixture into molds and chill them for several hours. Once the mixture is strained, add it to silicone candy molds. Place the molds in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours to fully set up. [6] X Research source Because the candy has the texture of gummy bears, you may want to use bear-shaped molds. If you don’t have candy molds, you can pour the mixture into a baking sheet that’s lined with plastic wrap and cut it with a knife or cookie cutters after it’s set. When using molds, it helps to place them on baking sheets before filling them. That makes it easier to carry the candy to the fridge without spilling the mixture. If you notice any bubbles in the mixture after you’ve poured it into the mold, pop them with a toothpick."

Whisk them together well to ensure that they’re fully blended. [7] X Research source Choose the amount of citric acid based on how sour you want the candies to be. A single teaspoon (6 ¼ g) will be fairly sour, but adding more makes the candy’s flavor more intense."
