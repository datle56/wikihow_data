      "title": "Wear reusable silicone nipple covers under thin fabrics.",
      "content": "Wear reusable silicone nipple covers under thin fabrics. Scherer recommends nipple covers to her clients because “they stay on, they’re washable, and they’re virtually invisible.” [3] X Expert Source Dina Scherer Wardrobe Stylist & Personal Shopper Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. These small, circular, or flower-shaped adhesive coverings are meant to cover only your nipples, so they’re a great option for low-cut tops and thin or sheer fabrics that might make your nipples visible. Stick the adhesive side onto your nipple and press it down gently. Wash the covers with gentle soap and water after use and store them in their original packaging for reuse. The adhesive will wear out eventually, but many covers come with a 30 to 50-wear guarantee. Check the product’s packaging for specific wear and care instructions. As Scherer points out, while these covers are “awesome,” they don’t work with every piece of clothing or provide support for your breasts.

      "title": "Try disposable pasties for a cheap, one-time cover-up.",
      "content": "Try disposable pasties for a cheap, one-time cover-up. Like silicone nipple covers, pasties are placed directly over your nipple and stay on using a sticky adhesive. They’re cheaper and come in packs of 4-6 because they’re meant to be for one-time use. Some people prefer pasties because they’re less noticeable under tight shirts than silicon covers, which are thick and might stand out under a tight fabric. On the flip side, pasties might not be as adept at concealing your nipples when they harden. [5] X Research source Try both nipple covers and pasties to see which works best at concealing your nipples ."

      "content": "Wear a T-shirt bra to cover your nipples through everyday tops. To ensure that your nipples don’t show through regular shirt material, look for bras with thick fabric cups, typically called either molded bras, contour bras, or T-shirt bras. They won’t have a lot of extra padding, but the fabric will be solid enough to prevent your nipples from being visible. [6] X Research source Padded bras provide extra nipple coverage."

      "title": "Wear a strapless bra for more support in a backless top.",
      "content": "Wear a strapless bra for more support in a backless top. A backless or strapless bra has two cups that stick onto your breasts with adhesive, rather than strapping around your back and shoulders with fabric. It often has a clip in the middle, like a front-clasping bra, that allows you to connect the cups for more push-up action. [7] X Research source To put on a strapless bra , bend over and stick the cup on the outside of each breast, then clip them together to create some cleavage. Wash the adhesive side of your bra after use with soap and water. Let it dry and store it in its original packaging so you can reuse it."

      "content": "Wear a top that’s made of thick or loose fabric to prevent clinging. Thin, tight shirts can make your nipples more obvious.

      "content": "Look for a darker shirt with a print to distract from your nipples. Light colors like white and pale pink will make your nipples more noticeable than darker ones, such as black, purple, and dark blue. Similarly, aim for small prints and floral patterns to camouflage your nipples, per Scherer’s expert advice. [10] X Expert Source Dina Scherer Wardrobe Stylist & Personal Shopper Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. Avoid tops that draw attention to nipples with darts or other structured elements."

      "title": "Wear an undershirt under a loose shirt.",
      "content": "Wear an undershirt under a loose shirt. If your shirt is loose and flowy but sheer enough to show your nipples, try wearing a thin cami or undershirt beneath. Look for a color that will blend in with the shirt or your skin tone. You could also choose a color that complements your top and pull it out a bit at the bottom to layer your outfit colorfully. You can also try this method with tighter shirts, but the lines of your undershirt will likely be visible beneath."
