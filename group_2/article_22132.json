You won't be able to have a good day if there's something you're avoiding thinking about, like an overdue assignment or a talk you had with a friend that made you feel uncomfortable. Finish it today, or make a realistic plan to take care of it eventually. Admitting that something is bothering you will relieve some of your anxiety. Try journaling about things that are stressing you to relieve some of the stress or anxiety. For instance, if you have a big assignment for school that is overdue, be proactive and ask your teacher for more time. If you had a conversation with a friend that is bothering you, take a walk and think about what bothered you. Try to think of what you want to do next: bring it up? Let it go? Get advice from someone else? Decide what's next and then don't dwell on it for the rest of the day."
