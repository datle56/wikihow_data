      "content": "Try a pre-poo treatment. If your hair feels too dry after a regular wash, consider treating your hair with oil, or pre-pooing, before shampooing. Popular pre-poo oils are olive oil and coconut oil. Coconut oil may even help reduce protein loss during your shampooing process.

You might find that your hair gets a little dried out even if you follow a good hair washing routine. If this happens, you may need to use a moisturizer or sealant between washes. Water is the best moisturizer for dry hair. Some days you may be able to get by with just spraying a little water on your hair to keep it soft. If you do have to buy a moisturizer, search for products that have water listed as the first or second ingredient. Sealants help keep the moisture in your hair, and are often made with oils and butters. You should only apply sealants after you moisturize, otherwise you'll just have greasy hair. If you find a product that contains both water and oil, it may work as a moisturizer and a sealant. If your hair is especially kinky or dry, search for thicker, creamier moisturizers."

      "content": "Use protective or low manipulation styles. Protective and low manipulation styles are good ways to prevent breakage and retain length. Protective styles are styles that protect the ends of your hair by tucking them away. Cornrows , and two-strand twists , are common examples of protective styles.

Low manipulation styles don't protect the ends of the hair, but they can still prevent breakage. They are easier to do and less permanent than protective styles. Twist-outs and coils are examples of low manipulation styles. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Detangle when your hair is damp. After washing, make sure you give your hair a little time to dry before trying to detangle it. If your hair is dry, use a spray bottle and mist it with some water before detangling. Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. If you find that using a comb causes your hair to break, then switch to finger-combing. Some people prefer to use a little conditioner or shea butter to help detangle their hair. Once your hair is detangled, rinse the moisturizer out with water."

      "content": "Trim your ends. When trying to grow your hair, it's best to trim away any split ends to prevent further damage to your hair. Schedule your trims every 3-4 months, when the hair starts naturally splitting. In between trims use a sealant to protect the ends of your hair. Trimming your hair when it is dry will give you a better idea of your hair's actual length. Dry hair also allows you to see more split ends and the true shape of your hair. Trimming your hair when it is wet might be easier because your hair is more flexible. But, during a wet trim you can't see the actual shape of your hair."

Heat tools, such as flat irons and hot combs, can permanently damage your hair if used too much. These tools suck the moisture from your hair and increase the chances of breakage.

Carrots are also an excellent source of vitamin A, though they aren't technically a green."
