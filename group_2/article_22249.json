      "content": "Heads-up poker is a game of poker with only 2 players. You can play any type of poker with only 2 players. But the term \"heads-up\" is typically only used to refer to \"flop\" games, such as Texas Hold 'Em or Omaha, with community cards and blinds. It's only in these types of games that playing with 2 players makes any difference in how the game is played. When you go heads-up in flop games, the order of the blinds is switched so the button posts the small blind. This also means that the action goes to the button first pre-flop. Heads-up rules come into play if you're one of the last 2 players at a full table after knocking everyone else out. You can also play heads-up intentionally from the start. Heads-up tournaments are super popular both online and at casinos."

If you're playing a home game and you and the other player are taking turns dealing the cards, the first card goes to the non-dealer, the second to the dealer, the third to the non-dealer, then the fourth to the dealer. [3] X Research source If you have a dealer, they'll follow the same rule, dealing the first card to the player who isn't on the button. This rule is likely going to be the easiest for you to remember because it follows the rules for literally any card game—the dealer would never deal themselves first."

      "content": "The player on the button acts first pre-flop. As the small blind, you have the option to fold, call the big blind, or raise the big blind. If you fold, the big blind steals the blinds and the hand is over. If you call or raise, action passes to the other player. [4] X Research source Since the player on the button posted the small blind, it only makes sense that they're first to act pre-flop. As the small blind, their bet isn't technically live until they at least match the big blind."

      "title": "The big blind acts first in all other betting rounds.",
      "content": "The big blind acts first in all other betting rounds. After the flop, river, and turn, the action is on the big blind. They have the option of checking (indicating they don't want to make a bet) or betting. Then, action passes to the other player, who can check (if the big blind did), call the big blind's bet, or raise the big blind's bet. [5] X Research source As in full-table play, the amount of the big blind is the minimum bet, so double the big blind is the minimum raise."

      "content": "Play a wider range of hands than you normally would. When you only have one other hand to consider, the odds of you winning with any given hole cards go up—way up. Any ace paired with any other card, for example, has better than 50% odds of winning pre-flop. This requires some adjustment if you're normally a pretty tight player, but if you look at an odds chart, it makes perfect sense. [6] X Research source Statistically, the worst hand in heads-up play is a 3-2 off-suit—and even that has a 29% chance of winning. Now consider that at a full table, pocket aces, the best hole cards you can get, only have a 30% chance of winning pre-flop. What about ace-king suited, a.k.a. \"Big Slick,\" the 4th best hole cards? Only 19%. [7] X Research source This doesn't mean that you're going to play every hand—you still want to be selective. But you can certainly afford to loosen up."

      "content": "Keep your mind in the game at all times. [8] X Research source When you're playing a full table, it's normal to zone out and go into auto-pilot for large chunks of time—especially if you're folding most of your hands. That won't fly when you're playing heads-up, so pay attention and focus on your opponent and the possible hands they might have. [9] X Research source Play a running commentary in your head of what you have, what your opponent might have, and what hands could possibly beat yours. Adjust and correct each time a new community card is revealed. For example, if you've got an ace in the hole and the flop is A-K-4, your pair of aces looks pretty good. But if the turn card (a.k.a. \"4th Street\") is a K, you've got to consider that your opponent might have 3 kings."

      "content": "Turn into a calling station against a hyper-aggressive player. If you're playing at a full table, being called a \"calling station\" is an insult. You'd never want a reputation as someone who calls every bet regardless of what your cards are. [10] X Research source But when you're faced with a maniacal opponent heads-up, simply calling their bets will work in your favor and slow their roll. When you put a serious dent in their stack after a few hands, simply by passively calling their bets, they'll usually rethink their strategy. You end up with a slight upper hand because you've just caused them to change their behavior."

      "title": "Bluff more than you normally would.",
      "content": "Bluff more than you normally would. The behavior of your opponent tells you when you have the opportunity to bluff them out of a pot. If they're acting hesitant or insecure about their hand, that might be a good time to make a big raise—even if you don't necessarily have the cards to back it up. [11] X Research source Since you need information about your opponent to bluff successfully, it stands to reason that you only want to bluff when you're on the button and can act last. Remember, when you bluff, you want your opponent to fold. You might have the cards to beat them, but you probably don't. Get a good read on them, and make your raise big enough that they fold. When you're bluffing, it's usually best to have a hand in mind that you're \"representing.\" Then, you simply play as you would if you had that hand. And as long as your opponent doesn't have it, you're pretty likely to take the pot."

      "content": "Keep a running tab of the number of big blinds you have. If you're playing tight and folding a lot of hands, playing heads-up can put a big dent in your chip stack pretty quickly. Start play knowing how many big blinds you have and keep a running tally in your mind. [12] X Research source Pay attention to your opponent's stack as well. If they win more than 2 or 3 hands in a row, start looking to make a big move so you can stall their momentum and stay in the game. If you end up really short-stacked, go all-in at every possible opportunity. If your opponent has a lot more chips than you, they won't think twice about calling you and you can double up a couple of times to get back in the game."

      "content": "Use the first few hands to get a feel for your opponent's style of play. Unless you get a really great hand, avoid coming out too aggressively in the first few hands. Use the time to observe, especially when you're the big blind. [13] X Research source If you're heads-up after having knocked out the rest of a full table, don't fall into the trap of thinking you've already got your opponent's style nailed. You might know how they play against a full table, but you don't know how they play heads-up."

Make sure they only read what you want them to. Think in terms of telling your opponent a story. You're crafting a character, the opponent you want them to believe they're playing. That character isn't you—it's the profile you've created. [14] X Research source Once you've got your opponent acting as though they're playing the character you've crafted, you'll see all sorts of opportunities to catch them off-guard and go home with the win. For example, if you want your opponent to call every time you push all-in, you might play to make him believe you're a loose gun, betting all over the place and bluffing a lot. Let them \"catch you\" in a bluff or two. Then, when you've got the cards and you're ready to push all-in, they'll be more likely to call."

      "content": "Take most of the small pots. Checking through round after round of betting to the final showdown only to steal blinds gets really tedious after a while. If your opponent checks, bet at your next opportunity. You might not get a lot if they fold, but you'll get something and gradually eat away at their stack. [15] X Research source Remember that every chip you steal from your opponent equates to a 2-chip lead over them. Those small pots add up! Another thing to keep in mind is that it's super rare in heads-up action for both players to have a really good hand. Most hands are won on the strength of a high card or a pair, so—usually—the first player to show interest in the pot is going to take it. No reason that can't be you!"

      "title": "Don't be afraid to push all-in.",
      "content": "Don't be afraid to push all-in. At a full table, going all-in is a big deal—and a monster pot usually means a monster hand. In heads-up play, though, going all-in is a much more frequent occurrence. You won't win heads-up if going all-in makes you antsy. Watch out for an opponent who seems to be betting out of boredom—that's a great opportunity to go all-in and take the pot. Going all-in is also a great way to protect a strong hand against an opponent who keeps raising and re-raising but never for substantial amounts."
