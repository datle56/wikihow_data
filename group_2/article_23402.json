      "content": "Keep an eye out for inflammation, swelling, or bruising. If inflammation, swelling, or bruising are present at the site of pain, this indicates the possibility of a stress fracture. Some areas where you might notice inflammation, swelling, or bruising include: [5] X Research source On the top of your foot. Along your shin (the front of your calf). Around your ankle or heel."

      "title": "Notice the presence of localized tenderness.",
      "content": "Notice the presence of localized tenderness. Localized tenderness usually originates from a specific spot and decreases during rest. Tenderness or the feeling of a palpitating soft object can be due to inflammation in the affected area. Touch the affected area to see if it is tender. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Note any muscle spasms.",
      "content": "Note any muscle spasms. When the muscle fibers in the injured area stretch or tear due to a stress fracture, they contract. This contraction may lead to muscle spasms and more pain in the affected area. [7] X Research source You may notice that the area feels tight, cramped, or achy."

      "title": "Monitor any weight-bearing exercise or activities with repetitive motions.",
      "content": "Monitor any weight-bearing exercise or activities with repetitive motions. Stress fractures are caused by putting too much weight or pressure on the weight-bearing bones of the body, like those in the legs and feet. This weight can cause an imbalance in the growth of new bone cells. Constant overuse of weight-bearing bones can lead to bone exhaustion, which can crack the bone and lead to a stress fracture. [8] X Expert Source Kevin Stone, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Low-impact exercises, like yoga, can also cause stress fractures if they use too much repetitive motion. These fractures are more likely to appear in the feet. [9] X Expert Source Kevin Stone, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Stress fractures usually occur in the tibia (shin bone), fibula (lower leg bones), metatarsals (bones of the feet), and navicular (mid-foot bone). They occur less often in the hip bones, pelvis, and sacrum.

      "content": "Consider a recent increase in activity. People who increase their physical activity after being sedentary for a long time have a higher likelihood of developing stress fractures. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This can come as a shock and be the first sign of overtraining. If you have just upped your running mileage dramatically or recently started a new workout regimen, then you may be suffering from a stress fracture."

      "content": "Know that athletes are at a heightened risk of stress fractures. Many sports, such as track and field, basketball, tennis, and gymnastics, cause repetitive stress on the bones. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This stress is due to the foot striking the ground, causing trauma that can lead to stress fractures. [13] X Expert Source Kevin Stone, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Athletes who overtrain on different surfaces and those who use substandard equipment, like worn out athletic shoes, are at an increased risk of stress fractures."

      "content": "Identify preexisting medical conditions that heighten your risk. People with preexisting medical conditions, especially osteoporosis, are prone to developing stress fractures because they have weak and brittle bones. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones and may lead to stress fractures."

Corticosteroids can, however, increase your risk of getting a fracture, especially if you have been using them for a long time. When getting your injury examined, be sure to tell your doctor if you are using corticosteroids. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Be aware that women are more prone to stress fractures. Women, especially those who exercise and diet to an extreme degree, have irregular periods, and/or have osteoporosis, are at an increased risk of stress fractures. This is known as the female athlete triad and it leads to brittle bones that are likely to break easily. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Reflect on any history of foot problems. Individuals with foot problems, like flat feet or high and rigid arches, are prone to developing stress fractures. This is due to the imbalance these foot abnormalities cause during weight-bearing activities. If you have a history of foot problems, then it is more likely that you will experience a stress fracture.

People who drink more than 10 alcoholic drinks per week or smoke are at a higher risk of developing stress fractures. [18] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This is because substances in alcohol and cigarettes tend to reduce bone density. Additionally, people with eating disorders have reduced amounts of calcium and vitamin D, which are both necessary nutrients for strengthening the bones.

      "content": "See your doctor. Check with your doctor or a specialist, like a podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon, if you experience pain while doing weight-bearing exercises such as walking, running, and jogging. Remember that in the case of a stress fracture, the pain usually subsides at rest. When the pain, discomfort, and swelling do not subside, it is best to head to the emergency department of the nearest hospital or treatment facility.

      "content": "Get a physical examination. During a physical examination, a doctor will inspect, palpate, and percuss the affected area.

      "title": "Get an X-ray.",
      "content": "Get an X-ray. An X-ray may not show evidence of stress fractures, but it can be used to detect signs of a stress fracture several weeks after the symptoms begin. These signs can show when the bone starts to remodel and heal at the fracture site. In this case, an X-ray may help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. [23] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Since stress fractures might only appear as a crack in the bone, their extent and severity may not be visible in a routine X-ray. If the X-ray is unsuccessful, further imaging may be necessary."

Computed tomography (CT) scans take computerized images and convert them to provide a clearer picture of the affected site and its surrounding joints, ligaments, and bones.

These areas indicate that there has been bone repair with a bright white spot on the scan image. However, a stress fracture may look the same as another type of bone injury on a bone scan, so it is not the most accurate imaging test for identifying stress fractures.

If your injury hasn't healed in 6-8 weeks, your doctor may recommend surgery to insert screws into the foot. You may need to wear special footwear for a few weeks after this surgery. It is a good idea to stop the activity that caused your stress fracture for 6-8 weeks after your injury. Ask your doctor if calcium or vitamin D supplements can help you as you heal."
