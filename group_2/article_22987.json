      "content": "Homemade smoothies last up to 1-2 days in the fridge. While smoothies are best enjoyed fresh ASAP, they’ll last for 24-48 hours if they’re kept inside a clean, airtight container . If you have dairy in your smoothie, it’s more likely to last just 1 day. [1] X Research source Leafy greens, like kale, have chlorophyll that can make a smoothie last longer. [2] X Research source Lemons or fresh lemon juice can also keep smoothies fresh for up to 2 days. [3] X Research source If you notice separation in your smoothie after 1-2 days, like a layer of water on top and a layer of greens on the bottom, it hasn’t gone bad—just throw it in the blender and mix it into a creamy consistency again."

      "content": "A smoothie has gone bad if it’s gone brown, aka “oxidized.” Once you cut up fruits and veggies for your smoothies, you expose them to lots of oxygen, which “oxidizes” them. When the ingredients for your smoothies are oxidized, they lose their nutrients. When they’ve been drained of all their nutrients, your smoothie will turn brown, so throw it out! [10] X Research source The vitamin C in citrus juices, like orange or lemon juice, can prevent quick oxidization. When you add vitamin C, you also improve the quality and freshness of your smoothie.

Usually, dairy products that have gone rancid give off a smell like spoiled milk, while expired fruits and veggies smell really bitter, sweet, or sour. Dairy that’s gone bad has a lot of unsafe bacteria, while rotten fruits and veggies carry germs.
