      "title": "Use a clean, responsive mouse.",
      "content": "Use a clean, responsive mouse. You cannot jitter click with a beat up mouse. It doesn't have to be some fancy Razer, Logitech, or SteelSeries model that costs hundreds of dollars, but try not to use a 1980s mouse that's covered in dust and sweat residue. Get a solid, responsive mouse with buttons that don’t stick or pause. [1] X Research source If your mouse could use some love, this is the perfect time to clean it."

      "title": "Tense your wrist with your finger on the mouse button.",
      "content": "Tense your wrist with your finger on the mouse button. When you jitter click, your hand is basically vibrating at a speed and frequency that’s hard enough to click the mouse faster than you normally would be able to if you exclusively used your finger. Set your finger on the left click button, but keep your wrist lifted slightly off of the desk. Tense your forearm muscles; they cannot be in a relaxed position. [2] X Research source Make sure to take breaks often when jitter clicking. This can take a lot out of your forearm, so if you start to feel any kind of strain, stop."

      "title": "Keep your arm locked in a fixed position.",
      "content": "Keep your arm locked in a fixed position. The fewer “moving parts” you have, the less likely it is that you accidentally slip or miss a click. Keep your arm still. Make sure that it is also slightly tense and not resting flat against a surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arch your hand over the mouse.",
      "content": "Arch your hand over the mouse. Don’t wrap your hand all the way around your mouse. Keep your wrist set over the mouse with your finger hovering over the left click button. Everything about your hand should be slightly arched. Keep in mind that this can get tiring, and it takes practice to perfect it, so don’t worry if this feels a little weird at first!

      "title": "Vibrate your hand to repeatedly click the left mouse button (LMB).",
      "content": "Vibrate your hand to repeatedly click the left mouse button (LMB). Flex the muscles in your arm and wrist. Vibrate your hand like you’re trying to shake your entire arm. If you’re doing it correctly, you’ll hear the mouse button click rapidly! Make sure you are not pressing the mouse button to click, but vibrating your hand to click. [4] X Research source Don’t push yourself too far. Jitter-clicking can hurt your arm, wrist, hand, and fingers over a long period of time. Try not to jitter for more than 15-30 seconds at a time. Stretch your arms and fingers after practicing. Try using two fingers if you’re having trouble . You may have an easier time jittering if you give your mouse-button finger a support finger. Try using your index finger and middle finger, or even your index finger and thumb. [5] X Research source Turn down the aiming sensitivity if you’re losing accuracy. Jitter clicking may make aiming harder for you. If it does, lower the sensitivity in the game settings so that your aiming reticle isn’t flying all over the place when you do this."

      "content": "Use online click tests to test your clicking speed. There are plenty of websites on the internet that will test your clicking speed. The average click speed is about 6 clicks per second (CPS). A fast clicker can click at about 9-12 clicks per second. The following are some websites you can use to test your clicking speed: Click Speed Test Click Test Rapid Tables Jitterclick.It"

      "title": "Keep practicing.",
      "content": "Keep practicing. It takes time to get good at jitter clicking. Use click speed testers and try jitter-clicking in-game. Whenever you have an unplugged mouse, try jittering for a couple of seconds at a time. Eventually, it will become natural. [6] X Research source If you succeed, then you should get around 7-9 clicks per second (CPS). If you become a master, you might reach 12 CPS. Good Luck!"

      "content": "Select a mouse that feels good in your hands. It doesn’t matter how fancy or high-end your mouse is if it doesn’t feel physically good in your hands. Always test a mouse out ahead of time before buying if you can. Alternatively, make sure the retailer you buy online from offers free returns if you don’t like the mouse. [7] X Research source Some of the most universally-loved gaming mouse on the market include: Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed Logitech G502 X Logitech G305 Lightspeed Razer Viper V3 Pro Hitscan Hyperlight Razer Basilisk V3"

      "title": "Look for a mouse with a larger LMB if your hand slips.",
      "content": "Look for a mouse with a larger LMB if your hand slips. If you find that jitter clicking is kind of difficult to pull off because you don’t have a big enough area to click (or your hand slips repeatedly), get a mouse with a really big left-mouse button (LMB). The more room that you have to click means the less accuracy you need to successfully click, so you should have no problem picking up the speed!"

      "content": "Try an ergonomic mouse if jitter clicking hurts your wrist. Some people find that jitter clicking really hurts their wrist. If that’s you and you don’t want to give up your competitive edge, try an ergonomic mouse . They may look a little silly, but they’ll seriously take the pressure off of your wrist, which should make it easier to click as quickly as you’d like. [8] X Research source A lot of traditional mice will market themselves as “ergonomic,” but what you’re really looking for with a true ergonomic mouse is a natural wrist position. For most people, that’s going to look like a slightly vertical mouse with the buttons on the side (although every person is different)."
