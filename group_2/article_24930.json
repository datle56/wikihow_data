      "content": "Limit your fat consumption, and choose healthy fats and oils. Include healthy sources of fat in your diet, such as vegetable oils, nuts, fish, and avocados. Go for low-fat or fat-free dairy products instead of full-fat options. Steer clear of fried foods, red meat, processed meats (such as bacon or deli meat), butter, and margarine. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source As a rule of thumb, about 25% of your daily calories should come from fat. Fat contains 9 calories per gram; to find your target daily value in grams, calculate 25% of your daily calories, then divide by 9. For example, 25% of 2500 is 625, and 625 ÷ 9 = 69.4, or about 70 g. If you’re managing a pancreatic condition, you should consume a fat-free diet if possible. Talk to your doctor about the best way to minimize or eliminate fat in your diet while also getting the nutrients you need. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Limit eating out as much as possible, and stick to home-cooked meals that are baked, boiled, or prepared in healthy oils (such as olive oil or canola oil). When you do eat out, look for healthy items that are low in oil and grease, such as salads, steamed vegetables, or baked chicken or fish. When in doubt, ask your server how the food is prepared. In some restaurants, you may be able to ask for a healthier alternative. For example, ask if foods normally cooked in partially hydrogenated soybean oil can be prepared with olive oil instead."

Your exact daily needs depend on your age, sex, and activity level. In general, women need 5 to 5 1 ⁄ 2 oz (140 to 160 g) of protein per day, and men need 6 to 6 1 ⁄ 2 oz (170 to 180 g) per day. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Eggs and nuts should be eaten in moderation. Try to eat no more than 3 eggs a week, and just a small palmful of nuts daily.

      "title": "Go for low-glycemic foods, such as whole grains.",
      "content": "Go for low-glycemic foods, such as whole grains. Healthy choices include bran cereals, whole grain breads and pastas, brown rice, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Choose these options instead of high-glycemic foods (i.e., foods containing refined sugars and simple carbohydrates), such as white bread, white rice, sugary cereals, and candy. [5] X Research source Carbohydrates are important for pancreatic health, but some types aren’t good for you. The simple carbohydrates in high-glycemic foods break down into sugar very quickly and easily in your body, causing spikes in your blood sugar. This can overwork your pancreas. About 45% of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates. Carbs contain 4 calories per gram. Find 45% of your total calories, then divide by 4 to calculate your target amount in grams. Suppose you eat 2,000 calories per day; 45% of 2,000 is 900, and 900 ÷ 4 is 225 g.

      "content": "Avoid consuming added sugars . Foods that naturally contain sugar, such as fruits and veggies, are good to eat. However, go easy on items that contain added sugars, such as sweetened breakfast cereals, desserts, and soft drinks. Eat candy and pastries sparingly, read nutritional labels (especially for cereals, sauces, condiments, and juices), and try sweetening coffee and tea with Stevia extract instead of sugar. [7] X Research source Read labels, but note that sugar contents listed under nutrition facts may not include all the added sweeteners. Check the ingredients, which are listed by weight. If you see sugar or words like “sucrose,” “glucose,” “dextrose,” or “high-fructose corn syrup” high up on the list, that product contains a lot of sugar. Added sugars make the pancreas do more work, and they don’t provide any nutritional value. Recommended limits for added sugars for adults are 100 to 150 calories, or 24 to 36 grams per day.

If you’re managing a pancreatic condition, keep a bottle of water handy at all times to avoid dehydration. In hot weather and when you exercise, drink 1 c (240 mL) of water every 20 minutes to replace the fluids lost due to sweating. [9] X Research source Check your urine to see if you’re dehydrated. If it’s pale yellow, you’re drinking enough water. If it’s dark, infrequent, or comes out in small amounts, you may be dehydrated. Dehydration can overwork the pancreas, and can aggravate or cause pancreatic disorders."
