      "content": "Someone you know may pass away. If you hear 3 knocks on the door, wall, or window in quick succession but there’s nobody there, it could be “the 3 knocks of death.” Some people believe that the knocking is the ghost or spirit of the person who’s about to pass away while others believe it’s a warning from the spirit world. [1] X Research source Hearing death knocking on the door is believed to be more common in the winter because more people are likely to get sick in the cold."

      "content": "You may receive bad news in 3 days, 3 weeks, or 3 months. Rather than the knocks symbolizing something happening at that moment, it may be a warning from the spirit world of something negative happening in the future. Stay aware of the news exactly 3 days, 3 weeks, or 3 months from when you first heard the knocking to see if any incidents align. Something bad happening after hearing 3 knocks may just be a coincidence. When you hear the knocking, you may be more aware of the news or looking for a correlation when there isn’t one in reality."

      "content": "Spirits may be trying to communicate with you. If you’re hearing knocking or banging sounds from inside your home without a reason, ghosts or spirits might want your attention. The spirits may not have a specific message to tell you, but they want you to be aware of their presence. [2] X Research source Most spirits are benevolent and mean no harm, and their energy may just be trapped inside. [3] X Research source Other signs there are ghosts in your home include strange localized odors, whispering voices, faulty electronics, or objects randomly disappearing. If you hear 3 knocks in a dream, it may also be a sign that spirits are trying to deliver a message to you. An evil spirit may knock or pound on a wall 3 times as a sign of disrespect to the Holy Trinity. [4] X Research source Other signs of a malevolent spirit may be sudden uneasy feelings when you enter a room. [5] X Research source Three is the number of unity, of everything coming together or full circle. That's why there's a superstition of everything happening in 3s, and why spirits often speak to us under the guise of 3, like 3 knocks (something isn't complete until it happens 3 times)."

      "title": "You’re becoming your more authentic self.",
      "content": "You’re becoming your more authentic self. The number 3 represents creativity and confidence, so hearing 3 knocks in quick succession may also be a sign that you’re reconciling with all your strengths, weaknesses, wants, and needs. If you’ve been working on building your self-confidence or acting like your true self, then the spirit world may be telling you to keep it up so you can be the most authentic version of yourself. [6] X Research source If you’ve felt like you’ve been straying away from who you are deep down or putting on a false front, then 3 knocks may be a warning that you should start focusing on the person you truly are instead."

      "content": "Knocking 3 times can be a way to ask for guidance from a higher power. If you’re looking for guidance from God or other spirits, then try knocking on a door 3 times to ask for what you want . Keep yourself open and receptive to the spirits so you can hear their guidance or advice when you’re going through a tough time. Three knocks can also represent hope, revelation, or divine intervention."

      "content": "Knocking on wood is said to bring you good luck. If a person says that something bad might happen and you have no control over it, try knocking on wood 3 times as a ritual for good luck. The superstition originated from Pagans who believed spirits lived in trees, and knocking on wood alerts them to protect you from harm. [7] X Research source Even if knocking on wood doesn’t actually prevent a bad thing from happening, doing it can help you feel more relaxed and less afraid of the situation.
