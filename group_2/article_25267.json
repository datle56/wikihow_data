Your mind might be spinning with questions like, “Will my teacher send me to detention for no reason?” or “Will my teachers like me?” When you feel anxious and start second-guessing yourself, take a deep breath. Tell your mind to stop dwelling on nervous questions, and try to think about something you find relaxing. [3] X Research source Say to yourself, “You have nothing to worry about. You’ve had lots of ‘firsts’ before, and you’ve gotten this far. You’ll get used to your new school and these feelings of nervousness will go away.” Remember, it’s not the end of the world if you get lost or show up to the wrong class. Even if something goes wrong, you’ll eventually just think of it as a funny first day of school story. In fact, teachers do not expect students to be able to get to the right class on the first day day - You might get lost or be unsure, they expect all that..... so don't worry so much! It's a normal thing. If you are every unsure where something is located, you can always ask for help! Asking for help is better.
