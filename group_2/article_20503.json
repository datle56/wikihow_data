      "content": "Check the warranty terms and conditions to figure out if your phone is eligible. Only devices you bought from AT&T or an official reseller are covered by a warranty. The devices also cannot have any liquid or physical damage on them, or they will be deemed ineligible. If you bought your phone new, the warranty lasts for 1 year after the date you purchased it. If you bought the device as “Certified-Like-New” or “Certified Restored,” then the warranty covers it for 90 days after you buy it. [1] X Research source Apple products, such as iPhones and iPads, can only be taken to an Apple Store or use the AppleCare warranty. AT&T Certified Pre-Owned phones are not covered by warranty. If you bought the phone anywhere else besides AT&T, use the warranty that the manufacturer provides with your phone."
