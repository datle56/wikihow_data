Some vehicles will not have space in the dash for an equalizer and will need to remote-mount their equalizer. Equalizers can be installed anywhere between your amp and receiver.

If your receiver does not have a wiring diagram to show which wires are switched power cables, then you should use a digital multimeter to identify the correct cable. Connect the multimeter to the cable when the key is in the off position and make sure the voltage reads at zero. Then turn the key into the on position and see if there is now 12V. If the wire follows this pattern then you have found the correct switched 12V power wire. Splice the wires together and wrap the exposed metal with electrical tape completely. This prevents the exposed areas from touching other wires and potentially shorting the system. You can also crimp the wires together but this is not as strong as splicing.

Some vehicles will have space for this in their dash. Other vehicles will not have space and the equalizer can then be mounted under the dash. The final option is to custom-fit your equalizer into the dash. If you have space in your dash, then you will simply need an installation kit to mount your equalizer. These kits are brackets that hold the head unit to the dash and require only a few screws to attach. Your kit will come with particular instructions for mounting. If you do not have space in your dash you will need an under-dash mounting kit. These kits are usually designed for under the dash on the driver’s side although other options are available. There are many different designs for under-dash kits so choose on that you prefer and works well with your vehicle. If you would like to have a custom install then it is best to leave the job to a professional audio installer."
