      "content": "Get creative when dressing for theme parties. Themes can be just about anything from 1980s parties, Hippie parties (or “Hippie vs. Hipster”), Mardi Gras parties, “Luck O’the Irish” parties, etc. You can usually find the clothes you need in thrift stores.

Wear something versatile, so you’re not stuck in the theme all night if you decide to go elsewhere. For example, if you’re going to an 80s dance party, think about wearing a brightly colored shirt, black tights, and Converse hightops, over a strappy black dress. That way, you can just take off the shirt and change shoes when you’re ready to move on."
