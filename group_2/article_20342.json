      "content": "Consider why you want this girl to like you. Ask yourself why you are attracted to girl. For example, she might sense that your interest is purely physical or superficial, and avoid you. [1] X Research source people.uncw.edu/hakanr/documents/unwantedsexattention.pdf If this is the only type of attention she receives from guys, then she might be jaded or feel under-appreciated. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Before approaching her, step back and determine what you look for in a relationship . Next, ask yourself if she is good relationship material based on these qualities: Integrity: is she honest with both herself and others, trustworthy, and dependable. Can you be upfront with each other about your thoughts and fears. Emotional maturity and self-esteem : no one is perfect, but a willingness to reflect on and learn from the past (and demonstrate what you've learned) is a key feature of emotionally mature people. Emotionally immature girls are those that are dependent on others for their self-esteem and well-being, and let their emotions control their actions. [3] X Research source Supportive and committed to personal growth: she has her own interests and actively pursues them, has a general positive attitude about life (even when faced with difficult circumstances), and she maintains good relationships with family and friends and encourages those around her. However, someone that constantly puts their own interests above others, and is overly competitive or judgmental does not make good partners."

      "content": "Make yourself more attractive to women. One of the ways to get a girl to notice you is to make yourself more attractive in how you look and act. By making small changes, you can not only make yourself more attractive to women but also improve your self-confidence . It is often the little things that will make you stand out, such as practicing good hygiene and doing something nice for others (even when she isn't around). Clean-up your appearance: this shows you have self-respect and take care of yourself. Make sure you wear clean and unwrinkled clothing, shower everyday, keep your hair combed and groomed, and your beard shaved or trimmed short. [4] X Research source Practice good oral hygiene, brushing your teeth twice a day and avoiding foods that cause bad breath (such as coffee or garlic). [5] X Research source Avoid wearing too much cologne or body spray – instead, stick with a neutral aftershave or deodorant. Relax and be confident : don't let your fear of being turned down overcome your ability to talk to your crush, even if it seems she is at first not interested in you. Girls don't like being around or interacting with men who lack confidence. [6] X Research source Also, girls find laid-back and less stressed men more attractive and enjoyable to be around.

      "title": "Talk to a girl you like, even if she seems uninterested.",
      "content": "Talk to a girl you like, even if she seems uninterested. Let her know you exist by initiating conversation and establishing a friendly relationship with her. Put yourself out there in a way that shows you are interested without seeming too pushy or aggressive. Ask her a question about herself or a topic you are both interested in, such as: \"hey, I just started watching (name of TV show). Who is your favorite character or what was your favorite season\". [8] X Research source Make a general statement about the weather, school, or something you are eating. Break the ice by asking them a favor, such as help with a project or your homework. Avoid talking about politics, religion, past relationships, or traumatic events. Catch her attention by making eye contact and smile when talking. Avoid speaking too fast or in a high pitch – this will make you look nervous. If walking next to one another, slow down. This will make you appear more laid-back and approachable – good qualities in both a friend and boyfriend. Remember to be respectful. Respect her decision to stay single. Move on without questioning her decision. It is important to realize some people are not compatible."

      "content": "Don't send mixed signals about your feelings. The term mixed feelings refers to the difference between how others perceive you and how you see yourself. [9] X Research source One of the reasons she may be uninterested in having a relationship with you is you send mixed signals. For example, you constantly brag about going on dates or being interested in other women, or you regularly blow off friends. [10] X Research source Talk yourself up without bragging. Mention accomplishments you are proud of, or goals you had and how you achieved them. For example: \"That English assignment or math test was rough, but my studying paid off\" or \"my months of training paid off in the half-marathon, maybe I will run the full marathon next year\". Be more upfront and open about your feelings. One of the mixed messages you may be sending is that you are cold or pessimistic. Make a goal of saying one positive thing a day about someone else.

      "content": "Be a good friend. If she is truly uninterested in a relationship, or there is something going on in her life (family, school, work, health issues, etc.) preventing her from having a relationship, do not pressure her. The only, and best thing, you can be right now is a good friend and confidant. You want to be supportive, but not overbearing. [12] X Research source This is especially important if she is facing a personal problem, such as a death or illness in the family. [13] X Research source Create space and respect her privacy. Do not try to fix her problems or constantly offer advice. Simply let her know you are there and are willing to listen. Be a good listener . Do not jump in with your opinion and resist the urge to fix everything. Let them talk things out and come to terms with things on their own. Make plans as a group and include her. Offer to pick her up or pay for her. Simple acts of kindness, as long as there are no strings attached, can go a long way."

      "content": "Get to know her in an informal setting. If you are already friends and want to take things to the next level, then ignore this step. However, if you just met or are only casual acquaintances, spend time together in a group or ask her out indirectly. This might require you to have a good opener or conversation starter. Start with a pre-opener: whenever you see her, make eye contact, smile, and say “hi”. [14] X Research source Next, start a general conversation. Compliment her on her achievements, or ask about her interests (music, movies, books, hobbies, etc.). [15] X Research source Use this general conversation as a starting point for developing a closer relationship based on common interests and/or shared goals. Be patient. Some girls are naturally more open about themselves and talkative, whereas others might be more shy or hesitant at first. Never use cheesy pick-up lines. Not only does this set a bad impression, but it can also be offensive."

      "content": "Ask a girl out on a date. You can be upfront and ask her out directly, or use a more indirect approach such as asking what she is doing this weekend and if she has any plans. [16] X Research source Which approach you choose depends on the situation and personalities. Other indirect examples include: asking whether she's been to a certain restaurant, and wondering if she wants to check it out with you; or phrase it as an opportunity, such as “we are both free this weekend and the weather looks nice, so why don't we do something together”. Remember, at this stage, you are only asking her to go on a date (to a movie, concert, dinner, etc.), not if she wants to be your girlfriend. [17] X Research source Make it clear you just want to hang out. Don't talk about relationships or ask her to be your girlfriend. Do not corner a girl or make her feel trapped (physically) when asking her out. She might say no because she feels uncomfortable and intimidated. [18] X Research source If she seems reluctant to go on a date with you, invite her to do something with a group of friends. Organize a picnic or go to a dinner and a movie with a couple friends.

      "content": "Make a good first date impression. On your first date (or first time you hang out), your goals should be to make sure she has a good time, you express your feelings in a way that are clear but not over the top, and you do not try anything too extravagant, expensive, or romantic. Go on a group date or do something in a public place rather than inviting her to spend time with you alone. Take the lead in deciding what you will do and where you will go on the date. Do your homework – ask her if she has any food preferences, make reservations if necessary, and avoid places that are upscale and pricey. Make an effort with your appearance – wash and comb your hair, brush your teeth, do not wear too much cologne, and wear clean, unwrinkled clothes. Do not overindulge in alcohol, be considerate, and practice good manners . These involve not dominating the conversation, turning off your phone and giving her your full attention, and being kind to others. [19] X Research source Avoid discussing controversial topics, such as politics, old relationships, complaining about your job, or sex. Instead, focus on good topics such as the news (and her opinion on current events), family, travel (either places you've been or want to go in the future), or your thoughts on love and what makes a good relationship.

[23] X Research source For example, make-up a funny story about travelling to a different country or pretend your house is haunted. Lightheartedly tease her about her taste in music, or a weird food she likes, and then follow it up with a compliment. [24] X Research source Other examples of teasing include light tickling, placing your hands over someone's eyes and saying “guess who”, or giving them a light shove or nudge on the back or arm.

If you know one another and are comfortable around each other, try brushing a strand of hair off her face, give her a hug, or sit next to her. If she is interested in you, she will start flirting back."

Start talking to other girls, and playing hard to get. By creating a challenge, you make yourself look more desirable. [27] X Research source Hold back some of your feelings at the beginning of the relationship. Maintaining a sense of mystery and uncertainty helps keeps things interesting – and perhaps kindle romantic feelings. [28] X Research source For example, don't tell her how much you like her and talk about your \"future\" together the first time you hang out. Give her some space. While you do not want to stand her up if you've made plans, don't text or call her every day. Your absence may lead her to realize how much she actually cares for you."

      "content": "Consider keeping things casual. If you like her and she likes you, but is afraid or nervous of commitment, you can always decide to maintain a casual relationship . [29] X Research source Casual relationships are non-exclusive romantic relationships. While you might see each other on a semi-regular basis, you are open to flirt with or go out with others. Especially if you are between the ages of 18 to 24, having an open, casual relationship can help you grow emotionally and become more comfortable interacting with the opposite sex. In a casual relationship, it is important to establish ground rules to minimize the risk of someone getting hurt: Is it okay to go out in public? Is it okay if others know, or should the relationship be kept secret? What happens when one person becomes romantic with someone else? Will you tell each other if this happens? How often do you want to see each other? When is it okay to call or text? Do not ask questions that are condescending or accusing, such as: how many people are you seeing? Where were you last night? Why didn't you return my calls? Can I add you on Facebook ? If you cannot agree to these terms, then you probably should not pursue a casual relationship. Tell her your feelings and let her know you're interested, but that you should remain friends if she feels she can't commit to something more serious."
