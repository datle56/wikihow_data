Take out a pen and paper, then write the name of the person who you'd like a deeper connection with. Record it 3 times. [1] X Research source Think of a fond memory of this individual as you write their name. Concentrate on how wonderful it would feel like to be with this person.

      "content": "Fold the paper 3 times so it can fit in a jar of honey. Take out a jar of honey—it can be any type that inspires you, from a spicy jalapeno blend to a sweet orange blossom variety . Fold your romantic note in thirds so it's small enough to submerge in the honey. [3] X Research source When you fold your note 3 times, you amplify the power of the number \"3\" to draw in luck and abundance. By the way, there's no rule that you have to use honey. Choose any liquid sweetener of your choice. For example, agave nectar represents passion and transformation, while maple syrup symbolizes balance and longevity. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Brew some tea and add a spoonful of honey to it. If you're extra fancy, you might want to use a ceremonial teapot for your ritual, like a red cast iron tea kettle. Choose a tea blend that strikes you as auspicious and magical, like vanilla rose tea or a blend dedicated to Aphrodite. Sweeten it with a mouth-watering dollop of honey. [5] X Research source Sweeten your tea to taste to represent what you want out of your love life. Alternatively, use an amount of honey symbolizes how much help you think you need from the Universe. You might want to add just a teaspoon for a little support, a heaping tablespoon for lots of divine assistance, or even a slathered honey dipper for a big miracle."

[6] X Research source If you want a crush to notice you, you might say, \"Anyone I want desires me.\" If you want the person you're dating to chase you, you may announce, \"My paramour always pursues me.\" If you want a special someone to become your spouse, you might declare, \"I will have marital bliss with my beloved.\" You can recite your affirmations as many times as you like—you can even repeat it with each sip of tea."

If you want to give the magick a boost and achieve a beautiful aesthetic, seal it with melted wax from a pink candle . Brand it with your favorite seal stamp —perhaps one with a heart design. If you have a garden, bury your honey in the earth so Mother Nature can receive your spell and your dearest wish. [8] X Research source Since you cast a love spell, a ceremonial burial allows the earth to charge it with grounding energy that will strengthen your connection. [9] X Research source It's ideal to bury an enchanted honey jar underneath flowers (especially roses) so they can bless your love spell. Keep your honey jar underground and in a spot where it won't be dug up—it should stay there for good. The intent of this love spell is to preserve your relationship. [10] X Research source If you aren't able to bury your honey jar, put it somewhere sacred, like a keepsake box that's hidden from view."

Fill your jar with a bottom layer of pink sugar, a middle layer of orange sugar, and a top layer of crushed rose petals and lavender. [15] X Research source Leave a little room at the top so you can add a special touch and close the jar. Use equal amounts of each of the 3 mixes, or follow your intuition and see where it leads you: for instance, it might just feel right to pour in a little more pink sugar because you crave some extra romance."

Proudly display your sugar spell jar on your altar or tuck it away for safekeeping. A votive candle takes about 15 hours to burn out, so make sure to keep it away from pets, kids, and anything flammable. If you want to represent all the colors of your spellwork, place an orange votive candle on top of the jar after the pink candle has burned out. Then, once the orange votive candle burns out, put a lavender votive candle on top of it, light it, and wait another 15 hours. The final color, lavender, represents devotion and serenity in love connections."
