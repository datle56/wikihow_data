Usually you will grade with the higher coloured belts too."

      "content": "Make sure you are at least 20 minutes early for your grading, sometimes there are lots of people. When you arrive you will need to sign in. You will need to hand in your grading slip and pay for your grading. You may also wish to purchase a belt. It is better to buy the belt at the start, because often they sell out or close the counter at the end. If you do pass you can wear it. If you don't pass you can just hang onto it until next time. The grading will be like a normal class, you will do a warm up and then your basic strikes and blocks, then you will do some leg stretches and basic stances and kicks. You might do so,e combinations of moves and other stuff too. Many sensei will walk around watching. Don't panic, they are mainly watching the higher grades. White belts aren't expected to be perfect to pass they realise you have only been doing karate for a little while."
