      "title": "Try on the dress to determine where you want the hem to be.",
      "content": "Try on the dress to determine where you want the hem to be. Don't wear heels or shoes that will tilt you forward so the hemline is uneven. Instead, stand up stand with your feet flat on the floor so you can see where the dress falls. If you want to make the dress shorter, determine how much fabric you'd like to remove. [1] X Research source You can try on the shoes that you plan to wear with the dress in order to get an idea of where you want the hemline. However, take them off when you begin to mark the hemline or it may be slanted."

      "title": "Turn the dress inside out and use fabric chalk to mark the hemline.",
      "content": "Turn the dress inside out and use fabric chalk to mark the hemline. Take off the dress and turn it inside out before laying it flat on your work surface. Lay a ruler or measuring tape on the dress and make marks every 4 inches (10 cm) along the hemline. [2] X Expert Source Kpoene Kofi-Bruce Couture Bridal Designer Expert Interview. 28 January 2021. Then, lay a ruler across the marks to line them up and draw along the hemline. [3] X Research source If you're struggling to mark an even hemline, put the dress back on while it's inside out and ask a friend to mark the line for you."

      "title": "Draw another line 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the hemline.",
      "content": "Draw another line 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the hemline. Use the chalk to make a parallel line below the hemline so you know where to actually cut the fabric. Once you've cut the fabric along this line, you'll fold it up so your hemline falls where you want. [4] X Research source If you forget to mark a lower cutting line, your finished hemline will be higher since you'll fold and sew the bottom edge of the fabric."

      "content": "Cut the excess fabric from the bottom of the dress if you're shortening the dress. Once you know how much fabric to remove, use [[Hold-Scissors|scissors] to carefully cut along the lower line you marked. Discard the excess fabric or save the scraps for another sewing project. [5] X Research source Skip this step if you're hemming the unfinished edge from a dress that you've already measured and cut."

      "content": "Fold the edge of the fabric over 2 inches (5.1 cm) and tuck the raw edge under. Take the raw edge of the fabric and bring it up so the bottom of the fabric lines up with the hemline that you marked. Then, fold the top 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of the folded fabric under to hide the raw edge. [6] X Research source Although you don't have to tuck the raw edge under, your hemline will look more professional if the raw edge isn't visible."

To prevent the folded edge from coming undone, stick a sewing pin through the folded fabric. Ensure that you insert the pins vertically so they secure the folds. Position the sewing pins about every 4 inches (10 cm) so the fabric doesn't slide around. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source It's important to choose thread that perfectly matches the dress. This way, it won't be noticeable if someone sees the dress's inner hemline."

Keep the dress turned inside out so you're only sewing through the wrong side of the fabric. Find the vertical seam where the dress pieces are sewn together. Then, push your needle through a few of the fabric's surface loops so you're not inserting it from the bottom of the fabric. Pull the thread until you reach the knot at the end of the tail. [11] X Research source If you're working with thick fabric, insert the needle again and bring it through the thread's loop before pulling the thread tightly. This secures an extra knot."

      "title": "Push the needle through a stitch directly above the folded hem.",
      "content": "Push the needle through a stitch directly above the folded hem. Don't push the needle through the fabric or the stitch will be visible on the right side of the dress. Instead, slide your needle through a single loop on the surface of the fabric so you don't poke a hole onto the right side of the dress. Then, pull your needle to draw the thread through the stitch. [12] X Research source It might feel like you're not really sewing through the fabric, but as long as you pick up a single stitch, your hemline will hold."

Ensure that you're sewing on the folded fabric instead of above it. Then, pull the thread so it secures the fold in place. [13] X Research source Pull gently so you don't make the hemline pucker."

Move your needle about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) to the left and insert it into a stitch on the fabric above the fold. Remember not to push through the fabric to the right side of the dress. Then, make another tiny stitch below it on the folded fabric. Repeat the blind hem stitch around the entire hem until you reach the seam where you started. [14] X Research source If you're left-handed, it's probably easier to sew from left to right."
