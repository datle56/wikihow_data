      "content": "Make dates. Ask your husband out. Take him to dinner, or dinner and a movie, or dancing. Pack a picnic for two. Ask him to meet you for lunch on a workday, or bike to brunch together on a sleepy weekend. Make it clear that it's a date: nobody else is invited, even the kids. Dress up. Plan events that will require you to change out of your ordinary clothes. This could mean going to an elegant dinner, a dance class, or a themed event. It could even mean going swimming."

      "content": "Plan (better) sex. Couples fall out of the habit of regular sexual encounters for a million reasons. The ways that you got together early in a relationship don't necessarily teach you how to maintain your sex life later on. Plan times and ways to have sex. If you always used to have sex at night, but are too tired now, find other times during the day. Shower together, or fall in bed before dinner. Please yourself. Be honest about what makes you orgasm, and what hurts or bores you. Ask for what you want: being selfless kills sex. Ask him what he wants in return, and take turns satisfying one another's desires. Make a date with him, and plan some creative details together (candles, costumes, trying something new.) Having a plan will get you excited ahead of time. Stick to it! Plans are useless if you don't follow through."

Kiss goodbye when one of you leaves the house, and kiss hello upon return. Groom one another. Offer to brush his hair, or put his lotion or sunblock on. Ask for him to help you with your zipper, and offer to tie his tie. Make eye contact when you talk. It is a powerful form of sensory connection.

If one of you drives all the time for work, for instance, don't let it involve driving. Take the train or fly, or walk down the street to the local hotel. Get nostalgic. Take a vacation to a place where you both had a lovely time together. Don't try to do everything exactly the same, but do the things you both liked best. Reminisce, and create new memories."

Try to limit your criticism to one instance a day. Before you offer criticism, think \"is this worth biting my tongue later?\" When your partner complains, listen. Rather than give advice, offer sympathy. You can give advice if it's asked for, or suggest a new perspective if he is thinking himself into a rut, but you might do the most good just by attentively listening."
