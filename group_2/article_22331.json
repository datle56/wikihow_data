Make an appointment with your doctor the moment you suspect injury or notice chronic pain in your shoulder area. Your doctor can assess the level of the tear, and let you know if conservative treatments such as rest and physical therapy will be enough to restore normal mobility. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Joel Giffin, PT, DPT, CHT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. Severe or complete tears often require surgery or steroid treatment.

      "content": "Rest your shoulder. While your tear is healing, rest your shoulder as much as possible. Avoid heavy lifting and rapidly extending your arm or raising it too high. Allow your arm to hang naturally, or use a sling if the weight of your arm is too much. Let your shoulder rest for as long as your doctor recommends before resuming regular physical activity. The length of recovery may depend on the severity of the injury. [3] X Research source Start small once you resume normal physical activity. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about appropriate activities as you heal."

Some basic stretches and exercises include: [12] X Research source Pendulum swings: Bend over at your hips and use your non-injured arm to support yourself on a table or chair. Allow your injured arm to hang down, and slowly perform easy movements in all directions for 1-2 minutes. Prone rowing: Lie on your stomach and bend your injured arm at the elbow. Squeeze your shoulder blade and lift your hand toward your armpit before returning to neutral. Repeat this for 10 repetitions. You can add a light hand weight for added resistance as you build strength. Shoulder blade pinching: Simply pinch your shoulder blades together and hold for 10 seconds. Do that 5-10 times.
