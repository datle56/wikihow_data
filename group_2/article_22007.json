Denying your fears or trying to sweep them under the rug won’t do any good—they’ll end up resurfacing when you least expect them. Instead, take some time to contemplate the things you’re afraid of and write them down in a journal. Once you’ve identified your fears, you can start working on a plan to address them.

      "content": "After identifying your fears, it’s time to confront them. Make a plan to gradually introduce the thing you’re afraid of into your life, so that you’ll become desensitized to it. When you avoid situations that make you afraid, it just perpetuates your fears. On the other hand, when you face your fears and live to tell the tale, your brain learns that there’s actually nothing to be afraid of. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re afraid of socializing with strangers, start by challenging yourself to say “hello” to one stranger during the day. This could be the person next to you on the bus, the barista who made your coffee, or someone riding the elevator with you at your workplace. The next day, you could challenge yourself to talk to two new people, or to go beyond a simple “hello” and keep the conversation going. After doing this for a period of time, your challenge might be to attend a party where you’ll need to converse with a lot of strangers. This would mark the final step to facing your fear.

Try to think of courage like a muscle—with training and exercise, it can grow stronger. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source It may be helpful to cultivate a growth mindset , rather than a fixed mindset, to solidify this message. [5] X Research source When you have a fixed mindset, you believe you were born with a fixed set of skills and abilities, which leaves no room for change or improvement. A growth mindset, on the other hand, means you believe your skills and abilities are always evolving, and that you have the potential to grow and improve. This will help you believe that it’s possible to become more courageous, even if it doesn’t come naturally to you. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Work on using positive self-talk. If your inner voice is overly self-critical, it can keep you from facing your fears and becoming more courageous. When you catch yourself thinking a negative thought, try to challenge it and replace it with a more positive one. [7] X Research source This will help you feel more confident and ready to take on the things that scare you. For example, you might catch yourself thinking something like, “I don’t know how to do this new task at work. I’m afraid I’m going to fail.” Try to replace this negative thought with a more positive one, such as, “This is an opportunity to learn something new and show my boss I’m capable. It’s okay if it takes a few tries to get it right.” You can also recite positive affirmations like, “I’m courageous” or “I am brave enough to face my fears.” Repeating empowering phrases such as these will help you believe them.

If you’re a beginner, it may be best to start with a short 5-10 minute meditation."

[15] X Research source Doing something you don't normally do helps you cope with the unexpected, which is where fear often springs from. If you train yourself to do this on a regular basis, you’re more likely to perform courageously when life throws you a curveball. You don’t have to go skydiving or climb Mount Everest to get out of your comfort zone. Small challenges work just as well! Sign up for a dance class, start learning to crochet, say “yes” to an invitation you’d typically turn down, ask your crush out on a date—the options are endless."
