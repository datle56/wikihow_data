      "content": "Chill your club soda for 15 minutes in the freezer. [10] X Research source Purchase any brand of club soda from your local grocery or convenience store. To make the traditional Slurpee that's found at gas stations, it'll be necessary for you to carbonate your drink. You can experiment with flavored club sodas to see how that will affect the taste of the Slurpee at the end. Remember not to leave the club soda in your freezer for too long or it may freeze. Set a timer to remind you to take it out."

[11] X Research source Pour half of your club soda into the blender and set the other half aside for later. The other ingredients can be mixed with your club soda in any order. Maraschino cherry juice can act as an alternative to cherry extract. [12] X Research source You can also use fresh or frozen fruit during this stage to add flavor. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Blend on high until your drink is smooth. Combining the ingredients together will ensure that the Kool-Aid, cherry extract, and sugar are sufficiently mixed. Make sure there are no clumps in your blender from the sugar or Kool-Aid mix. You can use any flavor of Kool-Aid. Choose a flavor that you like best and see how it is in Slurpee form.

      "title": "Add ice and remaining club soda and blend again.",
      "content": "Add ice and remaining club soda and blend again. Mix the drink until it's slushy. Be careful not to blend it so much that the ice melts, and it becomes liquid. It should have a slushy consistency, and the ice should be broken up into little pieces."

      "content": "Place the Slurpee in your freezer for 15 minutes. Chilling your Slurpee will allow it to thicken. Once you remove it, you can stir it with a fork or spoon to loosen it up before drinking. [15] X Research source You can put your blender in the freezer or pour out your Slurpee into a glass or cup before putting it into your freezer."

      "content": "Add agave nectar or lemonade and ice to your blender. Agave nectar is a healthier alternative to sugar and will help enhance the taste of your Slurpee. If you can't get Agave nectar, you can use lemonade or more sparkling water as an alternative. If you like your Slurpee sweeter, then add more agave nectar."

      "content": "Turn your blender on high until your drink is slushy. Blend all of the ingredients together until your drink reaches the desired consistency. Mixing the Slushee for a longer period will result in your slushy being more watery than the traditional Slurpee found at stores. Drink the Slurpee as soon as you're finished blending, or the ice will melt, and it will lose its consistency. [17] X Research source"
