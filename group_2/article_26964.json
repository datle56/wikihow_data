[1] X Research source There are 16 pawns for every full chess set, 8 for white and 8 for black, and are arranged across the second row from either side of the board. To make these you'll need: 16 1\" long carriage bolts (threaded) 16 hex nuts 16 flat washers All parts should be ¼\" diameter [2] X Research source"

Rooks are valued at five points apiece, and each rook begins with one in each of the four corners of the chess board. [3] X Research source To construct your rooks, you’ll need the following materials: 4 1½\" machine bolts 4 castle nuts 4 flat washers The threading for these bolts should only extend halfway up the bolt. Some stores may refer to these bolts as “hex-head cap screws.” [4] X Research source"

In order to end a chess game, you'll have to trap your opponent's king in threat. The king begins the game between the bishop and queen. Each chess set has one king per color.

Then, one at a time, use your glue to attach the bolt heads to your washers to create the rooks' base. [12] X Research source You may have to hold the bolt head and washer together for a few minutes while the glue sets, otherwise the parts may come loose. Rooks are sturdy pieces in a normal chess set, with a wide base and a shape that resembles a tower or castle turret."

Now you can screw your wing nuts onto the bolts until each nut is even with the end of the bolt. Then: Dab a little glue to the threading just below the wing nut, and then screw your hex nut back toward the end of the bolt until it is even with the wing nut. Then, glue your washers to the head of the bolt to make the base. Knights traditionally look like a horse's head and neck with a wide base. [13] X Research source"

Slip your washer onto the bolt so it rests against the bolt and twist your cap nut onto the bolt's end. Dab glue along the bottom of the cap nuts and then slide the washers up the bolt to glue it against the cap nuts. Then: Apply glue to the threading below the washers and screw your hex nuts so they're even against the washer. Complete the piece by gluing washers to the bolt head for the base. When gluing, you may need to allow some time for the glue to set. Typical chess sets have bishops with a wide base, a slim center, and oblong head with a slash through it. Your bishop will end up looking similar to your pawn, but a little bigger and with a few more parts. [14] X Research source"

Apply glue to the top of the nuts and slip a washer onto each bolt to glue the washer to the nut. Screw a second hex nut ¼\" above the first on each bolt and glue a second washer to this nut. Then: Attach a cap nut to each bolt end, glue the threading below the cap nuts, and twist the closest hex nut/washer so it's flat against the cap nut. Apply glue to the threading below the glued hex nut/washer, then screw the free hex nut/washer so it's flat against the first. Finally, glue the fender washer to the bolt head to complete the base. In store bought chess sets, the queen is one of the tallest pieces. She has a wide base, a long, slim center, and a crown on top. [15] X Research source"

Put glue onto the nuts and slide washers onto the bolt to glue the washers to the nuts. Then: Use some more glue to attach one washer to each castle nut, but be careful to keep the threading unobstructed so you can attach the nut. Screw on one castle nut/washer onto each bolt so the end of the bolt is even with the nut. Then glue a fender washer to each bolt head to finish the base. The king is usually similar to the queen in height, but with a thicker middle and a larger crown. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Separate the pieces. Allow all of the chess pieces to dry overnight. This will give the glue a chance to completely harden. When the glue is dry, separate the pieces into two opposing sides. Each side should contain one king, one queen, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, and eight pawns. Once the pieces are divided, check each individual piece for tightness. If a piece seems loose, you can add some more glue to secure it."

      "content": "Paint your chess pieces. When the glue touch ups have dried, use a clean, soft cloth to wipe away any oil or dirt that may have accumulated while working on your chess pieces. Then paint half the pieces black and half white. You may find it easiest to leave your white pieces unpainted, painting only your black pieces. Spray paint works well for painting your chess set. For best results, you may want to choose a spray paint intended for metal. If you want to make a chess set that is less traditional, choose two different contrasting colors. [17] X Research source"

On the first and last row, arrange your pieces so the corners contain rooks. Moving inwards on the same row as the rooks: Next to the rooks will be the knights. Next to the knights go the bishops. Next to the bishops are your king and queen, with the queen on the same color square as her color (white queen, white square; black queen, black square). Your pawns from a single row in front of your rooks, knights, bishops, king, and queen. White's leftmost rook (from white's perspective), should be a black square. On labeled boards, this will be square A1. [18] X Research source"
