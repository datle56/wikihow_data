      "content": "Visit Vegas at the right time. The dates of your visit to Vegas may increase your chances of receiving a free room upgrade. Travel experts, however, have conflicting opinions on the “right time” to visit Vegas. Visit during a period of low occupancy. According to some travel experts, if you want a free upgrade, reserve a room during a period of low-occupancy. For example, if the hotel is known to host businessmen and women during the week, book a stay on a weekend when there will be more suites available. Visit during a conference or event. Other travel experts insist that you are more likely to receive a free upgrade when all of the basic rooms are booked. This typically occurs during a conference or an event. Hotels may offer you a free upgrade to prevent you from switching hotels and to open up a less expensive room for a conference or event goer. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the right hotel. Some Vegas hotels and casinos are more likely to offer free upgrades than others.

      "title": "Book directly with the hotel.",
      "content": "Book directly with the hotel. Hotel clerks are aware when you have reserved a room through a third-party website. While booking through these sites may guarantee a better rate, it may also result in you being placed in a sub-par room with little chance of receiving a complimentary upgrade. Clerks are more willing to reward customers that book directly with the hotel. [3] X Research source If you see a lower rate on a third party site, call the hotel and ask if they will match it."

      "title": "Book a more expensive room.",
      "content": "Book a more expensive room. In order to receive a free room upgrade, consider spending a little more money on the initial reservation. When a guest books a mid-range room over a basic room, the hotel makes more money. The customer staying in the more expensive room automatically becomes more valuable than a customer staying in a basic room. As a result, hotel clerks are more receptive to the needs and requests of a customer that has booked a more expensive room."

      "content": "Pay with the right credit card. When you book with certain credit cards, such as American Express, you may be automatically eligible to receive a free upgrade.

      "content": "Ask for what you want. When requesting a free upgrade, specificity and the word “complimentary” are key. If you do not ask for what you want, you may just end up with a room on a higher floor; if you leave out the word “complimentary,” the clerk may assume that you are willing to pay for the upgrade.

If the clerk does not upgrade your room, don’t berate them. Instead, smile and thank them for their time and effort. If the clerk can upgrade your room, they will do so. If the clerk cannot upgrade your room, they should return your tip. You may choose to take back the bill or leave it with the clerk.

      "content": "Ask for a complimentary upgrade. When you simply ask for an upgrade, instead of discretely slipping the clerk a tip, you are taking a minimal risk that could result in major rewards. While checking in, nicely ask the clerk if there are any complimentary upgrades available. If there are, the clerk may be inclined to grant your request.
