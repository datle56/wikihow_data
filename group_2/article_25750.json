When a smaller value numeral is placed before a larger value numeral, subtract the smaller value from the larger one (IX = 10 - 1 = 9).

For example, to write 1 million, you’d place a bar over the numeral M (1000x1000 = 1 million). [8] X Research source V̅ = 5000 X̅ = 10,000 L̅ = 50,000 C̅ = 100,000 D̅ = 500,000 M = 1,000,000 It’s rare to see the numeral I with a bar since M already represents 1000, but it does come up in large compound numbers (for example: I̅V̅ = 5000-1000 = 4000). Note: For some large numbers, you can repeat numerals more than 3 times. For example, 5 million could be represented by MMMMM since there is no larger symbol than M (1,000). [9] X Research source Alternative: Rarely, you’ll see a numeral with 2 bars over the top of it. This indicates that the value of the numeral is multiplied by 1 million. [10] X Research source So, another way to write 5 million could be an M with 2 bars on top."

Since C is a smaller value than M, we know that it must be subtracted from M to form a separate digit (and not added to the previous M).

Since Rome had ruled many territories in Europe, these areas continued to use Roman numerals long after the Western Empire collapsed in 476 AD. Around 1300 AD, the Hindu-Arabic numerals we use today replaced Roman numerals throughout most of Europe. [15] X Research source Hindu-Arabic numerals made it easier to do complex calculations. In fact, it’s believed that Europe’s use of Roman numerals contributed to its mathematical “Dark Ages” compared to Middle Eastern and Indian cultures, which made great mathematical strides during the Middle Ages. Today, Roman numerals are used mostly for aesthetic purposes in places like watches and clocks, building cornerstones, movie credits, the titles of monarchs and popes, and the titles of major events like the Olympics or Super Bowl.
