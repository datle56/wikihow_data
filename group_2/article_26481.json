It’s a classic for a reason: this simple strength-building workout doesn’t require any equipment, and you can do it pretty much anywhere. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To do a plank, assume a push-up position: flat on the ground on your stomach, hands flat on the ground by your shoulders. Then lift yourself up on your hands and toes so that your arms are fully extended and your body forms a straight line from head to toe. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hold this position for 30 seconds at a time, then rest for a minute, and then do it again twice more. As you get more used to this position, try maintaining it for longer—even up to 2 minutes."

[3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is exactly what the bicycle crunch provides: an all-over workout that’ll strengthen your core and help you shed that groin fat. To do a bicycle crunch , lie flat on your back with your legs slightly bent. Place your hands behind your head, raising your shoulders slightly. List your left foot so that it’s about a foot off the floor while extending your left leg to its full length. At the same time, lift your right leg a foot off the ground and bend your right knee until it’s at a 45-degree angle. While you’re making these moves, turn your upper body so that your left elbow meets your right knee and almost touches it for just a second. Repeat this motion with the other side, and continue switching back and forth between legs without stopping until you’ve completed 15 to 20 reps."

This is another simple exercise you don’t need any equipment for—just your body, the floor, and a bit of space. [4] X Research source To do a leg raise, lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. Keep your legs together and your toes pointed up. Engage your abs as you raise your legs up until they’re perpendicular with the floor, keeping them tightly together while you do this. Try to keep your upper body still as well. Still engaging your abs, slowly bring your feet back down to the floor. Repeat this movement 10 to 20 times."

[5] X Research source One of the most popular and effective? The hundred! This move will burn fat and give you a complete full-body workout. To do the hundred , lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Keep your arms outstretched at your sides, parallel to your body. Keeping your legs together, extend your legs and raise them up until your feet are a few feet off the ground. Engage your abs by lifting your upper back and chest. Keeping your knees, upper back, and chest raised, start pumping your arms up and down—arms and fingers still outstretched—about a few inches off the floor each time. Pump your arms 100 times before relaxing for a few seconds. Repeat this set 2 or 3 times if you can."

Running is a classic for a reason: it's simple to do, and it gives you a great full-body workout. If you don't run already, you can build up to it by taking a half-hour walk 3 days a week and slowly walking faster and faster until you're walking and jogging at intervals. Keep this up until you're jogging for the entire half hour. Try to jog about 3 days a week for 30 minutes each time, but don't forget to warm up for a few minutes beforehand and stretch afterward.

HIIT workouts are intensive, but they’re short—usually only lasting between 10 and 30 minutes. The different workouts included in a HIIT routine vary, but they often include many of the exercises on this list: planking, burpees, bicycle crunches, push-ups, sprinting, jump-roping, and more. [7] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source You can take a HIIT class at a local gym, or you can find free HIIT workouts on YouTube. Taking a class offers accountability and can make working out more fun, but doing HIIT yourself at home ensures you can find the workout that suits you best and pause whenever you want. If you want to develop your own HIIT routine, start with only about 5 exercises. Do each exercise for 1 minute, with 30 seconds of rest in between, and repeat the sequence 3 times for a 22.5-minute workout. Pick exercises that target different parts of your body, including: 1 cardio workout, like jump-roping or jumping jacks 1 upper body exercise, like push-ups or burpees 1 lower body exercise, like lunges or leg raises 1 core-strengthening exercise, like the 100 or bicycle crunches 1 more cardio exercise, like jogging in place or mountain climbers One thing that makes HIIT such a great form of exercise is you get the same benefits of longer workouts, but in a shorter amount of time. In fact, studies indicate HIIT workouts burn 25-35% more calories than other exercises do! [8] X Research source"

Sometimes it can be overwhelming to commit to an hour of warming up, stretching, and exercising every day, but you might find it easier to commit to 3 15-minute walks a day.

Drastically eliminating calories is not a healthy or sustainable option, so don’t cut back too much. To ensure you get enough food and that you don’t give up on your diet, try to intake about 500 fewer calories a day—no more than that. [10] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source The average person needs about 2000 calories a day to maintain their weight, so to lose weight, try to get about 1500 a day—the minimum amount a man needs to stay healthy while still losing weight. [11] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source The simplest way to cut calories from your diet is by cutting back on refined sugars and processed foods—so less cake and potato chips, more fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins.

Just going into your meals with a mindful attitude has been proven to positively affect what and how much we eat, as well as to enhance the eating experience. Mindful eating prioritizes focusing on the experience of eating—the physical, emotional, and mental sensations, what the food tastes like, and what your body is craving. [12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source In fact, for many people, counting calories can lead to unnecessary caloric restriction—which usually isn’t sustainable and can cause you to “boomerang” right back into unhealthy eating habits. Mindful eating is also a great way to approach healthy eating: instead of treating eating healthy as “dieting” or depriving yourself of the things you love to eat, mindful eating requires that you become more in tune with your food and your body, which ultimately can make the experience of eating more pleasurable."

[13] X Research source Not getting enough sleep can make it harder to control your appetite, causing you to overeat (and more likely than not, it’s not vegetables you’ll be chowing down on).

Nonsurgical fat reduction is sometimes called “nonsurgical liposuction,” but it’s not actually liposuction at all: it utilizes lasers, heat, cooling, or soundwaves to eliminate fat cells.

[16] X Research source This form of treatment may be ideal for small areas of pesky fat that you just can’t seem to get rid of. For larger areas of fat, nonsurgical fat reduction may not work.

[17] X Research source A monsplasty , sometimes called a pubic lift , refers to surgery in which excess fat is removed from the pubic mound—that is, the upper portion of fat above your pubic area.
