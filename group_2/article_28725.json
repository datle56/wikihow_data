      "content": "Take apart an old baseball cap with a seam ripper. The order in which you take the pieces apart will depend on how your cap was made. In most cases, however, you'll start with the brim, then the facing (inside band), and finally the panels. Remove the plastic insert from inside the brim as well. [1] X Research source To use a seam tripper, insert the sharp point into a seam, then slide it away from you, along the seam. Alternatively, find a pattern online or in a pattern book. Print the pattern (if it's online), then cut it out. Click here to continue. This method may also work for other types of multi-panel caps, such as newsboy caps."

      "title": "Fold the seams down, then trace the pieces onto paper.",
      "content": "Fold the seams down, then trace the pieces onto paper. If you trace the pieces as they are, you might end up with narrow seam allowances that are difficult to work with. Instead, using the creases as a guide, fold the seams down, then trace around each piece onto paper. You will add your own, larger seam allowances. [2] X Research source Trace the following: brim, facing/inside hat band, and panels. The left and right side of a baseball cap are identical, so you only need to trace 1 front panel, 1 side panel, and 1 back panel. You must fold the original seams down. If you don't, the hat will be too big once you add your own seam allowances."

      "content": "Use a ruler to add 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowances. Pick a piece to start with. Place the end of a ruler against a point on the tracing. Measure out 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) and make a point with a pencil. Work your way around the tracing, making points every 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. Connect the points to make a second outline. This is your cutting line. [3] X Research source Repeat this step for all of the pieces."

      "content": "Cut the pattern pieces out along the seam allowance. Do not use fabric scissors for this; cut the pieces out using regular scissors. If you are cutting a pre-made pattern that you found online or in a pattern book, be aware that it may have multiple sizes. Cut along the line that corresponds to your size."

      "title": "Fold your desired fabric in half, then pin the pattern to it.",
      "content": "Fold your desired fabric in half, then pin the pattern to it. It does not matter which way you fold the fabric: right-side-out or wrong-side-out. Just make sure that the side edges and corners match up, then pin your pattern pieces to it. The right side of the fabric is the front. The wrong side of the fabric is the back. Choose a durable, woven fabric for this. Denim, sports twill, and canvas are all great choices."

You only need 1 piece for the facing/inside band. Cut this out at the very end from a single layer of fabric. [4] X Research source If your fabric is thin, cut some iron-on interfacing out, then iron it to the wrong side of the fabric following the instructions on the package."

Staring 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the tip, sew down the left side using a straight stitch and a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Repeat this for the other set of panels, but this time along the right edge. [5] X Research source Backstitch when you start and finish sewing. This is where you reverse the sewing machine for a few stitches. It will keep the stitches from comping apart."

Press the seams open with your fingers, then iron them using a heat setting appropriate for the fabric. Repeat this step for the second set of panels too. [6] X Research source Most iron labels have the fabric type printed on them. If yours doesn't, use \"hot\" for cotton or linen, and \"cool\" or \"warm\" for polyester. You can iron on the top, flat side of the ironing board, but it'll be much easier if you wrap the panels around the curved end instead."

Work from the wrong side of the fabric so that you can see the seams clearly. Match the color of the thread to the fabric, or use a contrasting color for a decorative touch. [7] X Research source Sew about 1 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.32 to 0.64 cm) away from each seam. Topstitch all the way to the top of each panel; don't stop 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) away from the points like you did before."

Measure the circumference of this gap, then make a bias tape using your fabric: [10] X Research source Cut a diagonal strip of fabric that's 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) wide. Fold the strip in half with the right sides facing out and iron it. Open the strip and fold the raw edges to the middle. Fold the strip back up again and iron it once more."

Secure the bias tape with as many pins as you need to keep it in place. Sew it down as close to the inside folded edge as possible. Remove the pins as you sew. [12] X Research source This will give you a nicer finish than just folding the raw edges down and hemming them."

Measure the width of the gap, then take the hat off. Choose a piece of wide elastic, then cut it about 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter than the gap. [13] X Research source Choose a wide, non-roll elastic. Something around 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide would work just fine. The color doesn't matter."

Make the rectangle the same width as the gap, and the same height as the elastic. Add 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowances to the side and bottom (not folded) edges. Cut the rectangle out when you're done. [14] X Research source It does not matter which side you fold the fabric on. This is just to get the shape of the piece. For example, if your gap is 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, and the elastic is 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, your rectangle will be 4 by 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (10.2 by 3.8 cm), including the 2 side seam allowances and the 1 bottom seam allowance."

Slide the elastic into the strip so that the left ends are aligned. Sew the left end using the edge of the bias tape as a guide. Scrunch the casing along the elastic to that the right ends are aligned, then sew the right ends using a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Keep the elastic's edges about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) away from the fabric's edges. This will help reduce bulk. Backstitch when you start and finish sewing each time. This will prevent the stitches from unraveling."

Slide the left end 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) behind the left side of the gap, and sew it down, from top-to-bottom. Repeat the process for the right end of the strap and the right side of the gap. [15] X Research source The gap will scrunch a little due to the elastic, but it will widen once you put it on your head. Rather than using seam allowances here, use the edge of the bias tape as a guide. Remember to backstitch for both sides of the strap. This will make the stitching nice and strong."

[16] X Research source Refer to the top layer of fabric for the seam allowance, not the bottom layer that's peeking out from under it. You don't have to offset the 2 pieces, but it will give you a more professional-looking finish. Only sew the top, outside edge of the brim.

Make sure that the wrong side of the facing is facing out, then sew it to the cap using a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. [22] X Research source The folded edge of the facing you just topstitched should be pointing up. Make sure that the facing is centered on the cap, and that ends are sticking into the gap. You need this excess fabric so that you can hem it nicely. You can use a regular foot for this step, but switch to a zipper foot once you get to the brim. Follow the stitching along the brim."

Sew them down using the edge of the gap's bias tape as a guide, then remove the pins. [24] X Research source Don't fold the edges onto the outside of the hat; it won't look very nice. Peel back the facing, if you have to, so that you can see what you are doing. How much you fold the edges in by will depend on the circumference of your cap.
