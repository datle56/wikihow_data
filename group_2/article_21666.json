It's natural to want to help someone who's having a hard time, which is why it's tempting to jump into offering solutions. However, sometimes people simply need to vent.

If you need to, leave the room until they've had a chance to cool off. You may also want to develop an activity to help you release any negativity, such as going for a long walk in nature or taking a yoga class."
