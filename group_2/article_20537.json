      "content": "Have your hero and dark character take turns giving the Chao the drives/animals. It's recommended to use animals because they give your Chao more points. Also, stamina does not matter! Even though many recommend raising your Chao's stamina level to 15-16 it doesn't have to. It can evolve at any level. However, raising the stamina level to 15 makes it evolve right away, but force feeding it takes a long time unless the Chao's personality is \"Big Eater\". Otherwise, continue to care for it with both Sonic and Shadow/ any hero or dark character."

      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. After the animal parts have been removed, your Chao will eventually evolve into a neutral run type Chao. It should have a green ball over its head, green wings, three quills on its head, and its body will be green (unless you used a monotone colored Chao from the Black Market). This is a basic Sonic Chao. To see if your Chao is a run type, take it to the Chao doctor and see its medical chart."
