      "content": "Cook the pumpkin meat that you just sliced. Boiling method: Boil the squares in a saucepan over medium heat, uncovered, until they're soft. Cook the pieces longer for a heartier texture and more intense flavor in your pie. Cool and remove the skin if you are peeling during this step. Oven method: Heat your oven to 275-300ºF (135-149ºC). Roast the pumpkin in a shallow pan until it's tender when you poke it with a fork. Roasting caramelizes the pumpkin meat and preserves nutrients that could be removed by boiling."
