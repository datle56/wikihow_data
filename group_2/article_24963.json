      "content": "Talking about yourself can keep the conversation going. If you don’t know what to ask your crush next and are worried the conversation will end soon, let them know about your day, interests, or hobbies. Share things that will give the other person a little bit of an in-depth look into who you are. Showcasing a little about yourself can spark an idea of what to talk about next.

Have you ever tried it?”"

      "title": "Shower your crush with affection to keep them engaged.",
      "content": "Shower your crush with affection to keep them engaged. This will let them know you’re into them without completely confessing your crush. Maybe they’ll thank you or compliment you back. Either way, swallow those nerves and keep the conversation rolling—you got this! [2] X Research source “Where did you get your haircut? It looks amazing!” “Has anyone ever told you you have a great smile?” “I love your shirt! Where did you get it?” “You’re so funny!

Playing “Would You Rather?” is a great way to keep the conversation going because you and your crush can elaborate on why you picked your choice and debate your answers.

      "content": "Give your crush a chance to gush about their interests. You can learn a lot about a person from their favorite movies, and it’s also a great way to start a friendly debate.

[5] X Research source “What was the last movie you saw in theatres?” “Have you seen any good movies lately?” “If you had to pick: Star Wars or Marvel?” “If there was one movie you could make everyone watch, what would it be?” “What did you think of the Oscars this year?

[6] X Research source See if some of these jokes get you both talking again: “Velcro. What a rip-off, am I right?” “Have you heard the rumor going around about butter? Never mind.

      "content": "This way, they’ll have to say more than “yes” or “no.” When asking open-ended questions , think of them like summary questions on a test. What can you ask that your crush will have to elaborate on? Stick to the “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how” to keep your conversation going. [8] X Research source “Who do you admire most?” “What is your favorite thing to do in your free time? I like dancing.” “When did you start playing the guitar?” “Where is your favorite place in the whole world?

And even if they have, talking about the video is a great way to hold their attention and keep the conversation from ending . [10] X Research source “Have you seen this video before? It’s my fav.” “You’ve gotta check out this video! LMAO” “This'll make you laugh. Trust me!” “Let me send you this hilarious TikTok.

      "content": "Try something new to stop the conversation from dying. Going with the flow is great, but sometimes conversations need a little push in a different direction to keep moving. Segue into a similar topic or take a 180 to something completely different! There are no rules, just remember what your crush has told you so far and branch off of that. [11] X Research source Listen to what your crush is saying. You can use what they’ve already told you to start talking about another topic. “You were talking about pizza before? Can I get a slice at this new restaurant you’re talking about?” “I just thought of the story I wanted to tell you about earlier!” “Remember that musician I was telling you about? I just found out they’re doing a concert this weekend!” “Total change of subject, but I finally watched that show you recommended. It’s so good!” “You said you’ve been to France, right? Do you have any travel tips?”"
