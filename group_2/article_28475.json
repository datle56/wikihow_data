      "title": "Substitute each letter for another letter.",
      "content": "Substitute each letter for another letter. Decide which letters in the regular alphabet will be swapped out for new letters in your alphabet. This is a great way to create a new language, because you can use letters that you and your friends already know. Some letters can remain the same if you'd like, or you can change every letter. For example, you can substitute each letter with the letter directly after it (A=C, B=D, C=E, D=F). This would be much easier to understanding in writing, because you could decode it. Speaking this language may be more difficult. You could also substitute every letter except for the vowels. For example, H=J because I(the letter in between) is a vowel. This will make it much easier if you want to be able to speak this language. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Swap the vowels of the alphabet (A, E, I, O, U).",
      "content": "Swap the vowels of the alphabet (A, E, I, O, U). Swap them so that A is E, E is I, I is O, O is U and U is A. This will allow each word in your language to have a vowel, making the language much easier to understand and pronounce when speaking. The language is simple enough for you and your friends to easily learn, but difficult enough for an unfamiliar listener or reader to not understand what you're saying. For example, \"I love you\" would become \"O luvi yua.\" Another example would be \"Hello, how are you?\" turning into \"Hillu, huw eri yua?\""

      "content": "Practice speaking and writing your new language. Write words over and over again, practice having conversations with your friends, write notes back and for the to each other in a notebook, or send each other messages online. The more you write and speak your language, the faster it will become second nature to you."

      "content": "Decide how to share the language with friends. You’ll either want to create a simple substitution rule that can be memorized and easily decoded by those who know the secret language, or make a cheat sheet / rule sheet if you’d like a code that’s tougher to break. If you decide to go with a tougher code, make sure that all of your friends get a copy of your language code so that they can communicate with you."

      "title": "Create a list of words to use in your new language.",
      "content": "Create a list of words to use in your new language. Choose unique words that you don't typically use in an average day. These can be big words, names of celebrities or athletes, names of sports or hobbies, etc. You will use these words to replace names, locations, activities, etc. in your new language. Using this technique is a much faster and simpler way to create your own language. For example, if you and your friends are basketball fans, create a list of well-known players, and use their names as substitutes for certain people. If you want to keep things simple, focus on only replacing words that are verbs or emotions. This can change the entire meaning to a sentence without changing every word."

    {
      "title": "Change the meaning of existing words.",
      "content": "Change the meaning of existing words. Replace the meanings of words that already exist to give them your new meanings. Get together with your friends and have a brainstorming session. Write down the words of your language and their new meanings so that nobody forgets. Try to use words that have very different meanings so that your language isn't hard to figure out. For example, use the word taco for hate. So if your sentence was originally \"I hate math\", your new sentence is \"I taco math.\""

It should list the words in your made up language, and define what they actually mean in your native language. This dictionary doesn't have to include every single word in a real dictionary, as many of the words will mean the same thing. It should include all of the words that you have changed the meaning of.

      "content": "Choose a prefix or suffix to add onto words. Popular \"secret\" languages, such as Pig Latin and Kimono Jive, simply add prefixes and suffixes to already existing words. This makes languages much easier to learn and communicate with. Take Pig Latin for example. To speak in pig latin, you simply move the first letter of the word to the end and then add an “ay” sound. Therefore, banana would become “ananabay.\" Now, make up your own prefix or suffix to use. Let's say you choose to use the prefix \"ho\" for every word and also move the first letter of the word to the end of the word. Therefore, the word speaker would become \"hopeakers,\""

It will take awhile for you to develop a natural ability to speak in your new language, so be patient with yourself. Try out basic sentences to start with. For example, using the previously mentioned language structure, \"This is my new language\" would become \"Hohist is my hoewn hoanguagel.\" [3] X Research source Many made up languages don't alter shorter words that are harder to transfer, such as to, by, of, on, etc. It's recommended to keep these words the same to make your language easier to write, pronounce, and understand."

These symbols can represent entire words instead of creating a whole new alphabet. This is an option if you're fine with only being able to write your made up language. However, if you want to speak your secret language, this isn't the best method to use. Reference other languages that use symbols for their written language to get inspiration for your symbols. Some languages that use symbols for words are Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphics. [4] X Research source"
