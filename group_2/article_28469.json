You may need to recruit friends or help from online fan communities to help with trickier parts of your Pokémon game-making project. Smaller projects, like those that investigate certain aspects of the game, can be more reasonable for you to accomplish on your own. Some examples of smaller scale game projects might include ones that develop the story of a side-character or explore a region in the Pokémon universe more fully. Become involved in online fan communities before begin working on your game. Make friends online so you can ask them for help with your game when you need it. Some examples of fansites you might look into include: the ultimate Pokémon network at www.upnetwork.net, Pokedream at www.pokedream.com, and Bulbagarden at www.bulbagarden.net. [5] X Research source Recruit from among your friends at school who are also interested in Pokémon. You might even have a game, anime, or Pokémon club that you can join to make like-minded friends. If no such club exists, you might want to look into how to start a school club . Take a pencil and paper and write down the particulars of your game. In particular, you should decide how long your game will be, the characters involved, the Pokémon available, and the physical size of the game. Before starting, you should decide how many squares your board game will be, you should know how many cards you'll need to make for your card game, and you'll also need to know the dimensions for the maps in your digital games.

You should write down a list of rules and get the opinions of others to find out whether they are clear or not. Keep ties in mind. While playing your game, two players may draw, or a player and a non-player character may draw. In this case, you should have clear instructions what players should do. When you have finished writing your rules, go through each and make sure none of the rules contradict each other. Rules that disagree with each other may leave players confused as to what to do next. You might want to write your rules in the Pokémon style to add realism to your game. For example, instead of writing a rule, \"Players should draw a card at the beginning of each turn,\" you could instead write, \"Trainers should power up their Pokémon by drawing cards at the beginning of each round.\" You should also include the conditions necessary for player to win with the rules of your game. These conditions can range from simple to complex, depending on the age range and difficulty of your game. [7] X Research source"

Depending on your approach to planning, your model might be a simple 2-dimensional sketch of your game setting/board on a piece of paper, but you might benefit from making a more detailed 3-dimensional model . You could even use both of these approaches, starting with a 2D sketch and then further developing that into a 3D model. You'll need to know how you plan on placing the squares of your board game, if you plan on making one. You can even plan on future artwork or setting drawing you plan on using in the future, simply make a notation or draw a simple sketch. Your card game may or may not use a placement board where players lay cards onto specific spaces for certain purposes. But if your game does, you should create a model of one of these placement boards. The physical model will help you test your game. [9] X Research source Draw maps. Tabletop RPGs sometimes make use of pre-made maps for dungeons or other scenarios, like battles. Digital RPGs also use maps that small digital character models (called sprites) travel across. You should draw all maps necessary for your game."

You may notice during the course of testing that some of your supplemental materials, some tokens and models for example, are too small for players to use easily. You may want to note this fact down, as well as a note to increase the size of those objects. If you have difficulty taking feedback, you can always use an impartial third party to run your game testing. This way, you won't influence the test group with your opinions or accidentally add supplemental information players wouldn't normally have."
