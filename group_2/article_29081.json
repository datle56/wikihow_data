      "content": "Work your body. If you want to make the girl jealous, you should first show some level of interest in her, so she is intrigued by you and has a sense that you want to take things to the next level. Body language is the easiest way to let her know you somewhat want her without even saying a word. You should only spend a few minutes giving her your attention, so every gesture counts. [1] X Research source Catch her eye from across the room. Be flirty and hold her gaze if she notices you, and even give her a big smile. When you approach her, turn your body towards her, stand tall, and lean in towards her slightly, showing that your body is giving her its full attention. Lightly touch her on the arm or back if she seems up for it. Maintain eye contact while you're talking. She should feel like she's the only girl in the world -- for a few minutes."

      "title": "Compliment her.",
      "content": "Compliment her. Once your body had done some of the talking, you should let your words do the work. A few careful compliments can show that you're paying attention to her and that you want to get to know her better. If it's someone you already know, then the compliments will show that you're still thinking of her. Here's how to do it: [2] X Research source Compliment her appearance. Go for subtlety with this one. Instead of \"Damn, you look hot,\" just say, \"Blue is a great color. It really brings out your eyes.\" Compliment her laugh or her smile. Tease your way into a compliment. Find a way to playfully poke fun at her while complimenting her at the same time."

      "title": "Ask her a few questions.",
      "content": "Ask her a few questions. Asking just a few questions will show that you want to get to know her and that you're invested in who she is. Just a few lighthearted and well-placed questions will hook the girl and will make her want you even more. Ask her a flirty question. If she mentions she has a sister, say, \"Is she as beautiful as you are?\" Ask her a silly question but act like it's really important. Ask her what she thinks of men who are in love with their dogs or men who wear leather. Ask her something about herself. Ask about one of her hobbies or what she likes to do for fun. Make the girl think you care about her -- just a little bit."

      "title": "Make her your #2.",
      "content": "Make her your #2. Once you've shown enough interest in the girl and have flirted enough to make her think she has a chance, it's time for a turnaround. Slowly start talking about another girl, whether it's someone she knows or a random girl you keep calling \"my really good friend\" or \"this girl I've known forever.\" [3] X Research source Find a way to mention the girl every few minutes. Don't do it every few seconds or it will be too annoying, but make it sound like you're constantly thinking of the other girl. Find ways to complement the other girl. Without being too obnoxious, say things like, \"She's like, my favorite person,\" or \"She can get any guy she wants.\" Make the other girl feel inferior. You can also make this person up. If you're a good liar, this \"other girl\" can be completely fictional. Repeatedly say, \"You should really meet her. I think you'd get along.\" This will drive the other girl crazy."

      "title": "Talk about lots of girls.",
      "content": "Talk about lots of girls. Instead of just going on and on about another girl in your life, you should take the opportunity to talk about lots of other girls. Just make yourself sound like a ladies man who hangs out with a ton of cute girls whenever and wherever. Mention a party you went to where there were so many amazing girls. You can even say that you were one of the few guys there but that it was okay -- you're used to it. Talk about a fun weekend trip you took to the beach, and mention how all the girls you were with were wearing the most ridiculous bikinis. Just mention \"this one girl I was seeing\" after another. Make it sound like you go on a ton of dates. Just make sure not to sound gross or like a total player. The girl will lose interest if you make yourself out to be too much of a Lothario."

      "title": "Use your phone to make her jealous.",
      "content": "Use your phone to make her jealous. While you're talking to the girl about being with other girls, your phone will be a great prop in making her jealous. Keep your phone handy and check it from time to time and even be prepared to answer it. Check your phone from time to time and smile to yourself, as if you've just received a naughty message from a girl. Say, \"Excuse me\" and smile as you type back something that may be equally naughty. Have your phone ring once while you're talking to the girl. Pick it up and say, \"Hey, how are you? Can I call you back?\" Don't overdo it and call the girl \"honey\" or \"baby\" over the phone. Just make it clear that you're talking to another sexy lady from the tone of your voice. Don't overuse the phone tactic. A girl's patience will quickly wear if you spend all of your time on your phone."

      "content": "Flirt with random girls. Once you've talked to the girl enough to give her an inkling about your affections, it's time to go into ignore mode and to start chatting up other girls at the bar. You should do this after just a few minutes of talking to the first girl. Here are some great targets to try: [4] X Research source Whether you're at a party or a bar, just pick a girl near you and start talking to her. Slowly transition from talking to the original girl to being absorbed by the new girl completely. Make sure you look like you're laughing and have a great time. Take the other girl to the dance floor. Don't make out with her or grope her. Just dance with her for a song or two and look like you're having a great time. Pick a pack of girls to hang out with. Make them laugh and let the other girl watch.

      "content": "Flirt with the girl's friends. If you want to stay more local to the girl or if you're done with your random girls, you can make the girl jealous by paying attention to her friends. This will let you stay close and keep her focused on you while making her doubt your intentions. Make all of the friends like you. Be your most witty, charming, and charismatic self. Make a point of ignoring the original girl in front of her friends. Even if she's standing right in front of you, act like she's not there. Don't isolate the friends too much. Try to get all of them to like you while you flirt it up. If you pay too much attention to a close friend of the girl's and she starts to like you, then you may create unwanted drama."

      "title": "Leave with another girl.",
      "content": "Leave with another girl. This is a bold move. If you're out at a bar or a party, leave with another girl at the end of the night. You don't even have to end up going home with her. Just let the original girl see you walking out with another girl. Acknowledge the original girl with a small nod or a smile as you walk out. Let her know that you know she's watching you."

      "title": "Let her see you with other girls during the day.",
      "content": "Let her see you with other girls during the day. You can make a girl jealous even in the daytime. If you're hanging out with another girl, whether it's just a friend or someone you're also flirting with, let the girl see you having a great time with someone else. If the girl you want to make jealous sees you with another girl, make sure to look completely focused on the girl you're with. When you \"finally\" notice jealous girl, you can say, \"Oh, I didn't even see you there.\" Of course you didn't -- you were too busy having fun with another girl. Pick places where you know jealous girl will be. Parade into her favorite cafe or dining spot with a gaggle of girls and look like you're having as much fun as possible. If you have a class together, sit away from her and next to another girl, and let her see you whispering to the other girl and doodling in the margins of her notes."

      "content": "Don't wait too long if you want her to like you. This is an important point. If you're just using jealousy to make the girl see you as desirable and to want you even more, you shouldn't spend too much time courting other women or talking about them, or the girl will see you as a playboy and will be turned off. [5] X Research source If you're using other girls at a bar or at a party to make the girl jealous, don't spend all night talking to them and then ignore her. Come back to the girl you want after a few minutes, before she loses patience. Once you see that the girl is really interested, stop talking about other girls or chatting up other girls in the vicinity. The chase is over -- for now."
