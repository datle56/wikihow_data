      "content": "Wash 1 lb (250 g) of fresh or thawed frozen cranberries in running water. Pour your cranberries into a colander. Remove mushy cranberries or stems if you see any. Then, hold the cranberries under running water and swish them around to clean the berries. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source If you’re using frozen cranberries, be sure to thaw them before you make your juice. If you want to make more juice, simply increase the amount of cranberries and water at a 1:1 ratio. For instance, you might use 8 cups (500 g) of cranberries and 8 cups (1.9 L) of water."

      "title": "Bring the cranberries and water to a boil, then turn the heat to low.",
      "content": "Bring the cranberries and water to a boil, then turn the heat to low. Pour your cranberries and 1 quart (950 mL) of water into a saucepan. Place the pot on your stovetop and heat on high until the water comes to a boil. Stay near the stove so you can monitor the pot. When you see steady bubbles, reduce the heat to a simmer. [3] X Research source Use a medium or large saucepan that’s big enough to hold the berries and water."

      "title": "Simmer the cranberries and water for 20 minutes or until the berries pop.",
      "content": "Simmer the cranberries and water for 20 minutes or until the berries pop. Set a timer so you don’t accidentally cook the cranberries for too long. As they simmer, keep an eye on the berries to monitor how many have popped. Continue to simmer until all of the berries pop, which usually takes about 20 minutes. It’s okay to cook the cranberries a little longer if you have a few stubborn berries. [4] X Research source The water will start to turn red as more and more berries pop."

      "title": "Filter the cranberry juice through a strainer into a bowl.",
      "content": "Filter the cranberry juice through a strainer into a bowl. Place a clean bowl on your countertop, then hold your strainer over the bowl. Slowly pour the cranberry and water mixture into the strainer. If you’re okay with a little pulp, push down on the cranberries with the back of a spoon to squeeze out all of the juice. [5] X Research source If you have cheesecloth, use it to line your strainer so you won’t get any pulp in your juice. This will give you a juice that has the consistency of store-bought juice."

      "title": "Stir your sweetener into the juice if you’re using any.",
      "content": "Stir your sweetener into the juice if you’re using any. Cranberry juice is usually very tart, so you’ll probably want to add a bit of sweetener before drinking it. Use sugar or artificial sweetener, depending on your preferences. Add the sweetener in small increments and taste it after each addition to see if you like the taste. If it’s still too tart, add more sweetener until you’re happy with the flavor. [6] X Research source For 1 quart (0.95 L) of cranberry juice, add about 1 cup (200 g) of sugar or 1.25 cups (240 g) of stevia or sugar in the raw. Adjust the sugar to your taste."

      "content": "Heat the mixture to boiling, stirring to dissolve the sweetener. Put the pot back on the stovetop and heat the juice on high. Stir the juice consistently to help the sweetener dissolve. Turn off the heat if the juice starts boiling. [7] X Research source It’s okay if the mixture doesn’t quite start boiling. You just want the juice to be hot enough to dissolve the sweetener."

      "content": "Remove the mixture from the heat when the ingredients are blended. Set the pot on a cool stove top burner, a cooling rack, or a folded tea towel. Wait until the steam is gone before transferring the juice to a pitcher. [8] X Research source Be careful when handling hot pots so you don’t accidentally burn yourself. Use a pot holder or tea towel to protect your hand."

      "content": "Pour the cranberry juice into a pitcher and let it cool before refrigerating it. Set the pitcher on your countertop so the juice can cool. Once it reaches room temperature, place the cranberry juice in the refrigerator to chill. When the juice is cold, enjoy a tall glass of homemade cranberry juice! [9] X Research source Make sure your pitcher is heat-safe. Some glass pitchers may crack if the juice is still hot when you pour it in the pitcher. You can store your juice in the refrigerator for a few days. Don’t drink it if you see any mold in the juice or the juice starts to smell."

      "content": "Blend the cranberries and water on high for 2 minutes. Watch the cranberries to make sure they’re blending properly. Turn off the blender and check after 2 minutes to see if the mixture is well-blended. If not, blend it for another minute or so. [12] X Research source Make sure all of the berries are blended before you proceed to the next step. Typically, this takes no longer than 2-3 minutes. However, you may need a few extra minutes if your blender is slow or has a dull blade."

Try 1.5 tablespoons (22 mL) of lemon juice or orange juice or a few drops of honey. You could also stick to sugar or an artificial sweetener. Add the sweetener in small increments and test the juice each time to see if you like the flavor. Keep adding sweetener until you’re happy with the taste. [14] X Research source If you made 2 cups (0.47 L) of cranberry juice, use about .5 cup (100 g) of sugar or about 2/3 cup (120 g) of stevia or sugar in the raw to sweeten your juice.
