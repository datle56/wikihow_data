In order to build or understand a chart you will need to know the basic “vibrations” or associations with the numbers from 1 to 9. [2] X Expert Source Camber Hill Life Coach Expert Interview. 16 June 2020. Each number is associated with a personality, or “vibration”, and the traits of each personality make up the rest of numerology. Numerology centers on 1-9 because all other numbers are built out of 1-9, as well as 0, which has no personality in numerology. The “master numbers,” which are 11, 22, and 33, are the only multiple-digit numbers that are often given their own personality. They are usually considered to have immense power.

You will also need to learn how the numbers combine and reduce, as in the case of numbers like 134, which is reduced to 8 by the addition of the single-digit numbers (1 + 3 + 4 = 8). [5] X Research source In some interpretations, the numbers 1, 3, and 4 influence the 8 because they are part of the calculation. Another example is 1,857, which reduces to 21 (1 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 21) and then 3 (2+1 = 3), meaning that 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 can all be said to influence the reduced total 3 due to their presence in the calculation."

      "content": "Memorize the difference between the “core numbers” of a chart. Each chart consists of several numbers calculated based on a person’s name and birthdate, like life path, expression, and heart’s desire numbers. The value calculated for each core number is associated with the core number’s domain over someone’s life. [6] X Research source For instance, the “life path number” is calculated from your full birthdate, and the personality of the number in that slot is said to describe the general flow of your life, from birth to death. Your “expression number” comes from all the letters in your name, calculated based on their position in the alphabet, whereas your “personality number” only adds up the consonants and a “heart’s desire number” comes from the vowels."
