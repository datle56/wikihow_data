      "title": "Using cornstarch",
      "content": "Using cornstarch For a condom-friendly, water-based lube, mix 1 cup (236 ml) of water and 4 tsp (10 g) of cornstarch in a saucepan. Heat it on the stove over low-to-medium heat and slowly bring the mixture to a boil. Once it’s boiling, turn off the heat and stir it continuously until there are no more lumps. Let the mixture cool completely before using. [1] X Research source This lube can be used for any type of sex, including penetrative and oral. To adjust the consistency, experiment with how much cornstarch you include. For a thinner lube, use less cornstarch, and for a thicker consistency, add a bit more. Store your lube in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-5 days. If you don’t refrigerate it, it’ll only be good for about a day."

      "title": "Using aloe vera",
      "content": "Using aloe vera If you have 100% pure aloe vera gel , use it by itself for a perfectly safe, natural lube. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To make your own aloe vera gel , take an aloe plant leaf and peel one side with a vegetable peeler. Scoop out the clear jelly inside and add it to a blender. If you’d like, add 1 tsp (5 ml) of vitamin E oil as a preservative. Blend the jelly until smooth to create the lube. [3] X Research source Store your homemade aloe vera lube in the fridge for 3-4 days, or if you added vitamin E, for up to 2-3 weeks. Because this lube recipe is water-based, it is safe to use with condoms. If you use store-bought aloe vera gel, read the label carefully to make sure it doesn’t contain harmful ingredients like alcohol that can irritate and dry out your skin. This is why it’s important to choose pure aloe products."

      "title": "Using flaxseed",
      "content": "Using flaxseed This lube recipe requires actual flaxseeds —not flaxseed oil. Boil 1 tbsp (10 g) of flaxseeds in 1 cup (236 ml) of filtered water for about 20 minutes or until the water is reduced by half. Strain the liquid, then store it in an airtight container. Discard the cooked flaxseeds. [4] X Research source Store the flaxseed lube in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. This recipe is safe to use with condoms."

      "title": "Virgin coconut oil",
      "content": "Virgin coconut oil Coconut oil is a popular lube alternative because it smells and tastes good, which can be a benefit for oral sex. Make sure it is virgin or unrefined coconut oil , as refined oils often contain additives that can irritate your skin. Because it is an oil, however, this is not a good lube if you’re using a condom, as oil can damage the latex and make the condom ineffective. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Olive oil",
      "content": "Olive oil Like coconut oil, olive oil is safe to eat, and it’s easy to find and relatively cheap. It’s best to choose virgin or extra virgin olive oil to avoid irritating additives. Like other oils, olive oil cannot be used with condoms or latex sex toys, but it is known to last longer than water-based lubricants. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be careful when using olive oil, as it can stain fabrics."

      "title": "Avocado oil",
      "content": "Avocado oil Avocado oil has the same perks as other natural oils, as it’s moisturizing, edible, and lasts longer than water-based lubricants. It also has a less-noticeable taste and smell than other oils, so it’s a great option if you’re looking for something more neutral. [7] X Research source Like the other oils, it cannot be used with condoms or other latex products."

    {
      "title": "Vitamin E oil",
      "content": "Vitamin E oil Vitamin E oil is known for being gentle on the skin, and it’s often used as a moisturizer or carrier oil for essential oils. Because of this, it works great on sensitive skin, like genitals. Like other oils, however, it doesn’t work with condoms, as it breaks down latex. [8] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Some silicone blend lubes contain vitamin E but don’t break down latex."

      "title": "Other natural oils",
      "content": "Other natural oils Several natural, organic oils work well as lube alternatives because they don’t typically cause irritation or lead to infection. Again, however, these alternatives are not a good idea if you’re using condoms , as they can break down the latex and cause them to become ineffective. Otherwise, here are some other oils to choose from: Hemp seed oil Grape seed oil Vegetable oil Sunflower oil When choosing a lubricant , be aware of any allergies you have. For example, if you have a nut allergy, don’t choose coconut oil or almond oil."

      "title": "You know what goes in it.",
      "content": "You know what goes in it. Commercial lubricants often contain fragrances, parabens, and other ingredients that can irritate the skin and even lead to infections. [9] X Research source When you make your own lube, you know exactly what ingredients it contains. Making your own lube allows you to choose natural ingredients that you know work well with your body."

      "title": "It’s more affordable.",
      "content": "It’s more affordable. Because DIY lubes are made with natural (and mostly edible) ingredients, anything you have left over can be used for other purposes, unlike commercial lube. Most of these items are already relatively affordable and shelf-stable, so you’ll easily get your money’s worth."

    {
      "title": "It reduces waste.",
      "content": "It reduces waste. Most commercial lube comes in plastic containers that you’ll end up throwing away. If you buy lube frequently, this can lead to a lot of waste. Making your own lube allows you to store it in reusable containers and cuts down on the amount you have to buy. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Animal products",
      "content": "Animal products Avoid using any animal or dairy-based products as lubricant. This includes items like yogurt, fish oil, butter, and egg whites. These products contain animal proteins that can disrupt healthy bacteria and cause fungal or bacterial infections, especially in the vagina.

      "title": "Cleansing products",
      "content": "Cleansing products Because cleansing products like shampoo and hand soap are safe to go on the skin, some people believe they’re safe to go in the body, as well, but that’s not the case, especially if you or your partner have a vagina. Cleansing products like these have a basic pH, while the vagina has an acidic pH. Using these products as lube could lead to a burning sensation or infection.

      "title": "Creams and lotions",

      "title": "Saliva",
      "content": "Saliva You may be tempted to use saliva as lube in a pinch, but it’s not the best idea. Saliva contains bacteria that is different from the healthy bacteria in or near your genitals, so introducing it to that area often leads to STIs.

      "title": "Sugar or sweeteners",
      "content": "Sugar or sweeteners Using sugary substances like agave, honey, or syrup may sound sexy in theory, but they often lead to fungal or bacterial infections, like yeast infections. They also tend to clump and cause scratches, so they’re not a very comfortable lube alternative. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Synthetic oils",
      "content": "Synthetic oils Synthetic oils include products like Vaseline and baby oil, which can irritate delicate tissue, especially in the vagina. Vaseline specifically states that it’s for external use only, so it’s not suitable for penetrative or oral sex. Baby oil also carries the risk of poisoning if ingested."
