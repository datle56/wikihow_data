For most beginners taking a baseline reading, this will likely be between 45 seconds and 2 minutes. [4] X Research source Since you need to track your baseline and progress, take the rest time to write down the number of push-ups you did."

      "content": "Perform a second and third set of push-ups, taking the same rest between each. One single set of push-ups alone will not work the muscle groups enough to see overall progress very quickly, so you want to perform at least three sets of as many push-ups as you can do. You want to continue timing each set, so you can take an equivalent-length rest between each set. It’s perfectly normal to perform fewer push-ups until muscle failure with each subsequent set, so don’t allow that to discourage you. With practice, you’ll see increases in the number in each set you can do."

When the next workout day comes around, perform the same routine you did to find your baseline, but try to increase the number in each set of push-ups by at least one. You likely will not be able to increase the number in each set every time you work out, but that’s okay. If you reach such a plateau, hold yourself to that number for three or four workout sessions, and then try to increase the amount after several days. Continue charting the results, and you’ll begin seeing more push-ups performed in less time over several weeks."

Follow the same set structure, but try diamond push-ups for the first set, standard push-ups for the second set, and do the third set with your arms set slightly wider. [6] X Research source This will give you a more complete workout of the push-up muscle groups. You’ll definitely notice that you’re capable of fewer overall push-ups with this variation, so take a new baseline measurement to start with. You can also diversify your routine and give your body a break from push-ups with other arm-strengthening exercises like barbell curls or weighted pull-ups. Reader Poll: We asked 366 wikiHow readers and 52% of them agreed that the best exercise for building arm strength is weighted pull-ups . [Take Poll]"

Perform just one set of as many push-ups as possible until you cannot do more.

Using the number right where your push-ups went from comfortable to more difficult during your baseline test, begin doing a single set of this many push-ups per day for a week. By doing a number right at the edge of your comfort level but not to exhaustion, you’re putting less strain on your muscles, which makes a more sustainable daily regimen. Even within the seven day period, you can create smaller goals for yourself by trying to decrease the amount of time it takes you to do your push-ups."

      "content": "Increase the number of push-ups each week. This method offers a more controlled way of increasing your push-up count by allowing you to gradually increase the number each week. If your number for the first week was ten push-ups per day, try increasing that number to eleven or twelve per day in the second week and so on across subsequent weeks. Remember not to increase the number in such a way that you’re doing push-ups to exhaustion because that type of rigorous daily strain can damage your muscles and set you back while you recover."
