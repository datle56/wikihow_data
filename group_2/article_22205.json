Sometimes it can be difficult to recognize subtle personality traits, since strong characteristics are dominant. These subtle traits, such as predictability, generosity, and sympathy, [8] X Research source are just as important as the prominent ones. Don't forget that more subdued personality traits are very strong in certain situations or roles. For example, empathy and conscientiousness are vital during major life events, like weddings or funerals."

Appreciating the differences in personality traits between people can benefit you when you are working on a team or are a manager. Valuing more subtle, but strong traits like empathy and generosity can help strengthen relationships and make working as a team easier. [9] X Research source The most effective leaders and managers are able to appreciate, enhance, and effectively use different personality types. For example, if you notice that someone on your team is soft spoken, but very informed on a subject, have that person create detailed project materials or programs. This will put the person's skills to use without causing the person anxiety."

      "content": "Understand how assertiveness is a strength. Assertiveness is the ability to express your opinions or stand up for your own needs tactfully, without aggression or defensiveness. It's often seen as the opposite of passivity or shyness. There are a few different aspects to being assertive that include the ability to: Request things from others (like favors), delegate, ask for help, and express needs or wants. Express negative emotions such as disagreement, complaints, the desire to be alone, and to refuse the requests of others. Show positive emotions such as pride or attraction and give compliments to others. Question authority and tradition by asking why with respect. This demonstrates your investment to make change happen and shows you share control in decision making. Start, continue, and stop conversations with others confidently, as well as the ability to change the topic of conversations and share opinions or experiences. Productively deal with daily irritations before they become reasons for anger."

Spend some time considering which parts of your life would benefit from you standing up for yourself. It may help to think about what you're struggling with right now. For instance, maybe you'd like to be able to tell your boss that you're overloaded and want to delegate tasks to another team member. For example, if your partner repeatedly does something that bothers you, you might want the ability to express that frustration tactfully."

      "content": "Be assertive with another person. Describe the situation or issue, while being as specific as possible about how you see things. Take care not to use \"you\" statements. These can sound accusatory and aren't usually taken well. Use \"I\" statements instead. Express your opinion firmly while maintaining eye contact and composure. Clearly and specifically describe how you'd like the situation to change. For example, if a friend repeatedly cancels plans with you, you might say, \"When you cancel plans, I feel frustrated and hurt. In the future, please only make plans you intend on keeping or give me extra notice.\" [10] X Research source Be reasonable with your requests and consider the other personâ€™s needs or restraints. Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes as needed. It might seem like you're being rude when you tell someone \"no\" or let them know they crossed a boundary, but you'll be able to have healthier relationships if you're not constantly worried about pleasing others. Remember, it's important for you to take care of yourself, and you can't do that if you always put other people first.

This gives you a great chance to practice having a strong personality before you actually interact with the person. Practice by assertively saying everything you're planning on expressing to the person. This will help you work through rough points in the conversation and can boost your confidence for the actual talk. Role-playing is just as beneficial for you as it is for the person you'll eventually be speaking with. It can give you insight as to your communication style and lets you change the conversation based on what's working and what isn't. [12] X Research source"

[13] X Research source This may seem completely natural for some people, but you can also learn and develop this skill. Leadership doesn't simply mean leading a large group of people. You can use this skill to positively influence others in your peer group, such as moving conversations to positive or more interesting topics. It can also help you gain the trust of work colleagues or supervisors. [14] X Research source For example, you might find that normally you sit back and listen to conversations. But, you may find yourself in a group where no one is really talking. Leadership might be as simple as getting the group to talk about something, whether it's politics or a new tv show. If you don't feel like leadership skills come naturally to you, identify some people in your life who you see as strong leaders. Then, pay attention to their habits and routines, and see if that inspires you to make any changes in your own life.

If you feel like you're stuck and that your life is just the same routine, do something to make a change, especially when you're going through a hard time.

The feeling of moving forward will help you bounce back and feel like you're in control of the situation.
