Ask what the grade point average (GPA) requirements are as well as if there are any other necessary qualifications. Find out if there are any extracurricular requirements, like joining a club, participating in afterschool activities, or playing an instrument in the school band or orchestra. [1] X Research source There may also be behavioral requirements related to being on the honor roll. So make sure you behave well and treat others with respect. You can also try talking to your guidance counselor to find out more about what it takes to meet the honor roll requirements."

      "content": "Plan your courses according to your skill level. Some courses (such as honors or AP classes) are given extra weight in your GPA calculations. This is intended to make up for the difference in grades based on the amount of effort it takes to achieve them. You need to keep this in mind when choosing your classes. In most schools, you can still be on the honor roll without taking honors or AP classes. So it might be a smarter idea to take the regular classes where you have a better chance of making an A. However, if you plan on attending college, taking AP classes is important. So it’s probably worth the extra effort to take the honors/AP classes. For example, you might have to work really hard to make a B in an AP class whereas you could have made an A in the regular version of the same class. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Meet the grade requirements for each class. It is easy to think of the honor roll as a holistic performance evaluation, but you need to also consider the smaller parts that make up the whole. Making good grades in each individual assignment is just as important as thinking about the whole picture. [3] X Research source Keep track of upcoming tests, quizzes and exams so that you can plan to study them. Generally, these assignments are worth a very large amount of your grade so getting good grades on them is important. Never stay up late before such an assignment so you can be well-rested and awake."

[4] X Research source It can also be helpful to calculate the grade you’ll need on major assignments to maintain or raise your GPA. For instance, knowing that you need a B+ on the final exam to get an A in the class can help you prioritize your studying. If you have excellent grades in one class, you’ll just need to work hard enough to maintain that grade. But if you have a lower grade in another class, you’ll have to work harder to make up the difference. Remember to always communicate with your teachers. If you have questions about class assignments or your performance in class, talk to your teachers about it. They are there to help you. Similarly, if you are struggling with a subject or if you have a schedule conflict and have to miss a few classes, be sure to tell your teacher as soon as possible. The more advanced notice you give them, the more flexible they can be to help you."

Take advantage of that, and come to class with questions about it if you don't understand. Never leave assignments and study time for the last minute.
