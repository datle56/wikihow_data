Drive Bays: Some computer cases have a drive bay that you slide the hard drive into and then secure it by fastening it to the chassis with screws. If this is the case, remove the screws and then slide the hard drive out of the drive bay. Drive Cages: In some computer cases, the hard drive is mounted to a metal or plastic drive cage that is then inserted into the computer case. The hard drive may be secured to the drive cage using screws, or it may be a toolless drive cage that uses pins and clips that fasten to the hard drive.
