      "content": "Remove electrical covers. [1] X Research source These are on the back of guitar or is the pickguard assembly such as on a Stratocaster. You will need to detach any wires leading from the pickguard assembly so you can easily replace a pickup (or any other hardware!)"

      "title": "Remove the solder.",
      "content": "Remove the solder. [2] X Research source There is a small amount of solder from the hot and ground wires from the pickup that you will be replacing. To remove them you need to touch the solder with the soldering gun and pull the wires apart. Don’t forget where they were because you need to know that when you place in the replacement pickup. If you need to, draw a basic schematic if you cannot get a wiring diagram."

    {
      "title": "Remove the pickup(s).",
      "content": "Remove the pickup(s). Take out the two screws on either side of any old pickup. Now gently remove it, making sure you leave enough lead wire for both positive and ground. Be certain you keep the springs, screws, and any pickup cover."

      "title": "Use shortcuts.",
      "content": "Use shortcuts. Unless you want to try “fishing” wires through precisely drilled holes, taping a guide string or small gauge wire to the ends of the hot and ground will save you much frustration and time."

    {
      "title": "Reference a diagram.",
      "content": "Reference a diagram. [3] X Research source When you buy new pickups they come with a wiring diagram. Use this diagram to distinguish which color represents the hot and ground. Then tape those wires to the guide string if needed. Be sure to pull gently or you may rip the wires out of the guitar."

      "title": "Solder in your pickups.",
      "content": "Solder in your pickups. [4] X Research source Once you have placed in the new wires and have enough lead wire, solder them to their necessary places."

      "title": "Replace hardware.",
      "content": "Replace hardware. Secure the new pickup by doing the opposite of taking it out and replace all electrical covers; make sure you have firmly placed them in level so there is no room for distortion in sound."

      "content": "Play to check your work. [5] X Research source If you can hear a signal, congratulations! You have just installed your first replacement pickup. If you cannot get any signal, go back and find a problem by referencing your diagram."
