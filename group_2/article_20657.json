      "content": "Figure out which show would suit you. Think about what you want to bring to the table. If you simply want to show off your personality, look for programs like The Real World or Big Brother where people simply live together while being filmed. If you're looking for something more specific, however, many shows are catered to particular talents. Things like the Amazing Race and Survivor are great if you're athletically inclined. Look into cooking shows, like Hell's Kitchen or Top Chef , if you're a talented cook. If you're a singer, go for a singing competition like The X Factor ."

      "content": "Check to make sure filming dates work with your schedule. Most shows require contestants be willing to fully commit to a show if they're chosen. This means you'll need to be on call 24/7 if you want to be a contestant. See when the show will be shooting to make sure you can film without issue. Filming dates are not always publicized. You may want to ask a representative from the show during auditions. However, if you can't find out filming dates, you can always wait to hear back.

Find a friend, co-worker, or family member who knows how to make videos and shoot out in the world. Capture the most exciting moments of your week on film to make your tape stand out. [5] X Research source Say you're auditioning for a singing show. In addition to clips of yourself singing, show yourself hanging out with friends at karaoke nights to make your personality apparent.
