      "title": "Combine the shrimp and salt.",
      "content": "Combine the shrimp and salt. Place the shrimp and salt in a large bowl and mash them together using a wooden spoon or your hands. If possible, use fresh shrimp instead of frozen shrimp. Make sure that the shrimp has been washed in running water and drained well in a colander before using it. The salt must coat the shrimp evenly after you mix the two ingredients together. The shrimp must be allowed to absorb as much salt as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let stand.",
      "content": "Let stand. Set the shrimp mixture off to the side and allow it to stand for two hours. The shrimp mixture should sit out at room temperature during this time. You can cover it partially with a loose sheet of plastic wrap to prevent dust and debris from falling in, but do not create a tight seal."

    {
      "title": "Add the rice and bamboo shoots.",
      "content": "Add the rice and bamboo shoots. Place the rice and bamboo shoots in the salted shrimp mixture. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix them in thoroughly. [1] X Research source The rice should be freshly cooked, slightly cooled, and slightly watery when added to the shrimp mixture. Strictly speaking, the bamboo shoots are optional. Shrimp, salt, and rice are the only ingredients that must be included, but bamboo shoots are highly recommended."

      "title": "Pack the mixture in a clean jar.",
      "content": "Pack the mixture in a clean jar. Transfer the mixture to a clean, dry glass jar. Leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar, then seal it. You can use separate jars or opt for one jar. If using one jar, it will need to hold 1 to 2 gallons (4 to 8 L). Cover the top of the jar tightly with a sheet of clean plastic wrap. After covering it with the plastic, tightly screw on the cap."

    {
      "title": "Let the mixture ferment.",
      "content": "Let the mixture ferment. Allow the mixture to sit in a cool location for 3 to 10 days. [2] X Research source It is best to keep the jar in a slightly cool location. A refrigerator can be too cold, but a humid kitchen is too warm. A basement or cellar is ideal."

    {
      "title": "Store in cold temperatures.",
      "content": "Store in cold temperatures. After buro ferments, you should store it by keeping the jar in your refrigerator or freezer. When stored in the refrigerator, the buro should last for about one month. When stored in the freezer, it should remain good for two to three months. If storing the buro in the freezer, you may wish to separate the buro into serving size portions before freezing it. That way, you will not have to defrost the entire jar just to use a portion of it."

      "title": "Cook before serving.",
      "content": "Cook before serving. When you are ready to serve the buro, sauté the amount you want in hot oil, onion, and garlic for roughly 10 minutes on medium heat. [3] X Research source For one-quarter of the buro produced in this recipe, use 1/2 cup (125 ml) vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) minced garlic, and 2 cups (500 ml) chopped onions. Cook the garlic and onions in the oil, stirring occasionally, until they become fragrant and lightly browned. Use a medium skillet or saucepan. Add one-quarter of the buro to the pan with the onions and garlic. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring continuously, until browned."

      "title": "Rub the fish with salt.",
      "content": "Rub the fish with salt. Use just enough salt to coat all sides of the fish evenly. Set the fish aside for 15 to 20 minutes. Make sure that the fish has been thoroughly cleaned before you use it. If working with fillets, you simply need to rinse and dry the fish. When cleaning fresh fish , you must remove the scales, gut it, and rinse the flesh. Slice each fish into 7 or 8 pieces before rubbing it with the salt. Let the fish sit out at room temperature. You can cover it loosely with plastic wrap, but do not create a tight seal."

Cook the ingredients over medium heat. Add your desired amount of buro to the pan and continue cooking for 10 minutes, or until browned.

After rinsing and drying each mango, peel off the skin using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler. Cut each mango into three flat pieces. Two of the pieces should hold nothing but the flesh, while the third middle piece will contain the pit or seed. Use a knife the shave away the flesh of this middle piece away from the seed.
