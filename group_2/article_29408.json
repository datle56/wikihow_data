Gently pull apart the ends of the sticks that are not held together by the rubber band, and slide the 5 stick base in between them, so that it sits perpendicular to the arm. Slide the five sticks between the two that are held together with the rubber until they are about one half inch away from the rubber band holding the sticks of the arm together. The base becomes the pivot point for the catapult arm. The two sticks will be separated in a \"V\" shape. Choose one stick to be the arm of the catapult and the other will rest on the ground with the five-stick stack as stable base."
