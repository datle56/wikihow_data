      "title": "Remove all stagnant water from your garden.",
      "content": "Remove all stagnant water from your garden. Check the whole garden for any puddles of water in toys, plates beneath flower pots, children’s pools, and buckets. Even 1–2 fl oz (30–59 ml) of water is enough for mosquitoes to breed, so remove all of these areas of stagnant water if possible to prevent attracting mosquitoes to your home. [1] X Research source Joshua Bloom. Pest Control Specialist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. Other areas that often have stagnant water in gardens are unused tires, trash cans, and bird baths. [2] X Research source If your garden has areas of stagnant water that cannot be removed, such as a pond, simply stay away from these areas at night and keep any outdoor events as far away from the water as possible. Don’t worry about your swimming pool attracting mosquitoes. Provided that the filter is working properly and that it’s chlorinated, the mosquitoes won’t be attracted to it. Make sure to replace or agitate the water in the birdbath often to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs there."

      "title": "Apply insect repellent when you will be outdoors at night.",
      "content": "Apply insect repellent when you will be outdoors at night. Read the label on the insect repellent carefully, and reapply it as often as necessary. Put it on children over 2 months as well. [3] X Research source Insect repellents usually contain DEET, picaridin, lemon or eucalyptus oil, and all of these are effective against mosquitoes. Don’t spray the insect repellent directly on your face, as it could irritate your eyes. Spray it onto your hands first, and then rub it on your face. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover your skin up as much as possible.",
      "content": "Cover your skin up as much as possible. Wear covered shoes and clothes that cover your arms and legs. Try to stick to light colors if possible, as mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors. [5] X Research source Lightweight clothes are the most practical due to the heat in summer."

      "title": "Avoid wearing any strong smelling body products.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing any strong smelling body products. Many strong perfumes, colognes, and lotions can actually attract mosquitoes towards you. Save these products for when you are indoors, or for when the weather is cooler. [6] X Research source Floral scents tend to be especially attractive to mosquitoes."

      "title": "Pretreat any outdoor areas that you plan on using with a backyard repellent.",
      "content": "Pretreat any outdoor areas that you plan on using with a backyard repellent. Connect the bottle of repellent to a hose, and spray the perimeter of your garden as instructed. This is usually done around 24 hours before you plan to use the area at night. [7] X Research source Read the label of the repellent carefully before you use it to check that the repellent is safe to use around children and pets. This will work to temporarily repel mosquitoes from the outdoor area."

      "title": "Place geraniol or citronella candles every 15 in (38 cm) in the outdoor area.",
      "content": "Place geraniol or citronella candles every 15 in (38 cm) in the outdoor area. Light the candles and strategically place them around the area that you will be using at night. Some candles can be hung, while others need to be placed on a surface. [8] X Research source Citronella, geraniol, and neem oil are the most popular natural repellants for mosquitos, although they may have a shorter effectiveness than commercial repellants.

      "content": "Install window screens on all of the windows in rooms where people sleep. You can purchase preassembled screens from home improvement stores, or you can make your own by creating a fitted frame and attaching the screen. You can install the window screens yourself by fitting them to the window, or you can hire a professional to do this for you. [10] X Research source Window screens let you keep the window open slightly during the warm summer months, but still keep out mosquitoes and other bugs. Placing window screens on bedroom windows is the most effective way to keep mosquitoes outside during summer. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Put door strips in place . Install a door strip on on the bottom of each door that has a large gap below it. These are installed by cutting the strip to fit the door, and attaching it with either adhesive or screws. Door strips are easy and inexpensive to place. [12] X Research source You can purchase door strips from home improvement stores. Door strips also have the added benefit of keeping the air in. This means that the temperature of the room is less likely to be influenced by the outdoor temperature."

      "title": "Sleep under a mosquito net.",
      "content": "Sleep under a mosquito net. Hang a mosquito net above your bed so that your head and upper half of your body is protected. You can also purchase nets that are treated with insecticide for extra protection. [13] X Research source Make sure that there is a gap between the mosquito net and your skin; otherwise;the mosquitoes can land straight on the net and still bite you."

      "title": "Turn a fan on to move the air around.",
      "content": "Turn a fan on to move the air around. A ceiling or a bedside fan will both do the job of shifting the air around, which makes it difficult for the mosquitoes to fly. It will also help to keep you cool during warm summer nights. [14] X Research source Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, so a fan will also help to move the carbon dioxide that you exhale away from you."

      "title": "Use a smokeless mosquito coil.",
      "content": "Use a smokeless mosquito coil. Plug in a mosquito vaporizer, and let it run for a couple of hours before you sleep. You can also use a timing device so that it switches off automatically. [15] X Research source This means that by the time you go to bed, any mosquitoes in the room will be dead. Plug-in mosquito vaporizers are a safe, indoor alternative to mosquito coils. There is no evidence of any health risks associated with using these."
