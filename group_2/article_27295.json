      "title": "Scrub and cut a piece of ginger root.",
      "content": "Scrub and cut a piece of ginger root. Take a section of ginger root and peel away the outer layer with a vegetable peeler. Next, use a small knife to cut away a 1 inch (2.5 cm) cube of fresh ginger. You’re only making 1 cup of tea with this recipe, so you don’t need to include a lot of the actual root. [2] X Research source You can find fresh ginger root at most grocery stores."

      "title": "Add ginger and water to a small saucepan.",
      "content": "Add ginger and water to a small saucepan. Set a saucepan on the stovetop to boil the water and pour 2 cups (470 mL) of water into the pot. Continue by adding the chunk of ginger to the water, and turning the stovetop burner to the highest setting. Make sure that the piece of ginger is fully immersed in the water before you continue. [3] X Research source To speed up the boiling process, place a lid on the saucepan."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the water to boil and then lower the heat setting.",
      "content": "Wait for the water to boil and then lower the heat setting. Stay by the saucepan for several minutes until the water and ginger mixture begins to boil. Remove the lid from the saucepan and adjust the burner heat to the lowest setting. Since the tea is brewing now, aim to apply a slow, steady amount of heat to the mixture. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that the flavor of the ginger has to steep into the water before you can drink it. Otherwise, the tea won’t be as potent or effective."

    {
      "title": "Strain the ginger and water into a cup after 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Strain the ginger and water into a cup after 10 minutes. Turn off the stovetop and pour the tea over a small, metal strainer. Hold the strainer over a mug as you pour, separating the chunk of ginger from the rest of the tea. To sweeten the drink, mix in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of honey into the mug. [5] X Research source Double or triple the recipe if you want to make larger amounts of tea at once. After storing the leftover tea in the refrigerator, pour it into a mug and reheat the beverage in the microwave for at least 30 seconds. Ginger tea tastes best if you drink it within 1 day.

      "content": "Boil 2 cups (470 mL) of water in a small pot. Pour some water in a saucepan and turn the stovetop onto the highest heat. Wait several minutes for the water to boil before adding in any ingredients. If you want to speed up the boiling process, put a lid on the pot or saucepan to contain the heat. [9] X Research source For reference, the water will be bubbling and steaming when it’s at a boil."

      "content": "Throw in equal amounts of ground ginger and turmeric. Take ½ tsp (1 g) each of both ground turmeric and ground ginger and add them into the boiling water. To add some extra flavor to the tea, try adding ½ tsp (1.32 g) of ground cinnamon to the mixture as well. If you want the recipe to be more potent, double the amount of spice added to the water. [10] X Research source Use fresh ginger if you want the flavor to be a bit stronger."

      "title": "Lower the heat and let the mixture steep for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Lower the heat and let the mixture steep for 10 minutes. Turn the stovetop down to a simmer so that the ginger tea can brew. Keep in mind that the tea will be more concentrated when you let it steep for longer. Wait for at least 10 minutes before turning off the heat. [11] X Research source Let the tea brew for 15 minutes if you want the drink to be stronger."

      "title": "Strain the tea into a mug and add any extra ingredients.",
      "content": "Strain the tea into a mug and add any extra ingredients. Take a metal strainer and set it over a large mug. Pour the tea through the strainer, catching any loose grains of spice as the steeped mixture fills the mug. At this point, sweeten your tea with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of honey, or another sweetener of your choice. [12] X Research source To make your tea slightly creamier, try adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of milk."

Make sure that you’re heating up enough water to prepare the tea, especially if you plan on pouring several mugs worth of it. Turn the stovetop onto the highest heat, and wait several minutes for the kettle to whistle before turning the stovetop off. If you don’t want to use a kettle, you can boil water in the microwave , as well."

Use a spoon to stir all the ingredients into the tea. Keep in mind that the grated ginger won’t dissolve, but instead sit at the bottom of your mug. Continue mixing these ingredients for around 5 seconds to fully stir them into the water. [13] X Research source If there’s any powdered medicine you can add to your tea, consider dissolving it into the drink. To sweeten the drink, add in 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey into your beverage. Make sure that the honey dissolves all the way before you start drinking the tea."
