      "content": "Determine when you began questioning your feelings. Feelings don't change overnight, which means it's likely that your feelings have been gradually changing for quite some time. After all, it took time for you to fall in love with your partner, and it also takes time to fall out of love with them. [1] X Research source Don't worry about giving yourself some time to unpack all of your emotions—you could seriously damage your relationship if you act out of impulse. Take all the time you need to sort things out. Consider what else was happening in your life when your feelings started to change. Stress and trauma can take their toll on relationships and might affect your feelings for your partner. If your feelings did change overnight, it's possible you were mistaking infatuation for love. Moore notes that \"with infatuation, feelings can also change very quickly. You can feel madly in love with someone in one moment and then the second they don't give you what you want... you can turn to hating them very quickly.\""

      "content": "Look for signs that you've fallen out of love with your partner. If you fall out of love, it's an indication that your relationship was lacking in the intimacy necessary for the two of you to be truly vulnerable around each other. Signs that you're falling out of love often relate to a failure to better communicate your needs as individuals and set firm boundaries in your relationship. Here are some things to look out for: [2] X Research source You move away from your partner and prefer to sit or stand on the other side of the room from them. When you're away somewhere, you make excuses to stay longer because you don't want to go home and be with your partner. Your partner's needs and interests are no longer a priority for you when you make decisions. You and your partner don't really talk about the future anymore or make plans for more than a few weeks out."

      "content": "Imagine a future without your partner. Take some time to think about what your ideal future would look like— writing a journal entry is a good way to explore this. Do you see your partner in that future? If you move on without them, will your life suffer or flourish? [3] X Research source If you find that your partner is a really important part of your life who you'd just started to take for granted, you might find that you actually do still love them after all. That doesn't mean the two of you don't have issues to work on, though. Keep in mind that being comfortable with someone is not the same as being in love with them. Part of the reason breakups are hard is that they force you to step outside of your comfort zone."

      "content": "Remember why the relationship ended. You might look back and romanticize an old relationship, but there was some reason that it ended. It might just have been circumstances or that one of you gave up too quickly, but it could also be that there were fundamental problems that needed to be addressed and resolved. [4] X Research source A healthy relationship with an ex only happens if both of you have changed in some fundamental way since you broke up with each other. Moore emphasizes that \"it's important to first understand why the breakup happened in the first place and what you're going to do differently this time around.\" If one of you hurt the other, the question is whether both of you can truly forgive and forget. You can't create a future with each other if you're still stuck on past issues. Butler emphasizes doing the work on yourself to meet your own needs first, then look at the potential for a relationship. She continues, \"Relationships completely shift when people start to show up as these really empowered partners to themselves.\" Reader Poll: We asked 302 wikiHow readers what change they’re most interested in making before trying to date their ex again, and 62% agreed that they want to focus on maturing as a person .

      "content": "Look for signs that you're still in love with the person. In a lot of ways, the signs that you're still in love are essentially the opposite of the signs that you've fallen out of love. If you're still in love, that means you still support the person and empathize with them. According to Moore, \"with real love, you want the other person to be happy no matter what, even if it's not with you.\" Here are some other signs to look out for: [5] X Research source You believe this person is special (you might even refer to them as \"the one that got away\"). You tend to focus on their positive traits and minimize or downplay their negative traits. Moore notes that \"when you actually love someone there is usually a steady building of positive feelings toward that person over time.\" You can't stop thinking about them, no matter how hard you've tried. You always see things that remind you of them everywhere you go. You hurt when they hurt and would readily make sacrifices for them if necessary."

Don't hold back—write absolutely everything you can remember. Then, consider how your overall quality of life changes when you're with them. [6] X Research source If you truly feel like a better person when you're around them, that's something you don't want to let slip away! But since you've already broken up at least once, it's likely that the picture is more nuanced than that."

Loneliness can be incredibly painful, but it's not a good reason to jump into a relationship with someone—especially someone you've been with before. It's certainly not the foundation of a healthy or long-lasting relationship.

It can also help you unwind and determine if stress was causing you to question your relationship. [8] X Research source During this time, you have the opportunity to sort out your feelings without any pressure from your partner. Butler recommends that you also spend time \"really tending to yourself, and giving yourself the space to really feel. Let yourself feel everything [and] name those feelings.\" You also have time to compose yourself and decide exactly how to proceed, based on what you figure out about how you feel."

      "content": "Discuss your feelings with the person, if appropriate. If you're currently in a relationship with the person, have a private conversation with them. Use \"I\" statements to tell your partner how you feel without sounding accusatory or hurtful. [9] X Research source If you aren't currently in a relationship with the person, decide if it's appropriate to tell them how you feel. It's likely not appropriate to tell the person if they're in a relationship with someone else or if you're only doing it to toy with their emotions. Keep in mind that things might get complicated after you voice your feelings. Unless you're sure it's something that needs to be said, it might be best to keep it to yourself. If you're confessing your love to an ex, Moore recommends that you \"remember what brought you and your ex together in the first place and to try and replicate that. Remembering why you clicked and loved each other in the beginning can go a long way toward getting back together again.\""

      "content": "Make a mutual decision about what to do next. Now that the person knows how you feel, find out how they feel. That will help the two of you decide what you want to do. Approach the person with an attitude of curiosity and respect. Listen actively to what they say, focusing more on their words than on what you want to say or what you hope to get out of the conversation. Whatever decision you make, you'll both benefit from the way you've approached the situation with emotional maturity.

If you were pondering whether you still love an ex-partner and decided that you do, the two of you might decide to give it another go if they have feelings for you as well."
