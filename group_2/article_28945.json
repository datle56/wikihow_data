      "content": "Roll up two blankets up into tubes. Use thin blankets and roll them lengthwise so that they are as long as possible. Once they are rolled up into a tube shape, fold them over so that they can fit snugly into pant legs. [1] X Research source Try to find blankets that are about twice the length of your pant legs."

      "title": "Stuff a pillow in the top of the pants.",
      "content": "Stuff a pillow in the top of the pants. Get a large, square pillow and stuff it into the waist of the dummy. If you don't have a square pillow, you can stuff the torso of the body with newspaper or plastic bags. The more filled out your dummy is, the more realistic it will look. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert a pillow into the body of a hoodie.",

      "content": "Fill in any empty spaces in the pants with crumpled up newspaper. Once you've finished stuffing your dummy, there will most likely be empty spaces in the legs, arms, and torso. Use newspaper to fill out any spaces that are empty to make your dummy look more realistic. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Take plastic bags and tie them around the feet and hands of the dummy.",
      "content": "Take plastic bags and tie them around the feet and hands of the dummy. Plastic bags will prevent the rolled up blankets and newspaper from falling out of your dummy. Secure the bags by tying them around the pants and hoodie, then wrap duct tape around the bags to secure them. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Tuck the torso into the pants and duct tape them together. Tuck the hoodie torso that you created into the pants and wrap the dummy with duct tape. Don't be concerned with the figure of the dummy, because this will change once you dress it. Make sure that the body and the legs are secure. [5] X Research source"

Your friend will have to wear a long sleeve shirt and pants because the duct tape is painful to remove if it's applied directly to their skin. Wear form fitting clothing, because the bulkier your clothes are, the more bulky and unrealistic the duct tape dummy will look. [8] X Research source Tell your friend to wear clothing that they don't care about because it will be destroyed in the end."

Do the same technique on the other side of the model so that an X forms on the front of the model. Continue to layer duct tape over the person until the entire torso is covered. Then, start working on each arm of the person, wrapping the duct tape around it. You can stop duct taping around the collar of the neck and wrists of the model."

Attach thick gloves to the arms of the dummy to create hands. You may have to fill the gloves up with newspaper or filling to make them look realistic. Attach shoes to the dummy by lining the inside of them with duct tape, then attaching them to each leg that you created."

      "content": "Dress and paint your dummy. Fit clothing over the duct tape dummy that you created.
