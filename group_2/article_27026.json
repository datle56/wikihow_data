      "content": "Crush limestone into 3-inch (7.62 cm) pieces. Purchase or find limestone on your property and crush it up into small, 3-inch (7.62 cm) pieces with a sledgehammer. You can tell if the stone is limestone if it fizzles or cracks when you put vinegar on it. [1] X Research source Industrial grade limestone companies use mechanical crushers or hammer mills to crush the limestone. You can also buy limestone-based Portland cement online, at hardware stores, or at home and gardening centers instead of making it yourself."

      "content": "Put the limestone in a kiln and raise the heat to 2,700°F (1482.2°C). Preheat the kiln and put your limestone into it. Let the kiln heat the limestone for 3 to 4 hours at 2,700°F (1482.2°C). Use a high-temperature kiln thermometer to determine the level of heat in the kiln. Make sure to wear a respirator and goggles when heating the limestone because it will let off a harmful gas. [2] X Research source"

Wear thick rubber gloves when handling the limestone. Transport the limestone to a wheelbarrow and then use a shovel to break up the limestone pieces until it turns into a fine dust.

You can buy all-purpose sand online or at a hardware store. If you have access to a concrete mixer, you can use that instead of a shovel and wheelbarrow. Add two parts of sand for every one part of cement dust that you have and make sure that they are well incorporated. [4] X Research source If you are trying to make more than 80 lbs (36.28 k) of concrete you should rent a portable concrete mixer instead of trying to mix it by hand. [5] X Research source"

This coarse material will help bind the concrete together once it dries. If you want a smoother concrete finish, you should use smaller pieces of gravel or crushed brick.
