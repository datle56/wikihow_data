      "content": "Start your seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before planting them outside. Sow your red onion seeds indoors in a potting tray or small container. Space the seeds 1 cm (0.39 in) apart if using a container. Place the seed in the soil and cover it with a thin layer of compost. Water your seeds immediately. [1] X Research source This way, your seeds will be ready for your garden when it’s time to plant them."

      "title": "Transplant your seedlings when they grow to 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) tall.",
      "content": "Transplant your seedlings when they grow to 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) tall. When your seeds sprout above the soil and reach a few inches tall, they can withstand the outdoor environment. To transplant your seedlings, place them outside 1-3 days before you replant them. Dig holes in your garden about 1 in (2.5 cm) deep, and place your onion seedlings inside. Cover them with compost and rock phosphate. Space your seedlings 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) apart. [3] X Research source The best time to replant your seedlings is in late March or early April when the temperatures reach above 20 °F (−7 °C) consistently. Hardening off your seedlings will help them adapt to outdoor conditions. One week before planting them outside, place your seedlings in a shaded area for longer times each day. The phosphorous in rock phosphate is essential for strong root growth. You typically need to add it to the compost since compost alone won’t have enough phosphorous."

      "content": "Purchase onion bulbs or seedlings from a local nursery. Red onion sets come in a bundle with about 10-20 total bulbs. When you are ready to plant them, take off their packaging and separate each bulb individually. [4] X Research source You can also get onion bulbs from a garden supply store."

Using a garden spade, fill a large bucket halfway with organic potting soil rich in nitrogen. Then, fill the rest of the bucket up with compost. Mix the dirt up using your garden spade. [7] X Research source This mixture provides ample nutrients to your red onions, so they can grow healthy. You can purchase nitrogen-rich soil and compost at home supply and garden supply stores."

This way, each plant has enough room for its roots to take to the soil. [10] X Research source If you have multiple rows of onions, leave 12–18 in (30–46 cm) between each one."

An immediate watering helps the plant take to its new home. Then, water your onions when the soil goes dry.

Then, wait for the soil to dry before watering it again. If the weather is very warm, it may need watering daily. If the weather is mild, your onion can go a couple days without water. [17] X Research source The best time to water onions is when their soil is completely dry."
