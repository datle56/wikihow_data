      "content": "Top your salads with a portion of beans. Beans are high in soluble fiber, which binds to cholesterol and prevents it from entering your circulation. [3] X Expert Source Dee Dine Nutrition & Vegan Food Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Research studies have indicated that adding half a cup of cooked beans to your salad (when eaten once daily for two months) can substantially reduce your high cholesterol. When adding beans to your salad, plan to start with common varieties including black and pinto beans. These should all be in stock at your local grocery store. Once you’re familiar with these types of beans, you can branch out into less common types of bean including garbanzo and navy beans. Other legumes will have the same beneficial effect of lowering bad cholesterol: try adding a handful of sprouts, a dollop of hummus, or a serving of falafel to your next salad.

If you’re not in the mood for nuts on your salad, consider substituting a handful of healthy seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, or flax seeds. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In addition to providing healthy, unsaturated fats and delicious flavors, nuts are also a substitute for high-cholesterol croutons. Croutons, as with many other breads and grain products, are high in bad cholesterols."

      "content": "Try salmon with your salad. Unlike other types of fatty, unhealthy meat, salmon is actually quite healthy when added to a salad. Salmon is a fatty food, but its fats are good for your health: the fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which boost your heart health and can help lower LDL cholesterol. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Salmon is a rich fish with plenty of flavor, so you won’t need to put a large amount on a salad in order to taste the fish. Like most fish, salmon can be pulled apart into neat “flakes” once it’s been cooked. Cook your salmon—say, a quarter pound—and then flake off as much as you please on top of your salad."

      "title": "Limit the amount of meat you put on your salad.",
      "content": "Limit the amount of meat you put on your salad. Meat is high in fats and bad cholesterol and should be put on a salad only sparingly, if at all. High-fat meats and fried meats—such as bacon—are among the least-cholesterol-friendly types of meat to put on a salad. [10] X Expert Source Dee Dine Nutrition & Vegan Food Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Fatty meats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which raise the level of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in your body. [11] X Research source If you enjoy meats on your salad, opt for a leaner cut. Look at your local deli for lean cuts of meat (those that contain less fat), or purchase a package of cold-cuts that is marked “low fat.” Opt for lighter meats—such as turkey and chicken—over fatty pork and beef."

      "content": "Skip the creamy dressing on your salad. Creamy, rich salad dressings tend to be high in fats—especially saturated fats—which will increase the levels of cholesterol on the salad. [12] X Expert Source Dee Dine Nutrition & Vegan Food Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Avoid these fatty salad dressings; to check which dressings are relatively high in saturated fats, examine the nutrition facts label on the back of the salad-dressing bottle. Thinner, vinegar- and oil-based dressings—such as balsamic vinaigrette—will contain less bad cholesterol than rich, creamy dressings including ranch and blue cheese. You can also skip the dressing altogether, and substitute a few cut-up pieces of fruit. Slice a sweet and juicy fruit (like an orange or a handful of strawberries) into bite-sized cubes and toss the fruit in with your salad."

      "content": "Hold the cheese. If you normally put shredded or crumbled cheese on your salads, you may want to reconsider. Many of the types of cheese commonly added to salads—such as feta, blue cheese, cheddar, mozzarella, and gouda — are high in saturated fats, which are directly linked to LDL cholesterol. [13] X Research source If you’d still like to serve cheese on your salad, look at your local grocery store for cheeses marked “low fat,” as these will have fewer saturated fats and less cholesterol. Serve these cheeses in moderation on your salad. You can also add a dollop of cottage cheese to your salad, as cottage cheese is low in cholesterol."

      "content": "Innovate with your lettuce choices. Lettuce is the foundation of most types of salad, and many types of lettuce or lettuce-substitutes should be available at your local grocery store. When choosing lettuce for your salad—romaine, iceberg, green leaf—be aware that they’re all cholesterol-friendly.

If you’re tired of the three mentioned types of lettuce, consider expanding to spinach leaves, spring leaves, kale, or a mix that combines multiple types of lettuce.

Although avocados are a fatty food, they contain significant amounts of good, healthy fats—including oleic acid and monounsaturated fats—and do not contain high amounts of saturated fats. Consequently, avocados will help raise your levels of good cholesterol, and lower levels of bad cholesterol. [18] X Expert Source Dee Dine Nutrition & Vegan Food Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Avocados are commonly served as a garnish on the top of a salad. Cut each avocado half into thin slices, and arrange these on top of your salad. Alternately, cut each avocado half into half-inch squares, and sprinkle a half-cup or so on top of your salad."

To make this minimalist salad, cut up and combine 2 ½ cups of grapefruit with 1 ½ cups of green apples. If you would prefer not cut up the grapefruit—which could result in a large amount of liquid in the salad—try pulling the slices into finely “shredded” segments. [19] X Research source Mix in 2 or 3 tablespoons of diced walnuts for added flavor, texture, and heart-friendly omega 3 fatty acids. Serve the salad immediately.

Compared to thick, creamy salad dressings, these contain a higher percentage of healthy fats that help reduce cholesterol levels. They are still high-fat foods, so use a small amount with other flavorful ingredients. For example, mix ½ cup of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon of paprika, 1/8 teaspoon of dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. [20] X Research source Combine all of these ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat together until well blended. The liquid ingredients may separate, so be sure to shake the dressing well before serving."
