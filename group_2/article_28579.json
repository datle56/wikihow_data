The best height is right on the crown of your head, so that you could just see the top of the ponytail poking up if you look in the mirror.

The ponytail should be tight, but not so tight that it causes tension and breakage."

A small elastic will hold the hair in place while you craft your bun. [3] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020.

      "content": "Twist the ponytail into a tight rope. A tight rope will lead to a more secure bun, but donâ€™t make it so tight that it breaks your hair or hurts. Some ballerinas like to create their bun in 2 parts by splitting their hair in half to make twisting easier. If you do this, simply repeat the following steps for both halves."

      "content": "Start to tightly wind the strand of hair around the ponytail holder. Follow the direction you twisted in for a neat, tight bun. If you twisted clockwise, wrap clockwise. You want to keep the rope of hair close to the ponytail holder. Use bobby pins to start securing everything down."

      "title": "Fasten the hair with bobby pins that match your hair color.",
      "content": "Fasten the hair with bobby pins that match your hair color. Place pins at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock, if your bun was a clock face. Place extra pins in between these sections as well, especially if your hair is thick. If the first half of your bun feels a little shaky, put more bobby pins in if desired. Many ballerinas prefer the U-shaped pins, as they capture more hair and hold longer. Repeat these same steps for the second half of your ponytail, if necessary. If you do, make sure your twist and turn the second half the opposite way as the first. [4] X Research source"

Use water and a comb to really straighten out your hair, combing out any bumps or fly-away hairs causing problems. If you have thicker or unruly hair, a little gel may be helpful, too."

If you've recently washed your hair, and everything is silky smooth, you might try a texturizing spray to give the strands some hold. Like most up-dos, this look is a bit easier to pull off with \"day old\" hair. But, if you're fresh and clean, some texturizer should do the trick. [5] X Research source"

With one hand around your tight coil of hair, use the other hand to keep to press and hold the bun around your ponytail as you wrap it. The curl between your thumb and first finger, for example, is a great tool to help mold a perfectly rounded bun."

      "content": "Split the ponytail down the middle and build the bun in 2 parts. For girls with thinner hair, or for a more \"classic\" look, you just twist the entire ponytail. But for girls with thick or uneven length hair, or for a slightly more secure hold, you can go with the \"2-part\" method. Simply pull the ponytail in half, then twist and wrap both halves around the base of the ponytail for a \"figure 8\" bun. If you're doing the bun in 2 parts, simply repeat the exact same process for both parts. However, when you get to the wrapping and pinning, just make sure the 2 strands are wrapped in opposite directions (1 clockwise, 1 counter-clockwise)."

If you're a brunette, don't use the blonde hair net because then you have a lighter bun than the rest of your hair."
