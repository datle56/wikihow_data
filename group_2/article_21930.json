      "content": "A hard part refers to a sharp line shaved on the side of your head. Also known as the razor part, the hard part is a clean shaved line on the side of your head that separates the hair on one side from the other. It’s usually cut with a razor or trimmer and can be paired with fades, spikes, undercuts, and other hairstyles to add definition. [1] X Research source What's the difference between a hard part and a soft part? A hard part is a line shaved into your head with a razor or trimmer, while a soft part is when the hair is brushed or combed into 2 distinct sections. [2] X Research source Where do I put my hard part? Comb your hair forward to see where your hair naturally parts and separates into 2 sections. This is the best place to shave your hard part, but you can always talk to your barber to see if you can train your hair to part to the other side."

If you want a natural look, for example, request a subtle, thin hard part. For a more aggressive and edgy look, ask for a wider hard part. Tell your barber to keep the top long or short, depending on your preferences, and blend it into a low, mid, or high fade. You can also ask them to pair the hard part with an undercut, quiff, pompadour, or any haircut you like. [3] X Research source There are so many different hard part haircuts (which we’ll cover later on), but be sure to show your barber reference photos of hard parts that have the length, part, graduation, and styling you like. The key to a flattering haircut is to be clear about what you want!"
