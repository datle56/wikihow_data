      "title": "Groom your dog",
      "content": "Groom your dog regularly to prevent attracting flies. Flies gravitate towards dirt and bad odors. If your dog is brushed and bathed once or twice a month, they are less likely to attract flies. Brush and bathe your dog in addition to their monthly grooming session whenever you notice flies targeting your dog, especially during the summer months when flies are more active. Make sure you're cleaning and trimming the fur around your dog's anus and genitals so it doesn't get matted or dirty."

      "content": "House train your dog. Flies often lay their eggs in fecal matter. If your dog has poor hygiene, they will be more susceptible to fly bites. Train your dog to toilet in a specific area of the yard to make cleanup easier. Set up a daily toileting routine for your dog and reward them for relieving themselves in the designated area."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda on your dog's bedding to get rid of lingering odors. If your dog's bedding still smells unpleasant after washing it, baking soda may get rid of the scent. Sprinkle a little baking soda on the bedding, leave it for about 15 minutes and then vacuum it up. Re-apply the baking soda as needed or whenever you wash your dog's bedding to keep the bedding smelling fresh. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Vacuum your carpets",
      "content": "Vacuum your carpets several times a week. If your dog is often bothered by flies in your home, you may have an infestation. Regularly vacuuming your carpet will help you pick up any fly eggs on the ground that may be unseen by the naked eye. After vacuuming your home, empty the vacuum cleaner outside to prevent reinfestation."

      "title": "Clean up any trash or waste in your home or yard.",
      "content": "Clean up any trash or waste in your home or yard. Because flies thrive in dirty conditions, keeping your dog's living areas well-maintained is important for preventing fly bites. Throw away any garbage, dog waste, or old food as you see it to avoid unpleasant smells, which can attract flies quickly. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring your dog inside during the hottest times of the day. Flies are most active during the summer months, especially during the day. The hotter the temperature, the more likely your dog is to be infested with flies. Keep your dog indoors during the late morning and afternoon to prevent fly bites. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly to your dog's ears. If your dog's ears are often bitten by flies, apply a thin coating of petroleum jelly to the area. Squirt a small amount of petroleum jelly into your hand and rub it into both sides of your dog's ears. This will prevent flies from landing there again and give your dog's wounds time to heal. [5] X Research source Open bite wounds can attract more flies, so applying petroleum jelly to your dog's ears is important to prevent more irritation."

      "content": "Make a fly repellent from vinegar, mineral oil, and scented essential oils.

      "title": "Hang up fly traps or buy fly-trapping plants.",
      "content": "Hang up fly traps or buy fly-trapping plants. Hangable fly traps stay out of a dog's reach while catching any flies that may be in the house. If, for whatever reason, you are against fly traps, purchase a Venus flytrap or other carnivorous plant to naturally lower your fly infestation. [6] X Research source Venus flytraps can be grown outdoors or by a windowsill. They require routine care and maintenance to keep healthy."

      "content": "Light a few citronella candles in your home. Citronella is a scent that's safe for dogs and that insects find repellant. If you would prefer not to kill flies, purchase several citronella candles and use them in the rooms your dog most often frequents. [7] X Research source Other citronella-based fragrances, like essential oils or cleaning sprays, can also repel insects but flies find smoke most repulsive. Never leave your candle unattended or low enough that your pet could knock it over."

Fly repellents made from pyrethrum are usually non-toxic and safe for dogs. [8] X Research source Pet-safe fly repellants are available online or at most pet stores."
