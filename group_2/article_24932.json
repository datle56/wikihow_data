      "content": "Charge your phone throughout the day. Your phone's battery has a fixed amount of charging cycles (the number of times you charge the battery from 0% to 100%). For example, if your battery has a lifespan of 400 charging cycles, letting the battery drain every day means your battery will only last 400 days. [1] X Research source If you top off the battery before it drains completely, it reduces the number of overall charging cycles, which makes your battery last longer. Keeping a battery at full charge or always draining it to 0 can damage it and reduce its capacity. Try to keep your battery midway charged when you can and only charge to 100% when you need the extra time."

      "content": "Exposure to very high or low temperatures drains the battery quickly. Batteries are made to work best at room temperature, which is about 68 °F (20 °C). [2] X Research source Your battery, especially when fully charged, will drain much faster in extreme temperatures. This can cause damage to the battery over time. [3] X Research source Avoid using your phone at all if the temperature is below freezing 32 °F (0 °C). If you live in a very cold region and spend a lot of time outdoors, invest in an insulated phone case. Only charge your battery at temperatures between 41 °F (5 °C) and 95 °F (35 °C). If the phone or charger feels hot to the touch during a charging session, unplug the phone from the charger as soon as possible to avoid damaging the battery."

      "content": "To avoid parasitic load, don't play games or stream videos while charging your phone. Parasitic load is what happens while a battery is being drained during charging. [5] X Research source Parasitic load adds higher voltage stress to the battery, increases heat, and can cause parts of the battery to continually cycle and deteriorate faster than the rest of the cell. While you can take calls or browse the web during a charging session, avoid heavy tasks."

Both Androids and iPhones have special battery-conservation modes that turn off background apps, decrease processing power, dim the screen, and disable other services that can drain your battery quickly. To turn on your iPhone's Low Power Mode, open the Control Center and tap the battery icon. If you have a Samsung Galaxy, open Settings and go to Battery and device care > Battery > Power saving . Tap the switch to turn on Power Saving Mode. [6] X Research source For other Androids, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Saver and tap Turn on now . [7] X Research source"
