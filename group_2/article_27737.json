Add more lime, more baby oil and more petroleum jelly in small amounts until it starts to loosen up. Stir well and pour it onto the sheet again. If the clay feels crumbly, it needs more wax and coconut oil. Melt some wax in the double boiler again. Add some coconut oil and place your crumbly wax in the pot. Stir until it is combined."
