      "content": "Pick a theme and your materials. Scrapbooks showcase photos, memorabilia, and stories that are united by a theme. The theme may be very general, like a family photo album, or incredibly specific, like a wedding album. It is important to settle on a theme before you purchase your supplies and/or start crafting. Your theme will inform the amount of material you will include, the type of album that you will use, and your color scheme. [1] X Research source General themes may include: family, children or an individual child, pet(s), and extended family members. Specific themes may include: wedding, birthday, school year, sports season, vacation, holiday celebration, and pregnancy/baby."

Take a moment to jot these stories down—you write down keywords, brief descriptions, or complete tales. When your list is complete, look over the items and decide how you want to organize these stories. Will you tell the stories in chronological order or group them by sub-topic? How many pages will you devote to each story? [2] X Research source"

During this process, don’t be afraid to be extremely selective. Gather a collection of photos and items that are directly related to your album’s theme. Sit down at workspace with the organized list of stories, your photos, and your memorabilia. Sort the material into categories based on the stories you wish to tell. Place the pictures and memorabilia inside labeled folders or envelopes. Go through each folder or envelope and take out any memorabilia or photos that do not pertain to your narrative.

After you’ve settled on a story list and sorted through your images and memorabilia, it's time to settle on a color scheme. Peruse the aisles of your favorite crafting store for cardstock and embellishments that complement your theme and stories. While you’re shopping, pick up any tools you may need to complete the scrapbook. To achieve a cohesive look, purchase paper and embellishments, like stickers and stamps, from the same line and color-families. Buy acid-free, lignin-free and buffered cardstock. This paper will help to preserve your handmade scrapbook. Purchase pigment-based ink pads and pens. Search for ink that is waterproof and fade resistant.

Select a size that will accommodate your theme, the number of stories you want to tell, the amount of material you intend to use, and the number of embellishments you wish to include. The most common size is 12 x 12 inches. This size is ideal for anyone who wants to fit several images, pieces of memorabilia, writings, and/or embellishments on a single page. It is also great for general albums. The 8 ½ x 11 inches album is ideal for scrapbookers with slightly less material and embellishments to work with. You can fit one to two pictures per page. This is a great size for vacation, school year, child, or pet themed scrapbook. Other common sizes include 8 x 8 inches, 6 x 6 inches, and 5 x 7 inches. These are perfect to give as gifts or to use for a very specific theme. You can fit 1 picture per page. As you shop for an album, pay attention to the type of binding used. There a three general types of bindings: post-bound, strap hinge, and 3-ring binders, or D-rings. Each binding method allows you to move pages around, remove pages, and add additional pages."
