      "title": "The “thumbs up” is a common symbol of approval or contentment.",
      "content": "The “thumbs up” is a common symbol of approval or contentment. The hand sign is formed by making a fist, then extending a thumb and pointing it upward. In American and European cultures, it’s used to express agreement, approval, or the fact that everything is going according to plan. [1] X Research source Similarly, the “thumbs down” gesture is commonly used in the U.S. to mean the opposite of a “thumbs up,” i.e., disapproval or disagreement. The “thumbs down” and “thumbs up” emojis are also very commonly used to express these ideas over text. In other countries, however, these hand signs have a different meaning. The “thumbs up” sign is considered a major insult in many Islamic and Asian countries, and the “thumbs down” sign may be considered rude and arrogant in other cultures. [2] X Research source In Australia, the “thumbs up” gesture shares the European and American meanings unless it’s moved up and down—which turns it into an insult."

      "content": "The peace sign is a mostly universal positive symbol of peace and unity. This meaning of the peace sign came about during the Vietnam War and the “hippie” era in the United States, during which the peace sign began to symbolize pacifism and efforts to end the conflict. [3] X Research source Prior to the 1960s, however, the hand sign that features the index and middle fingers extended in a “V” actually indicated “victory.” For this reason, the symbol is sometimes referred to as a “victory sign.” [4] X Research source In the U.S., the peace sign holds the same meaning regardless of palm orientation. In other countries like the U.K., South Africa, and Australia, however, making a peace sign with the palm facing inward is considered a major insult. [5] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Unfortunately, the OK symbol has also been used by white supremacy groups to indicate their affiliation and express racist views.
