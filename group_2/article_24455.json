      "content": "Back Market is cheap because they sell refurbished products. Refurbished products have the same functions as new products, but they can’t be sold as new since they’ve been used. Refurbishing involves putting pre-owned products through a series of tests and repairs that bring them back to their original performance. [5] X Research source Since these products have been used and repaired, their value is lower than a new product. Refurbished products are different from second-hand products. Refurbished products are professionally tested and repaired to ensure they meet a certain standard. Second-hand products aren’t. [6] X Research source Some users have received products with faulty batteries. Products on Back Market are required to have at least 85% of their original battery capacity (besides smartphones, which are required to have 80%). If you receive a faulty product, reach out to Back Market to resolve the issue. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "To stay safe on Back Market, take precautions before buying. Check the seller’s profile for good reviews and a history of selling to ensure that they are legitimate. Also, make sure to ask your seller about the device you are looking to buy. If you notice any discrepancies between the description and what the seller is telling you, proceed with caution. If, at any point, you feel uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to back out of the deal and go with another seller. Legitimate sellers won’t ask you to pay them outside of Back Market. If a seller asks you to pay them off-platform, don’t buy their product. They are trying to scam you. [10] X Research source Back Market has all of the information they need for you to buy a product. Don’t give the seller any more information than what’s required. Back Market takes 3-7 days to deliver your product, depending on the seller, the item’s origin, and your location. If it takes any longer, reach out to Customer Care for assistance. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Getting a refurbished iPhone is a great way to save money. There are risks, though, as you could possibly receive a faulty device. To avoid these risks, make sure you look into the seller before buying to ensure that they’re reliable. Good reviews and an extensive history are signs of reliability. Don’t buy an iPhone that’s Activation Locked. That means that it was lost or stolen. [12] X Research source Refurbished iPhones may have a lower battery capacity than new iPhones, but they both have the same features. Check for damage when you receive your iPhone. If there are scratches, faulty buttons, or the Lightning connector is damaged, contact Back Market’s Customer Care team to start the return process."

Buyers have generally had good experiences with purchasing MacBooks on Back Market, but some have received faulty products. To ensure that your MacBook is up to standard, check the seller’s reviews to make sure they’re selling good products. Make sure your device doesn’t have a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile. An MDM profile means that the device is remotely managed by a company or organization, which is a strong sign that it’s stolen. If your device does turn out to have an MDM profile, contact Back Market immediately so you can get a refund. [13] X Research source"
