      "content": "Get the look. Do not have, for example, a white undershirt with a black tee and white cuffs. It will show you are just starting out and other greasers will call you a poser. Get Levi's 501s, rustler jeans or any straight-legged, slim (not skinny), or boot-cut jeans, and cuff either 1–4 inches (2.5–10.2 cm) or degrees for cold weather. [2] X Research source If you have a school uniform that's not strict, you could wear Levi’s tan jeans, and shirt (even with sweater vest) you could roll the sleeves up, or wear a jacket, crop your pants, and wear chucks or, if you have to, dress shoes or motorcycle boots. For girls get skinny blue jeans and roll them up or wear leather pants. Buy Dickie's work shirts, fitted t-shirts of any colour (roll-up sleeves, but this is not a requirement), western shirts, bowling shirts, slim fit suits with a bola or plain tees of any colour. Get a Dickies or Levi’s work jacket, denim, windbreaker, or a leather jacket (any colour), and for work out or exercise, you could wear khaki shorts, a tee-shirt, and Chuck Taylor's or timberland boots. Timberlands are also good for everyday wear with loose or tight jeans and a classic white tee. In the winter wear leather bomber jackets."

If you want to be a real slick cat, either for everyday use or for special occasions, get some creepers such as T.U.K.S. or wingtips."

      "content": "Get the hair right. [3] X Research source The main styles are pompadours , afro-dours, part/afro-arts, conk, Jheri curls, the quiff, elephant's trunk, DA, or slicked back. For girls, you can get greasy curls pin-ups anything you want that shows you’re a greaser. Snooki's hairstyle from jersey shore would work too. You can make your own combinations, again as long as it shows that you are a greaser. If you don't want long hair you can get a short crew cut, or for black people, a shirt version if a hightop fade, those hairstyles were also popular in the 1950s, and keep in mind the term \"greaser\" didn't actually exist in the '50s. Another option is to get a stingy brim fedora or a paperboy hat. Make sure it's a real fedora made of feeling with a shiny band around it tied into a bow or a leather cap."
