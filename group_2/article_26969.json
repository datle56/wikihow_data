The chicken is cooked when it is golden brown on the outside and white in the center. [3] X Research source Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel."

      "title": "Prepare the chicken.",
      "content": "Prepare the chicken. To serve four, you should prepare approximately one pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs. Traditional stir-fries generally go easy on the meat and heavy on the vegetables, but it's up to you. Trim any fat off the chicken using a sharp knife, then cut into 1/4-inch thick bite-size slices. For extra flavor, marinate the chicken before cooking. Combine 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of rice wine or dry sherry and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Pour the marinade over the chicken and stir to combine. Leave to sit (refrigerated) for as little as five minutes or as long as an hour before cooking."

      "content": "Decide what to cook with. A flat bottomed, carbon steel wok is the best type of pan to prepare your stir-fry in. You can also use a flat-bottom frying pan, but you miss out on using the sides of the pan as cooking surfaces, unlike a wok. You may also have trouble with ingredients falling out of the pan when preparing a large amount of stir-fry. Do not buy a non-stick wok. Non-stick woks are less than useless for high-heat stir-frying; they are downright dangerous. This is because non-stick coating is not supposed to be heated to a very high temperature, but all wok cooking happens at a high temperature. Use a fish spatula or other thin, flexible spatula for stirring."

      "content": "Choose your vegetables. Nearly any combination of vegetables can be used in a stir-fry, so it is easy to adapt to your personal tastes and preferences. Some chefs recommend choosing only 2-3 vegetables for a stir-fry, as they believe that keeping it simple will prevent the dish from being too busy, while also saving you from too much prep work. Others take more of an \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" approach. Go with whatever sounds good to you, or whatever you happen to have in your kitchen. When preparing the veg, try to chop everything into pieces of approximately the same size. This prevents one vegetable from becoming overcooked while another is still raw. Regardless of uniform size, some vegetables will still cook quicker than others. Place all of the chopped veg into bowls, separated according to their cooking times. This will make it easy for you to throw all of the vegetables with longer cooking times into the wok together, while keeping the fast cooking veg separate. If you are unsure of how long each vegetable takes to cook, here's a quick guide: Mushrooms will need five to ten minutes, depending on their size and type. Cabbage, spinach and other greens will take approximately four to six minutes. Veggies like asparagus, broccoli, carrots and green beans will take between three and five minutes. Peppers, peas, courgette and squash will only need two to three minutes. Bean sprouts are the fastest of all, with a cooking time of less than a minute."

Stir-fry sauces can be spicy, sweet, salty or nutty and can lift a stir-fry from healthy and boring to flavorsome and exotic. You can buy stir-fry sauces at the supermarket, or make your own. Here are some ideas: Lemon sauce: 1/4 cup lemon juice 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1/4 cup chicken broth 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 tablespoons sugar Sweet and sour sauce: 1/4 cup chicken broth 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes Satay sauce: 4 rounded tablespoonfuls chunky peanut butter 3 tablespoons dark soy, Tamari 3 tablespoons honey 1-inch ginger root, peeled and minced 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 orange, juiced"

The carbohydrates can be mixed in with the stir-fry, or served on the side. You have several options when it comes to deciding what to eat with your stir-fry. Brown rice, this is probably the healthiest option. White rice, such as basmati or jasmine. Noodles, such as Chinese ramen-style or rice noodles. Pasta, such as angel hair. Nothing! Stir-fries can be just as tasty eaten on their own. This is a good option if you are trying to limit your carb intake."
