Attractive women might be used to hearing compliments about their looks. Compliment them on who they are inside to make your birthday greetings more memorable. For a more serious, heartfelt wish, make a list of the qualities you admire about her. Too many compliments about her looks might make your birthday wishes sound like empty flattery. Instead, try to focus on what she likes about herself. If you want to give her a special compliment about her appearance, focus on something she has control over, like her taste in clothes, how well she styles her hair, or the way she carries herself with confidence or grace."
