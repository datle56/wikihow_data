      "title": "Her body language is more closed off around you.",
      "content": "Her body language is more closed off around you. When someone is attracted to you, they tend to have very open, engaged body language. This means they’ll face you and lean in when you talk, and they’ll sit or stand near you when you hang out. [1] X Research source If you notice that she’s pointing her body away from you or keeping more physical distance between you than usual, these could be signs her feelings are changing."

      "content": "She’s making a lot less eye contact. Eye contact is a major sign of attraction, and when someone is into you, they’ll gaze into your eyes pretty often. [2] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source If she starts avoiding your eyes when you talk or looking away from you when you try to catch her attention, these could be subtle signs that she’s not as attracted to you anymore. Eye contact also signals that you’re interested in what someone's saying, so a lack of eye contact can mean that she’s not fully present or engaged when you’re hanging out.

      "title": "She’s not touching you as much as she used to.",
      "content": "She’s not touching you as much as she used to. If someone is super into you, they’ll often go out of their way to touch you. This would include things like casually touching your arm, holding your hand, brushing her fingers through your hair, putting her hand on your chest, or going in for kisses. [4] X Research source However, when a girl isn’t interested anymore, she might stop touching you altogether or go out of her way to avoid physical closeness. If your relationship started out with a lot of physical touches and PDA, but now she hardly gives any at all, it could be time to talk to her about where the relationship is going. You may also start to feel like she's faking her interest and pleasure in bed. However, keep in mind that many women who fake orgasms often do so in order to protect their partner's feelings—not necessarily because they've lost interest in them. Reader Poll: We asked 1698 wikiHow readers and 48% of them believe that the main reason women fake orgasms is to make their partner feel good about their performance . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "She’s always cancelling plans or saying she’s too busy to hang out. If you feel like you’re always chasing her or struggling to pin her down for plans, this could be a red flag. “If she’s always giving vague responses, like ‘Maybe, I’ve got some work stuff,’ or ‘Let’s play it by ear,’ that could be a sign that she’s less eager and invested,” Carmichael explains. “Because typically people who have a crush on each other will be eager to find time to get together.” [5] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 21 March 2023. It’s possible that she’s just busy, and there are valid reasons to miss a date. However, if this happens more than 50% of the time, it could be a sign that she’s not as invested anymore."

      "title": "She avoids being alone with you.",
      "content": "She avoids being alone with you. Notice the type of dates she wants to have. If she’s always inviting friends to meet up with you or suggesting group dates instead of solo ones, this could be a sign that she’s trying to keep things more casual or low-key between you. If this happens, it could be a good idea to talk to her about where the relationship is going so you're both on the same page. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "She pays less attention to you when you hang out in groups.",
      "content": "She pays less attention to you when you hang out in groups. “You can tell if someone’s interested in you if they’re asking you a lot about yourself or giving you a lot of attention, [to the point] that it’s a little disproportionate to how they interact with others,” Jeney explains. [7] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. “If she doesn’t really give you much attention when you’re in the same space, that’s probably an indicator that she’s not interested in you.” [8] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Similarly, if she stops inviting you to group hangouts that she used to want you to tag along for, this could be another sign."

      "title": "She never texts you first.",
      "content": "She never texts you first. “If you’re the person who’s always initiating the text, you might be more invested in her than she is in you,” explains Carmichael. [9] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 21 March 2023. Likewise, if she takes a super long long time to respond (around 24 hours or more), Carmichael says this “might be a sign that she’s not as interested.” [10] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 21 March 2023. However, Carmichael clarifies that some women she works with don’t like to text first because they prefer for a crush to pursue them. For these women, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad sign if they don’t reach out first. [11] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 21 March 2023. With this in mind, it’s best to look out for a change in her texting behavior. If she used to text first all the time but now she never does, this could mean she isn’t into you, but if she never reached out first to begin with, it’s likely nothing to worry about."

      "content": "She flirts with other people. If your crush or girlfriend is checking other people out or flirting with them in front of you, this is usually a red flag. This includes in-person flirting (complimenting others in a flirty way, making flirty comments, being touchy-feely with others), as well as virtual flirting (leaving flirty comments on others’ social media posts, sending flirty texts to others, etc). [12] X Research source When this happens, it’s a pretty clear indicator that she’s not interested."

[13] X Research source If you notice that she doesn’t care or pay attention at all when you talk to other girls, it may be a sign that she isn’t interested in you anymore. For example, if you’re having a group hang out with your crush and some friends and she couldn’t care less that you’ve been talking to someone else all night, she might not think of you in a romantic way."

[14] X Research source If disagreements over little things start to become big blow-outs every time, you should take some time to evaluate your relationship. She may be starting to lose interest in you romantically, or you might just not be compatible with each other. “Whenever you have an argument, if you feel like you always have to be the person to reach and try to straighten things out, or they would pretty much just let things drift away and you would never see them again, that would also be a sign that they're not into it anymore,” Carmichael says.

      "content": "She doesn’t make an effort to be romantic anymore. “As people get more comfortable in relationships, they may just not plan as elaborate dates as they did during a courtship phase,” Carmichael explains. “So, if you notice a constellation of ways where they're just no longer putting effort or interest in the relationship…this could be a sign that they’re potentially not into it anymore.” [16] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 21 March 2023. For example, maybe she used to suggest that the two of you dress up and go out to dinner on a regular basis, but now she never plans romantic things with you. If you’re in this situation, her feelings could be fading."

      "content": "She never wants to talk about the future with you. If she tries to shut down the conversation or change the topic when you bring up your future together, this is a pretty clear indication that she doesn’t see your relationship lasting in the long run. “That might be a sign that she doesn’t have the depth of feeling you have,” Carmichael explains. [17] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 21 March 2023. For example, if you mention going on a weekend trip together in the next few months and she gives a vague or evasive response, this may mean that she doesn’t think you’ll still be hanging out at that point."

So, if you’re uncertain about where the two of you stand, try asking her how she feels openly, and be willing to work through any problems that come up."

Whatever she ends up saying, it’s important to hear her out and respect her point of view. She might tell you that there’s nothing wrong. In this case, ask yourself if you could have been overthinking things. If so, your next step would be to work to calm your anxiety about the relationship and try to accept that things are going well. On the other hand, she may be upset about specific things that you can address to make things work . For example, she could say she wants to spend more quality time together, which is something you can fix. Finally, she might say she wants to end things, and you’ll need to accept her decision. This can be tough, but at least you'll know she wasn't the one, so that you can start the healing process and find your perfect match in the future."
