      "content": "Make sure your location is big enough to hold all of your guests! You can host a party at your home, a local park, a restaurant or bar, a community center, a roller rink, a bowling alley, or even at some zoos! Choose a date and time that will work for most people, like on a weekend or in the evening. [1] X Research source Little kids might appreciate a party at a place with activities, like a roller rink or a bowling alley. Older adults are probably fine with a party in your home or at a restaurant. If gathering in-person isn’t an option, you can throw a party via video chat. Invite your guests to join a meeting on Zoom, Google Hangouts, or Skype, then eat and chat like you would at any other party."

      "content": "This will make decoration and food shopping way easier. If you’re planning a party for a small child, you might choose their favorite book or TV show. If it’s for an older kid or a young adult, something a little more sophisticated might work. [2] X Research source Jungles, zoo animals, pirates, princesses, and ocean life are all fun themes to choose for a little kid. Glow in the dark/neon, sci-fi, night club, and the beach are all great themes for a young adult. Older adults probably don’t need a theme, so you can just choose some fun party colors instead."

      "title": "This will give your guests plenty of time to work it into their schedule.",
      "content": "This will give your guests plenty of time to work it into their schedule. Send paper invitations, email invites, or text messages to all your guests a few weeks before the party. [3] X Research source If you’re hosting a party for your child, have them hand out invitations during class. You can buy invitations that match the theme of your party for a cute way to tie it all together. Make sure you note the time and place of the party on the invitation."

      "title": "Your guests will probably eat as they walk around and chat.",
      "content": "Your guests will probably eat as they walk around and chat. Pick up some food that’s easy to eat on the go, like chips, sandwiches, and ice cream bars. If you’re hosting a children’s party, be sure to check with the other parents to see if anyone has dietary restrictions. Popcorn, pretzels, and M&Ms are all fun finger foods that your guests can eat. If you’d like a healthy alternative, try vegetables or fresh fruit. Older adults might like food that’s a little more fancy, like crab puffs or mini quiches. If you’re hosting both kids and adults, try to get a variety of food that everyone will like."

      "title": "You can’t have food without something to wash it down!",
      "content": "You can’t have food without something to wash it down! For a kid’s party, juice and soda will do the trick. For an adult party, you may want to grab soda, beer, and wine. It’s never fun to run out of ice, so make sure you stock up on the day of the party. You could also ask your guests to bring a few drinks to share potluck-style. If you’re hosting a party for adults, you could also make up a pitcher of cocktails to share."

      "content": "It’s the most important part of the party. If you’d like to get a professional to make your cake, head to your local bakery a few days in advance to put in your order. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can make and decorate the cake yourself the night before. If your party has a theme going, decorate the cake to match it. You can use fondant, frosting, or plastic cake toppers for a fun and easy decoration. If you don’t want to deal with cutting up a huge cake for all of your guests, get some cupcakes instead. You could also splurge on some cookies as an extra sweet treat. Don’t forget to grab some candles!"

Try decorating the outside and the inside of your location to set the mood for the rest of the party. [4] X Research source If you’re going for an animal theme, put up cutouts of jungle animals, zoo animals, or aquatic animals. If you’re hosting a party for a teen or young adult, try putting up a disco ball and a fun “happy birthday” banner. Or, try a murder mystery party with cobwebs and old silverware. You could also grab a few party hats or silly glasses for guests to wear. If you’re hosting the party outside, grab some outdoor lights or hanging lanterns."

Older kids might like iSpy, cornhole, or making slime. [5] X Research source Teens and older adults probably don’t need games or an activity to do while at a party. Just make sure there’s plenty of music and snacks to go around. You could even have live entertainment, like a band or a DJ, for an older adult."

Grab your phone or a digital camera and spend some time walking around the party to take pictures of people. [6] X Research source You can send the photos out later after the party so everyone remembers what a good time they had! If you’re going to post your pics on social media, make up a fun hashtag, like #BradsBdayBash or #AlyssasBigDay."

[7] X Research source This is especially important during a party for a little kid. It’s always fun for their friends to see what kind of toys and games they got. If you want to remember this moment forever, have someone record the gift-opening with their phone. If you’re hosting a party for an older adult, opening gifts in front of everyone isn’t required. However, it can still be fun! If you’d like to send out thank you cards, make sure you write down who each gift is from."

Once everyone’s eaten their fill of snacks and finger food, light the candles and sing “Happy Birthday” before the birthday girl or boy blows them out.

[9] X Research source For older guests, fancy chocolates or cocktail kits are a fun way to send them off. Try checking out the $1 section at your local home goods store for cheap and easy goodie bag fillers. Goodie bags are optional, but they’re fairly common at birthday parties for small children."
