      "title": "Make the tahini sauce.",
      "content": "Make the tahini sauce. To make the tahini sauce, all you have to do is combine the garlic and lemon juice in a medium bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, you can whisk in the tahini, olive oil, yogurt, and ¾ teaspoon of salt until the mixture is smooth. If the mixture feels too thick to pour, then you can add another 1 or 2 tablespoons (14.8 or 29.6 ml) of water and mix it in to make it a bit thinner. You can make the sauce while you’re cooking your chicken, lamb, beef, veal, or other meat if you want to save time. Additionally, you can make the sauce two days in advance and store it in the fridge until it’s ready to be used."

      "title": "Make the pickled cabbage.",
      "content": "Make the pickled cabbage. Pickled cabbage is another important ingredient to making tasty shawarma. All you have to do to make it is to heat a bit of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add your cabbage and cook it for about 8-10 minutes, until it’s good and tender. You can stir it occasionally as you do this to make sure it’s evenly cooked. Then, remove it from the heat and add the pomegranate molasses, vinegar, and sugar. Once you do that, just season it to taste with a bit more vinegar or sugar, as well as salt and pepper. You can make the cabbage while you’re cooking the meat if you’d like to save time. Alternatively, you can make it up to two days in advance and store it in the fridge until you’re ready to use it."

      "title": "Prepare your flatbread.",
      "content": "Prepare your flatbread. You can use pita, yufka, Norfolk, or even a flour tortilla for shawarma. If you’re using flatbreads that you bought in the store or have made them ahead of time, then just warm them in a deep skillet over medium heat for a minute or two. You should do this right after you’ve finished preparing the meat so that you can place the meat into a shawarma that is nice and warm. Note that, after you’ve added your meat, tahini sauce, and cabbage to the shawarma, you can cook it, seam-side-down, for about 3 minutes in a skillet to get it nice and brown and to seal the ingredients together."

You can add lettuce, onion, tahini sauce, pickled cabbage, hummus, or whatever other ingredients you’d like to place in the flatbread. Place the chicken in the bread first, followed by the other toppings, pouring on the tahini sauce last. Wrap the flatbread similarly to a burrito, leaving an inch of space between the ingredients and the top of the bread so they don’t pour out. Once you do that, your chicken shawarma will be ready to eat! [1] X Research source"

Then, flip them over to the other side and continue cooking them until they are evenly cooked on both sides. You may need to add a bit more oil to cook your second batch. When you’re done with both of the batches, transfer them to a 9 x 13-inch roasting pan and season them with salt and pepper to your liking. Remember that you don’t have to cook them completely, just get them nice and browned. You’ll be placing them in the oven, so they will continue to cook. If you cook them too much on the skillet, they’ll be dry after being in the oven."

You can even flip the lamb chops over and move them around a bit to make sure that you get them spiced evenly. Once you’ve seasoned the lamb chops, you can cover the pan with a double-thickness of foil to prepare the lamb chops for cooking."

Once you do that, move the liquid to a 3-quart saucepan and then boil it over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until about half of it remains.

Now that you’ve prepared your lamb, you’ll need to add it to your flatbread, toss in the cabbage, and pour your tahini sauce over it to add a delicious flavor to your meat and veggies. Place the lamb in the flatbread about an inch from the edge and roll it up tightly while making sure to pull back on the edge of the flatbread in order to fold it over the filling and tuck it in like a burrito. Place it down on its seam side before cooking it in a skillet for 3 minutes until it’s ready to eat."
