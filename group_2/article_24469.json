      "title": "Gambling itself isn’t considered a sin in the Bible, but it may lead to sin.",
      "content": "Gambling itself isn’t considered a sin in the Bible, but it may lead to sin. There are no specific Bible verses condemning gambling as a mortal sin. However, gambling may lead to greed, a love of money, idolatry, unhealthy competition, and overdependence on others, all of which are discouraged or considered sins. [1] X Research source Gambling is categorized as a “sin stock,” or an activity associated with what some might view as unethical behavior. Other sin stock industries include alcohol, tobacco, and adult entertainment—activities that may or may not in themselves be wrong, but that may attract people prone to sinful behavior or that may be associated with addictive or sinful behavior."

      "title": "Gambling may be a sin for some people and not others.",
      "content": "Gambling may be a sin for some people and not others. Because gambling may lead to sin for some people, it may be considered sinful for those people to engage in gambling. The Catholic Church, for instance, considers gambling to be a sin if it causes you to spend your money unwisely or neglect other financial responsibilities, like feeding your family. So while the Bible doesn’t expressly forbid gambling, if gambling causes you to sin, then for you, it may be considered a sin. However, if you can gamble casually without becoming addicted or falling into any of the above mentioned sins, then gambling is probably not a sin for you."

      "title": "Ask yourself how it will affect your relationship with God and others.",
      "content": "Ask yourself how it will affect your relationship with God and others. If you know or believe that you could become addicted to gambling—essentially letting gambling become an idol—or that it could cause you to engage in sinful behavior or neglect your responsibilities to other people and to God, think twice before doing it. Pray to God for wisdom and insight. A gambling addiction can negatively affect your relationship with your partner, family, or friends: “In couples [where there’s] a spouse with a gambling addiction, trust is one of the biggest factors that they cite that's broken during that process,” says Tiffany Douglass, MA, founder of Wellness Retreat Recovery Center. The answer may not be black-and-white. You may not be able to gamble safely while intoxicated, for instance. Or maybe you can’t go to casinos, but you can play the church raffle. Further, gambling may be fine for you, but if you know your friend has trouble not getting carried away, then inviting them to a casino would be sinful, as you may be creating a \"stumbling block\" for them (i.e., something that causes them to sin, as Romans 14:13 says)."

      "content": "The Bible discourages greedy or selfish behavior. Though the Bible doesn’t specifically forbid gambling, it has a lot to say about the vices of greed, selfishness, and the love of money. Consider these relevant verses when trying to figure out whether or not gambling is a sin for you: “10 Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.” Ecclesiastes 5:10 [2] X Research source “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Hebrews 13:5 “Then he said to them, ‘Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.’” Luke 12:25"

      "title": "There are many verses discouraging unwise spending.",
      "content": "There are many verses discouraging unwise spending. The Bible doesn’t command us not to gamble, but it does ask that we tend to our financial responsibilities. Whether you owe someone money or need to use your money to take care of your family or other duties, if you think gambling could get in the way of these responsibilities, it may not be right for you to engage in. Check out these verses for more insight: “The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.” Proverbs 21:5 “A wise man saves for the future, but the foolish man spends whatever he gets.” Proverbs 21:20 [3] X Research source “Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence….” James 5:4-6 [4] X Research source"

      "title": "The Ten Commandments prohibit the worship of false idols.",
      "content": "The Ten Commandments prohibit the worship of false idols. False idols aren’t limited to just golden calves, but to anything that takes your attention away from God and your religious responsibilities, including addiction. If you believe you’re addicted to gambling or could become addicted, then it’s safe to assume it would be a sin for you to engage in. Consider these verses: “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God.” Exodus 20:4-6 [5] X Research source “For you shall worship no other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.” Exodus 34:14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 1 Corinthians 13:14"

      "content": "What does Jesus say about gambling? Jesus doesn't say anything specifically about gambling, but he has a lot to say against greediness, selfishness, and the love of money, and he also encourages us to love one another and not be materialistic or needlessly competitive (which is relevant, since in order to win at gambling, others must lose). [6] X Research source Check out these verses for some insight into how Jesus might feel about gambling: “Then he said to them, ‘Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.'\" Luke 12:15 \"You cannot serve both God and money.\" Matthew 6:24 \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" Mark 12:31"

      "content": "Is gambling a sin in the Qur'an? Yes. While gambling is not expressly prohibited in the Bible, it does go against the Muslim religion. [7] X Research source The Qur'an states that games of chance involving money are grave sins, as in these verses, for example: \"They ask you about wine and gambling. Say: 'In them both lies grave sin, though some benefit, to mankind. But their sin is more grave than their benefit.'\" Qur'an 2:219 \"O believers, wine and gambling, idols and divining arrows are an abhorrence, the work of Satan. So keep away from it, that you may prevail.\" Qur'an 5:90"

      "content": "Is gambling a sin in Hinduism? As with Christianity, Hinduism does not expressly forbid gambling, but it discourages behavior often associated with gambling, such as greed and materialism. Gambling may also be seen as distracting and detrimental to one's spiritual growth. For instance, the Gambler's Lament, one of the hymns of the Rigveda, consists of a monologue of a gambler sorry for all the destruction his gambling addiction has brought upon his personal life.
