The hat should be as light in color as possible, or people will be able to see it through the bed sheet that will be draped over your head."

You should still be able to see where the mark on the top of the head is, but it will be less visible to onlookers. You can also just cover the mark with white-out. Or, use a fabric marker pencil that fades (invisible fabric markers)."
