      "content": "Measure the garage door opening before purchasing panels. Use a tape measure to carefully record the length and width of the opening. Order this size so the panels will be made slightly smaller, fitting perfectly in the doorway. The panels will be about 1 ⁄ 4 in (6.4 mm) smaller than the opening."

      "title": "Lay weather stripping over the bottom door panel.",
      "content": "Lay weather stripping over the bottom door panel. At a home improvement store, purchase some rubber weather stripping. Lay the panel flat on a workbench. The stripping is shaped like a tube, and you can fit the edge of the door panel in the tube's groove. Any of the panels can be used as the lower panel. Pick one, but remember that the one with the weather stripping is the one that needs to be placed first."

      "content": "Center the door panel in the garage doorway. Have a friend help you pick up and move the heavy panel to the doorway. Position the panel in the center of the doorway, then hold a level over the panel to make sure it's level. Use shims to adjust the panel as needed. [1] X Research source Shims are small wood strips you can slide under the door panel to even out the sides. Purchase packs at a home improvement store."

You'll install the hinges the same way you did before, only this time you'll leave the trackless side empty. Align a hinge in 1 of the corners and in the center of the panel, then screw them in place. Leaving 1 side bare makes fitting and installing the track easier, so do this for every panel."
