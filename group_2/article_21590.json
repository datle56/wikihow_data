      "content": "Understand hacking for the PSP. Hacking your PSP will allow you to access a wide variety of custom made software. This software is called Homebrew, and it ranges from games to productivity programs. Hacked PSPs can also run emulators, which are programs that allow you to play games from other consoles on your PSP. Hacked PSPs can run images of PSP games without having to have the original copy. This is for legal backups only."

      "title": "Find your PSP model number.",
      "content": "Find your PSP model number. The model number will determine the software that you can install during and after the hack. There are essentially two different processes that depend on the model. For older PSPs, open the battery compartment. To the right of the Sony logo, you will see “PSP-XXXX.” All you will need to know is if it is a 1XXX, 2XXX, or 3XXX model. For the PSP Go, you can find the model number by flipping open the display and looking in the upper left-hand corner. It should say N1XXX. The ideal model is 2XXX or older model. 3XXX and the PSP Go can be hacked, but you will be slightly limited in what you can do."
