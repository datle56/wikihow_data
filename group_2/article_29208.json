      "title": "Understand the anatomy of a hip-hop beat.",
      "content": "Understand the anatomy of a hip-hop beat. All hip-hop beats use a combination of the following instruments: Drum line — Sets up the tempo and background of the beat. The drum line is the most important aspect of the beat. Bass line — Complements the drum line. The bass line is less important in the grand scheme of the beat than is the drum line. Lead — The main instrument used to create a melody (e.g., a piano). Support — Any other instruments used in conjunction with the melody (e.g., minor string instruments)."

      "title": "Learn the proper timing.",
      "content": "Learn the proper timing. Most hip-hop instrumentals are created in 4/4 time, which means each measure has four beats in it. In other words, one measure might have a drum line, a snare, a hat, and a clap each play once before resetting for the next measure. Additionally, the average hip-hop instrumental is around 115 BPM (beats per minute). [1] X Research source For a slower hip-hop beat, you can use a 2/4 beat, which is two beats per measure."

      "title": "Know which instruments are usually present.",
      "content": "Know which instruments are usually present. Hip-hop beats typically use a combination of the kick, clap, hat, and snare drum effects as their drum line, while a bass guitar may be used for the bass line. Technically, these are the only instruments you need to create a true hip-hop beat. Lead and support instruments can be anything from a synth to a piano."

      "title": "Consider your beat's purpose.",
      "content": "Consider your beat's purpose. While hip-hop and rap typically focus on spoken word more than singing, some hip-hop artists tread the line between rap and R&B in their songs; if you want to have a portion of your beat devoted to a singing section, you may want to change the beat's lead and support instruments to complement the section. You can add rap lyrics to virtually any 4/4 beat and have the end result sound fine, so you shouldn't worry too much about structuring your beat specifically if you're creating a traditional hip-hop composition."
