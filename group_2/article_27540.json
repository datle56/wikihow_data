There is something you can learn from virtually every circumstance you encounter. This allows you to constructively cope with negative situations. You find the lesson and apply what you learned to the future. When you face a problem, think of it as a challenge that is strengthening you for later circumstances. Ask yourself, \"what can I learn about this situation?\" You can confidently leave this situation knowing that you will make a wiser, more-informed decision down the road. [1] X Research source"

True enough, we have very little control over a lot of things in our lives, the weather and the price of gas, to name a few. But, we should concentrate our energies on those things we can control to boost our outlook on life. To demonstrate, researchers found that optimism was much greater in subjects for events in which they had a fair amount of control, such as being the driver in a car accident or getting skin cancer, as opposed to those in which they had very little control like being the passenger in a car accident or having to wear a hearing aid.

Drop \"have to\" for \"get to\" - \"I get to work out in the gym today.\" Swap \"problems\" for \"situation\" - \"We have a situation that we need to discuss.\" Trade in \"mistakes\" for \"valuable lessons\" - We all learned from your valuable lesson.

Comparisons keep you feeling bad about yourself, because there will always be someone who is more attractive, richer, or more successful. Aim to stop idealizing and start humanizing. What this means is instead of looking from the outside and idealizing another person's life, you should realistically assume that this person also has faults and bad days. No human being is perfect.

Optimism can be learned.

The very first step to turning lemons into lemonade is being aware of your negativity. If you are blind to your tendency to only see the bad side of things, you won't be able to transform this habit. Track your thoughts on a daily basis, becoming attuned to the negative assumptions you make. [17] X Research source When you notice a negative thought pattern, override this thought by coming up with something more positive to say. For example, you might ail a test in school and conclude \"I'm not good at anything!\" Transform this thought into something like \"Math is hard, but I am really good in English and History.\" If you are a lifelong pessimist, it will seem insincere to override your natural negative thinking. Fight against this fake feeling; it will get easier in time."

People in a range of jobs and industries practice visualization to help them find success--professional athletes and CEOs included. [19] X Research source Visualizing success accomplishes four things: generates creative ideas to help you reach your desired outcome, programs your brain to look for and notice the resources you need to succeed, draws positive people and situations to you (i.e. activates the law of attraction), and give you the necessary motivation to take appropriate action. [20] X Research source Visualization is a fairly easy technique to master. Set aside a few minutes each day for quiet. Close your eyes and envision yourself living life as if your goals were already achieved. Notice what's happening in vivid detail, activating your senses to make the vision seem more real."

[21] X Research source This strategy helps you balance your budding optimistic self with your overly negative pessimist one. You direct your energies towards the better outcome occurring. But, you also have prepared yourself and thought out an alternate plan to deal with the worst outcome, if it should occur."
