      "content": "Choose the material for the cover and cut out two identical pieces. For your first book, cardboard is easy to work with. Once you get the hang of it, you can move to wood or game boards. [1] X Research source The cover needs to be 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) wider and 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) longer than the inside pages. If you use printer paper, cut your cover so it’s 8 3 ⁄ 4 by 11 1 ⁄ 2 inches (22 by 29 cm)."

      "content": "Fold and sew your stacks of pages. Start by folding six sheets of paper in half. Then, sew them together at the crease in a figure-8 pattern. Make sure you start and end at the same point and the knot faces inside. This will create a spine. Repeat to create more.

      "title": "Stack and flatten your six-sheet stacks and measure the spine.",
      "content": "Stack and flatten your six-sheet stacks and measure the spine. Make sure they are properly aligned when stacking them on top of one another. Press them down between some heavy books to flatten them. Measure the width of the stacks’ collective spine—you’ll need to create the spine cover."

    {
      "title": "Sew your stacks together.",
      "content": "Sew your stacks together. Start by opening each stack to its central crease. Measure and mark about six dots along the crease, equally distant from one another. Make the same marks on the crease of all of your stacks. Pierce them with a sewing needle. Use the same figure-8 pattern from earlier to sew through all the stacks, weaving the thread through each stack’s hole before moving to the next point. Alternatively, staple them together using a heavy-duty stapler."

      "title": "Cut a strip of fabric and glue it to the spine.",
      "content": "Cut a strip of fabric and glue it to the spine. Use scissors to cut a strip from any thin fabric (like old sheets) that’s as long as the pages and 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) wider than the spine measurement you took. Coat one side of the fabric with fabric glue and stick the fabric to the spine of the pages. Pull it tight and run a ruler along it to smooth out any bubbles. Place the book between sheets of wax paper and underneath a heavy book or two. Wait for the glue to dry, about 20 minutes or so."

      "title": "Glue the cardboard pieces to the first and last pages.",
      "content": "Glue the cardboard pieces to the first and last pages. Before you do this, check that the fabric glue from the spine is dry. Make sure the pieces of cardboard are aligned with each other and with the spine when you glue them. Use craft glue or a glue stick to bind the cardboard to the paper."

    {
      "title": "Cut a wider piece of fabric and glue it to the spine and cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut a wider piece of fabric and glue it to the spine and cardboard. Cut the strip of fabric so it’s as long as the cardboard pieces and 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) wider than the first piece of fabric along the spine. Using fabric glue, adhere the new strip along the spine and against the cardboard pieces. Press it into the first piece of fabric. Again, place the book between pieces of wax paper and underneath the heavy books. Wait to dry, around 20 minutes. If you opt to use leather instead of fabric to bind your DIY book, leathercrafting expert Mike Stramiello suggests using a thin, pliable leather like kidskin."

      "content": "Cut out a piece of decorative paper. This will decorate the front and back covers of the book. Pick your favorite large sheet of patterned construction paper or scrapbook paper . Cut it so it’s 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider than both the covers and the spine combined (when the book is open and flat), and two inches longer than the cover’s length (top to bottom)."

      "title": "Crease and slit the paper, gluing it to the inside covers.",
      "content": "Crease and slit the paper, gluing it to the inside covers. Make creases in the decorative paper 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top and 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. Use scissors to cut four small slits in the center of the paper where it will cover the spine (cut up to the creases you made, and no further). Finally, place the book inside the paper and run a glue stick along the creased border. Fold and press it to attach it to the book’s inside covers. Cut the slits in the paper so the spine is covered, but so there is no paper directly above or below it. Create four flaps by doing this—two above the book and two below with notches in the middle once you cut the excess."

      "title": "Cut and glue two decorative sheets of paper to the inside covers.",
      "content": "Cut and glue two decorative sheets of paper to the inside covers. With scissors, cut the sheets to be 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) narrower than the cover and 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) shorter. Use a glue stick to glue each one to the inside cover so it covers the white paper and is flush with the folded-in cover page’s margins. After all of it is dry, decorate it however you want! Draw or paste on a cover and write, draw, or glue pictures or stickers to fill up the inner pages."

Draw two vertical lines on one of the cardboard pieces. Draw the first line from top to bottom 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the left edge. Draw the second line just under 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) from the left edge, parallel to the first one. Repeat on the other piece of cardboard.

      "content": "Cut decorative paper to make your outside covers. Choose two pieces of patterned scrapbook paper for your book’s front and back covers. Use scissors to cut them to size—about 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) longer and 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) wider than the inside pages. Place one of the pieces of paper face-down and use a pencil to draw a 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) border all the way around the sheet. If your blank paper is 8 by 10 inches (20 by 25 cm), cut your decorative paper to 9 1 ⁄ 2 by 11 1 ⁄ 2 inches (24 by 29 cm) size."

      "title": "Glue the cardboard pieces to the sheets of decorative paper.",
      "content": "Glue the cardboard pieces to the sheets of decorative paper. Cover the entire paper with glue—use craft glue or a glue stick. Line up one big and one skinny cardboard piece along the border you traced on the paper in the previous step, leaving a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) gap between the cardboard to create a hinge. Repeat for the front cover. Apply the glue to the paper, not the cardboard. If you're using wrapping paper (or other thin paper), this prevents wrinkling and swelling and gives the paper time to get used to the moisture in the glue before application on the cardboard."

      "title": "Glue and fold the paper around the cardboard.",
      "content": "Glue and fold the paper around the cardboard. Apply glue stick glue to the corners of the decorative paper and fold them over as far as they'll go. They’ll look like little triangles resting on the corners of your cardboard. Next, run your glue stick along the top, bottom, and side margins and fold them into the cardboard, pressing to help the glue bond. Run a ruler along the folds to help eliminate any creases or air bubbles."

      "title": "Use bull clips to hold everything together.",
      "content": "Use bull clips to hold everything together. Stack your back cover, your pages, and your front cover on top of each other. Align every component so the book’s pages can’t be seen, only the covers. Use at least two clips, placing them about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the side that will be the spine of the book (near where the gap in the cardboard is)."

    {
      "title": "Punch two holes into the binding.",
      "content": "Punch two holes into the binding. Make the holes about 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) from either edge. If you don't have a hole punch (preferably a single hole punch), you can use a drill. Make your holes so they go from cover to cover, piercing all the pages in the same place. If you use a drill, place the covers inside out so that the rough edges are on the inside. Before you drill holes into your book, place it onto something you're comfortable drilling into, like a phone book."

      "content": "Thread a ribbon through the holes using the Japanese bookbinding method. Cut your ribbon so it’s six times longer than the book is tall. For example, if your book is 6 inches (15 cm) tall, cut a 36 inches (91 cm) ribbon to use. [6] X Research source Place the ribbon down through the top hole. Leave a length on the right for a bow. Bring the same end around and push it down through the same hole again. Thread the same end down through the bottom hole. Bring the same end around and thread it down through the bottom hole again. Wrap it underneath and down through the bottom hole once more. Pull the same end through the top hole to form a criss-cross pattern along the spine. Wrap it over the top of the book and tie it with the other end in a knot. Let the knot sit on top of the hole. Tie in a bow."
