      "title": "Find your motherboard's documentation.",
      "content": "Find your motherboard's documentation. The number one factor that determines what processor you can install is the socket type of your motherboard. AMD and Intel use different sockets, and both manufacturers use multiple socket types depending on the processor. Your motherboard's documentation will provide you the necessary socket information. You cannot install an Intel CPU in an AMD motherboard, or vice versa. Not all processors from the same manufacturer use the same socket. You cannot upgrade the processor on most modern laptops. Older laptops (Pre 2014-ish) may be upgradable though. To check this, see if your processor is soldered on the motherboard."

This is the easiest program to use to find your motherboard socket type. Download and install CPU-Z from www.cpuid.com . Run CPU-Z. Click the \"CPU\" tab and note what is displayed in the \"Package\" field."

      "content": "Take your old processor to a computer store if you can't identify it. If you still cannot identify the socket type, remove your old processor from the motherboard and take it to a computer specialty store. One of the technicians should be able to tell you what socket type it is, and may be able to make recommendations on what processors would be good replacements."

      "content": "Consider purchasing a new motherboard if you want to upgrade. If you're trying to upgrade an older computer with a newer processor, there's a pretty good chance that the sockets won't match. As time goes on, getting a new processor that fits an older motherboard becomes more and more difficult. Purchasing a new motherboard along with your new processor will make things a lot easier. Note: If you're upgrading your motherboard, you may also need to upgrade your RAM , as old RAM is often incompatible with new motherboards."

Some CPU coolers have a bracket on the back of the motherboard that must be removed first. After popping the cooler off of the motherboard, it will likely still be attached to the processor because of the thermal paste. Gently twist the heat sink back and forth until it comes free of the processor. If you're going to be reusing the CPU cooler on the new processor, wipe off the excess thermal paste from the bottom of the cooler with rubbing alcohol."

You may have to angle the processor a little bit to get it out from under the socket cover, but make sure you are clear of the pins before doing so. If you want to save your old CPU, make sure to store it in an antistatic bag. If you are storing an AMD CPU, try to press the CPU into antistatic foam as well to avoid damaging the pins."
