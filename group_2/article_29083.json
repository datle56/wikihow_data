      "title": "Text her song lyrics or movie quotes that sound like real messages.",
      "content": "Text her song lyrics or movie quotes that sound like real messages. Pick something that both of you have heard or seen. At first, she’ll probably be a bit confused. But when she realizes you’ve played a little prank, she’ll be surprised and hopefully amused! She may even join in, responding to your message with the next lyric or quote. Start a faux-dramatic convo with some well-known Adele lyrics, “Hello. It’s me. I was wondering if, after all these years, you’d like to meet.” If she’s a Napoleon Dynamite fan, you could quote the movie’s hero by responding with, “Whatever I feel like I wanna do, gosh!” when they ask what you’re doing on a given day. And, of course, Carly Rae Jepsen's lyrics make for a classic text prank. Start with, “Hey, I just met you. And this is crazy…” Wait for her to respond before you finish the super famous chorus!"

This strategy, referred to as a callback, will take a little attention to detail and strategic thinking because it’s like a joke happening in slow motion. You set it up, let some time pass, and then drop a punchline. [4] X Research source Suddenly bringing back an old topic can cause serious, side-splitting laughter. If your conversation has referenced a movie/TV show protagonist, say something like, “I bet [character’s name] wouldn’t have this problem.” This would work well after mentioning a small challenge in your day, like stepping in gum. If she mentions a musician she adores, you could reference the artist jokingly later on like this, “I’m pretty good at basketball. In fact, I’m sort of like the [musician’s name] of basketball.”"

[5] X Research source Remember that time the two of you absolutely lost it over something silly? You can use this special, outside information to be funny in your current conversation. Consider whether or not you and your texting partner have ongoing inside jokes that you could reference through text. If not, reflect on a moment when the two of you laughed your heads off together. This could be the start of an inside joke! Choose a detail of that experience and find a way to reference it in conversation. If she’s seen you take a comical trip down the stairs, for instance, try sending a photo of some steps in front of you. Include a message like, “Oh no, it’s my nemesis! The stairs!”"

But making her laugh is just the first step toward winning her heart. Here are a few ways you can keep the conversation going and really get to know her. Ask her questions about her opinions, hobbies, and interests. Try open-ended questions that need more than 1 or 2 words to answer, like, “I heard you’re a big reader. Can you tell me a little about the last really great book you read?” When she talks, make sure you give her your undivided attention. That means answer her right away and don’t get distracted by a TV show or video game while you’re texting. Give her a low-key compliment that focuses on her personality, skills, and character instead of looks. Compliments about something she does are often more meaningful than ones about her appearance. Playfully tease her to flirt in a fun, laid-back way. Just make sure she knows you’re just kidding. Text something like, “Wait. You don’t know who Baby Yoda is? Have you been locked in a basement for the last 5 years?😜🤣”"
