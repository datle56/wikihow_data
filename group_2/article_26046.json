      "title": "A “line-haul office” status means your package is being sorted for transport.",
      "content": "A “line-haul office” status means your package is being sorted for transport. Once an order has been processed, the seller delivers it to a warehouse for packing and shipping. The package is then delivered to a line-haul office, a transportation hub that sorts packages by location and delivers them to an air, land, or sea carrier that will ship it to your country. [1] X Research source This is a completely normal part of the shipping process, especially on AliExpress. [2] X Research source You can’t pick up your package from the line-haul office, but these places are designed to securely handle packages, so your item is generally safe there. If your package does get damaged, contact the item’s seller on AliExpress and request a partial or full refund by going to “My Orders > Order Detail > Return/Refund.” [3] X Research source Usually your package stops briefly at the line-haul office, but factors like weather, holidays, or customs inspections can extend this time."

      "content": "Wait until the estimated delivery time. AliExpress standard shipping can take between 15 to 45 business days, but actual delivery times vary by the seller and your chosen shipping location. [4] X Research source You can check the estimated delivery time by clicking “Track Order” on the order list page. The delivery time will be on the top left. [5] X Research source If you choose premium shipping, most items will be delivered between 7 to 15 days. [6] X Research source You don’t need to contact AliExpress or the shipping carrier when your package gets to the line-haul office. However, if it takes an unusually long time, you can reach out to the seller. Your package might go to multiple line-haul offices—this might be because of normal logistical reasons like package volume, available routes, or customs inspections."
