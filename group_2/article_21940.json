      "content": "Try this fun Harry Potter drinking card game someone shared on Reddit! [1] X Research source To begin the game, each person will be sorted into a house (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). This is done by drawing a card. The houses are chosen as follows: hearts for Gryffindor, spades for Slytherin, clubs for Hufflepuff, and diamonds for Ravenclaw. Then, each person will take turns drawing cards. Each card represents various activities that the players will act out: 2: The Dobby/House Elf Card All players from other houses must swap one item of clothing with someone from a different house for the remainder of the game. Any player who refuses must take three sips. Any player who receives an item of clothing must take two sips. 3: Veritaserum You become the High Inquisitor and require all players not in your house to take a sip. You then ask a \"never have I ever...\" question, and they must take another sip if they have done the action you mention. 4: Felix Felicis You can keep this card for as long as you wish. When you use it, you take a sip and can then nullify any card played against your house and redirect it to target another player in a different house. 5: Unbreakable Vow You form an Unbreakable Vow with someone in your house, meaning whenever they drink, you must drink, and vice versa. The handshake must be acted out before each drink, and anyone who breaks the vow faces unspeakable horror...three sips. 6: Chocolate Frog Card Similar to \"Think while you drink,\" but with Harry Potter-themed names, such as \"Cornelius Fudge, Fred Weasley, Winky the House Elf,\" etc. 7: Expelliarmus Wands (represented by pens or pencils) are placed in the center of the table. When this card is drawn, the last player to grab a wand and shout \"Expelliarmus!\" must take a sip. Note that wands flying out of hands can be dangerous. 8: Room of Requirement You and anyone in your house can leave the room to use the restroom or get refreshments. However, if your house ends up with none of these cards, you cannot leave the room at all. 9: Quidditch A soft ball (the \"Bludger\") is placed in the center of the table. When this card is drawn, you can choose to throw the Bludger at a player from another house. If they don't catch it, they must take a sip; if they do, you must take a sip. 10: Pensieve This card copies the effect of the last card that was drawn. Jack: Sorting Hat Card When this card is drawn, all players in the corresponding house must take a sip (e.g., all Hufflepuffs drink for the Jack of Clubs). Queen: Bellatrix Card You become Bellatrix Lestrange and gain the ability to cast three \"Crucio\" spells, each of which causes the target to take two sips. You can fashion a special \"Bellatrix wand\" to mark this. King: Harry Potter Beverages You must take a shot of a well-known Harry Potter drink, such as Butterbeer, Firewhiskey, Gillywater, or Pumpkin Juice. Ace: You become Voldemort and must be referred to as \"He Who Must Not Be Named\" or \"You-Know-Who.\" If anyone calls you by your name, they must take a sip. Joker: Goblet of Fire The Goblet of Fire contains a premade \"dirty pint\" involving spicier drinks. Whoever draws this card must down the entire dirty pint."
