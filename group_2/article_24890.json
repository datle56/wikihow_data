      "content": "Choose a king-sized bed frame that's raised on the sides. Make sure there's a lip on the edge of the bed frame that will hold the mattresses in place. This will help prevent the twin mattresses from sliding away from each other while you sleep. [1] X Research source If you use two twin-sized bed frames, they'll shift apart from each other while you're sleeping unless you secure them to each other. Switching to a king-sized bed frame is a better long-term option."

      "content": "Place the mattresses onto the bed frame. First, put your two twin-sized box springs onto the bed frame, then top that with the mattresses. They should fit the width of the bed neatly—twin mattresses are 36 in (91 cm) wide, so side-by-side, they're the same width a king: 72 in (180 cm). [2] X Research source If you're using XL twin mattresses, your new bed will be the exact same length as a king-sized bed—80 in (200 cm). However, if you're using standard mattresses, they'll be about 5 in (13 cm) shorter. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a foam wedge in the gap between the beds. One of the biggest issues with putting twin beds together is that there's often a slight gap between the mattresses. Luckily, you can buy specially-made foam wedges that are designed to convert twin beds into king-sized. Just press the wedge down into the gap, then smooth out the top. [4] X Research source You can buy these wedges online or at big-box home stores. The center of the bed might be slightly higher than the sides at first, but over time, it will become less noticeable as the foam forms to the shape of the gap."

      "title": "Use a pillow top mattress pad if you want to disguise the wedge.",
      "content": "Use a pillow top mattress pad if you want to disguise the wedge. You don't have to do anything else if you're happy with the way your bed is set up now! However, if you think the foam wedge might be too noticeable while you're sleeping, cover the mattresses with a fluffy pillow-top mattress pad or a memory foam topper before you put on your fitted sheet. [5] X Research source If you used two standard mattresses, place the mattress topper so it hangs evenly over the top and bottom of the bed. That will help disguise some of the difference in length, especially when you put your sheets on the bed! However, if you don't want to use a topper, just tuck the sheets a little further under the mattress. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Strap the mattresses together so they can't slide.",
      "content": "Strap the mattresses together so they can't slide. Wrap a long strap—like a flat ratchet strap—around the perimeter of the mattresses, then buckle it to secure the mattresses to each other. Then, place a foam wedge in the middle of the bed to disguise the gap between the mattresses. You can buy twin bed conversion kits at many home stores—they'll include both the straps and the foam wedge. If you don't have a foam wedge, place folded towels in the gap, then cover them with a folded quilt. However, keep in mind this may not be the most comfortable solution. This is a great option if you're using two twin beds in a guest room and you'd like the option of converting them into one larger bed when company comes."

      "content": "Secure the bed frames together for an easy solution. If you just need a temporary fix, like if you're staying in a hotel or you just want to try out a larger size bed for a couple of nights, try tying the legs or sides of the bed frame together. You can use anything you have on hand, including a rope, belt, cord, or zip ties. [7] X Research source You could even clamp the frames together if you happen to have a couple of C-clamps available."

      "content": "Turn the mattresses sideways in a pinch. If you don't really have any way to secure the bed frames but you still don't want your mattresses sliding in your sleep, push the two beds together and take off the mattresses. Then, put the mattresses back into place, but place them horizontally instead of vertically, so one's running along the head of the bed and the other is at the foot. Since the bed frames will still be horizontal, the mattresses will be less likely to slide as you sleep. [8] X Research source You'll have a gap running horizontally along the bed, so this isn't necessarily the most comfortable option. However, it can work if you really don't want to sleep all night in a twin bed!"
