      "content": "Lean bulking is a plan to build muscle without gaining fat. Normally, athletes who are bulking accept that a certain amount of fat gain is necessary. But if you’re willing to take it a little slower, lean bulking can allow you to gain about 1 lb (0.45 kg) each week—and about half of that will be muscle. To successfully build muscle, you need to eat more calories than you burn each day. But to avoid putting on too much fat, those calories need to come from healthy, whole foods like lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and complex carbs. Strength training is also an important part of lean bulking."

      "title": "Gain muscle without adding much fat.",
      "content": "Gain muscle without adding much fat. When you lean bulk, you focus on a diet rich in protein and whole foods. So while you are eating more calories than you burn each day, they’re healthy calories that your body can easily convert into muscle. That means you’re less likely to add a lot of fat to your body. Lean bulking is especially helpful for skinny people who want to bulk up—you’re already starting at a lower body fat percentage, so with lean bulking, you won’t be hiding your muscle gains under a layer of fat."

      "title": "Improve your overall strength.",
      "content": "Improve your overall strength. Lean bulking involves weight training or resistance workouts up to 4 times a week. As you build muscle, you’re also gaining strength—so during the lean bulking process, you should start to notice that you’re able to lift heavier weights or do more reps and sets during a workout."

      "title": "Build healthy, long-term habits.",
      "content": "Build healthy, long-term habits. Because lean bulking requires you to carefully track your food intake, you’ll get a really good sense of how your meals impact your body. You’ll also start developing healthy food prep techniques and discover which healthy foods you love the most. This can create healthy food habits that you can maintain in the long-term, even after you’re finished bulking."

      "content": "Increase your calorie intake by 300–500 a day. Start by figuring out how many calories you need each day to maintain your current weight—use an online calorie calculator for any easy way to determine this. Aim to eat an extra 300–500 calories a day more than that maintenance number. [1] X Research source Focus on adding calories from nutritious, whole foods like fruits, veggies, and whole carbs. [2] X Research source Arana advises, “Unless you weigh and measure everything you eat, you may be underestimating the amount of calories you’re taking in, which can make a big difference in your progress. For example, eating one extra tablespoon of peanut butter adds almost 100 calories!”"

      "content": "Aim for lean proteins to be 40% of your daily intake. Protein is essential when you’re trying to build muscle, and when you’re lean bulking, it should make up about 40% of your total diet. Each day, aim to eat about .5 grams of protein for every 1 pound (0.45 kg) that you weigh. [3] X Research source So if you weigh 200 lb (91 kg), try to eat 100 grams of protein each day. Best proteins for lean bulking: Salmon, lean chicken, beef sirloin or tenderloin, bison, turkey, eggs, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, nuts and nut butters, quinoa, tofu, whey, and protein powders"

Carbs are also an important source of the energy you’ll need while you’re working out. Avoid processed carbs and stick to whole foods—they’ll sustain you longer and provide more nutrition instead of empty carbs.

They also give you energy and help build muscle. But the types of fats that you eat are important when you’re lean bulking—avoid highly processed, fatty foods and refined oils that add tons of calories without much nutritional benefit.

And some fruits and veggies can help you reach your lean bulking macro targets—like bananas, potatoes, or carrots if you need more carbs or avocados and olives if you need more fat. [6] X Research source Best produce for lean bulking: Leafy greens like spinach and kale, berries, bananas, apples, citrus fruits, bell peppers, beets, avocados, broccoli, legumes, beans, olives"

For instance, if you know you’re going out for pizza that night, you might opt to lower your calories for breakfast and lunch so you’re still in the target range for your calorie surplus. [7] X Research source In particular, try to avoid processed foods with added sugars or fats, like fried foods, pre-made salad dressings, and snacks like chips or sweets."

If you follow the 40-30-30 breakdown, that would be 960 calories from protein (about 240g), 720 calories from carbs (about 180g), and 720 calories from fats (about 80g). You might try breaking it down like this: Morning: 450 calories, 40g protein, 35g carbs, 25g fats Smoothie made from 1 ⁄ 2 cup (4.0 fl oz) of coconut milk, 1/2 of an avocado, 1/2 cup (70 g) of frozen berries, 1/2 of a banana, 1/2 cup (120 g) of plain Greek yogurt, and 1 tbsp (16 g) of almond butter Mid-morning: 475 calories, 35g protein, 50g carbs, 15g fats 1/2 cup (230 g) of cooked oatmeal (cooked with 1 ⁄ 2 US tbsp (7.4 ml) olive oil) 1 medium apple sliced and topped with 1 tbsp (16 g) of almond butter Lunch: 540 calories, 45g protein, 55g carbs, 20g fats 5 oz (140 g) of grilled salmon 1/2 cup (90 g) of cooked quinoa 1 cup (35 g) of mixed greens tossed with 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of balsamic vinaigrette 1 oz (28 g) of almonds Dinner: 500 calories, 40g protein, 45g carbs, 20g fats 5 oz (140 g) of lean beef 1 medium sweet potato 3/4 cup (120 g) steamed broccoli 1 oz (28 g) shredded low-fat cheese (to top sweet potato or broccoli) Before bed: 400 calories, 40g protein, 5g carbs, 15g fats 1 cup (240 g) plain Greek yogurt topped with 1 tbsp (16 g) natural almond butter and 1/4 cup (30 g) granola (choose one that’s low in added sugars)"

[10] X Research source Bodyweight exercises and workouts that use resistance bands can be good for building strength and getting a balanced workout. But to really build muscle, include weight training exercises in your workout plan. [11] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Include compound exercises that work your whole body, like weighted squats , pull-ups , bench presses , and barbell deadlifts . Whalen says, “When you’re working on major muscle groups with exercises like squats and deadlifts, you’re going to build more muscle overall.” You can also target specific areas with isolation moves like bicep curls and calf raises . For the best results, sign up for a gym membership or buy weights so you can work out at home."

When you’re doing cardio during a lean bulk, aim for an activity that will raise your heartrate to a steady, moderate level. Walking or jogging, cycling, and swimming can be good options—just don’t go too hard, and limit it to about 30–60 minutes a day. [12] X Research source If your cardio is too strenuous, you may burn too many calories. The resulting calorie deficit could prevent you from gaining muscle."

To perform a drop set, do as many reps as you can a weight training exercise—don’t stop until you feel fully fatigued, like you can’t do anymore of that move while maintaining good form. Then, choose a weight that’s about 25% lighter than what you were using, and do as many more reps as you can. [16] X Research source Completely exhausting your muscles in this way can help you build muscle even faster. For example, if you’re doing bicep curls with 20 lb (9.1 kg) dumbbells, you’d go to fatigue, then drop to 15 lb (6.8 kg) and keep going as long as possible."

If your body fat is 12–13% or higher, you should focus on getting in shape before you try to build muscle. Not only will you build muscle less effectively in this range, but you’ll also be more likely to gain fat instead. [19] X Research source If you’re around 10–12% body fat, you’re in the right shape for a bulk. Cerqua advises, “The biggest misconception is that exercise is going to fix everything. But if you’re out of shape, you have to get your diet and nutrition in order first.” To decrease your body fat percentage , decrease your calorie intake so you have a caloric deficit, meaning you burn more than you take in. Also, increase the intensity of your cardio."

About half of that will be muscle, for a total of about 2–4 lb (0.91–1.81 kg) of muscle a month.
