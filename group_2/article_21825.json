Just make sure that the space is well ventilated, as smells from cooking and humidity in general can get caught in fabric. Keep in mind that command strips don't always do well in humid areas, like a humid bathroom. [1] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. Avoid hanging your tapestry directly above a heater if possible since the heat could cause the adhesive in the command strips to melt.

Take the Command Strips out of their packaging and separate them. Press the hook-and-loop fastener faces of two strips together until they make a clicking sound. Prepare several pairs of strips in this way so they are ready to use. [3] X Research source"

Stick the strips securely along the top edge of the tapestry, starting with the corners. Depending on the size and weight of your tapestry, you may only need 2-4 Command Strips across the top edge of your tapestry. Once you hang the tapestry, you may decide that you want to use two more command strips on the bottom edge to hold the tapestry in place."

Measure both the tapestry and foam core and compare their sizes. You will be mounting your tapestry onto the foam core, so the goal is to leave at least an inch of tapestry overlapping around the edge of the board. For example, if your tapestry is 60\" by 45,\" your foam core should be cut to 58\" by 43\" to leave an inch of fabric to fold over the edge of the board and staple."

Make an initial cut using an Exacto Knife or box cutter, just deep enough to pierce the top paper of the foam core. Then, go over this light cut with a second, deeper cut that goes all the way through the board."
