      "content": "Strike a healthy balance between playing with your cat and giving it alone time. Even though cats really need your care, they have a strong need for independence and personal space. While cats enjoy being stroked, they are not always interested in interaction with people. One of the biggest mistakes pet owners make is to treat cats like dogs. Remember that they are very different animals! Dogs are pack animals originally bred to work alongside people. In contrast, cats are relatively solitary animals that historically served humans by killing vermin on their own.

      "content": "Avoid resorting to punishment. When cats are punished by yelling or other aggressive actions, they simply tend run away. For the most part, cats do not learn through discipline. Your cat will not love you if you're a mean owner. Never strike a cat as this will only make matters worse. While spraying a cat with water to punish bad behaviours is a common tactic, water-spraying may make your cat fear and distrust of you [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source"

      "content": "Discover your cat’s favourite treats. Like humans, there are some foods that cats prefer over all others. Find out what these foods are, and instead of discipline use treats to reinforce your cat’s positive behaviour. Tastes among cats vary, but small tuna flakes and cooked chicken pieces often prove irresistible. Ration these treats to make your cat love you.

      "title": "Learn and respect your cat’s body language.",
      "content": "Learn and respect your cat’s body language. Much like humans, cats use body language as a form of communication to express everything from trust to fear. Their postures convey important messages. For example: An arched back, upright hair along the spine, and unsheathed claws means that your cat feels threatened. Leave it alone for time being! [5] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. If your cat nudges you, it may want to play. If your cat curls its tail around you, it’s probably expressing contentment. When a cat approaches you with it tail pointing up and then curling round slightly at the top it is wanting to see you and be petted and play with you, let a cat check you out first by putting your hand out and letting them sniff it before you stole them. If its tail is tucked below or between its legs, your cat is likely feeling anxious or insecure. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Listen to your cat’s vocalizations. Purring is a sign of love and contentment. Growling and hissing means stay away. Meowing is an attention-getting vocalization that expresses everything from hunger to a desire for affection. Cats do not meow at each other; they meow to communicate with people. Constant meowing may indicate illness and require a trip to the veterinarian. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your cat out of danger. If your cat is safe and protected, it will love you more. Ensure your cat has a safe place to sleep, feels secure while toileting, has unobstructed access to food, and is not threatened by other human or animal members of the household. Ensure that your cat cannot access poisonous substances. Keep your pantry and cupboard doors closed, as cats are curious animals and they may get into trouble. Outfit your cat with a collar with a quick release buckle (in case he gets stuck) that includes contact information in case it runs away."

      "content": "Feed your cat according to a schedule. Cats are creatures of habit. Don't change their feeding times drastically or very often. When cats do something good try to reward them with a treat, but don't let this interfere with their main meal. To get your cat to love you more, avoid frequently changing the type or brand of food they eat. Cats can be perfectly healthy eating dry food, canned food, or a combination of both. [10] X Research source Most experts recommend feeding your cat no more than two meals a day. In industrialized countries, one in five cats is obese, which can cause serious health problems.

If you're away from home for an extended period, ensure that someone keeps an eye on your cat's well-being, cleans its litter, and provides some stimulation. A neglected cat will not love you. While cats are fairly independent creatures, they also need human attention and regular grooming. If going on vacation, consider a cattery or pet sitter."

Wash out the box with soap and water routinely. Don't suddenly change a cat's type or brand of litter. When switching to a new brand of litter, gradually introduce it by mixing the new and the old."

Grooming is a great chance to discover lumps, fleas, or injuries. Also use brushing as an opportunity to bond with your cat. Avoid brushing your cat against the grain of its fur; this may cause discomfort and stress. Remember to brush gently in long strokes rather than in short, rough strokes."

Your cat will playfully pounce on toys you move in front of them. Cats love owners that stimulate them through play. Encourage your cat to pounce on toys, not your hand!"

If there is more than one person in your house, try to be the person who feeds the cat. The cat will get used to this and come to you straight away if hungry or it's time for dinner. One of the best ways to get a cat to love you is through its stomach!"
