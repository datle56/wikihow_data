      "content": "Decide how and where you will use your body scrub. Where you will use your body scrub will determine what ingredients you will use. There are body scrubs for tough, calloused areas such as elbows and heels, and body scrubs for tender areas such as the lips. Use body scrubs containing abrasive exfoliates, such as sugar, on tough, calloused areas. If you use an abrasive scrub, then you may have to moisturize your skin afterwards with lotion or body butter. Use body scrubs containing moisturizing exfoliants, such as sugar, on the rest of the body. If you want to use your scrub on your face or lips, then avoid abrasive exfoliants. Use essential oils and colorants with caution to avoid irritation."

They are not very abrasive and can be used on the rest of the body. Ground coffee helps tighten the blood vessels and may help varicose veins go away for a little bit. It is also good for making the skin appear brighter. [1] X Research source Coffee grounds do not dissolve, which makes them an excellent exfoliant to sloth away dead skin cells. They also contain antioxidant agents that help improve elastin and collagen production. Oatmeal is gentle and moisturizing. It also helps your skin feel softer. Salt is harsher and more abrasive than other exfoliants, which makes it perfect for tough, calloused areas like elbows, knees, and heels. Sea salt is particularly good for detoxifying the skin and unblocking pores. [2] X Research source Sugar is the most common exfoliant found in body scrubs. It's gentler than some other exfoliants, such as salt, and good for reintroducing moisture into the skin. [3] X Research source You can use white sugar or brown sugar."

      "content": "Consider substituting your carrier oil. If you do not wish to use a carrier oil, you can use something else instead. You can also combine your carrier oil with another liquid ingredient. For example: Honey can be used instead of a carrier oil, or it can be combined with a carrier oil. It is a great cleanser and moisturizer. It can also be used in lip scrubs. Milk soothes and moisturizes the skin. It will also create a thinner body scrub. It can be added to the oil, or used in place of it. If you add milk to your scrub, use it within a few days. Yogurt is great for moisturizing and brightening the skin. Like honey, it can be substituted for the carrier oil, or it can be used in combination with the carrier oil. If you choose to use yogurt in your scrub, use it within a few days."

      "content": "Decide what additional benefits you want your scrub to have. Do you want your scrub to just exfoliate your skin, or do you want it to have additional properties?

Mica powders, purchased from soap-making shops, will make your body scrub shimmery. Soap colorants can add color to your scrub. They come either in liquid form, in dye blocks, or as powders. Food coloring can also add color to your scrub. Fruit can add some color and scent to your body scrub. Consider crushing some berries or squeeze juice from a citrus and adding that to your scrub. If you choose to do this, however, use your scrub within a few days. Avoid adding shimmer and color to your scrub if you intend to use it on your lips. Instead, consider adding chap stick or lip balm."

If you want your scrub to be smoother and gentler, then add more of your carrier oil. At this point, you can put your scrub into a jar, or you can continue adding other ingredients."

      "content": "Add the essential oil. If you choose to use essential oil in your scrub, you can add it now. Use anywhere between 5 to 10 drops. If you are using a small amount of exfoliant and carrier oil, then you may have to use less essential oil."

      "content": "Add everything else. If you are adding additional ingredients, such as honey, fruit juices, or colorants, do so now. For liquid dyes and food coloring, start with a few drops. Do not add too much, or else you risk coloring your skin. You want the color to the subtle and pale. For powder colorants and mica powders, start with a pinch or too. As with the liquid colorants, you do not want to add too much, or else you will risk staining your skin. For other ingredients, such as butters, herbal teas, honey, juices, and yogurt, start with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml), and continue adding more to your taste. If you are making a smaller batch, then start with a smaller amount, such as a teaspoon. If your scrub is starting to get too runny and lose its grainy texture, the exfoliant might just be settling. Give it a stir. If that does not help, you have added too many additives. Remedy this by adding in more of your exfoliant."

Body scrubs are perishable, and you do not want to sell your customer an expired product, or a product that will expire before he or she can enjoy it."
