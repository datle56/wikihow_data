There is one variable and one constant, written as F ( x ) o r y = a + b x {\\displaystyle F(x)ory=a+bx} in a linear function, with no exponents, radicals, etc. If you've got a simple equation like this, then graphing the function is easy.

So, to find it, you simply set x to zero, leaving the constant in the equation alone. For the earlier example, y = 2 x + 5 {\\displaystyle y=2x+5} , your y-intercept is 5, or the point (0,5). On your graph, mark this spot with a dot. [2] X Research source"

In your example, y = 2 x + 5 {\\displaystyle y=2x+5} , the slope is \"2.\" That is because 2 is right before the variable in the equation, the \"x.\" Slope is how steep a line is, or how high the line goes before going to the right or left. Bigger slopes mean steeper lines."

      "title": "Break the slope into a fraction.",
      "content": "Break the slope into a fraction. Slope is about steepness, and steepness is simply the difference between movement up and down and movement left and right. Slope is a fraction of rise over run. How much does the line \"rise\" (go up) before it \"runs\" (goes to the side)? For the example, the slope of \"2\" could be read as 2 u p 1 o v e r {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2{\\text{ }}up}{1{\\text{ }}over}}} . [3] X Research source If the slope is negative, that means the line goes down as you move to the right."

For example: F ( x ) = 2 x 2 − 18 {\\displaystyle F(x)=2x^{2}-18} Set F(x) equal to zero: 0 = 2 x 2 − 18 {\\displaystyle 0=2x^{2}-18} Solve: 0 = 2 x 2 − 18 {\\displaystyle 0=2x^{2}-18} 18 = 2 x 2 {\\displaystyle 18=2x^{2}} 9 = x 2 {\\displaystyle 9=x^{2}} x = 3 , − 3 {\\displaystyle x=3,-3} [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Find and mark any horizontal asymptotes, or places where it is impossible for the function to go, with a dotted line. This is usually points where the graph does not exist, like where you are dividing by zero. If your equation has a variable in a fraction, like y = 1 4 − x 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {1}{4-x^{2}}}} , start by setting the bottom of the fraction to zero. Any places where it equals zero can be dotted off (in this example, a dotted line at x=2 and x=-2), since you cannot ever divided by zero. Fractions, however, are not the only places you can find asymptotes. Usually, all you need is some common sense: Some squared functions, like F ( n ) = n 2 {\\displaystyle F(n)=n^{2}} can never be negative. Thus there is an asymptote at 0. Unless you're working with imaginary numbers, you cannot have − 1 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {-1}}} [12] X Research source For equations with complex exponents, you may have many asymptotes."

The more complicated the graph, the more points you'll need. In general, -1, 0, and 1 are the easiest points to get, though you'll want 2-3 more on either side of zero to get a good graph. [13] X Research source For the equation y = 5 x 2 + 6 {\\displaystyle y=5x^{2}+6} , you might plug in -1,0,1, -2, 2, -10, and 10. This gives you a nice range of numbers to compare. Be smart selecting numbers. In the example, you'll quickly realize that having a negative sign doesn't matter -- you can stop testing -10, for example, because it will be the same as 10."

For example -- you know that eventually, y = x 2 {\\displaystyle y=x^{2}} gets really, really big. Just one additional \"x\" (one million vs. one million and one) makes y much bigger. There are a few ways to test end behavior, including: Plug in 2-4 large values of x, half negative and half positive, and plot the points. What happens if you plugged in \"infinity\" for one variable? Does the function get infinitely bigger or smaller? If the degrees are the same in a fraction, like F ( x ) = x 3 − 2 x 3 + 4 {\\displaystyle F(x)={\\frac {x^{3}}{-2x^{3}+4}}} , simply divide the first two coefficients ( 1 − 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{-2}}} to get your ending asymptote (-.5).
