      "content": "Save your sticker as a PNG or GIF from an image editor. If you're saving a still image, just about every image editor and art program has the ability to save a PNG file. Most image editors can save GIF files as well, but you'll need a program that has a timeline feature (like Photoshop) or video editing software to save an animated GIF. You can also use an online photo editor like Photopea to save your image as a PNG or GIF."

Copy the WEBP image and send it in a Discord message. Click on the image, then click Open in Browser in the bottom-left corner. You can now save the image, which has been converted to a PNG, and upload it as a sticker . Discord doesn't appear to support WEBP images, so when you send one in a Discord message, Discord will automatically convert it to PNG."
