Therefore, if you see puffed-up hair on your cats’ tail, body, or both, then they are more likely to be fighting than playing with each other. [2] X Research source"

However, if you notice one cat biting the other in order to cause harm, then your cats are probably fighting instead of playing. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source For example, if one of the cats yelps out in pain and hisses or growls, then your cats may be engaged in a fight. Usually, when cats play, they alternate biting one another. If one cat is frequently biting another cat who is trying to get away, it is unlikely that they are playing."

Keep your cats in separate rooms and feed them at the same time on different sides of a closed door.

When they seem comfortable with this setup, let them see each other through a screen or gate and watch how they interact.

When a new cat is added to a home, fights in the home are likely to become more frequent. These issues usually come from a cat feeling insecure about their territory not being protected. [21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Other potential reasons include : A lack of early-life socialization when the cat was a kitten. Food and resource scarcity when cats are fed close together without enough food. Illness, especially when a cat suddenly attacks without previous issues. Protectiveness over kittens, most commonly in households with breeding females. Genetics passed down by problematic or especially irritable cat parents."

They especially like to engage in social play if they’re surrounded by fun obstacles, hiding holes, cat trees, and other activity-based toys. To a human, a cat’s play sessions can look like fights, and they can often turn into one if one cat becomes over-stimulated by a more energetic or excitable cat."
