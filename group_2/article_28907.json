      "content": "Assemble your supplies. To make a stegosaurus cake, you'll need two round cakes, frosting in two colors, and the decorations for the added touches. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need: Large mixing bowl, medium bowl, and a small bowl Sifter Hand or stand mixer Two round eight-inch cake pans, greased An oven preheated to 350ºF (177ºC) Two wire cooling racks Whisk Frosting knife Spatula Round two-inch cookie cutter Cake plate Piping bag with round tip"

      "title": "Combine the dry ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine the dry ingredients. Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. If you don’t have a sifter, whisk the dry ingredients together in the bowl to remove lumps, mix the ingredients together, and add air. [1] X Research source Adding air to the dry ingredients will ensure the cake is light and fluffy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the wet ingredients and eggs.",
      "content": "Add the wet ingredients and eggs. Pour the butter, milk, and vanilla right into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a hand mixer or the whisk attachment on a stand mixer to beat the batter on medium speed for about four minutes. Then add the eggs and beat on medium speed for another three minutes, until all the ingredients are fully incorporated into the batter. If necessary, stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients get mixed in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bake the cakes.",
      "content": "Bake the cakes. Divide the batter evenly between the two greased cake pans. Bake the cake for 30 to 35 minutes. You know the cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or the cakes spring back when you press them gently. Allow the cakes to cool in their pans on the wire racks for 10 minutes."

      "title": "Cool before decorating.",
      "content": "Cool before decorating. When the cakes have cooled in their pans for a few minutes, turn them out onto the wire cooling racks. Set them aside to cool completely, to room temperature, for about an hour or hour and a half."

    {
      "title": "Make the frosting.",
      "content": "Make the frosting. Place the butter into a medium bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Cream the butter on medium-high speed for one to two minutes with a hand mixer or a stand mixer’s paddle attachment. Beat in the sugar 1 cup (125 g) at a time, until all the sugar has been incorporated and the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla and 2 tablespoons (15 ml) of milk and beat for another minute. [2] X Research source If the frosting is too thick to spread properly, beat in another tablespoon of milk."

      "title": "Cut the cake.",
      "content": "Cut the cake. With your eyes, draw an imaginary line down the center of the cake. Then move the line over by an inch and cut the cake in half at that spot. This way, you'll end up with one half larger than the other. The larger half will be the body, and you'll use the smaller portion to create the head and tail."

      "title": "Punch out the leg shapes.",
      "content": "Punch out the leg shapes. With the larger cake portion, take the round cookie cutter and position it in the middle bottom of the cake, where you just cut the cake in two. Punch out an upside-down U-shaped piece from the cake to form the legs. The cake should now be shaped like a top-heavy upside-down U. Transfer the body to the cake plate and lay it down with the U-shaped cut-out (the legs) facing you. The scrap cake you punched out can be set aside or frozen for another cake or to make cake pops."

      "title": "Make the head.",
      "content": "Make the head. Take the smaller portion of cake and divide it down the middle to create two smaller wedges. Set one aside for the tail. Cut off an elongated S-shaped slice from the curved side of the wedge to create a head shape. At the right angle corner of the wedge, cut off the bottom inch of the corner at a 45-degree angle to create a neck shape. With a knife, carefully round off all the sharp edges and corners to create the head and neck shapes of the dinosaur. Set all the scraps aside for another recipe. Cover the uncut straight edge of the wedge with a layer of frosting. Position the head on the right side of the dinosaur body, half way between the bottom of the foot and the center of the back. You can leave the head as is and attach it to the body facing down, or you can flip the wedge over so the head is facing up. Gently press the frosted side of the wedge into the body of the dinosaur to secure it in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the tail.",
      "content": "Make the tail. Orient the second wedge so that the right angle corner is the bottom right of the wedge, facing you. To make the tail, you're going to cut off the bottom inch of the long flat edge and taper it to a point. From the corner of the wedge, measure up one inch (2.5 cm) and make a two-inch (5-cm) horizontal cut into the length of the cake. Then follow the outer curve of the wedge and cut to taper the inside edge the same way as the outside, bringing the tail to a point. Frost the straight end of the tail and lay it down on the left side of the cake, about 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) from the bottom of the foot. Attach it to the back of the body by gently pressing the frosted side into the body."

      "title": "Divide and color the frosting.",
      "content": "Divide and color the frosting. Remove about one-quarter of the frosting and set it aside in a small bowl. To create the yellow-green frosting for the body of the stegosaurus, add 10 drops of yellow and five drops of green food coloring to the large portion of frosting. Whisk in the color until it’s completely incorporated, and then add more food coloring as needed until you achieve the desired color for the body. For the green accents, add five drops of green food coloring to the smaller portion of frosting and whisk it to combine. Add another five drops if necessary to achieve the desired color."

      "content": "Apply the crumb coat. With the frosting knife, frost the entire dinosaur with a layer of yellow-green icing. This will trap any fallen crumbs and help make the final layer smooth and even. Place the cake in the fridge and let the frosting set for 20 to 30 minutes."

Use the bag to pipe two rows of pea-sized green dots across the top of the body, head, and neck of the dinosaur. [3] X Research source You can also pipe one line of green dots down the front of each leg."

      "title": "Add the plates.",
      "content": "Add the plates. To do this, you'll use the Oreo thin crisps to replicate the plates that stick out of the stegosaurus’ tail, back, and head. Spread the cookies out over the tail (close to where the tail and body meet), body, and head, concentrating the most cookies at the center of the back. Press the cookies into the cake at a 45-degree angle. Push them in halfway, so only the top half of the cookies are showing."

      "content": "Add the tail barbs before serving. Take the three chocolate-covered biscuit sticks and press them into the end of the tail so they stick out of the tail toward the sky like protective barbs. You can use either Pocky sticks or chocolate-covered pretzel sticks for the barbs. [4] X Research source"
