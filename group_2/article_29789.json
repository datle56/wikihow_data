      "content": "Start your grill, campfire , or wood fireplace. You can make your s'mores over any sort of fire. Keep in mind, however, that the fuel you use may also influence the flavor of the marshmallow. If you are working outdoors, make sure to follow safety precautions by having water or fire extinguisher near by, and to avoid windy days. If you are making a campfire, be sure to use clean, dry wood, and to properly rein in the fire with a ring of stones. Do not use accelerators."

      "content": "Skewer the marshmallow and toast it . Carefully insert a clean skewer into the side of the marshmallow. Hold the marshmallow just over the flames and let it roast to your liking. Be sure to rotate the marshmallow so that it cooks evenly. If you are camping and wish to use a stick, be sure to shave the tip into a fine point; this will make it easier to skewer the marshmallow and get rid of any bark. If you are using a metal skewer, make sure that it has a heat-resistant handle so that you don't burn your hand. You can tell if the marshmallow is done if it is golden-brown in color. You can continue roasting it, set it on fire, or remove it from the fire at this point."

Broiling will take less time, but you will have to watch your marshmallow and chocolate so that they don't burn. If you choose to bake your marshmallow, preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).

Strawberries and bananas taste great when paired with chocolate, but you can also use other types of fruit too, such as raspberries. When making a fruity s'more, add the strawberry or banana slice on the graham cracker, before the chocolate. Consider using chocolate spread instead of hard chocolate.

You can also use chocolate with ground nuts in it as well. For a cool, wintery spin, use mint-filled chocolate instead of regular chocolate. Switch out the regular graham crackers for chocolate graham crackers. For a unique, salted-caramel flavor, use caramel-filed chocolate and add a strip of fried bacon.

For an extra creamy flavor, skip the chocolate and replace it with dulce de leche. Use cinnamon graham crackers instead of regular ones. For a unique twist, add a strip of red or black licorice on top of the chocolate just before you set the marshmallow down."

You can also heat the s'more packet over a grill. Set the temperature to 350°F (177°C)."
