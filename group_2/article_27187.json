      "content": "Combine sodium polyacrylate with water. Cut open a disposable diaper and remove the white granules; these are made from sodium polyacrylate. You can also buy it in powder or granulated form from the soil treatment section of a garden supply store. Powder makes fluffy \"snow,\" while the granules create slushy \"snow.\" Mix in water little by little until you obtain the desired consistency. This may look more realistic if you put it in the freezer. If it dries out, just add more water. If you want to keep it dry, reduce the amount of water and add salt."

Keep your thumb on the bristles, facing toward the surface. Rub the bristles gently to spray the paint onto the surface. Don't use a nice new brush, since rubbing the bristles will damage them."
