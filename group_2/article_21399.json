      "title": "Buy some fertile popcorn seeds.",
      "content": "Buy some fertile popcorn seeds. You can use plain popcorn from a bag, but you will want to do a fertility test first. Not all store-bought popcorn will be fertile because of the heating and sterilization processes popcorn goes through before being packaged and sold. You can also buy popcorn seeds from a seed company or from a farmer. [1] X Research source To test store-bought popcorn for fertility: sow 20 seeds, water, and wait. If the corn grows in about a week, you have fertile seeds. If 2 weeks pass, and you still don't see any sprouts emerging, you have infertile seeds. The seeds must be fertile in order to grow."

      "content": "Choose the right spot. Make sure that the spot will receive lots of sunlight and that the soil drains easily. You will need lots of room to grow corn. Don't plant within 100 feet (30.48 meters) of other types of corn, or you may get cross pollination. This could result in hybrids, and may affect the flavor. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant the kernels after the danger of frost has passed. Depending on where you live, this will be sometime between the first week in March and the middle of May. [4] X Research source The soil should be between 50 and 55°F (10 and 12.7°C). [5] X Research source Expect the seedlings to emerge in 3 to 12 days. [6] X Research source Space seeds 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.4 centimeters) apart. If you are planting in rows, space the rows 18 to 24 inches (45.72 to 60.96 centimeters) apart. [7] X Research source Plant the corn ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) deep in the spring. Plant the corn 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) deep in the summer. Put 2 seeds in each hole. Only 75% of seeds germinate. [8] X Research source"

You do not need to fertilize often. Only two or three times. Here is when you use fertilizer: [11] X Research source When the corn is about knee-height, or gets 8 to 10 leaves: use ½ pound (226.80 grams) of fertilizer per 100 square feet (9.29 square meters). When the ears form silk: use ¼ pound (113.4 grams) of fertilizer per 100 square feet (9.29 square meters) once the ears form silk. Add more fertilizer if: the leaves turn yellow or pale, especially after getting silk. [12] X Research source"

Here are some ways you can keep those feathered thieves away from your crop: [14] X Research source Place mulch around your corn. By the time the seedlings come up, the crows won't be as interested in them anymore. Put up a scarecrow. Place a tunnel of chicken wire over each row of seedlings. [15] X Research source"

Fortunately, there are a few ways you can protect your crop from those furry bandits: [16] X Research source Install an electric fence around your field Put some hot pepper on the silk. Install a flood light and train it on the corn. Use portable radios around the corn. Try the Native American trick of planting pumpkin around the corn. No one is quite sure as to why this works, although there are many theories."

There are two ways to handle earworms: [18] X Research source Before the silk turns brown, sprinkle the tip of each ear with a pesticide, such as: Bacillus thuringiensis (BT), pyrethrin, or rotenone. After the silk turns brown, put a drop of mineral oil on the tip of each ear."
