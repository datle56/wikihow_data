      "title": "Turn 2 socks inside out and lay them flat.",
      "content": "Turn 2 socks inside out and lay them flat. You can use any socks you like, but the best ones have heels and toes in contrasting colors. You can use matching socks or different ones for a funky monkey! Whatever you use, pick socks that are clean and don't have holes. Spread your inside-out socks flat on your work surface so the heels face up. [1] X Research source You'll use 1 sock for the body, legs, and head, and the other sock for the arms, tail, face, and ears. Going for the iconic sock monkey style? Buy Rockford Red Heel Socks, which have a distinctive red heel."

    {
      "title": "Cut the sock from the opening to 1 in (2.5 cm) from the colored heel.",
      "content": "Cut the sock from the opening to 1 in (2.5 cm) from the colored heel. This splits the sock into legs so make sure you're cutting through both layers of fabric. [2] X Research source You can eyeball this line or draw a guideline using a ruler and fabric marker if you'd like a perfectly straight line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sew straight along each inner leg and stop 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end.",
      "content": "Sew straight along each inner leg and stop 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end. You can use a sewing machine or needle and thread to stitch your monkey. Either way, sew along the bottom of the cuff to close the bottom of each leg before you sew up the inner leg. [3] X Research source Don't stitch completely around the inside of the monkey's legs or you won't be able to stuff it! You can use any type of stitch you like—running stitch, straight stitch, zigzag stitch, or your favorite."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the sock right side out and stuff it with polyfill.",
      "content": "Turn the sock right side out and stuff it with polyfill. Take a small handful of fluffy polyfill and push it through the gap between the monkey's legs. Keep adding polyfill until the entire sock monkey is stuffed and as firm as you like. [4] X Research source You can buy polyfill from fabric supply stores, craft stores, or get it online. Don't have polyfill? Don't worry! You could use cotton balls or small strips of fabric instead. Your sock monkey may be a little lumpy, but it will have character."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sew the gap between the legs closed so the stuffing doesn't fall out.",
      "content": "Sew the gap between the legs closed so the stuffing doesn't fall out. Grab your needle and thread again and pinch the fabric together at the gap. You can use any stitch you like to sew the opening between the monkey’s legs closed. You may want to go over the space a second time so it's super secure and stuffing won't come out. [5] X Research source If you're new to sewing, a simple whip stitch, where you go back and forth across the fabric, is completely fine. If you're a little more experienced, do a slip stitch, where you work the needle through the very edge of the fabric, to get an almost invisible seam."

    {
      "title": "Tie a rubber band around the top 1/3 of the body.",
      "content": "Tie a rubber band around the top 1/3 of the body. To shape the head, wrap your index finger and thumb around the top of the stuffed sock. Then, take a rubber band or elastic hairband and twist it around the sock so the top looks like a rounded head. Now, you can set this sock aside while you work on the arms and other parts of your monkey. [6] X Research source For a really cute monkey, tie a ribbon around the neck. You'll probably want to do this over the elastic so it's extra secure."

      "content": "Cut your second sock into the 6 pieces on the template. You can download and print the template at the top of this article or glance at it to cut your second sock into pieces. As you cut, go through both layers of fabric. Cut: [7] X Research source The heel of the sock to make the mouth 2 long strips for the arms A long strip for the tail 2 small curved shapes for the ears"

      "title": "Sew each arm piece in half lengthwise and along 1 end.",
      "content": "Sew each arm piece in half lengthwise and along 1 end. Use your sewing machine or needle and thread to sew across the cuff end and along the long side. Repeat this for the other arm. [8] X Research source Again, feel free to use any type of stitch for sewing the arms or any part of the monkey."

    {
      "title": "Fold the tail piece in half lengthwise and sew it up.",
      "content": "Fold the tail piece in half lengthwise and sew it up. You'll pretty much repeat what you did for the arms with the tail. Remember to leave 1 end open so you can stuff it later. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sew the curved sides of the ears.",
      "content": "Sew the curved sides of the ears. Since these are pretty small, you'll probably want to sew them by hand. Take an ear and fold it in half so the curved sides line up. Then, sew from 1 end of the curve to the other end. [10] X Research source You won't be stuffing the ears so you don't need to leave an opening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the pieces right side out and stuff them with polyfill.",
      "content": "Turn the pieces right side out and stuff them with polyfill. Take a small piece of polyfill and push it down into the sewn pieces. To make it a little easier, use the eraser-end of a pencil to push the polyfill down. Fill the arms and tail as much as you like. [11] X Research source There's no need to sew the stuffed pieces shut since you'll be stitching them to the monkey and that will close them."

    {
      "title": "Stitch the arms and tail to your monkey's body.",
      "content": "Stitch the arms and tail to your monkey's body. Hold or pin an arm onto the side of the body so it's near the upper third of the body. Use a needle and thread to sew the end of the arm to the body. Go around it twice so it's extra secure. [12] X Research source Keep your stitches tight and close together so the tail and arms stay in place."

    {
      "title": "Stuff the mouth piece with polyfill and sew it to the monkey’s face.",
      "content": "Stuff the mouth piece with polyfill and sew it to the monkey’s face. Take the rounded mouth piece and place stuffing into it. Turn it onto the bottom half of the head so the stuffing isn't visible and sew the edges of the mouth piece to the head. [13] X Research source Want to give your monkey a little more personality? Before you attach the mouth piece, make a thick line of stitches across the mouth so it looks like the line between lips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stitch the ears onto the sides of the monkey's head.",
      "content": "Stitch the ears onto the sides of the monkey's head. Press the straight side of each ear onto the monkey's temples. It might help to pin them in place so they don't move while you're sewing. Then, use a needle and thread to sew the straight sides onto the head. You may want to go back and forth a few times so they're really sturdy. [14] X Research source Check that the ears are aligned before you stitch them in place."

    {
      "title": "Attach 2 black buttons for eyes.",
      "content": "Attach 2 black buttons for eyes. Thread a needle with black embroidery floss or thread and press a black button on the head so it's above the mouth. Stitch from underneath the button through a hole and bring the needle down through the opposite hole—you'll probably want to pass the thread through the holes 4 or 5 times. Then, stitch through the 2 diagonal holes before you sew on the other button. [15] X Research source If you don't have black buttons, it's no big deal. Just use whatever buttons you have on hand. For a sillier look, stick large googly eyes onto the head instead of using buttons. You'll probably want to add fabric glue to the backs so they don't fall off."

      "content": "Add decorative touches like pom pom hats, hearts, or clothes. Now that you've got your adorable sock monkey, have fun customizing it! Use fabric glue to stick pom poms on your monkey's head or a heart on its chest. Want to play dress-up with your monkey? Dress your monkey in doll clothes like dresses, vests, or sweaters.
