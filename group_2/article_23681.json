      "title": "Look for the cause.",
      "content": "Look for the cause. There are many relatively minor reasons the dog might be eating less. These may clear up on their own, but you can still try to help them through it. If none of these issues fit your dog's situation, you may need to contact a vet or consider medical causes . Some dogs get motion sick when traveling. Others have trouble eating in new surroundings following a move. Some dogs dislike being fed in an uncomfortable situation. Try to keep the dog's bowl in the same place, at a comfortable height, and away from other pets that try to eat the dog's food. Dogs may react to the departure or arrival of another pet or a family member. The cause may even be something small, like changing furniture or having house work done. Some dogs don't eat because they want attention from their owner. If the dog ignores its food and looks to you for attention, ignore it. When you feed the dog, put down its food for 10 minutes, ignore it, and throw away whatever doesn't get eaten. The dog may simply happen to be picky about the type of food he eats."

      "content": "Cut back on treats and table scraps. Most dogs would much rather eat that piece of steak and mashed potatoes than dog food. He'll love you for giving it to him, but over time it can make him a finicky eater and a beggar at the table. Keep careful watch on your kids — they aren't always the best about cooperating with this rule."

      "title": "Exercise the dog.",
      "content": "Exercise the dog. Regular exercise will stimulate your dog's appetite and encourage him to eat more. To really boost the appetite-improving effects of exercise, take him for a walk before each meal. It won't take him long to associate the walk with mealtime, giving him a positive association for both activities. Although some types of dogs require more activity than others, ideally, your dog should be getting exercise every day or at least several times a week. If you aren't capable of participating in physical activity, there are plenty of other ways to have your dog exercised for you. Take him to a doggie day care center, hire a dog walker, or go to a dog park and let the other dogs tire him out."

      "title": "Feed at the same time every day.",
      "content": "Feed at the same time every day. Feed your pet twice a day at regular times, or as recommended by your vet. Some dogs prefer eating later in the day. If the dog is healthy and energetic, but gets distracted before finishing, set his food down and walk away. Come back in a half hour and pick his dish up, even if he hasn't eaten all of his food. It won't take him long to realize he needs to eat when he has the chance."

      "content": "Make the food tastier. To make the dog's food more palatable, you can stir in a few spoonfuls of canned dog food or pour a little warm water or broth over the top. [1] X Research source Alternatively, use dog gravy. You can buy this from pet stores. These are just granules that you mix with dry food and warm water that can make the food far more tasty for the dog."

      "title": "Change your dog’s feeding situation.",
      "content": "Change your dog’s feeding situation. If the dog still won't eat, try these variations. It may take a little time for your dog to adjust to the change, but they may help in the long run: Feed your dog away from other pets. Use a different bowl or place it at a more comfortable height. Feed directly on the floor instead of in a bowl. Some dogs get distracted by activity and have trouble focusing on their meal. Make sure your dog's food and water dishes are in a quiet spot where he can eat in peace."

      "title": "Switch foods.",
      "content": "Switch foods. Try a different brand, or switch from dry food to wet food. Make the change gradually over a week: mix 1/4 new to 3/4 old for a few days, then half and half for a few days and so on. This will be much easier on his digestion. If you have a puppy, try getting them used to both canned and dry food so they can experience different varieties of food textures.

If the dog is acting tired, lethargic, excessively thirsty, in pain, or if he has a distended belly, dull coat, or rumbling noises from his stomach, take him to a vet.

Look for common signs of torsion like looking at the stomach, groaning, pacing, and gagging without vomiting. Any unnecessary agitation on the dog's part may indicate torsion and should be checked with a vet immediately.

Pull the dog's lip up gently to check his teeth, if any are missing, or if they look very brown, stink, or have visible buildup, he is probably in too much pain to eat well.
