While you can book an appointment with a professional for a face massage, you can also do your own at home using your hands, a jade roller, or other face massaging tools on the market. [9] X Research source To do your own facial massage at home using just your fingers, first apply face moisturizer or oil to lubricate your skin. Starting at the bottom of your face, use gentle but firm pressure to massage up toward your cheeks with your finger tips. Work your way up your face, then use just your ring fingers to massage around your eyes. Start at your brows and go around your eyes and down to the outer corners. Finish by tapping the skin on your forehead in an upward motion. Make it a habit to massage your face every day for the best results!"

The best method for you depends on your skin type. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you have dry, sensitive, or acne-prone skin, use a mild-strength chemical exfoliator so you don’t irritate your skin. If you have oily skin, try mechanical exfoliation, or use a stronger chemical exfoliator. Exfoliate 2-3 times a week. If you have sensitive skin, cut that down to once a week. It’s tempting to exfoliate every day, but don’t do it—too much exfoliation can strip your skin of natural oils and cause inflammation that actually accelerates aging. [12] X Research source"
