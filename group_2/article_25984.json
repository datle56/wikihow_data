      "title": "Block the wind with your back.",
      "content": "Block the wind with your back. You'll have difficulty lighting your fire if the wind is blowing right in the direction of the fire. To make it easier to light, kneel or crouch so your back faces the wind and shields the fire from the wind. [1] X Research source Remember that strong wind can blow fire to nearby trees or branches so be prepared to extinguish the fire if it begins to spread. If you're lighting the fire in an indoor fireplace, you can skip this step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect the lighter or match flame.",
      "content": "Protect the lighter or match flame. Strike the match or flick the lighter to create a flame. Do this close to the tinder and your cup your other hand around the flame to ensure that the wind won't blow out the flame before you can bring it to the tinder. [2] X Research source If you'll be lighting a fire in damp conditions, consider using waterproof matches. If you're lighting a fire indoors, you probably won't need to worry about the flame going out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Touch the light to 3 or 4 spots around the tinder.",
      "content": "Touch the light to 3 or 4 spots around the tinder. Your fire is more likely to catch if you touch the match or lighter flame to several areas of tinder. The tinder should catch almost instantly so the kindling catches fire soon after. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow on the tinder to light the kindling.",
      "content": "Blow on the tinder to light the kindling. If it looks like the tinder flames aren't going to reach the kindling, blow very gently on the tinder so the flame goes in the direction of the kindling. Once the kindling catches, you can add more kindling so the flames grow. If you're still struggling to get the kindling to catch fire, you might not have enough tinder. Add more tinder and light it again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the fuelwood on the fire.",
      "content": "Place the fuelwood on the fire. Add pieces of wood that are about as thick as your wrist. They'll begin to catch fire from the kindling and you'll be able to enjoy the fire you just lit. [4] X Research source If you'd like to add large logs, wait until the thinner fuelwood catches. This way the fire will have enough oxygen to generate heat that will burn the large logs. Otherwise they will just suffocate the fire."

    {
      "title": "Purchase a ferrocerium rod.",
      "content": "Purchase a ferrocerium rod. You can buy a Ferro rod from most outdoor supply stores, welding stores, or online. Ferro rods are great to use if you are new to building and lighting fires. This is because you can use them even if they get wet. They also produce a much hotter spark than the spark from flint and steel, so your tinder will catch easier. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a strong item to strike against the rod.",
      "content": "Choose a strong item to strike against the rod. You can use almost any hard material as long as it's harder than the Ferro rod itself. For example, use a stone that's harder than the rod, such as flint, the back of a knife, steel, or glass. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that some Ferro rods will come with a striker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the Ferro rod next to the tinder.",
      "content": "Hold the Ferro rod next to the tinder. Position the rod so that one end of it is resting on a flat surface and the tinder is directly in front of the rod. The rod can be almost touching the tinder so the sparks will land on the tinder and start a fire. Hold the other end of the rod up using your other hand. [7] X Research source Hold the rod so it makes a 45-degree angle. Placing the end of the rod on a flat surface will prevent you from accidentally knocking the tinder away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub a sharp side of the striker against the Ferro rod.",
      "content": "Rub a sharp side of the striker against the Ferro rod. Hold the striker at a 90-degree angle against the Ferro rod. Then scrape it forcefully up and down against the rod. Do this quickly to produce sparks. [8] X Research source If you prefer, hold the striker steady and pull the Ferro rod up towards you so it rubs against the striker to create sparks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrape the striker until the tinder begins to smoke.",
      "content": "Scrape the striker until the tinder begins to smoke. Continue to rub the striker up and down against the Ferro rod until enough sparks land in the tinder to start a fire. You'll notice smoke before you see a small flame. Blow gently to help the kindling above the tinder catch. [9] X Research source You'll also see small sparks catching once the fire is going. These sparks are some of the metal shavings that you scraped off of the Ferro rod that are just now catching."

    {
      "title": "Hold a magnifying glass over the tinder.",
      "content": "Hold a magnifying glass over the tinder. To use this method, the sky needs to be cloudless and the sun must be shining. Hold a magnifying glass between the sun and the tinder. [10] X Research source It's easier to get the fire going if you use a glass magnifying glass. Although you can use a plastic magnifying glass, plastic can get scratched easily which will make it harder to focus the sunlight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the lens close to the tinder so the sun shines through it.",
      "content": "Bring the lens close to the tinder so the sun shines through it. You should see the sunlight shine through the magnifying lens to create a circle of light. Direct this so the circle shines on the tinder. Then move the lens close to the tinder until the circle is about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) in diameter. [11] X Research source Focusing the sunlight on a small circle will concentrate the sun's heat so the tinder lights easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus the circle of light on the tinder for 20 to 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Focus the circle of light on the tinder for 20 to 30 seconds. Keep the small circle of light positioned on your tinder and don't move it. This will channel the heat from the sun onto the tinder until it begins to smoke. [12] X Research source If your tinder isn't catching, consider placing a piece of charred cloth on top of your tinder. This will help the fire start."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow on the tinder to light the fire.",
      "content": "Blow on the tinder to light the fire. Once the tinder smokes, lean in towards the tinder and gently blow on it to encourage the kindling to catch. You may need to use the magnifying glass again to light the tinder in another place if you're having trouble getting the kindling to light."

      "title": "Make a circular divot in a piece of fireboard.",
      "content": "Make a circular divot in a piece of fireboard. Get out a piece of softwood that you're using as a fireboard. The fireboard should be around 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. To position a spindle into the fireboard, you need to make a small dip in the wood. Use a knife or sharp rock to carve a small circle that's the same diameter as the spindle you'll be using. [13] X Research source The divot only needs to be about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deep."

      "title": "Place the spindle into the divot of the fireboard.",
      "content": "Place the spindle into the divot of the fireboard. Step on 1 end of the fireboard to keep it in place and crouch down onto your other knee so you're leaning over the fireboard. Put 1 end of the stick that you're using as a spindle into the divot you carved and hold the other end with your hand. [14] X Research source The spindle is a piece of dried hardwood that's the width of your pinky or smaller."

    {
      "title": "Rub the spindle between your hands as you apply pressure.",
      "content": "Rub the spindle between your hands as you apply pressure. Position the end of the spindle between your palms. Then rub your hands so the spindle spins quickly. Use your entire hands to create friction instead of just rubbing the spindle between your palms. Apply force as you do this to make a small dark pilot hole. [15] X Research source Your hands will work down the spindle. When they're about halfway down the spindle, return your hands to the top of the spindle and start rubbing again. Protect your hands. Put your sleeves over your hands, or wear a pair of gloves, or use anything else that will keep your hands from getting cut or burned."

      "title": "Cut a triangular notch into the middle of the pilot hole.",
      "content": "Cut a triangular notch into the middle of the pilot hole. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut a clean triangular opening into the center of the hole you just made with the spindle. You'll need to cut completely through the 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) fireboard. [16] X Research source Making a clean notch will allow the powder to fall as you start your fire."

    {
      "title": "Put a scrap of wood under the fireboard and rub the spindle again.",
      "content": "Put a scrap of wood under the fireboard and rub the spindle again. Once you've made the notch, put a thin piece of wood under the board. This will catch the dust and coal. Then rub the spindle through your palms until the fireboard smokes on its own. [17] X Research source Remember to apply pressure to the spindle as you rub it. This method may take a lot of time, so be patient and don't give up too soon because it doesn't seem to be working."

      "title": "Transfer the coal and dust to tinder and blow it to make a fire.",
      "content": "Transfer the coal and dust to tinder and blow it to make a fire. The fireboard should continue to smoke once you set the spindle aside. Slowly remove the fireboard so any dust falls onto a scrap of wood. Then put the dust and the coal onto the tinder of the fire you built. Blow gently to light the tinder. [18] X Research source Have your kindling and fuelwood close by so you can build the fire easily."
