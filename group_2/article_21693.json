You want to be able to talk to them when an incident is fresh in your mind. Do not sit and stew for a few weeks, as you may forget necessary details. Your parents may be skeptical at first.

      "content": "Talk to other students. Sometimes, simply venting to others can help you cope with a frustrating situation.

      "title": "Ask your child for clarification.",
      "content": "Ask your child for clarification. Children often make generic comments. Things like, \"My teacher's mean to me!\" may not necessarily be a sign something is awry. However, if your child's been complaining consistently and seems stressed or worried in school, something may be wrong. When your child is complaining about a teacher, press him for details. If your child says something like \"My teacher was mean to me today,\" try to get him to unpack that statement. Press him for details. Say something like, \"What exactly did your teacher say? What was happening at the time?\" Children do exaggerate, especially when feeling miffed or wronged. \"Mean\" may simply mean the teacher scolded your child for doodling on his worksheet instead of completing his math problems. However, press for more clarification to be sure. Ask about the teacher's tone and her exact words. Even if your child was misbehaving, if his teacher raised her voice and used belittling language, this is a problem. For example, your child may say, \"She told me I was being a little brat and yelled at me to get back to work.\" While your child was misbehaving, his teacher is the adult in the situation. Her response was not appropriate."

      "title": "Investigate the problem.",
      "content": "Investigate the problem. If your child's version of what occurred seems inappropriate, you should investigate the situation further. Jot down exactly what your child said occurred so you have all the details. From there, do some investigation of your own. You do not want to get angry and confront the teacher until you have all the facts. Check your facts. Your child may be exaggerating. You may want to call another mother and ask her to get her child's account of what happened. Talk to other parents. Some teachers have a bad reputation. If other parents have had an issue with this teacher, chances are your child is not exaggerating the situation. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Schedule a discussion with the teacher. If you've determined there's an issue with the teacher, make an appointment to talk to her. Teachers are usually willing to talk to parents about issues in the classroom. Calmly give the school a call and request and appointment with your child's teacher."

      "title": "Stay calm.",
      "content": "Stay calm. Even if you're angry, go into the situation as someone wanting to resolve a problem. If you enter the meeting yelling and placing blame, you're only going to escalate the issue. Use calm, inclusive language that's free of blame. Start off the meeting by saying something like, \"My child seems to be having trouble in your classroom. I'm not sure I completely understand what's been happening, but I'm hoping we can work together to find a solution.\" Even if you are calm and respectful during the confrontation, the teacher may get defensive. Many people do not take well to criticism, especially if they're frustrated or overworked. Stay calm if your teacher gets defensive.

      "title": "Look for a solution.",
      "content": "Look for a solution. You do not want to transfer your student from a classroom. A transition mid-year can be stressful. Try your best to brainstorm with the teacher on how the two of you can effectively solve the problem. You may find the teacher simply does not know how to deal with your child. You could offer her some insight on how to help your child behave better in the classroom. Say something like, \"I know Isaac struggles to concentrate, but I think sometimes reminding him gently is more effective than scolding. It seems to work at home.\" Also the teacher could just simply be a little grouchy and blunt and your child may be taking this personally. If this is the case, you can say something to your child like, \"Mrs. Donahue simply has a different way of communicating than Mommy and Daddy do. It doesn't have anything to do with you. Just try to behave in her class.\" Ultimately, strive to leave the conversation with some ideas about how to move forward. Hopefully, your teacher will take your feedback as a learning experience and be better equipped to deal with your child."

      "content": "Make an appointment with the school's principal. If you've raised your concerns with your child's teacher and nothing has changed, it's time to go to a higher authority. Contact the school's principal and make an appointment. You should only take this step in extreme situations. Even if your child does not like his teacher, chances are he'll survive the experience. You can take this as a learning opportunity. You can teach your child that life is harsh and unfair sometimes, but you have to learn to cope. However, in certain situations it's important to report the problem. If you're teacher is yelling at students and using name-calling or derogatory language, this is a form of bullying.

      "content": "Stay calm during the discussion. As with your initial discussion with your child's teacher, it's vital to stay calm. You want the principal to understand what's happening is a problem. If you get angry or emotional, the principal may be less inclined to believe your side of the story. Try to be as positive about the situation as you can. Remember, teachers are humans, and they have emotions, too. [11] X Expert Source César de León, M.Ed. Educational Leadership Consultant Expert Interview. 11 November 2019. It may help to recruit other parents. If this teacher is a problem in general, having others to back you up can help. The principal will see it's not just a problem with your student. Be firm. For a variety of reasons, your principal may be hesitant to handle the situation. You need to make it clear that you'll continue to raise concerns until the problem is resolved. Explain, firmly, that you're worried about other students in addition to your own child."
