      "content": "Inspect the charging cable for loose connections and damage. Make sure the charging cable is securely connected to the power adapter, as well as to your MacBook Pro, and that the power adapter is connected to an outlet. Also, check the cables for damage—if you have a damaged or faulty cable, it won't give your MacBook Pro the charge it needs, no matter how long it's plugged in. [1] X Research source If the cable is damaged or not providing power even though it's securely connected, try swapping it out for another. If you're charging via MagSafe, the USB-C end of the MagSafe 3 cable must be connected to the power adapter, and the MagSafe 3 end (the wider connector) to the MagSafe port on the side of your MacBook Pro. Make sure you're using a MagSafe 3 adapter. MagSafe 2 and MagSafe adapters are not compatible with MagSafe 3, so you won't be able to use an older MagSafe adapter to charge or power on your MacBook Pro. [2] X Research source"

If the light on the MagSafe 3 connector (the part that's plugged into your MacBook) is flashing, here's what to do: Unplug the charging cable from the power adapter and your MacBook. Unplug the power adapter from the wall outlet. Wipe off all connectors and ports with a dry, soft, lint-free cloth. Restart your MacBook Pro, then reconnect the cable and adapter. If the light still flashes repeatedly, contact Apple for service. [3] X Research source"

Then, try plugging it into a different outlet. If no other outlet is available, try plugging a different device into the outlet to see if that device is able to get power."
