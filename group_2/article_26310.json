      "content": "Wash your face twice daily. Skincare is a key factor in looking good without makeup. Spend what time and money you would spend applying and purchasing makeup on skin care. First and foremost, find a good facial wash that's suited to your skin type and use it twice a day—once in the morning and once at night. [1] X Research source Although it may be tempting to wash your face more than twice a day, this is not advisable. Over-washing can make your skin dry and irritable, causing it to look worse rather than better. [2] X Research source Develop a skin regimen for your face. Whatever regimen you choose, stick to it, and always follow through. Repeat the regimen in the morning and at night."

      "title": "Wear moisturizer daily.",
      "content": "Wear moisturizer daily. Every time you wash your face, you should follow it up with an application of facial moisturizer. Pick a quality daily moisturizer (preferably one with SPF in it) and apply it every day after washing. Opt for a slightly richer moisturizer to wear at night. [3] X Research source Always choose a moisturizer that's suited to your skin type. If you have sensitive skin, go for something gentle and unscented. If you are prone to pimples, try something light and non-oily. Drier skin types should go for heavier moisturizers with soothing, nourishing ingredients like shea butter or aloe vera."

      "title": "Exfoliate once a week.",
      "content": "Exfoliate once a week. Exfoliation removes dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, leaving your face looking fresh and radiant. It can really help to give a healthy glow to your skin, which is a bonus when you're aiming to go makeup free. Find a skin wash with special exfoliating particles which you can use at least once a week, but as often as every 2 to 3 days, for best results. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can exfoliate using a clean washcloth soaked in warm water. Rub your face gently with the washcloth, in slow circular motions. This option is good for people with skin that is sensitive to the ingredients in any facial washes. Never scrub your face too hard with the exfoliator or use it too often. This will dry out your skin and leave it feeling irritated, which is the last thing you want."

      "title": "Use toner.",
      "content": "Use toner. Toner is a skin care product that has often been overlooked but can do wonders when it comes to improving the appearance of your skin. Toner restores your skin's natural pH balance, along with many other benefits depending on the type of toner. Look for toners that are alcohol-free. These are less drying on the skin and help to even out skin tone. [5] X Research source For instance, toners designed for oily or acne-prone skin can help to remove excess oil and tighten pores, while toners for dry skin can help to soothe irritation and lock in extra moisture. A toner appropriate for your skin type can be used everyday, after cleansing and before moisturizing."

      "content": "Always remove your makeup. Even though this article is a guide on how to look good without makeup, chances are you will still want to wear it from time to time. This is absolutely fine, but just make sure that when you do wear makeup, you remember to take it off completely before bed. Makeup that is left on overnight can clog the pores and lead to pimples. [6] X Research source Use a specific makeup removing product, like a foaming cleanser or cream to remove the makeup , rather than your regular face wash. Use a special eye makeup remover to clean off mascara, eyeshadow, and eyeliner."

      "content": "Take care of any pimples. Pimples can be one of the main reasons that people are afraid to go bare-faced in the first place, so if you can get rid of those, you will feel a lot more confident about going makeup free. Make sure to follow a rigorous skincare regimen to avoid pores from becoming blocked and remove any excess bacteria from the surface of the skin. Use products targeted at oily or acne-prone skin and look for moisturizers, sunblocks and makeup that are non-comedogenic (non-pore blocking). [7] X Research source Look for over-the-counter spot creams and gels which contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, both of which are extremely effective for clearing acne. If these measures do not seem to be working, consider seeing a dermatologist who can prescribe a stronger medicated cream or even a round of antibiotics or other oral medications."

      "title": "Wear sunscreen always.",
      "content": "Wear sunscreen always. You should wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cold, cloudy or snowy, as the UVA/UVB rays can still damage your skin. Sun damage will cause your skin to age prematurely, and in extreme cases can lead to skin cancer and other skin conditions. [8] X Research source Aim to use SPF 30 or higher and, if possible, find a sunscreen which doubles up as a moisturizer. This will make sunscreen application easy to remember."

      "content": "Stop touching your face. This is a habit many people are guilty of, which can seriously affect the quality of the skin. Picking at spots, rubbing your forehead, or simply resting your chin on your hand are all things which add oil and bacteria to the skin, causing it to break out and look greasy. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source The skin infection can be worse than the blemish itself in most cases. Rubbing at your face can also loosen the skin, causing premature wrinkles. Therefore, if you want to improve the appearance of your skin, make an effort to stop unnecessarily touching your face."

      "content": "Take care of your skin from the inside out. Be sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep per night, and to drink plenty of water . Sleep gives your skin a chance to repair and restore itself, leaving you looking fresh and without dark circles beneath your eyes, while drinking water hydrates the skin and purifies it from the inside out, flushing out toxins and fueling the skin's metabolism. [10] X Research source The exact amount of water you need varies by your individual needs. In general, men need 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids daily, while women need 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids daily. Note that about 20 percent of this daily intake will usually come from food; the other 80 percent comes from water and other drinks.

      "content": "Pluck or wax your eyebrows. Keep your eyebrows looking tidy by removing any stray hairs. Having perfectly shaped brows can do wonders for your face by framing your eyes, therefore making them the center of attention. Well-manicured eyebrows can be very striking and add definition to your features without the need for makeup. [12] X Research source If you're nervous about plucking and aren't sure which eyebrow shape would best suit your face, go to a beautician to have them plucked or waxed for the first time. Once that's done, you will be able to maintain your new shape at home with a pair of good, quality tweezers. Always pluck one hair at a time, and pluck from the bottom of the brow rather than the top."

However, unless you have extremely oily hair, it is probably unnecessary to wash your hair every single day—every 2 or 3 days is generally fine for most people. [13] X Research source This will certainly ensure that your hair doesn't get dried out, but never looks dirty either. Use a shampoo and conditioner suited to your hair type and remember to get a haircut every 3 to 4 months to keep hair in tip-top condition.

      "content": "Curl your eyelashes. Long, curling eyelashes can make you feel very feminine, but you don't need lashings of mascara to achieve this look. All you need to do is invest in an eyelash curler—a contraption that may look scary, but is actually painless and easy to use. The eyelash curler clamps around your eyelashes and is held in place for 10 to 20 seconds, leaving your lashes curled and your eyes looking wider. You can also make your eyelashes appear thicker and darker by applying a coat of petroleum jelly to your lashes, then combining them through with an eyelash brush."

While this is an option for occasional use, such as an important interview, do not use eye drops on a regular basis. Doing so can cause your eyes to become more dilated and bloodshot, and the preservatives found in these eye drops can be toxic when used frequently. [17] X Research source"
