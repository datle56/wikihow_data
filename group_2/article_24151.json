      "content": "Unscrew the clamp bolts on the bottom of the saddle. Locate the 1 or 2 hex bolts connected to the metal clamp directly underneath your saddle. Fit a hex wrench into the bolt and turn it counterclockwise by 2–3 rotations. If your saddle has a second bolt, unscrew it evenly with the first one so you don’t strip the threading. Loosen the bolts just enough so you can move the metal clamp around. [1] X Research source Typically, bike hex bolts are 5 mm, but it may vary depending on your model."

      "title": "Lift and turn the top clamp to remove the saddle.",
      "content": "Lift and turn the top clamp to remove the saddle. Look for the thin metal rails that run down from the saddle and go underneath the metal clamp on the seat post. Grab the top piece of the clamp and lift it up so it isn’t touching the saddle rails. Once you move the clamp out of the way, lift your old saddle straight up to remove it. [2] X Research source If you can’t turn the clamp and it has 2 bolts, you may need to unscrew one of the bolts completely."

      "content": "Clean the dirt and residue off the clamp with a damp paper towel. Wet a paper towel with clean water or isopropyl alcohol and use it to wipe the clamp down. [3] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Work the paper towel into the channels along the sides of the clamp so they’re completely clean. Make sure you wipe both the top and bottom pieces of the clamp. [4] X Research source If dirt or residue gets stuck in the clamp, your saddle may creak or squeak while you’re riding."

      "content": "Grease the bolts and new saddle rails with bike lube. [5] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Place a fingertip-sized amount of lube on the bolts’ threadings and spread it around with a paper towel. Turn the bolts in the clamp to distribute the lube more evenly. Then, coat the metal rails on the bottom of your new saddle with lube so it doesn’t creak while you’re riding. [6] X Research source You can buy bike lube online or from a local sporting goods store."

      "title": "Set the saddle rails in the bottom clamp’s channels.",
      "content": "Set the saddle rails in the bottom clamp’s channels. Point the front of the saddle toward your bike’s handlebars so it’s in line with your bike frame. Position the rails so they sit inside of the channels to ensure you can easily move your saddle around later on. Hold the seat in place so it doesn’t turn or move. [7] X Research source It doesn’t matter how far forward or backward you position the saddle right now since you’ll be able to adjust it later."

    {
      "title": "Reposition the top clamp so it fits over the rails.",
      "content": "Reposition the top clamp so it fits over the rails. Hold your new saddle in place with your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand to grab the top half of the clamp. Turn the clamp so it wraps around the saddle rails and presses down against the bottom half. Line up the bolt holes on the top with the ones on the bottom so you can screw the bolts back in. [8] X Research source Keep your hand on the saddle since it’s still loose and could fall off."

      "content": "Tighten the clamp bolts to hold the saddle in position. Hold the saddle with your non-dominant hand so it doesn’t shift around. Use your hex wrench to turn the clamp bolt clockwise. If the clamp has multiple bolts, tighten them evenly so they don’t get damaged. Screw the bolts in until your saddle doesn’t move around on its own but leave it loose enough where you can still wiggle it around. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Find the length of your inseam by measuring from the floor to your groin. Hold a level or ruler between your legs so it’s parallel to the floor. Pull the level up as far as you comfortably can. Ask a helper to measure from the floor to the top of the level to find your inseam measurement. Write down the number so you don’t forget it. [10] X Research source If you don’t have a helper, stand next to a wall and mark the top of the level with a pencil. Then, measure from the floor to the mark."

      "content": "Multiply your measurement by 0.887 to find your ideal saddle height. When you’re pedaling, you don’t want to fully extend your leg since it will make your body rock and get uncomfortable. Calculate the new height for your saddle and write down your adjusted measurement. [11] X Research source For example, if your measurement was 30 inches (76 cm), then your equation would be 30 x 0.887 = 26.61 inches (67.6 cm)."

      "content": "Measure the seat post from the top of the saddle to the bottom bracket’s axle. The bottom bracket is where the pedals connect to your bike frame. Put the end of your tape measure on the center of the axle and pull it up the seat post. Extend the tape measure until you reach the height measurement you just calculated. Keep your tape measure in place or ask a helper to hold it for you. [12] X Research source Don’t measure from the ground, or else you’ll set your saddle too low."

      "content": "Position the top of the saddle to your adjusted measurement. Grab the bottom of the saddle so you can easily raise or lower it. Move the saddle until the top lines up with the measurement. Turn the hex bolt clockwise to lock your saddle into place. [14] X Research source While this should put your saddle in a comfortable position, the saddle height depends on your personal preference and what feels best when you’re riding. You may need to make adjustments to the height again if you feel sore or uncomfortable."

      "title": "Tilt the saddle so it’s perfectly horizontal.",
      "content": "Tilt the saddle so it’s perfectly horizontal. Park your bike on level ground so you set the angle accurately. Place a level on the saddle so it’s in line with the frame below it. If the saddle isn’t level, loosen the bottom clamp bolts and grab the back side of the saddle. Raise or lower the back of your saddle until the level is horizontal. [15] X Research source If you set the angle too far forward, you’ll slide forward while you ride and put more pressure on your arms. If the saddle tilts back, your legs won’t be in a good position to pedal."

      "title": "Slide the saddle forward so the back of your knee lines up with the pedal axle.",
      "content": "Slide the saddle forward so the back of your knee lines up with the pedal axle. Sit on your bike and move the pedals around until they’re at the same height. Tie a small weight to a string and hold it against your leg behind your kneecap. Let the string hang straight down and look where it intersects the pedal. If it lines up with the small axle running through the middle pedal, then your seat is in the correct forward position. If not, push the saddle straight forward or back and check again. You may need to ask a helper to support you and your bike while you take your measurement. If you don’t have the saddle in the right forward position, it may be more difficult for you to pedal."
