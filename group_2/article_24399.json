If you're curious about how people see you , you can use TikTok's inverted filter. Keep in mind that you'll look a bit different since you're more familiar with your mirrored image. Different doesn't mean badâ€”you're just not used to seeing yourself this way. Mirrors are generally a lot more accurate than photos since it provides a 3D view, so don't feel discouraged by your inverted image."
