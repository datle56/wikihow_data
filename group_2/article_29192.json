[1] X Research source [2] X Research source You can find them at craft stores; they are usually sold in packs. You can also get a longer dowel and cut it down using a hacksaw. You can also use a stick that you found outside. Make sure that it is no thicker than your finger, close to the length you want it, and fairly straight."

      "title": "Sand down one end of the dowel so that it is rounded.",
      "content": "Sand down one end of the dowel so that it is rounded. This will make the tip. [3] X Research source You can even sand the wand so that it tapers slightly, just like the wands in the movies. Start with a coarse-grit sandpaper and finish off with a finer grit. If you are using a stick, you'll want to sand down any sharp, pointy, or jagged ends. You can leave the bark and knobs on the stick, or you can cut/sand them off."

      "title": "Use hot glue to build up the handle part, if desired.",
      "content": "Use hot glue to build up the handle part, if desired. The handle part is usually about the length of your finger. Use the hot glue to cover the entire handle of your wand. Let the glue harden, and add 2 to 3 more layers, if desired. [4] X Research source Not all wands have to have a handle. For example, Hermione's wand did not have a handle on it. Once the hot glue hardens, you can \"carve\" designs into it with the hot nozzle of the glue gun."

      "title": "Consider hot gluing a bead or button to the base of your wand.",
      "content": "Consider hot gluing a bead or button to the base of your wand. Some wands have a knob at the end of the handle. You can make one by hot gluing a fancy button or bead to the end. Pick something that is about the same width as the base of your wand; you don't want it to be too big. [5] X Research source Don't worry about the color; you'll be painting it later."

      "title": "Use a hot glue gun to draw designs on the rest of the wand, if desired.",
      "content": "Use a hot glue gun to draw designs on the rest of the wand, if desired. This is ideal for creating swirly designs on the wand, like Hermione Granger's. You can do this by twirling the wand between your fingers while drawing with the hot glue gun. Also, if you don't have hot glue you can use tape wrapped around it to make a handle or use clay to make a nice handle without a glue gun."

      "title": "Paint your dowel with a base color using acrylic paint and let it dry.",
      "content": "Paint your dowel with a base color using acrylic paint and let it dry. Most wands will be some shade of brown, but you can also make your wand black or white. To give it some extra texture, paint it several shades of the same color. For example, you can make your wand brown with light brown and dark brown streaks. Consider using watered-down acrylic paint so that the wood's original texture shows through."

      "content": "Add some weathering. Take a darker shade of your base color, and use it to fill in any nooks and crannies on your wand. Then, take a lighter shade of your base color, and use it to highlight any raised areas on your wand. Use a small, pointed brush to do this."

Then, flip the wand over and spray the other side. Let the sealer dry and repeat if needed. Sealing the wand is not absolutely necessary, but it will make the paint job last longer! You can use a glossy, satin, or matte finish."

      "content": "Get a chopstick. If you are making this for a child, a regular chopstick will work just fine. If you are making this for a teen or an adult, consider getting one of those 15-inch (38.1 centimeters) bamboo cooking chopsticks. Don't worry about the color; you will be painting it later on! Can't find a chopstick? You can try using a long, wooden paintbrush instead. Just snap the brush part off, just below the metal crimp. You can also saw it off using a hacksaw."

      "content": "Use hot glue to build up the handle and wand. The handle should be about the length of your finger. Cover the handle area with hot glue let it harden. Add 2 to 3 more layers, if needed. To create a wand like Harry's, draw vertical lines to make the handle. Make them thicker at the base of the wand and thinner towards the other end of the handle. Some wands are plain but others, such as Hermione Granger's, have designs on the rest of the wand. You can use the hot glue to draw vines, squiggles, or spirals. You can create a neat design just by twirling your wand in your fingers while drawing a line. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a bead or button to the bottom of the wand. Some wands have a fancier handle base. If you'd like yours to have one too, you can hot glue a small bead or fancy button to the base of your wand. The bead or button should be the same width as your wand; it should not extend past the edges by much. Think about the bead or button's design and don't worry about the color. You will be painting this. You can always leave the bead or button unpainted, especially if it is a pretty crystal one!"

This way, the original texture still shows through."
