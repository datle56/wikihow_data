      "content": "Choose a baggy t-shirt to modify. Bright, neon colors were very popular in the 80s, but you can use a neutral color as well, such as black, white, or grey. You will be cutting this shirt up, so make sure it's one you don't mind permanently altering. A blank shirt would work best, but you can use a decorated one too."

      "title": "Cut the neckline wider with sharp fabric scissors.",
      "content": "Cut the neckline wider with sharp fabric scissors. Begin by making a snip 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from each shoulder seam. Connect the snips with a curved line, just below the collar. This will give you an off-the-shoulder look. [1] X Research source You can cut through both layers of fabric at the same time for something quick and easy. For a more professional finish, cut the front neckline lower than the back."

      "title": "Consider cutting the sleeves off.",
      "content": "Consider cutting the sleeves off. You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to turn your shirt from a t-shirt to a tank top. Cut the sleeves off following the seam on the shirt body, not the sleeve. You can make the arm holes bigger by cutting a littler further down past the armpit."

      "content": "Cut the bottom hem off of the shirt. You can cut as much of the hem off as you want. For a high-low look, cut the front hem higher than the bottom one. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut a fringe into the hem.",
      "content": "Cut a fringe into the hem. It needs to go about a quarter of the way up the shirt. The tassels need to be Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide. [3] X Research source Try to cut through both layers of fabric. This way, you can be sure that the fringes are even on both sides of the shirt. You'll also save some time. If you made a high-low hem, cut the fringes separately. Make sure that they are the same length (however many inches/centimeters long you choose) on both sides of the shirt."

      "title": "Consider adding beads onto the fringe.",
      "content": "Consider adding beads onto the fringe. Twist the tassel into a tube, then thread it through a plastic bead, such as a pony bead. You can add as many beads as you want; 1 to 3 would be ideal. Knot the tassel below the bead. [4] X Research source You can also use a large yarn needle to thread the beads onto the tassels. Alternate the colors and the number of beads on the tassels."

      "content": "Decorate the shirt further, if desired. You can leave the shirt as is, or you can decorate it further. If the shirt is blank, consider adding an iron-on transfer. You can also paint the shirt instead using fabric paint."

      "content": "Choose a blank, solid-colored t-shirt. Transfer paper prints are usually translucent, so the shirt's color will show through. For best results, use a white shirt. If you must have a colored shirt, be aware that the image may not be as bright. You can also use transfer paper meant for dark shirts, but it will have a white background. You will have to trim around the image, or the white will show up. [5] X Research source Baggy t-shirts were very popular in the 80s. If you want something more modern that is simply vintage inspired , you can use a fitted shirt instead. If you want something that looks vintage, consider using an old shirt. The more faded, the better."

      "content": "Choose a vintage image to print. Logos from 1980s cartoons work the best. Look for something that is larger than your hand, and has the title of the show as well as some of the characters. Make sure that you get the right generation, however; many of the original cartoons got reboots. For example, the new My Little Ponies look very different from the original ones. This will defeat the whole vintage look. Some of the most popular ones were: Thundercats, Mighty Mouse, and Rainbow Brite. [6] X Research source Care Bears, My Little Pony, and Popples were also popular. You can also use other popular films and shows, such as: Back to the Future, Dark Crystal, Ghostbusters, Labyrinth, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, etc. You can also use logos from bands and other things that were popular in the 80s, such as MTV or the Cabbage Patch dolls."

If your image has words on it, they will be backwards. If the image is too big, you can shrink it. If the image is too small, you can try to enlarge it, but be aware that you may loose some quality. If you are using dark transfer paper, you typically don't have to reverse the image. [7] X Research source"
