Look for products designed to treat dry, damaged hair or 3-in-1 formulas (with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash built in). [1] X Research source If you want to make a crystal or water-like slime, use a clear shampoo. Otherwise, select any color or scent you like."

Keep adding salt and stirring until the shampoo turns into a squishy, slimy texture.

If you store it at room temperature, it melts, and it turns solid if you put it in the freezer for too long. Throw away the slime when you’re done playing with it, and make a new batch whenever you’re looking for some fun."
