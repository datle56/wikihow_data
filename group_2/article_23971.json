Other fonts are free for personal use only, meaning you can't use them for commercial purposes (such as in your business's logo or for designs you're selling). If you plan to use a font for commercial purposes, you'll usually need a commercial license. Make sure you understand the font's rules before using it for commercial purposes—the creator of the font could sue you if you don't purchase a license!"

When you download a font, it will usually save to your computer in the ZIP format—this file contains the font itself, and sometimes a Readme or Info file. Depending on the site you're using, you may be able to select the font format you want to download. The different font formats are: [1] X Research source True Type (.TTF or .TTC) fonts are easy to install, as they contain fonts for both on-screen and printing in a single file. [2] X Research source This font type can be installed on both Windows and macOS. OpenType (.OTF) fonts, which can also be used on both Windows and macOS, are similar to True Type fonts in that they are easy to install and contain both on-screen and print fonts in a single file. However, the technology is more modern, so the fonts can contain alternate characters, small caps, and other extras. PostScript (.PFB and .PFM) fonts are much older and less prevalent these days, as they require two separate files to install. You likely won't find many of these fonts available on free font sites, but you can install them if you do. Just remember you'll need both the \".PFB\" and \".PFM\" files to install the font."
