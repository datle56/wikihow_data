Of course, it's important for you to get what you're looking for from a sexual relationship too, but you should start by setting a good example. The better you make them feel, the more they’re going to want to rise to the challenge. The key to good sex is to make sure that you're processing and acknowledging your partner's reactions to the experience. When you see your partner wince, stop . You might be hurting them. When you hear your partner moan, repeat the motion you just did because it probably feels really good. Most importantly, pay attention throughout sex to make sure that your partner is mutually interested in everything you are doing. Stop immediately if they say “no.” Remember that just because your partner doesn't say \"no\" doesn't mean that they are comfortable with the situation. Consent is an ongoing process. After all, your goal is to get a resounding “yes!” from the both of you."
