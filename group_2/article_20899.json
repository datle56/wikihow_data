      "title": "Prepare a clean, decluttered room.",
      "content": "Prepare a clean, decluttered room. You can give a sensual massage anywhere, really, but the room should be soothing. This means removing any extra junk from the room so it looks clean. You should also consider laying down a clean, cotton sheet wherever your partner will be laying down for their massage. [1] X Research source The sheet will feel good on your partner’s skin, and it will be easy to clean afterwards in case any body lotion or oil gets on it."

      "title": "Dim the lights.",
      "content": "Dim the lights. You can also completely turn off the lights to create a sensual atmosphere for your massage. Just make sure you have enough light to see what you’re doing! [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use aromatherapy.",
      "content": "Use aromatherapy. Get a few candles in your partner's favorite scent. You can also try an oil diffuser with calming or sensual scented oils. Try vanilla, cinnamon, rose, or lavender scents. If you're using candles, set up a few throughout the room to use as an alternative to overhead lighting."

      "title": "Play calming music.",
      "content": "Play calming music. If nature sounds are more calming to you, those work, too! The important thing is that whatever you’re playing is calming and quiet, which helps your partner relax. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Warm your hands.",
      "content": "Warm your hands. There’s no worse feeling than a freezing cold hand on your bare skin! Before you start the massage, rub your hands together for 10 to 15 seconds to warm them up. You can also blow on your hands or wrap them in a warm towel for a minute or so. Your partner will appreciate it, and it will help them relax, rather than jolting them out of the calming atmosphere you’ve created. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use lotion or body oil.",
      "content": "Use lotion or body oil. Lotion and body oil reduce the friction between your hands and your partner’s skin, which increases the sensation. There are tons of options for lotion and oil, including warming oil and scented or flavored options. Pick one you think your partner will enjoy and squeeze a few drops into your hands before you start the massage. [5] X Research source If you want to warm the oil or lotion before using it, hold the bottle in your hands for a minute or so to warm the contents. You can also get a lotion warmer from most beauty supply stores or online. Another option is placing the bottle of oil in warm water before starting the massage. [6] X Expert Source Marty Morales Certified Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Don't put the oil or lotion in the microwave - it can easily get too hot and burn. Choose an oil with a relaxing fragrance that your partner enjoys, like lavender oil. [7] X Expert Source Marty Morales Certified Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 December 2019."

      "content": "Ask your partner to lie down on their back. It will be easiest for you to massage their feet while they’re lying down. It will also be more comfortable for your partner. Make sure their head is on a thin pillow. This gives your partner's head support without changing the line of their spine. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Start with a gentle massage on the feet. Don’t use too much pressure at first. You’re just rubbing their feet enough to release some tension in the muscles. Rub in large circles, moving from the pads of their feet toward their heels. [9] X Research source"

Apply very little pressure here to start, though. It can be very sensitive and you don’t want to hurt your partner. As you add more pressure, make sure you ask if it still feels okay.

      "content": "Repeat the whole process for the second foot. Once you’ve given plenty of attention to one ankle - 5 to 10 minutes - move to the other. You might need to add more lotion or body oil to your hands before you start massaging the other foot. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to the calves.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the calves. Since your legs have tendons that attach to your feet, massaging them can be a great way to up the sensuality of a foot massage. Use all ten fingers and run them down your the sides of your partner’s legs toward their ankles. Apply more pressure each time you run your hands down. [14] X Research source A little compliment about how much you love your partner’s legs won’t hurt, either."

The soft skin between your partner’s toes have a ton of nerve endings.
