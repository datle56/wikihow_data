      "content": "There is no official age restriction for buying condoms. Yep, it’s really that simple! In the U.S., anyone, regardless of age, can technically buy condoms or get them for free from community centers or clinics. If you go to your local drugstore, the cashier or other employees shouldn’t ask you to see ID or question your purchase when buying condoms. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, it’s important to remember that there is a legal age to engage in sexual activities. This is known as the age of consent, and it varies by state. The age of consent is 16 years old in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Main, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. [2] X Research source The age of consent is 17 years old in Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, and Texas. The age of consent is 18 years old in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."

      "content": "Look for condoms at your local drugstore. The great thing about condoms (aside from the fact that they’ll protect you and your partner during sex) is that you can likely find them at just about any drugstore or convenience store. [3] X Research source You’ll likely find them in the “family planning” aisle alongside other items related to sexual intercourse, such as lubricant and pregnancy tests. It’s totally normal to feel a bit awkward or self-conscious when buying condoms. Just know that people buy condoms every day and no one will judge you for your purchase. If anything, be proud that you’re consciously making an effort to practice safe sex. If you want to buy condoms discreetly , go to a different drugstore that you don’t normally visit or ask someone else to buy them for you. You also have the option to buy your condoms online. This is also a good option if you want to buy condoms in bulk."

      "content": "Get free condoms from a nearby clinic or community center. Sometimes you don’t even have to hand over any money to get some condoms. Go to a nearby health clinic, HIV/STI prevention center, or Planned Parenthood health center to see if they have any free contraceptives. When you go to these locations, there will also often be professionals there who can give you advice about using contraceptives safely. [4] X Research source Even if you can’t get your condoms for free, buying them won’t break the bank. On average, condoms usually cost around $1 each, but they may be cheaper if you buy them in bulk."

      "content": "Figure out what size you’ll need before purchasing. To save yourself the hassle of trying to figure out what size you need while you’re standing in the store aisle, do a bit of planning before you head out. Condom sizes are determined by the circumference of an erect penis rather than length, so if you need to, take measurements to determine what size to buy. [5] X Research source If you’re between a few options, try them on and see which feels best. If the circumference is between 4.7 and 5.1 inches (11.93 to 12.95 cm), a “regular”-sized condom will likely fit best. If the circumference is less than 4.7 inches (11.93 cm), go for a condom that’s marked something like “slim fit,” “snug fit,” or “true fit.” [6] X Research source If the width is greater than 5.1 inches (12.95 cm), buy condoms that are marked something like “XL,” “Magnum,” or “King.” If you buy a condom that’s too small, you run the risk of it breaking during sex. On the other hand, a condom that’s too large might slip off."

      "content": "Explore different styles of condoms. Believe it or not, there’s a ton of different types of condoms out there. Some come with different textures, such as ribs or studs, and others have special lubricants on them that create different sensations during sex. There are also flavored condoms which some people choose to use if performing oral sex. Look into a couple condom brands and test out a few if you’re curious. [7] X Research source Pay attention to the material each condom is made of. Lots of brands use latex, however, there are also brands that use soft plastics such polyurethane, polyisoprene, and nitrile. If you or your partner are allergic to any of these materials, steer clear and find another alternative. [8] X Research source Some condoms may also be made of animal membranes, such as lambskin. However, be aware that these types of condoms will only help prevent pregnancy—they won’t protect you from HIV/STIs."

      "content": "Check the expiration date on condoms before buying. It’s important to remember that condoms do have expiration dates, and using one after it’s expired gives you and your partner less protection against STIs and unwanted pregnancies. When making your purchase, check the expiration date on the package or box and make sure you’re planning to have sex within that time frame. [9] X Research source Make sure that there aren’t any holes or leaks in the condom’s packaging when you buy it. Store condoms in cool, dry places and away from direct sunlight, such as in a dresser drawer or purse, to prevent them from deteriorating. Always have a couple of backup condoms prepared in case some are expired when you use them or if they break during sex."

These can help prevent unwanted pregnancies, and some are also effective in preventing the spread of STIs. Use a barrier method every time you have sex to prevent pregnancy and STIs.
