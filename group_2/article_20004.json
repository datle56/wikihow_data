That means that you can have 1 of each: primary, military, magic, and support that individually equal $50,000. [2] X Research source For example, drag and drop a Monkey from the primary towers (blue backgrounds), and click the upgrade button multiple times until it's valued at $50,000+. Next, drag and drop a Monkey from the military towers (green backgrounds), and click the upgrade button multiple times until it's valued at $50,000+. Next, drag and drop a Monkey from the magic towers (purple background), and click the upgrade button multiple times until it's valued at $50,000+. Which towers you use (primary, military, magic, and support) does not matter, as long as you use each category of monkey. The tier that you upgrade does not matter; as long as the value of that Monkey is at least $50,000. The best way to reach this is as follows: 5-0-0 Bomb Shooter, 5-0-0 Heli Pilot, 0-0-4 Super Monkey, and 0-0-5 Engineer Monkey."
