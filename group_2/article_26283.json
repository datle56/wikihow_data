      "content": "Maintain beautiful brows. Pluck your eyebrows a little bit. If you shape your eyebrows already, just pluck any stray hairs. If you don't shape your eyebrows, just pluck the hairs in the middle of both your eyebrows, to avoid having a uni-brow. If you don't pluck your eyebrows at all, just leave them; your boyfriend probably likes them the way that they are. Don't go crazy and over-pluck! Once you do that, there’s no going back — until they grow out again, that is. Besides, some girls look better with thicker brows. You can also line your brows with a brow pencil for an added dramatic effect."

      "content": "Wear flattering clothes. It doesn’t matter what you wear — what does matter is that you feel beautiful in your clothes, whether you’re wearing a little black dress or flannel and leggings. The more confident you are, the more beautiful you'll seem, as beauty and confidence go hand-in-hand. If you feel super-confident in all of your outfits, pick one that you know he likes the most. If you don’t dress up a lot and you and your boyfriend have a special occasion coming up, then wow him with a more dressy dress or a skirt and a cute top. [1] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 21 October 2021. If you're on the bigger side, don't freak out! Pick out an outfit that shows off your gorgeous curves ! Your boyfriend should like you for who you are, so embrace those curves! [2] X Research source If you’re looking to add some spice to your look, try wearing heels if you normally wear flats. They can make you feel taller and more confident. However, if you normally wear heels, try some flats for a change — you may feel happier and more comfortable!"

      "content": "Style your hair. Brush or comb your hair, and then style it the way you like it best. Try out some different styles to see which one you think makes you look the most beautiful. If he's complimented your hair in a certain style, try wearing it in that style again some time, since he obviously likes it. Braid , straighten , or curl your hair for a new look. You can put it up or leave it down, depending on how you feel. There’s no magical hairstyle that will appeal to your boyfriend the most; it’s all up to what makes you feel the most beautiful. Don’t try something elaborate just because you think your boyfriend will really like it. It’s more important that you like it and you should think about that before you consider what he thinks."

      "title": "Wear simple makeup",
      "content": "Wear simple makeup . If you're allowed to, put on some makeup that enhances your natural beauty and brings out your best features. Go for a very simple and natural-looking makeup look, especially if you don't wear makeup very often. If you don't want to wear makeup, that's fine too; beauty doesn't come only from makeup. [3] X Research source If you want to put makeup on, just a bit of eyeshadow will be perfect for your lids, whether it’s a darker color like brown or a smoky black, or a lighter color like beige or light pink. You can wear some mascara to accentuate your beauty, too. You may want to only stick to the top lid to avoid that spidery bottom-lid look. To apply mascara, place the brush below the bottoms of your lashes, and gently move it side to side and up to add volume to your lashes. If you just move it from top to bottom, your lashes may look cakey. You can decide whether you want to wear foundation or concealer or just to try the natural look. Foundation and concealer can make your skin look more uniform and can make your makeup stand out a bit more; that said, it makes for a more dramatic look that takes time to implement. Applying just a bit of blush to the apples of your cheeks can make your face look a bit rosier and more healthy. Just make sure you blend it thoroughly so it doesn’t look too cartoon-ish. If this is your first time with blush, try it for a nighttime or more formal occasion so it doesn’t stand out as much."

      "content": "Accessorize . Put in some special earrings, or wear a cute necklace or bracelet. If he bought you a piece of jewelry and you like it, wear that. If accessorizing isn't your thing, don't sweat it! You don’t want to look phony in a pair of earrings that really aren’t you. But if you do want to give your look that extra touch, then you can try some cute studs or small hoop earrings, a few bangles, a chunky ring, or just whatever jewelry works for you. You can wear just one small piece of jewelry that means a lot to you. It’s all about whether or not it makes you feel beautiful, not about how many pieces of jewelry you can wear at once."

      "content": "Shower regularly. Take a shower or bath and shampoo and condition your hair. While you're in there, shave your legs and armpits, if that’s something you normally do. Exfoliate your skin with a loofah to remove dead skin cells and keep your skin healthy, fresh, and gorgeous! Finally, wash your body with soap or a body wash to keep your skin smelling great. [4] X Research source You don’t have to wash your hair every day if it actually looks and feels better if you only wash it a few times a week. Every girl’s hair is different. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Get the hands of your dreams. If you have dry hands, exfoliate them with a sugar scrub or another exfoliating soap. You can buy one from a store, or make one yourself. [6] X Research source Simply run your hands under water, then wipe them off on a towel so that they are damp, and then put a generous amount of sugar scrub on them. Rub it around your hands, focusing on the areas that are the most dry. After you're done, rinse the scrub off, and you should have nice, soft hands. Your boyfriend will especially love your soft hands if you hold hands a lot."

      "content": "Get kissable lips . Your boyfriend will love it if you have soft, nourished lips, especially if he's thinking about kissing you. Exfoliate your lips, and apply lip balm to hold in the moisture. Carry lip balm with you and apply it every few hours to keep your lips nice and soft. [7] X Research source If you think you’re about to kiss your boyfriend, though, hold off on the lip balm. You want your lips to be nice and soft when you kiss him, but if you put on lip balm right before you kiss him, then your lips may be a little too wet for his taste."

      "content": "Moisturize your body. Lock on the moisture by moisturizing your whole body. Focus on really dry areas, such as your feet, hands, and elbows, but moisturize yourself everywhere. This works especially well after getting out of the shower. If you shave your legs, make sure to moisturize them so that they're not dry. Smooth, soft , silky skin is sexy skin, and your boyfriend will love it. [8] X Research source You can also carry lotion around with you to reapply it throughout the day if you need to."

      "content": "Take care of your pearly whites. Brush your teeth twice a day, floss them, and use a mouthwash to get extra-fresh breath. If you two are going to kiss, you'll want to taste minty, and not like what you ate for lunch. And when you smile, you'll want your teeth to look their best! [9] X Research source Chewing on gum or sucking on a mint is great before you kiss your boyfriend. Just don’t do it immediately before you kiss him, or you’ll be making your intentions a little bit too obvious."

      "title": "Know that your boyfriend always thinks you look beautiful.",
      "content": "Know that your boyfriend always thinks you look beautiful. If you really want to look beautiful to your boyfriend, then you have to know that he already thinks you’re beautiful. You don’t want to think that you’re inadequate and that you can dress yourself up with some fancy makeup and a new outfit in order to look great; you’re already beautiful and are just trying something different. You should always have self confidence to stay positive. It’s important to know that your boyfriend thinks you’re beautiful no matter what — if you have that attitude, he’ll be much more taken by your looks anyway. If your boyfriend puts down your looks or tells you that you should lose weight or wear more makeup to look more beautiful, then he’s not in the relationship for the right reasons and it’s time to cut him loose. Your boyfriend should make you feel even better about yourself than you already do — not worse."

      "title": "Be positive.",
      "content": "Be positive. Another way to look beautiful is to have a positive attitude about your life, how you look, and what you do in the world. Don’t complain too much and focus on talking about the things you’re looking forward to in life. Don’t nitpick every little thing your boyfriend or friends do and give them compliments instead. If you cultivate optimism in your life, then good things are more likely to happen to you. What’s more, you’ll be a more beautiful person because of the positive energy that you bring to the table. Watch yourself the next time you talk to your boyfriend. If you notice yourself making a negative comment, make two positive comments afterwards to cancel it out. You should compliment your boyfriend much more than you nag him. Positive feedback is more valuable than negative."

      "title": "Don’t put yourself down.",
      "content": "Don’t put yourself down. Part of the attitude of a beautiful person is knowing that you’re beautiful inside and out. While you can lightly poke fun at yourself to show that you don’t take yourself so seriously, you shouldn’t talk about how fat, ugly, or dumb you are, because that will only make your boyfriend feel sorry for you. Instead, focus on accentuating the things you love the most about yourself instead of being negative all the time. If you’re too negative, then you’ll look like you’re fishing for compliments while being insecure. It’s one thing to not take yourself too seriously and to poke fun at yourself every once in a while, and another to be so down on yourself that it makes people uncomfortable."

      "title": "Don’t compare yourself to other people.",
      "content": "Don’t compare yourself to other people. You’re beautiful, and that has nothing to do with how beautiful your neighbor, best friend, worst enemy, sister, or a celebrity may be. You can appreciate the beauty of other people without wishing that you were more like them or feeling like you don’t have enough to offer. Focus on looking and feeling as beautiful as you can and don’t worry about anyone else; besides, your boyfriend will be much happier if you don’t waste your time talking about other people and focus on yourself. [10] X Research source You can compliment other women or mention how pretty or interesting another woman is when she’s not around. This will show that you’re comfortable enough with yourself to not feel competitive with every female on the planet."

      "title": "Ooze confidence.",
      "content": "Ooze confidence . As mentioned before, confidence is very beautiful and very sexy. You can be drop-dead gorgeous, but without confidence, you're nothing. Work on your confidence, and wear things that make you feel gorgeous! Don't do anything that you're uncomfortable with, because this will bring your confidence down. [11] X Research source Walk in a confident way by keeping your head up. Look at him when you're talking to him. You don’t have to be 100% in love with yourself to be confident, but you do have to work on loving who you are, and on addressing the flaws you can fix if you make that your goal. As for the rest, it’s important to accept that there are some things you can’t change about yourself (like your height) and to learn to accept them as well."

      "content": "Smile! To top it all off, smile at your boyfriend as often as you can. If you have braces, don't feel self-conscious ! He's your boyfriend, so he obviously loves you for you (including your braces!). When you see him, smile at him. When you walk away from him, smile and wave. Smiling makes you look friendly, confident, and very beautiful. Besides, it’s been proving that smiling can actually make you feel happier, so you have nothing to lose by smiling.
