      "content": "Read a book. [1] X Research source If your parents saw fit to confiscate all your electronics, reading a book is usually your best option. Although you may find books less exciting than video games or TV at first, becoming immersed in a good book is incredibly enjoyable. Provided you choose the right book, the time can shoot past like nothing at all. Reading a book can also help you with getting better at reading and also can help you with school. Lying down on your bed and reading is a relaxing way to go about this. Sometimes it can take your mind off being grounded. If you aren't sure what to read, think about your interests. For example, if you're interested in fashion, you could pick up a book about the history of fashion. If you're a chess player, read a book on the best openings in a match. Young adult fiction usually comes in the form of a series. This can be handy if you have a lot of downtime to work with."

      "content": "Spend time with siblings. If you have any siblings, the company of family members besides your parents can be a great comfort. Depending on the sort of relationship you have with brothers or sisters, you can share a variety of activities together. In some cases, you might even be able to do things with them that you would otherwise be banned from, like video games and movies. In general however, it's recommended that you simply try to talk to them. Conversation can be very enjoyable on its own when it's with the right people. Board games are an enjoyable, electronics-free way to spend time. You will need other players to play, however. If you have siblings, you should try to enlist them in a game or two."

      "content": "Try on different outfits. You probably don't think of your wardrobe as a potential source of fun. All the same, the down time you have available to you can be used as an opportunity to see what sets of clothing match best with others. This is easiest if you already have a body mirror in your bedroom. If you're usually the sort of person who throws a random outfit together, this can be your chance to get some skill in fashion. Boy or girl, you can experiment with different hairstyles and makeup as well. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Binge-watch a good TV show.",
      "content": "Binge-watch a good TV show. Nothing quite makes the time fly past than a great TV show. Shows from AMC and HBO are often film-quality, and can keep you occupied for hours and hours. Watch a show via Netflix or your computer. Make sure that your parents are okay with you watching TV while you're grounded before you do this, though. Movies are always recommended as well, but because it's assumed you probably have a fair amount of time on your hands, you have a perfect opportunity to catch up on longer TV shows."

      "title": "Play a video game.",
      "content": "Play a video game. Video games are lots of fun. If you have a console in your house, there's a good chance you already go out of your way to play them. If it's just a matter of not being able to go see friends, video games are a great way to kill time. What's more, you can play a multiplayer game and interact with your friends as such."

      "title": "Text your friends.",
      "content": "Text your friends. [7] X Research source If you would normally be out spending time with your friends, it will probably feel weird to be separated from them for a time. Luckily, if your phone wasn't confiscated, you can keep in contact with them over the phone. Let your friends in on the situation, and get them to keep you up to date on what's going on with the outside world."

      "title": "Make plans with friends once your grounding is up.",
      "content": "Make plans with friends once your grounding is up. If you have your phone or a computer and wish you were out with friends, it can feel good to make plans for a day after you're ungrounded again. Suggest to go see a movie together, or meet up for food. Although it won't change your current setting much, the fact that you'll have a social event to look forward to once the punishment is over might make you feel better."

    {
      "title": "Apologize.",
      "content": "Apologize. [8] X Research source Even if you're not entirely sorry for what you did, apologizing to your parents for what you did will work out big in your favour. If your parents think you are truly regretful for whatever you did, they'll be that much more likely to ease restrictions and unground you."

      "title": "See things from their perspective.",
      "content": "See things from their perspective. When parents ground you, they're usually not doing it just as a way to get at you. Rather, they're using a punishment to teach you a lesson. If you try to understand why they've grounded you, your attitude towards them may change. Try to put yourself in your parents' shoes. Whether you think you deserved to be grounded or not, try to imagine how something looked from their perspective. Most parents do not go out of their way to be purposefully unfair. Trying to emphasize with your parents' side may help you better understand the situation. If you end up feeling like you deserved some form of punishment, the grounding won't feel as bad. On the other hand, if you empathize and still feel like things were misinterpreted, you can bring the issue up with them if you think they're open for discussion."

    {
      "title": "Negotiate a deal.",
      "content": "Negotiate a deal. Many parents will accept other forms of restitution as a way to replace or shorten the grounding. While you'll most definitely need to apologize first in order to begin a dialogue with them, you should come prepared with a few ideas on how you're going to make up for whatever it is you did. For example, you should suggest that a day of your grounding be removed in exchange for doing the dishes or sweeping the floors. These alternative punishments are usually a hit with parents because they'll get something real done for them. Some parents are very strict and won't be open to negotiating. This is something you'll have to deal with if you're in a strict family setting."

      "title": "Keep your emotions under control.",
      "content": "Keep your emotions under control. If you've been grounded for whatever reason, it is natural to feel angry. However, letting these feelings loose will only make things worse for you and your family situation. Even if you think you're being punished without cause, you should make a firm point of keeping your composure. A simple grounding can be made into something much worse if fighting keeps up. If you still continue to feel angry, it can be helpful to journal your feelings, scream in a pillow, or do some form of exercise."
