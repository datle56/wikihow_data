      "content": "Move past small talk to really understand someone. According to dating coach Lauren Sanders, “When you meet a new person, ask them about their life goals and values, their upbringing, their most recent committed relationship, their current career plans to further it, and their first impression of you.” This helps you move past pleasantries and learn what someone’s about.

      "content": "Break the ice with someone new by posing an interesting question. Licensed clinical psychologist Donna Novak strongly recommends asking questions to break the ice with someone new because people tend to really get engaged with questions.

      "title": "Use active listening skills.",
      "content": "Use active listening skills. “It's always very important to show curiosity and listen actively because a lot of people just want to be heard,” Dejonckheere says. Using active listening skills means keeping your attention focused on the other person. Then, show you’re listening by maintaining eye contact and leaning slightly toward them as they speak. “If you're truly present and curious in a conversation with anyone, then the next question that you ask will undoubtedly be meaningful,” suggests Stathopoulos. Above all, avoid interrupting the other person when they’re speaking. Not only is it rude, but it also shows you weren’t really paying attention to them."

      "title": "Ask open-ended questions to go deeper or get clarification.",
      "content": "Ask open-ended questions to go deeper or get clarification. Open-ended questions encourage the other person to give more than a 1-2 word answer. They commonly start with “What,” “Why,” “How,” or “Tell me about…” [4] X Research source Open-ended questions are also great when you’re asking follow-up questions because they let the other person know you’re interested in hearing more. Examples of open-ended questions are: “How did that make you feel?”, “What was that like?”, or “Why did you choose that?”"

      "content": "Avoid being judgmental about what they’re telling you. Whether you’re meeting someone new or getting to know them better, keep an open mind and make an effort to see things from their point of view. After all, everyone has different experiences, and this is your opportunity to learn why they believe something or act in a way that you don’t agree with. [5] X Research source Make a conscious effort to cut the other person some slack if they share something you’re inclined to be judgmental about. If they tell you about something they’ve done that you disapprove of, try to separate the action from the person. Remind yourself what it’s like when someone is judgmental toward you without knowing your side of the story."

      "content": "Be willing to be vulnerable. Being more vulnerable in a relationship means you’re willing to share your fears, regrets, and insecurities with the other person. If you’re willing to share your deeper emotions with someone, they’re much more likely to feel close to you. It also helps you feel closer to them.

If you suffer from social anxiety, meeting a new person can trigger symptoms like a shaky voice, butterflies in your stomach, or a racing heartbeat. There are a few different things you can try to help lower your stress levels when talking with someone new: [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Challenge negative thoughts like, “They’re not going to like me,” or “I’m going to embarrass myself.” Instead, say something to yourself like, “How do I know they won’t like me? They don’t even know me yet,” or “Even if I make a social misstep, are they really going to laugh at me?”"

      "title": "What should you avoid when asking questions?",
      "content": "What should you avoid when asking questions? Try to stick with asking one question at a time. Sometimes, when you’re eager to learn more about someone, you might throw multiple questions at them, which can get overwhelming. Instead, take your time and listen to their answers. Then, really engage with their response by restating it in your own words or asking a follow-up question. [8] X Research source Ask questions that not everyone would ask. They don’t have to be completely out of left field. A surprising question is automatically more interesting than a common question. When you ask a question, pause for a moment. Give them time to think about how they want to answer. A short pause after a question is normal and not something to worry about. Avoid asking yes-or-no questions that don’t encourage someone to open up."

      "title": "Why is it hard to ask someone questions to get to know them better?",
      "content": "Why is it hard to ask someone questions to get to know them better? Some people don’t ask questions because they’re worried about people judging them. Others may be afraid of offending the other person or seem like they’re overstepping boundaries. [9] X Research source The best way to handle this fear is to ask the question and be sensitive to the person’s answer. Pay attention to how the person reacts to your question. If they look thoughtful or engaged, you probably haven’t offended them. If they seem upset or refuse to answer, it gives you the opportunity to apologize and withdraw your question."
