      "title": "Add the macaroni and cook it for 7–8 minutes.",
      "content": "Add the macaroni and cook it for 7–8 minutes. Open the package with the dry macaroni in it. Carefully pour it into the boiling water, taking care not to splash. Stir the macaroni occasionally as it cooks with a wooden spoon. You will know that the macaroni is ready when it is tender but still slightly firm. Tip: Pick up a piece of macaroni using a fork after 7 minutes to check that it feels tender. If not, continue boiling the macaroni for an extra 30 seconds and then check it again. Avoid overcooking the macaroni as it will turn mushy. If you prefer a slightly firmer noodle, check if they’re done around 6 minutes."

      "title": "Drain the water from the macaroni.",
      "content": "Drain the water from the macaroni. Remove the saucepan from the heat once the macaroni is tender. Place a colander or drainer for the noodles in the sink and gently tip the contents of the saucepan into it. The water will drain away, leaving just the macaroni in the colander or drainer. Don’t rinse the macaroni with fresh water. The noodles are coated with starches that help the cheese sauce stick to them, so rinsing them might make your mac and cheese soupier.

      "content": "Place the macaroni, margarine or butter, milk, and cheese sauce mix into the saucepan. Transfer the macaroni from the colander back into the saucepan. Add ¼ cup (55 g) of margarine, 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of milk, and the cheese sauce mix into the saucepan. The cheese sauce mix is the second packet in the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese box. Tip: Some people prefer to add less butter to cut calories or alter the taste and texture. Feel free to adjust the amount depending on your preference! Less butter may make the cheese more likely to clump, though."

      "content": "Stir the ingredients to combine them. Use a wooden spoon to mix together the macaroni, margarine or butter, milk, and cheese sauce. Continue stirring until the cheese sauce, milk, and margarine or butter has dissolved into a smooth and creamy sauce. Stirring the ingredients in well prevents any lumps forming in the sauce. Tip: Keep the stove burner on low or medium to help the butter melt faster."

      "content": "Serve the macaroni and cheese immediately or store it in the refrigerator. Divide the macaroni and cheese into individual serving bowls and enjoy! If you don’t want to eat it straight away, let it cool before placing it into an airtight container. Store the airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days (it’ll be best to eat within 1 or 2 days, though).

      "content": "Replace some of the margarine with American cheese to make the dish creamier. Once you have cooked the macaroni and are adding the ingredients into the saucepan to make the cheese sauce, replace half of the margarine with 3 slices of American cheese. This means that you will add 1/8 cup (27.5 g) of margarine, 3 slices of American cheese, 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of milk, and the cheese sauce mix into the saucepan with the macaroni. The American cheese will melt as you stir it in. Alternatively, you can add all of the margarine or butter plus 3 slices of American cheese if you want the dish to be extra cheesy However, the dish may become more greasy."

Alternatively, try adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of curry powder to add a spicy hit to this favorite dish. [7] X Research source If you use salt, add just a pinch. A serving size already has 710mg of sodium, so it’s easy to make it too salty on accident. [8] X Research source"

It’ll technically be safe to eat for many months, but the taste and texture will be best if you eat it within 3 months. [10] X Research source To reheat, transfer the macaroni to the fridge to thaw (for a few hours or preferably overnight), then heat it up in the microwave or on the stove.

Then, add water up the “fill line” (look inside the cup for a line going all the way around). Microwave it uncovered for 3 and a half minutes. Once it’s out, add in the cheese sauce packet and stir until each noodle is coated and there are no more clumps. [11] X Research source If you see some white powder in the noodles when you open the cup, don’t panic! That’s starch and it’s supposed to be there. Some water may bubble out of the cup while it’s in the microwave. Just wipe it up with a paper towel or cloth once the microwave cools down."
