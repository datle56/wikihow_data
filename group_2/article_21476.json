      "content": "Start with a fresh shave for an even beard. Just as you need a clean canvas to start painting, you need a clean-shaven face to start growing facial hair. Start from scratch, shaving off any hairs you have to ensure your beard grows in evenly. You want hair growing in on the tip of your chin, above your lips, under your neck, and near your sideburns at the same speed. Otherwise, your beard will be patchy and hard to style. [1] X Research source Consider having a hot shave at a barber's shop. This is typically the closest and most even shave you can get, to start off. After your initial shave, wash your face regularly with a skin cleanser while your beard comes in. Not all people are able to grow full beards, and that’s okay! Styling what you have (be it a mustache, a goatee, mutton chops) will look way cooler than trying to force something patchy and uneven that isn’t really there."
