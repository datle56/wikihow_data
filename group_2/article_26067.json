      "content": "Choose a song you love. If you're in love with the material you're working with, that passion will shine through on stage. Choose a song that you're passionate about and that has personal meaning for you when lip syncing. Not only will you look happier performing if you love a song, you're less likely to slip up. If you really love a piece of music, you've probably listened to it over and over again. You're more likely to recall how to move your lips properly. Having a vested interest in what you're learning makes memorization easier. For example, even people who are bad with names can easily remember the names of people they find attractive. If you choose a song that interests you personally, you're more likely to retain information like lyrics and timing. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Memorize the lyrics. The first step to learning to lip sync is to memorize the lyrics you want to lip sync to. You can usually find lyrics online if you can't make out the precise words. Try singing along to the song a few times with the music playing before attempting to lip synch. Write out the lyrics over and over again. Actively pay attention to the words you're writing as you go. Memorization of material improves through writing. Write the lyrics 5 to 10 times, paying close attention to each word you're writing down on the page. [2] X Research source Remember, oftentimes when lip syncing you may find it looks more authentic to sing the words quietly as you go along. Having the words committed to memory can really help you lip syncing go over well."

      "title": "Use a mirror.",
      "content": "Use a mirror. Practice singing along to the song in front of a mirror. Watch how your lips move. See if they're in sync with the song. You may find that you need to slightly exaggerate the movements of your lips and mouth to make it look like you're singing. It can help to sing softly while the song is playing. Do not sing loud enough that your voice overpowers the recording. However, quietly singing the words can help your lip syncing look more accurate. In addition to remember the lyrics, timing is key. Try to keep track of musical interludes and how long they last. Try to count in your head to measure about when you'll need to start singing again. It might help to record yourself singing and then play it back. You can re-watch your performances and see where there's room for improvement."
