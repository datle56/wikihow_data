      "content": "Recognize hypoglycemia. Glucose gives the body energy. If your puppy is hypoglycemic, you'll first notice it moving more slowly and becoming restless. As the hypoglycemia worsens and your puppy’s brain is starved for glucose, your puppy will tremble, have a blank stare, and fall on its side. Other signs of hypoglycemia include: [2] X Research source Fatigue Weakness Wobbly walking Shivering Head tilt"

[3] X Research source Eating a little bit of food may be enough to raise your puppy’s blood glucose back to normal levels. [4] X Research source If your puppy does not want to eat, then you will need to feed it something sweet like honey, corn syrup, or sugar dissolved in water. If your young puppy is still nursing, you may need to bottle feed it."

      "title": "Administer the sugar source.",
      "content": "Administer the sugar source. Give your puppy the sugar source by either rubbing a small amount on the gums with your finger or placing a few drops under your puppy’s tongue. Placing the sugar source on the gums or under the tongue will help it be absorbed more quickly by the body. [6] X Research source One to two tablespoons of a sugar source is usually enough to revive a small dog with hypoglycemia. [7] X Research source If your young puppy is really tiny, ask your vet about how much you should give. You can also place a few drops of the sugar source on your puppy’s tongue. [8] X Research source If you’re going to give drops of the sugar source, use a medicine dropper. To prevent your puppy from choking, do not put the sugar source directly down its throat.

Nelson WR and Couto CG. Page 731. If your puppy does not respond, contact your vet immediately. Be aware that the sugar source is just a quick fix.

Your puppy will also need to see your vet if it responded to the sugar, but became hypoglycemic again. [14] X Research source"

Feeding your young puppy multiple times a day, at the same times each day, can help prevent hypoglycemia. [17] X Research source Puppies should eat 3-4 times a day, depending on their age. [18] X Research source Leave the food out for 10 to 20 minutes.

Give your puppy treats when it behaves well at the vet’s office. That way, it may not get so stressed when it’s there. Do not try to handle your puppy all the time. Give it some alone time so it can rest. Keep your puppy’s routine the same from day to day."
