      "content": "Apply ice immediately to the injured area. When you overextend your elbow, you'll know it because of the pain. When you injure your elbow, apply an ice pack wrapped in a cloth as soon as you can. Leave it on for 10-20 minutes at a time, as it can keep the swelling down. Never apply the ice directly to your skin. Make sure there’s a cloth between the ice and your elbow at all times.

      "content": "Wrap an elastic bandage around your elbow. Hold the end of the bandage against the inside of your elbow and wrap it tightly around the injury to provide compression. This will hinder movement in your elbow, allowing it to heal. Loosen the bandage if it becomes painful or makes you lose feeling in your arm. [4] X Research source This bandage wrap is typically tan in color and is sold in a roll. Look for it in the first aid section of convenience stores."

      "content": "Rest your elbow while it heals. Keep your elbow as still as possible while it’s injured. The bandage should help with this, immobilizing your elbow to help it heal and prevent re-injury. Keep it wrapped as much as possible, and avoid moving it as much as you can."

      "content": "Visit the doctor if you hear a \"pop.\" While not every sprain needs to be seen by a doctor, you should visit your doctor if you heard a popping sound when your elbow hyperextended. That could mean your ligament tore rather than just stretched. The doctor will take an x-ray to check for fractures and an MRI to check the tissue, including the ligaments. [5] X Research source"

If these aren't helping after a day or 2, talk to your doctor about a prescription. [6] X Research source For ibuprofen, you can take 400 milligrams every 4 to 6 hours or so. Do not exceed 3200 milligrams in a 24-hour period.
