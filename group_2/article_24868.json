      "title": "Soda water helps preserve fruit without altering the taste.",
      "content": "Soda water helps preserve fruit without altering the taste. Like fruit juice, soda water creates a protective barrier between the fruit’s flesh and the air, slowing oxidation. The bonus? It doesn’t change the taste of the bananas! This makes it an ideal hack for picky eaters. Simply sprinkle some of the soda over the bananas or soak them for a couple of minutes before serving. [2] X Research source Be sure to use soda water or club soda. Tonic water, a very similar beverage, has a strong flavor that doesn't pair well with bananas."

      "content": "Coconut, sunflower, and grapeseed oil prevent the enzymatic browning of the slices. Studies have also shown that this process helps preserve essential vitamins and flavor in the fruit, since oil coats the fruit and inhibits the oxidation (or \"browning\") process."

      "title": "The acidity in fruit juice forms a protective layer on sliced bananas.",
      "content": "The acidity in fruit juice forms a protective layer on sliced bananas. Although the type of juice you use will change the taste of your banana, it will also keep it from turning brown. Try using lemon, lime, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, or apple juices. Buy a 100% juice, fruit concentrate, or squeeze your own and then sprinkle it on top of the slices. [3] X Research source Lemon juice is the most commonly used juice for this hack and adds a subtle, complementary tang to your fruit. If you’re making a fruit salad, consider tossing all the cut fruits in the juice. Pick a juice that brightens the salad, like pineapple or grapefruit. Some users of this hack prefer diluting the juice with a 1 to 1 ratio of water, so it doesn’t have such a strong flavor; however, this can weaken the acidity and cause the bananas to brown."

      "title": "Fruit preservation powders",
      "content": "Fruit preservation powders use citric acid to keep sliced fruit from oxidizing. These powders are specifically designed to keep your sliced banana from turning brown. Basically, the powder is a dried-up version of the citric acid found in lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges. All you have to do is put your banana slices in a bowl of water and follow the instructions on the back of the packaging, adding the right amount of powder to water ratio. Let them soak for 3 to 5 minutes and drain. [4] X Research source These powders typically have no taste, but some argue that adding too much could alter the taste of the fruit."

      "title": "A honey and water mixture can help prevent sliced bananas from turning brown.",
      "content": "A honey and water mixture can help prevent sliced bananas from turning brown. The honey technique works similarly to the acidity in fruit; however, it leaves behind a much sweeter taste and stickier texture. Combine 2 tbsp (28 g) with 1 c (128 g) of water, then pour the mixture over the banana slices. [5] X Research source Try adding cinnamon or brown sugar to the mixture for an extra sweet snack."

      "title": "Diluted vinegar can slow the process of oxidation of sliced fruit.",
      "content": "Diluted vinegar can slow the process of oxidation of sliced fruit. Just like fruit juice, vinegar coats the fruit with an acidic barrier. Simply add 2 tsp (8.4 g) of vinegar to 1 c (250 g) of water and dip your slices in. Although this is similar to the fruit juice hack, it tastes like anything but. If the vinegar makes your bananas taste too sour, try rinsing them before eating. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is a natural food preserving agent.",
      "content": "Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is a natural food preserving agent. When mixed with water, it can help prevent your banana slices from browning as it blocks air from getting to the fruit. Buy the product in a powder or tablet form (double check that it’s food safe) and follow the instructions on the packet. Once the powder or tablet is dissolved in water, place the banana slices into the solution for 3 to 5 minutes, drain, and then serve. [7] X Research source The ascorbic acid may leave a slightly bitter, acidic flavor on your bananas, so consider this trick when using sliced bananas to decorate desserts. This way, the difference in taste won’t be as noticeable among the other ingredients."

      "title": "Place banana slices between wax paper or put them in an air-tight container.",
      "content": "Place banana slices between wax paper or put them in an air-tight container. The fruit flesh of a banana will start to oxidize the second you remove the peel. If you move quickly enough, you can get them into another means of storage before they turn an ugly, mushy brown. Toss the bananas into a container with a lid to place in the fridge, or lay the slices evenly in between 2 sheets of wax paper before putting in the fridge or freezer. [8] X Research source Try adding lemon juice or citric acid to the slices before storing them in a container or between wax paper, so they last even longer. With an added layer of lemon juice or citric acid, bananas can last 3 to 4 days stored this way."
