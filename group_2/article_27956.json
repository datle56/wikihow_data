      "content": "Bring a large pot of distilled water to a boil. Pour 2 c (470 mL) of water into a pot, then place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Allow the water to come to a rolling boil. [2] X Research source Distilled water is preferred, since it’s free of any unwanted minerals that may find their way into their hair, but tap water works just fine, too."

      "title": "Simmer rosemary sprigs for 15-20 minutes.",
      "content": "Simmer rosemary sprigs for 15-20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium. Place 3-4 whole, fresh sprigs of rosemary directly into the boiling water, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes. After about 15 minutes, the water will take on a darker, amber hue. The longer you leave the sprigs in, the stronger your rosemary water will be. Optionally, remove the pot from the heat after boiling the rosemary for 5-10 minutes, and let the rosemary steep in the pot for up to 3 hours for a more potent infusion. Also, consider adding 1 tsp (1 g) of whole cloves, which has antimicrobial effects that may promote scalp health.

Then, strain the rosemary water into a spray bottle and throw out or compost the leftover rosemary. Your rosemary water is ready to use!

      "title": "Work 3-4 spritzes of rosemary water into your scalp.",
      "content": "Work 3-4 spritzes of rosemary water into your scalp. Part your hair down the center. With your spray bottle, spray the rosemary water directly onto your scalp. (Or, pour 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of the water onto your scalp, if you don’t have a spray bottle.) Then, use your finger to massage the rosemary water all across your head for 2-3 minutes, working your fingers in small circles. For best results, apply your rosemary right after you get out of the shower, onto clean hair. Before you apply it to your scalp, patch test the water by dabbing a bit onto your wrist and waiting for 2 hours to see if you have a negative reaction to the rosemary."

      "content": "Use your rosemary water in the shower as a rinse. If you’d rather not have your hair smell so intensely like rosemary, apply the rosemary water in the shower, just like you would shampoo. Spray a few spritzes onto your scalp, then massage the rosemary water in with your fingers. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then thoroughly rinse it out. [5] X Research source Use the rosemary water before you shampoo or condition if you’d rather mask the smell. Otherwise, use it afterward so that the rosemary has longer contact with your scalp."

      "content": "Use your rosemary water 2-4 times a week. For best results, apply your rosemary water to your scalp at least twice a week. If you like, use it every day to give your scalp plenty of contact with the beneficial compounds in the rosemary. Whatever your schedule, stay consistent! Hair growth is a long process, even when using remedies like rosemary oil—expect results in about 6 months. To possibly enhance your results, use rosemary oil alongside your rosemary water.

      "content": "Rosemary water may speed up hair growth. In a clinical study comparing rosemary oil to minoxidil (or Rogaine), researchers found that, after a period of 6 months, rosemary oil performed just as well as minoxidil to encourage hair growth. [7] X Research source Rosemary water contains the same compounds as rosemary oil (but in lower concentration), and so rosemary water may also be an effective hair growth agent. The hair-growth properties of rosemary are thanks to carsonic acid, which reduces inflammation, provides antioxidants, and rejuvenates damaged scalp tissues and nerves.
