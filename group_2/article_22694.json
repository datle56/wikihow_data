      "title": "Do not confront your partner until you have proof.",
      "content": "Do not confront your partner until you have proof. While you should talk to your partner about concerns regarding other problems, with infidelity it is best to wait until you have proof. Proof in this case means hard evidence (e.g., pictures, catching them in person, etc.) that your partner has been unfaithful. If you confront your partner too soon or without evidence, they will just deny everything. They will also become more secretive and careful with their actions, making it even harder to obtain proof of their infidelity. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for signs of cheating. Before deciding to hire a private investigator it can be helpful to start gathering some information about your suspicions. Be very careful as you do this, as you do not want to be caught during this initial step. Also keep in mind that signs of cheating are not the same as proof of cheating. The most common signs of infidelity include: [3] X Research source Notable increase or decrease in intimacy, affection levels, or sexual interest.

      "title": "Keep a journal of your partner’s whereabouts.",
      "content": "Keep a journal of your partner’s whereabouts. In order to track your partner’s changing behaviors, it is crucial that you start writing down important information. A cheating partner will often change their story or question your memory, and this journal will help you bring to light these inconsistencies. Some things to track in the journal include: [4] X Research source Dates and times of outings/events The other people attending the outing/event Reasons why you are not invited Excuses given for why your partner is late"

      "title": "Gather hard evidence.",
      "content": "Gather hard evidence. Without being too obvious or invasive, further your preliminary investigation by monitoring your partner’s habits and spending. In addition to keeping a journal about what they say, try to find some hard evidence about what they are doing. Watching your partner slyly can help build a case against them, which you can then use to find the right private investigator. Without being too obvious, try to track some of the following: [5] X Research source Monitor your partner’s mileage, receipts, credit card statements, ATM withdrawals, phone records, etc. to give you an idea of where they are going and if they are spending more money than usual. If you share a cell phone account, contact the phone company for the text message log, which includes all text messages sent or received that weren’t deleted. Try searching for other social media accounts to see if your partner has a secret profile under a different name."

      "title": "Discuss the matter with your personal attorney.",
      "content": "Discuss the matter with your personal attorney. If you are serious about hiring a private investigator, it is important that you speak with legal counsel about it beforehand. Marital disputes are fraught with legal issues, and having advice from a lawyer can help limit your exposure. Many attorneys also work with private investigators and may be able to recommend a PI that they have worked with or have heard is reputable. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Research licensed private investigators in your area. As you begin choosing a PI to help confirm your partner’s infidelity, it is extremely important that this person is a licensed, experienced PI. Most states have strict requirements to obtain an investigative license, including specific training classes, passing grades on assessment examinations, and a particular number of supervised field hours. However, the following states do not have statewide licensing requirements: [7] X Research source Alabama Alaska Colorado (voluntary licensing available) Idaho Mississippi South Dakota"

      "content": "Choose a PI with experience in spousal infidelity investigations. Many private investigators have a specialty within the investigative industry. Rather than hiring any licensed PI, try to locate one that has a great deal of experience with marital investigations. These PIs will be more experienced with the nuances of investigating a suspected cheater, as opposed to a PI that typically investigates corporations or insurance fraud. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask each potential PI what their services include.",
      "content": "Ask each potential PI what their services include. If you want to be sure that the investigation is thorough, be sure to discuss specifics with each PI you are considering. For the most part, licensed PIs will conduct their investigations per the standard methods they are trained on; however, it is important to be sure that your PI actually utilizes all the methods available to them. While a PI is unable to pose as law enforcement officers, tap wires, or obtain cell phone records via pretexting, they should include the following in their investigation: [9] X Research source Physical surveillance Hidden cameras GPS tracking Internet monitoring Social network investigation Decoys to tempt your cheating spouse"

      "title": "Shop around for the most reasonable price.",
      "content": "Shop around for the most reasonable price. Another factor to consider when choosing a private investigator is the cost of such an extensive professional investigation. The cost of a PI can vary widely based on the experience of the PI, the location(s) of the investigation, the prospective length of the investigation, and the difficulty of the investigation (like if the partner is a high-profile person). However, some general information regarding PI costs: [10] X Research source Hourly fees throughout the country range from approximately $40 - $100 per hour, with an average hourly rate of about $50 - $55 per hour. Many PIs require a retainer or deposit to be applied against fees for services rendered and expenses, with deposits up to $5,000 for infidelity cases. Factors determining this amount include travel involved, airline/hotel costs, estimated number of surveillance hours, and the urgency of the case. Keep in mind common additional costs, such as a mileage expenses for any driving and fees for adding additional PIs to the case."

      "title": "Commit fully to the investigation.",
      "content": "Commit fully to the investigation. Once you have chosen a PI, the most important thing you can do is commit to the investigation. It is important that you give the PI all of the information you have on your partner from your own monitoring. It is also crucial that you answer any and all questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge. Holding anything back from the PI, even things that incriminate you and your own fidelity, will only hinder the PI and disrupt the investigation. You need to be willing to speak openly with the PI about your situation, and you must be willing to find out the truth!"
