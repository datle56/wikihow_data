      "content": "Give your cat a massage to relieve stress. Just like when you go get a relaxing massage, your cat can enjoy one, too. A gentle massage does wonders to help lower anxiety, relieve tension, and relax your cat’s muscles after a hard day. Plus, it can strengthen the bond between you two. If your cat is old or sick, a massage can help them fall asleep, too."

      "content": "Stick to light stroking when you give your cat a massage. Think about how your cat likes to be petted: usually, they enjoy soft, light touches that run along their body. As you give your cat a massage, stick to gentle motions that caress them rather than deep ones that could be tough on their bodies. [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source If you think your cat needs a deeper massage, you can take them to a vet to get it done professionally. As you move throughout the massage, you can use one or both of your hands."

      "title": "Keep the massage around 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Keep the massage around 5 to 10 minutes. Cats don’t need hours and hours of massage, so you can keep yours short. Set aside at least 10 minutes of your day to give your cat some extra attention whenever you have the time. [2] X Research source There’s no set amount for how often you should massage your cat, so you can tailor it to their needs. In general, try not to give them a massage more than once or twice per day."

      "content": "Massage your cat when they’re in the right mood. If your cat is grumpy, anxious, or jumpy, they might not be in the mood for a lot of touch. Wait until your cat approaches you with some gentle head bumps to indicate they’d like to be petted, then go ahead with the massage. [3] X Research source Never massage your cat if they’re in a lot of pain, if they have open wounds, or if they have blood clot problems. You should also never perform a massage directly on top of tumors or infected skin. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get yourself into a zen mood. Cats can pick up on your stress and anxiety, and they won’t be able to relax if you’re in a bad headspace. Make sure you’re feeling at least somewhat calm before you start giving your cat a massage so they can feed off of your positive energy. [5] X Research source Giving your cat a massage can be a relaxing activity for you, so you can use it to help you destress after a tough day. If you aren’t in a good mood, your cat may not want to be petted by you at all, anyway."

      "content": "Find a comfortable spot. This is all about making your cat more relaxed, so you should pick a space where they feel their best. You can sit on the couch, lay on the floor, or stand up next to a table—whatever your cat prefers. [6] X Research source Make sure there aren’t a ton of loud noises (from kids, other pets, or TVs) so your cat can stay calm and relaxed. You should also keep the temperature neutral—not too hot and not too cold."

      "content": "Wait until your cat isn’t busy. It might sound funny, but cats have lives too! If your cat is grooming themselves, eating, or using the litter box, it isn’t a good time for a massage right now. [7] X Research source Try to wait about 2 hours after your cat eats before you start a massage. That way, they can digest their food first."

You may even want to wait for him to come to you instead of grabbing him out of his comfort zone. Wait for him to hang out with you, relax, lie down, or even to purr or nuzzle up against you.

Starting with a familiar place will make your cat more amenable to being massaged all over. [10] X Research source You can figure out where your cat likes to be touched by listening when they start to purr. It’s super important to start slow—going too fast can overwhelm your cat and make them anxious. Try to stay away from the head and face unless your cat really likes that. Cats can interpret that sort of touch as a threat, and it can stress them out. Cats typically prefer to be touched from the neck up.

Use your full hand and apply some gentle pressure to the cat’s body as you’re stroking it. Save your fingertips for massaging the head and face.

If they are blinking, purring, drooling, falling asleep, or even looking a little dazed, they’re probably enjoying the massage immensely. [13] X Research source If your cat backs up or starts to scratch you, stop the massage. It’s probably nothing personal, and you can try it again in a few hours or a few days. Some cats may raise their hind end when they're enjoying a massage, especially if you're petting them along the spine from their head to the base of their tail.

[15] X Research source [16] X Expert Source Molly DeVoss Certified Feline Training and Behavior Specialist & Certified Cat Behavior Consultant Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. Pay attention to how your cat reacts to having their head massaged. Some cats perceive this as a threat, so back off if they look uncomfortable or anxious. You might want to come back to the head after you’ve massaged your cat more, since they might need to be more relaxed in order to fully appreciate having their head massaged."

Massage your cat with your fingers, making small circular motions up and down the neck. Be careful not to press into their neck too hard to avoid hurting them. [17] X Research source The neck is another sensitive area, and your cat may not like it. Pay attention to their body language and how they act during this part of the massage."

Keep your attention on your cat’s upper back, as the lower back and hips can be sensitive for many cats. If your cat likes to be touched in this area, then massage it very gently. Remember to pay attention to body language and purring."

      "content": "Massage your cat's tail. Start by massaging your cat's tail at the base, near the rump, and then slowly work your way toward the end of the tail. You can use both hands, but work lightly with the fingers, since the tail is a very sensitive place for the cat. If you just go for your cat's tail first, they’re likely to run away from you. [24] X Research source You can even massage your cat’s head with one hand and the tail with the other. If your cat starts wildly moving their tail, then they’re probably getting excited and maybe even angry, which is the opposite of what you want."

Check the fur to see if your cat has been grooming himself. [27] X Research source If the fur is matted or greasy, this could indicate health problems such as diabetes, bladder infections or other issues. If it seems unclean in only a few spots, this might indicate that your cat has trouble reaching certain areas of his body, perhaps because of arthritis. If the fur is over-groomed and the fur is actually missing or sparse in some areas, this could indicate a dermatological issue, such as a skin irritation or allergy."
