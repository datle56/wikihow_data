      "content": "Sit down and peruse a journal. Journals typically provide academic research that are longer than magazine articles and use extensive citations.

If you prefer the academic nature of a journal, then join a society that you are interested in like history, biology, or sociology. These societies fund journals and send them to members who are interested in the same fields of knowledge. Go to a university library where you can access hundreds of different journal titles on nearly any academic topic."

Joining a book club, for instance, encourages you to engage in something you normally wouldn’t, like reading a book that is outside of your interests."
