      "content": "Yes—just because she's married doesn't mean she can't choose her friends. Relationships are complex things and just because a woman is friends with a man doesn't mean she's attracted to him physically, romantically, or emotionally. Plus, relationships change over time. Researchers have found that, in general, romantic and physical attraction actually diminished over time in friendships. [1] X Research source This suggests that platonic friendships are possible, so there's no reason women can't hang out with men."

      "content": "Not necessarily, but talk with her if you feel uncomfortable. Don't hide your feelings—let her know if you're feeling concerned or threatened.

For instance, you might say, \"I get that you and Tim are friends, I'd just feel better if he doesn't call the house late at night.\" This doesn't have to be a one-time conversation. You should feel comfortable talking with your wife if you ever feel like her best friend is overstepping in the relationship. For example, say, \"Could we talk about what Tim's been saying lately? I've noticed he's started flirting with you and I'm uncomfortable with it.\" You might be concerned if infidelity has been an issue in your marriage. You may not trust your wife if she's cheated in the past, or maybe you cheated and assume that she might, too. In either case, you both might benefit from talking with each other about your relationship or meeting with a marriage counselor."

Be sensitive but honest and explain that it's probably best for everyone to stop spending time with each other. For example, you might say, \"Alex, I've been giving our friendship a lot of thought and I realized that I'm attracted to you. This isn't fair to my spouse, so I can't see you anymore.\" You might say, \"Rory, I can't help but feel like you've been flirting with me lately. I don't feel that way about you and it's making me uncomfortable. Maybe we need to take a break from hanging out.\""
