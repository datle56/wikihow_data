Such wounds and past trauma can greatly affect how an adult views the world, themselves, and their relationships. However, in many cases, a person may often try to repress and ignore these wounds. [1] X Research source The concept of the inner child was proposed by psychologist Carl Jung as an archetype that symbolizes the common vulnerability that connects all humans. [2] X Research source When a person’s inner child is healthy, it’s a source of childlike creativity, excitement, and inspiration."

If you had adults in your life who constantly told you what to do, it might be hard for you to decide for yourself what your true interests and passions are as an adult. Because of this, you may find it hard to make decisions and rely on others to make them for you in your adult relationships. [11] X Research source It can also be hard to pinpoint your exact wants and needs if you’ve gotten used to ignoring them for the sake of looking after others.

They likely learned from an early age that their caregivers wouldn’t be able to give them the support they needed, so they were forced to become independent and self-reliant. As an adult, this can translate into difficulty asking others for help or showing weakness. [15] X Research source For example, even when you’re incredibly stressed out at work and have too much on your plate, you might bottle up your emotions instead of talking to someone.
