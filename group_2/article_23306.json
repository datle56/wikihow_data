      "content": "Notice the signs of a deeper MRSA infection. As the infection spreads through your body, it can choke the lungs; inflame your urinary tract; and even begin to eat your flesh. Untreated MRSA can result in necrotizing fasciitis, a rare but horrific flesh-eating disease. Notice the signs that MRSA has spread to the lungs. If the infection is still undetected and left untreated, there is a risk that it can spread to the lungs. Look out for coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. [16] X Research source A high fever and body chills, possibly accompanied by urinary tract infection, are signs that the MRSA has spread to other organs of the body, such as the kidneys and urinary tract. Necrotizing fasciitis is very rare, but not unheard-of. This may manifest as a severe pain in the infected area."

      "content": "Seek treatment immediately. If you think that you're infected with any stage of MRSA, act as quickly as possible before the bacteria eats its way any deeper into your system. Even if you aren't sure: ask a doctor. MRSA can be a serious and life-threatening condition, and it isn't worth it to take any chances. Treatment for community-acquired MRSA is Bactrim and if you are hospitalized it is IV vancomycin."
