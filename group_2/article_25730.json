      "title": "Hit your opponent’s temple to disorient them.",
      "content": "Hit your opponent’s temple to disorient them. The temple is located 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) behind and slightly above the eye. Striking this point on the body is painful since it’s one of the softest locations on the head. Use a closed fist or open palm to slam against the side of your opponent’s head, disorienting them and giving you time to prepare your next move. This will also cause your opponent to raise their arms to protect their head, giving you access to their body. [1] X Research source Warning: You can kill someone by striking the temple too hard or by puncturing it with an object. Only strike an opponent’s temple as a last resort to preserve your own safety. The temple is so sensitive because it’s the point where 4 different bones in the skull fuse together. It’s especially dangerous to hit this area though, because the bone structure is weaker than other parts of the skull. Using an open palm can reduce the odds that you may kill or seriously injure someone when doing this."

      "title": "Gouge an attacker’s eyes to subdue them and restrict vision.",
      "content": "Gouge an attacker’s eyes to subdue them and restrict vision. Spread your index finger and middle finger out 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) and quickly strike both of your opponent’s eyes with the tips of your fingers. As they raise their hands to protect their face, use your non-dominant hand to either hold the back of their head, move their hands away, or strike another part of their body. [2] X Research source This is a good way to get away from someone attacking you. They can’t chase you if they can’t see where they’re going. Warning: If you keep applying pressure to your opponent’s eyes after striking them, you could damage their optical nerves and permanently blind them. Shemesh advises to “hit [an attacker’s] vulnerable points. When you hit someone in the face, like eyes, you’ll get the same results whether they’re 300 or 100 pounds.” [3] X Expert Source Tsahi Shemesh Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 17 September 2019."

      "title": "Use a fish hook to control your opponent’s head and neck.",
      "content": "Use a fish hook to control your opponent’s head and neck. To fish-hook an opponent, slide your index and middle fingers into the inside of your attacker’s cheek. Then, pull on the skin at the side of their mouth while maintaining pressure to restrain them and keep them from turning their head. In a grappling situation, fish-hooking your opponent allows you to control their head and gives you the upper hand. [4] X Research source Warning: You can snap someone’s neck doing this if you pull too quickly and too hard. Try to avoid sticking your fingers in between your opponent’s teeth while doing this. If they bite your fingers, the move could backfire."

      "title": "Punch or chop the side of the neck to make your opponent dizzy.",
      "content": "Punch or chop the side of the neck to make your opponent dizzy. When you find an opening, strike the opponent on the side of the neck, roughly 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) under the ear where their neck starts to slope into the shoulder. This is the location of the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. Hitting this location hard disrupts your opponent’s oxygen supply and causes them to become dizzy. [5] X Research source This is the same set of arteries you can restrict when performing a sleeper hold . If you can’t reach the side of your opponent’s neck, striking them in the middle of their throat can make it difficult for them to breathe and may throw them off balance. Warning: If you damage this artery, your opponent could die."

      "title": "Strike the groin to quickly drop an attacker.",
      "content": "Strike the groin to quickly drop an attacker. The groin is a highly sensitive area of the human body. Striking it with a quick kick or punch to send your opponent into a tremendous amount of pain, Shemesh explains. [6] X Expert Source Tsahi Shemesh Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 17 September 2019. They will quickly drop to the ground, buying you time to flee or subdue your attacker. Curl your toes, and kick your opponent in the groin with the top of your foot. [7] X Research source Your opponent will have trouble standing up after this, as attacks to the groin usually cause a fair bit of nausea. Warning: You can permanently disfigure or damage your opponent by doing this, so use caution if you don’t want to cause serious harm to the person you’re fighting."

      "content": "Punch or kick an opponent’s gut to bring them down to their knees. There aren’t any bones protecting the stomach, which means you can strike an opponent’s stomach and damage their organs without much resistance. Use a closed fist to punch your opponent’s stomach right below the belly button to deliver a powerful strike that will make your attacker bend over. You can also use a bent foot to kick your opponent’s gut if it’s easier. [8] X Research source Even if you miss the stomach, hitting your opponent’s bladder or kidneys has a similar effect."

      "title": "Slam an attacker’s sides to take the wind out of them.",
      "content": "Slam an attacker’s sides to take the wind out of them. If you can’t strike the stomach directly, opt to kick or punch an opponent’s side, 5–6 in (13–15 cm) beneath the end of their ribcage. This throws your opponent off balance while causing them to bend over to the side in pain. This is an excellent option if you want to reposition in a fight and gain the upper hand. If you need to flank your opponent when you’re facing them, strafe 2–3 ft (0.61–0.91 m) with your dominant foot to your dominant side to keep yourself from needing to move both of your feet."

      "title": "Kick the back or side of the knee to drop your opponent.",
      "content": "Kick the back or side of the knee to drop your opponent. When you’re in striking distance, lift your foot and aim the heel of your shoe at your opponent’s knee. Kick it from the side or behind the kneecap to knock your opponent down to the ground. Because the knee is designed to bend forward, it’s incredibly easy to cause it to over-extend by kicking it from the side or the back. [9] X Research source This is an excellent option if you’re grappling with your opponent and your arms are busy. Warning: You can break an attacker’s knee by doing this, so only perform this move when necessary."

      "title": "Sweep your opponent’s leg if you’re lower to knock them down.",
      "content": "Sweep your opponent’s leg if you’re lower to knock them down. If you end up in a position in a fight where your opponent is either standing over you or trying to force you down, drop lower to the ground and swing your leg through their shin or ankle to drop them to the floor. Swiping the ankle or shin is a great way to use your opponent’s advantage against them. Swipe your attacker’s leg from the side to knock their legs out or get behind the ankle to put them on their butt. [10] X Research source Once your opponent is on the ground, you can either grapple them with your newfound advantage or take the time to get back to your feet."

      "content": "Grip your opponent’s wrist and bend it inward to disarm them . If your attacker is holding a weapon or an object, reach out to grab the front of their hand with your dominant hand, and the side of their wrist with your nondominant hand. Once you’ve gripped both the front and side of their hand, bend their wrist inwards to cause them to drop their weapon after they open up their palm. [11] X Research source With their wrist still held tight, you can pull their arm behind them to execute a wrist twist, which will allow you to subdue your opponent. Warning: You can break someone’s wrist by doing this."

      "content": "What are pressure points? Pressure points are specific points of the body that are believed to trigger an involuntary response. In Chinese medicine and reflexology, pressure points are used to calm ailments and bring peace to the body (this is commonly seen through acupuncture). [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In combat, pressure points are considered areas of the body that are weakest. Dim Mak, a Chinese martial art, refers to pressure points as “death points.” It’s rumored that touching or striking these points on the body can immobilize or even kill an opponent."

      "title": "Do pressure points really work in a fight?",
      "content": "Do pressure points really work in a fight? Yes, attacking “pressure points” can work in a fight, but they’re not always reliable. Experts explain that pressure points work best when dealing with a calm, compliant partner (preferably in a dojo). In a real, unsolicited fight, they can be more difficult to target successfully. This is why it’s best to target a general area of the body rather than one small, specific pressure point. [13] X Research source It’s still important to target pressure points in a fight, even if they won’t reliably take your opponent down. They can still cause imbalance and weaken your attacker."
