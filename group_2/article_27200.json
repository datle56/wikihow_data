      "content": "Put 1 tablespoon (11 g) of fenugreek seeds into a pot on the stove. Set a small pot on the stove and put the whole seeds into it. There's need to crush the seeds as long as you simmer and steep them. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of water and turn the burner to high.",
      "content": "Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of water and turn the burner to high. Keep the lid off of the pot so you can see when the water begins to boil. There's no need to stir the fenugreek seeds as the water heats. [2] X Research source If you'd like to make a larger amount of fenugreek tea, double the amount of tea and water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Simmer the seeds over medium-high heat for 6 to 7 minutes.",
      "content": "Simmer the seeds over medium-high heat for 6 to 7 minutes. Once the water comes to a boil, turn the burner down to medium so the water bubbles gently. Let the tea simmer until the water turns a pale yellow color. Then, turn off the burner. Stir the fenugreek seeds occasionally to help the tea steep evenly."

    {
      "title": "Strain the tea into a teacup.",
      "content": "Strain the tea into a teacup. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a teacup and put on oven mitts. Slowly pour the hot fenugreek tea through the strainer. Then, discard the seeds that are in the strainer. For the most potent, flavorful tea, don't steep the seeds again. If you like, you can eat them."

    {
      "title": "Add honey or sweetener if you want to adjust the flavor.",
      "content": "Add honey or sweetener if you want to adjust the flavor. Fenugreek tea has a slight maple syrup flavor on its own, but you can stir in more of your favorite sweetener if you like. Stir in honey, agave, or cane syrup, for example. If you like creamy tea, stir in a little milk."

      "title": "Put all of the herbs and seeds into a bowl.",
      "content": "Put all of the herbs and seeds into a bowl. Measure or weigh 1/4 cup (45 g) of fenugreek seeds and put them in a bowl along with 1/2 cup (45 g) of dried nettle leaf, 1/2 cup (12 g) of dried red raspberry leaf, 1/4 cup (23 g) of fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup (12 g) of dried lemon verbena. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Fenugreek is a phytoestrogen that can improve signs of breastmilk sufficiency. Fennel and dried nettle leaves have been studied as galactagogues, which increase milk production. Red raspberry leaf and lemon verbena improve the flavor of the fenugreek tea."

      "title": "Stir the dried ingredients and store them in an airtight container.",
      "content": "Stir the dried ingredients and store them in an airtight container. Use a spoon to mix the dried herbs and seeds until they're combined. Since this makes 2 cups (138 g) of dried herbal tea (which makes about 100 servings of brewed tea), transfer the tea to an airtight container that's large enough to hold it all. [4] X Research source If you store the herbal lactation tea in an airtight container away from direct light, it will last for up to 4 years."

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of boiling water over 1 teaspoon (1 g) of tea to brew a cup. When you're ready to make a cup of your lactation tea, measure 1 teaspoon (1 g) of the herbal tea and add it to your teapot. Carefully pour 1 cup (240 ml) of boiling water over the herbs. Keep in mind that you can double these amounts if you'd like to make a larger pot of tea. [5] X Research source If you'd rather make the tea in your cup, place the leaves into a tea ball."

      "title": "Steep the tea for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Steep the tea for 5 minutes. Put the lid on the teapot or place a saucer or lid over the teacup. This traps the steam and prevents your tea from cooling as it steeps. Then, set a timer for 5 minutes. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Strain the lactation tea and sip it slowly.",
      "content": "Strain the lactation tea and sip it slowly. Set a strainer over an empty teacup and pour the tea through it or remove the ball if you steeped the tea directly in the cup. You can sip the tea as it is or sweeten it with honey or agave. [7] X Research source If you'd like to flavor the tea even more, add a squirt of lemon juice. Drink 1 cup (240 ml) of tea 3 times a day if you're trying to increase milk production. You can get many health benefits from fenugreek seeds in soups, baked goods, salads, and curry. [8] X Research source In powdered or crushed form, you can consume fenugreek in capsules, pancakes, herbal tea, and bread. [9] X Research source Fenugreek seeds taste better roasted or blended with spices. [10] X Research source"
