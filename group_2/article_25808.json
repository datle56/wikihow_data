      "title": "Choose your paper, then cut it if needed.",
      "content": "Choose your paper, then cut it if needed. Regular paper will work for most books, but if you want something fancier, consider handmade paper, sketchbook paper, or even watercolor paper. Your paper needs to be the height you want your pages to be, and twice the width. If it's too long, cut it. You will be folding your paper in half. Decide how many pages you want, then use half that number."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold your paper in half widthwise.",
      "content": "Fold your paper in half widthwise. Run your fingernail or a boning knife along the folded edge to sharpen the crease. Now your paper should be the exact height and width you want the pages to be. Fold the pages one at a time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make an even number of marks along the edge of your first sheet for the stitching.",
      "content": "Make an even number of marks along the edge of your first sheet for the stitching. Pick one sheet to use as your guide. Using a pencil, make small marks along the folded edge where you want the stitches to be. [1] X Research source The first and last marks should be ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the top and bottom. The rest of the marks should be 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart. Make sure that you make an even number of marks, otherwise the stitching won't work out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the pages inside one another to create bundles.",
      "content": "Tuck the pages inside one another to create bundles. Plan on using 4 to 6 pages per bundle. The more pages you cut, the bigger your bundles can be. Avoid using more than 6, however, or the book will warp."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stack the papers, then extend the marks down the other folded edges.",
      "content": "Stack the papers, then extend the marks down the other folded edges. Gather all of your bundles into a stack, with the marked sheet on top. Make sure that all of the folded edges are lined up, then use a pencil to draw lines across the folded edges. [2] X Research source Use the marks on the first page as a guide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an awl to punch the paper.",
      "content": "Use an awl to punch the paper. Thanks to the lines you drew in the last step, each of the folded edges should now have marks on them. Unfold the bundles and flatten them on a foam pad. Use an awl to punch a hole over each mark. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Thread a book binding needle with a long piece of waxed thread.",
      "content": "Thread a book binding needle with a long piece of waxed thread. If you can't find any waxed thread, you can use regular thread, then run it across a piece of beeswax. A 50-inch (127-centimeter) piece of thread should be long enough for most books. If you can't find a book binding needle, a curved needle will also work."

      "title": "Begin to sew the first bundle, starting from the outside.",
      "content": "Begin to sew the first bundle, starting from the outside. Pull the thread through the bottom hole on the outside of the first bundle. When you have about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) of thread left, move onto the next hole. Keep sewing through the holes until you come out of the top hole on the outside of the bundle again."
    },

      "title": "Add the next bundle.",

      "title": "Tie the thread together, then add the next bundle.",
      "content": "Tie the thread together, then add the next bundle. When you come out of the bottom hole on the next bundle, find that 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) tail from before. Tie the two threads together in a tight knot, then add the next bundle, just like you did the second one."

      "title": "Continue sewing, then loop the thread around the horizontal stitches at the top.",
      "content": "Continue sewing, then loop the thread around the horizontal stitches at the top. Use the needle to weave the thread in and out of the holes. When you come out of the top hole, stop, and take a look at the spine. You'll notice horizontal stitches running across the spine. Pull the needle down through the top horizontal stitch so that the thread loops around it."

      "title": "Continue adding bundles, sewing them, and looping the thread around horizontal stitches.",
      "content": "Continue adding bundles, sewing them, and looping the thread around horizontal stitches. Slide the next bundle onto the needle. Sew your way towards the bottom hole. Slide the needle up through the bottom horizontal stitch, then add the next bundle. Keep sewing up and down, wrapping the thread around the top/bottom stitching, and adding bundles until you reach the last one."

      "title": "Tie the thread off.",
      "content": "Tie the thread off. Wrap the thread around the closest horizontal stitch to make a loop, then slide the needle through the loop to make a knot. Do this one more time to tighten the knot. If you finished on the bottom row, tie the thread to the 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) thread from before in a tight, double knot. Cut off the remaining thread."

If you are using a flower press, make sure that the spine is sticking out past the edge of the press by about ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters)."

      "content": "Paint glue across the back of the spine. Use a brush to coat the entire spine with glue, from edge-to-edge, top-to-bottom. [4] X Research source Book binding glue will work the best, but if you can't find any, ordinary pva glue (ie: white glue or carpenter's glue) will also work. [5] X Research source"

Make sure that the bottom end of the ribbon is ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the bottom end of the spine. Coat the spine again with more glue to seal the ribbon in.

Place the fabric over the spine, with ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of space on the top and bottom. Fold the side edges of the fabric down onto the first and last page of the book.

      "title": "Clip the corners.",
      "content": "Clip the corners. Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to slice off the corners of the leather, as close to the cardboard corners as you can. This will reduce bulk when you fold and glue the leather down."
