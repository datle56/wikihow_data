Glide the tool in complete outward, upward strokes, 3-5 times per section of the face or neck, to help direct and stimulate lymph drainage.

Below are steps to guide you through the typical order of facial gua sha. You can shorten this routine if your goal is simply relaxation through the calming ritual. [6] X Research source Neck: Glide the long side of your gua sha tool up and down the neck, 3-5 times per side. Throat: Glide the notched side of the gua sha tool from the base of your throat to your chin, 3-5 times. Jaw: Glide the notched side of the gua sha tool along your jawline, from the center of your chin to under your ear. Do this 3-5 times on one side, then repeat on the other side. Cheeks: Glide the notched side of your gua sha tool along your cheekbone, moving upward from the side of your nose to your ear. Do this 3-5 times before repeating on the other cheekbone. Eyes: Glide the long side of your gua sha tool across your under eye area, moving from below the inner eye to the temple. Do the movement 3-5 times before repeating on the other side of your face. Eyebrows: Glide the notched side of the gua sha tool over your brow bone 3-5 times, starting from between the brows and moving outward toward the temple. Repeat on the other brow bone. Forehead : Glide the long side of your gua sha from the center of your forehead outward. After doing this motion 3-5 times on both sides, move up. Repeat until you’ve scraped all sections of the forehead. You’re done!"

When it comes to price, keep in mind that some experts argue you can use any rounded tool to perform gua sha—even a wooden spoon—but you want something you can easily clean. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For mental/spiritual wellness: You’ll likely want a gua sha (the term refers to the stone tool as well as the practice) associated with healing benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). [9] X Research source Jade is a popular material because of its cooling properties, and rose quartz is said to be ideal for those with sensitive skin. [10] X Research source Look out for fake (glass or plastic) stones, and consider supporting Asian-owned brands when shopping for authentic gua sha that aligns with TCM principles. [11] X Research source Avoid porous stones, as these can breed bacteria over time. [12] X Research source For cosmetic benefits: Maneuverability and shape are important to consider when picking a gua sha tool. The popular heart-shaped gua sha is easy to hold, and its notch allows you to easily perform gua sha on the jawline and under eye area. A comb gua sha (also called a wave-shaped gua sha tool) offers ridges to perform gua sha on the scalp as well. [13] X Research source Avoid porous tools that can breed bacteria, or weak tools (for example, plastic rollers) that could break easily. [14] X Research source"

[16] X Research source You’ll apply the oil before beginning gua sha (and may need to reapply it throughout the process) to lubricate your skin and help the tool glide easily, so make sure you have enough! [17] X Research source Look for a moisturizing face oil that’s suited to your skin type—if there’s already a skincare brand you love like Youth To The People or Drunk Elephant, see if they offer face oil."

      "content": "Create a schedule based on your goals and availability. Gua sha is typically performed at least 2-3 times a week. However, some experts recommend using a gua sha tool once or twice a day as part of your regular skin care or self-care routines to create a consistent practice. [18] X Research source Timing is also key—performing gua sha in the morning can address puffiness and energize your skin, while gua sha at night can help relax your facial muscles before bed. [19] X Research source If you aren’t a morning person or only have time to perform gua sha on the weekends, plan a low-frequency routine. Try to space out the days you perform facial gua sha (for example, once every three days), especially if your goals are physical/cosmetic in nature. This way, you can attempt to consistently achieve results such as stimulating lymphatic drainage to reduce puffiness. [20] X Research source When deciding when to perform gua sha at night, aim for fitting it in after cleansing your face and before putting on night creams or moisturizers. Since performing gua sha can increase blood circulation in the face, it’s believed by some experts to help with absorption of products. [21] X Research source Set reminders on your phone, smart watch, or other device to help you remember when it’s time to perform gua sha. Performing a gua sha routine takes 3-5 minutes (or 7-10 if you adopt a longer routine), so you only have to allow a little time each day to reap the benefits!"

Some YouTube channels with popular Gua Sha tutorials to follow along with include Tina Engeo , All You Can Face , and Lémore Beauty . Be advised that videos may feature claims about gua sha’s effects that are not supported by research or empirical evidence. Currently, there is little or no research supporting the claims that gua sha can tone muscles, spot-reduce fat, or reduce wrinkles by promoting collagen production—so focus on achieving possible effects such as muscle relaxation, stress relief, skin brightening, and lymphatic drainage.
