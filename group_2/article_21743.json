      "content": "Screw an eyelet hook to a ceiling joist for the most support. [1] X Research source Even though most LEGO builds are relatively light, some of the larger sets get really heavy. If you’re worried about a build falling down or if it weighs more than 15 pounds (6.8 kg), you’ll have to attach the hook directly into the wooden joist . [2] X Research source Run a stud finder over your ceiling to find a joist and drill a hole for the hook. Eyelet hooks have an enclosed loop so your model won’t slip and fall off of the wall. Always attach eyelet hooks into a joist. If you only put the hook through drywall, the weight of your LEGOs could pull the hook out from the ceiling."

[3] X Research source Mark where you want to hang the bolt and drill through the drywall. Pinch the wings on the side of the toggle bolt and push them through the hole. Tighten the bolt until it’s pressed up against your ceiling and feels secure. [4] X Research source Look for a toggle bolt that has a hook on the end so it’s easier to hang your LEGOs. Toggle bolts can’t hold more than 15 pounds (6.8 kg)."

[5] X Research source If you aren’t able to put holes in your wall or just want a cheaper option, hooks with adhesive backing might work best for you. Peel the backing off of the adhesive hook and press it onto the ceiling right above where you want to hang your LEGOs. Let the adhesive set for at least an hour before hanging anything from them. [6] X Research source You can use multiple adhesive hooks on slightly larger builds to help evenly distribute the weight. Adhesive hooks usually only work if you have smooth ceilings since they could fall off if they’re textured."

      "content": "Use anchor hooks that clip to braces if you have a drop-down ceiling. Drop-down ceilings are a little trickier since the tiles can’t really support the weight. However, you might be able to hang your LEGOs from the metal braces that run between them. Buy anchors specifically made for drop-down ceilings and push them onto the metal braces.

      "content": "Place multiple hooks to support the heaviest and largest sets. Most of your LEGO sets will be fine with just 1 hook, but the largest sets that weigh over 20 pounds (9.1 kg) could damage your ceiling. [8] X Research source If you need multiple hooks to hang your set, space them evenly apart on your ceiling so the LEGO sets stay balanced and don’t sag down. [9] X Research source Measure the widest part of your LEGO set and place the hooks that distance apart on your ceiling. There are very few sets that you’ll need multiple hooks for, but they may include the Millenium Falcon and the International Space Station models."

Pull the string tight and lower the model to the height you want it. Make sure that it isn’t so low that you’d bump into it, but don’t put it too high or you’ll only see the bottom of the model. Pinch the string at the top of the model so you know what length you need. [10] X Research source Where you hang your LEGOs is all up to personal preference, so choose whatever height works best in your room."

      "content": "Cut fishing line so it’s 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) longer than the measurement. Fishing line works perfectly since it’s really tough to break and is nearly invisible. Pull the fishing line off of the spool and stretch it to the length of your string. Add about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) extra since you’ll need to wrap some of it around your LEGO model so it doesn’t fall down. Cut the line with a pair of scissors. [11] X Research source Fishing lines have different ratings based on how much weight it supports. For example, if you get 6 lb (2.7 kg) line, then it will safely hold 6 pounds (2.7 kg) without snapping. If you have a heavier model, you may need a thicker line."

      "content": "Wedge the line between the bricks near the model’s center of gravity. Since LEGO bricks fit really tightly together, they should easily hold the fishing line in place without pulling them apart. Balance the model on the side of your hand so you can find where it’s center of gravity is. Take off the top 1–2 bricks and lay the end of the line on your model. Press the bricks back into place so the line doesn’t move around. [12] X Research source If you don’t want to take apart your LEGO model, you might be able to loop the line around the sturdiest part of the build. For example, if you have a LEGO plane, you can wrap the fishing line under the bases of the wings."

      "title": "Lift your model up by the fishing line.",
      "content": "Lift your model up by the fishing line. If your LEGO model is heavy, hanging it just from the center of gravity could make the rest of the bricks sag down or cause them to separate. Carefully lift the model up by the line to see if it fully supports the weight. If you notice the edges of your build sagging down, you may need to add more fishing line to the sides. [13] X Research source This is also a great way to test the angle your LEGO model hangs when you pull the string tight. If it hangs crooked, then you may need to move the line closer to the middle of the build."

Cut another piece of fishing line that’s the same length as your first piece and wrap it around the end that’s sagging down. Try to clamp the line between 2 of the bricks so it doesn’t come loose. Otherwise, you can try looping it around the bottom of the model. [14] X Research source If you want to tilt your LEGO model so the top is more visible, make the second piece of line 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) shorter than the first piece. This can make your model look like it’s turning or flying around."

If you used a hook that screws into the wall, then turn it clockwise so your model faces a different direction. Let your LEGO set stop moving so you can see its position before you keep adjusting it.

Support your model with one hand or take it down so it doesn’t fall down. Slide the fishing line between the bricks to shorten or lengthen the height that it hangs from the ceiling. The angle of your set depends on your own personal preferences, so keep adjusting it until you’re happy with the look. [18] X Research source For example, you can make the line on the right side of a LEGO plane longer to make it look like it’s banking to the right. As another example, you can make the front of a plane lower than the back to make it look like it’s coming in for a landing."

You could have planes flying at each other so it looks like they’re fighting, or you can have a plane taking off from a LEGO airport you built on a table. Get as creative as you want and try multiple arrangements to see what you like the best!

[20] X Research source You can even rotate the models and have them face different directions to help create more of a scene."
