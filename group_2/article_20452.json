      "content": "Test the wipe on a small section of fabric to remove any makeup product residue. Due to the chemicals usually found in detergent wipes, see how the wipe interacts with the fabric and if it is damaging to your clothes. Detergent wipes, such as Shout: Wipe & Go, can be found at your local grocery store or online. You may also consider a stain-fighting pen like Tide-to-Go."

      "title": "Massage stain with the wipe.",
      "content": "Massage stain with the wipe. Gently rub the stain with your detergent wipe in a circular motion. Start at the edges of the stain and work your way towards the center. Do this for a few minutes, or until you notice most of the stain has transferred over to your wipe."

      "title": "Flush the spot with running cold water.",
      "content": "Flush the spot with running cold water. Hold the stained fabric flat underneath the faucet. Try to set the spout to run on a low intensity, so it is easier to pinpoint the water stream directly within the stained area. Cold water will help lift the stain up. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry with a paper towel.",
      "content": "Dry with a paper towel. Squeeze the water from the stained area. Focus on lightly dabbing the stain repeatedly to guarantee all the makeup has been removed. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Blot the stain with a clean tissue to remove lipstick, eyeliner, or mascara from your clothing. This method works well with these makeup products because they are usually oil-based. Dish soap will not harm most fabrics. Using the tissue, sheet of toilet paper, or paper towel, gently pat the stain to remove any excess makeup. Do not rub the stain as this could make the makeup spread."

      "title": "Spritz with cold water.",
      "content": "Spritz with cold water. You can run your fingers through some water, then lightly pat the stain. You can also find a 1/2 teaspoon, then pour it over the stained area. Do not use hot water as it can cause the fabric to absorb the stain. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply a drop of dish soap onto the stain.",
      "content": "Apply a drop of dish soap onto the stain. If you are worried about how the soap may affect silk or wool, try it on a small area first before attempting to clean the stain. With your index finger, gently spread the soap so it covers the entire stained surface. A thin layer of soap on the stain is all you need. When choosing a dish soap, pick a strong grease fighting formula at your local grocery or convenience store."

      "title": "Rub the soap into the stain.",
      "content": "Rub the soap into the stain. Use a cloth towel to gently massage the soap into the stain. Start from the outside corners and work in; rub the soap into the stain in a circular motion. A small terry cloth would work best for this step. The loops of the cloth help remove the makeup from the fabric. If this is not available, you can use a regular hand towel. To help with stubborn stains, use an old toothbrush to massage the soap into the stain instead of a cloth."

      "content": "Pat clean with a dry towel. Do not rub the stain, rather dab the area so the towel absorbs the soap and makeup. Rubbing can create friction and leave more makeup or towel pieces behind."

      "content": "Spray hairspray on a small section of your clothing to remove liquid foundation, self-tanner, and liquid lipstick. See if there is any discoloration or damage. If all is well, take the hairspray, and spray directly onto the stain. Hairspray with extra holding powers is ideal because the chemicals will grab onto the makeup effectively. The faster you treat the makeup stain, the more likely it will be completely removed. Be careful when using hairspray on delicate fabrics, such as lace or silk. You may not have to apply multiple coats for the hairspray to harden."

      "content": "Moisten a paper towel. Get a clean paper towel, and run it under cold water. The colder the water, the better it is to remove the stain. Wring out any excess water, so that you will not completely saturate the fabric. The paper towel should be cool to the touch but not drenched."

[5] X Research source Push gently down on the stain with your paper towel and lift it off to see how much makeup has been removed, repeat until no makeup is visible on your clothing. To minimize the chance of leaving paper towel pieces on your clothing, use a heavy duty 2-ply paper towel."

Before the makeup starts to dry into the fabric, scrape the top layer of makeup using a plastic spoon or knife. These makeups will not dry instantly on your clothing, ensuring better removal. The malleability of the utensil makes it easier to scrape up the excess makeup. Discard once you are done. [6] X Research source"

Keep massaging the stain with the ice cube until you notice the makeup has lifted from the fabric. You may want to hold the ice cube with a paper towel. It will protect your fingers from the harsh temperature and delay the ice cube's melting. Ice cubes can be used on all fabrics. It's water!"
