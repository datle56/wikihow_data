      "content": "Some fighting is normal in relationships, and it might not be a bad sign. Most, if not all, couples fight at some point. If you're fighting sooner in your relationship than you expected, it might just mean the two of you are self-assured and opinionated (ultimately positive qualities). Notice how you and your partner treat each other during your disagreement. As long as you both remain empathetic and understanding, fighting early in the relationship might not be a bad thing at all. [1] X Research source Alternatively, if you or your partner is insulting or mistreating the other, or you're fighting over big issues like infidelity or lying, that might be a red flag."

      "content": "It's common to start fighting after the honeymoon phase is over. Every couple is different, but this period in a relationship usually lasts between 3 months and 2 years. During the honeymoon phase, higher levels of dopamine and oxytocin are released in your brain. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source These chemicals are usually responsible for that passionate, overwhelming feeling of falling in love. As you get to know each other, that passion may subside, and you might start noticing your differences. If you have your first fight earlier than 3 months in, that doesn't mean your relationship is doomed. Just make sure that you're both listening to each other, empathizing with the other's perspective, and finding solutions."

Even if you do notice these differences, you might ignore them (they're gorgeous, funny, and smartâ€”who cares if they don't clean up after themselves?). After your first fight, you might see your partner as only human, flaws and all. [3] X Research source If these flaws aren't dealbreakers for you, then try to look past them and remember the good in your partner. Remind yourself that you have flaws, too, and accept them for who they are. Perhaps these flaws are dealbreakers (lack of commitment or lying are pretty big ones). In that case, voice your concerns respectfully and see if their behavior changes. You could say, \"I completely understand that you're friends with your ex, but I'd appreciate if you were honest with me about when you see each other.\""

You might not feel ready to voice your concerns or state your boundaries because you don't want to scare them off. After your first fight, the two of you have established that you can get through conflict and still want to be with each other. This helps you feel more comfortable being yourself and addressing your needs. [4] X Research source Be open and honest about your boundaries and needs in your relationship, even if you've only been dating a few months. The early stages of the relationship are a great opportunity to establish what does and doesn't work for you. You might say, \"I can be a little sensitive sometimes. It's important to me that if we ever have a disagreement, we don't raise our voices or yell at each other.\" Going too long without speaking up might actually harm your relationship more than a fight, as it could lead to resentment and misunderstandings."

Instead of beating yourself up about this, try to see it as an opportunity to grow and work on listening to your partner going forward.
