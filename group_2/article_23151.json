      "content": "“I know, right?” means you emphatically agree with what someone said. When someone makes a statement that you strongly agree with or that you already knew was true, respond with “I know, right?” to show you’re on the same page. [1] X Research source This is a casual phrase that implies you’re excited or relieved to find something in common with another person. Them: “I can’t believe we have another exam this week!” You: “I know, right? It’s too much!” “I know, right?” is a grammatically correct phrase. Although it’s technically a question, adding “Right?” is a way to invite the other person to agree with you or continue the conversation (you’re not literally asking someone if it’s correct that you know something).

      "content": "Place the main emphasis on know in “I know.” The phrase “I know” affirms that you agree with, understand, or relate to what someone just said. [3] X Research source By putting extra weight on know , you’re indicating that someone’s point resonates with you very deeply or that you can relate to someone’s experience. The emphasis on know is very common when native English speakers say “I know, right?” It shows more depth and emotion without having to use extra words."

      "content": "Inflect your tone upward on right to make it sound like a question. In English, it sounds natural to raise the pitch of your voice at the end of a question to signal that you’re looking for an answer or more information. [4] X Research source In “I know, right?” most speakers will inflect upward on right? to cue the other person to respond. This might seem odd since you’re the one responding to them . However, asking “Right?” at the end of the phrase invites the other person to acknowledge or affirm your agreement. In this case, you’re not literally asking the other person if your agreement was correct. Instead, “Right?” is more of a relational tool that conveys a deeper level of understanding and connection.

      "content": "Reply with “I know, right?” when you wholeheartedly agree with someone. When someone makes a point that you agree with or that you already knew, say “I know, right?” in response to show that you understand or relate to it. This is an extra great reply when you feel like the opinion you’re sharing isn’t super common or that only people with a niche interest will know about. Them: “Summer is definitely the best time of year in this city.” You: “I know, right? There’s so much more to do than in the winter.” Them: “There’s no way we’re making it to the playoffs without our star quarterback.” You: “I know, right? I can’t believe they traded him.”"

When you’re super glad someone shares your point of view (especially if your opinion is an uncommon one), say “I know, right?” to mean something like “I’m so thankful you feel the same thing.” [6] X Research source This is a great way to build a connection with someone and express your approval with just a few words. Them: “I still think Jenna should have chosen the blue dress, but it’s her choice.” You: “I know, right? The blue looked so good but no one else said so!” Them: “I thought algebra was way easier than geometry, honestly.” You: “I know, right? Everyone thinks geometry is so cool but I don’t get it at all.”"

      "content": "Text “ikr” as a slang abbreviation for “I know, right?” The acronym IKR means “I know, right?” and is used in text messages and online chats the same way you’d say it in conversation. When someone makes a great point when you’re texting or surprises you by sharing a similar opinion to yours, send “ikr” to show you relate. Them: “Dave and Christa are breaking up and honestly, it’s about time.” You: “Ikr? They’ve been on the rocks forever.” Them: “So much of my sense of humor comes from watching SpongeBob as a kid haha” You: “Ikr!? I don’t get these people that have never seen it!”"

In the movie (written by Tina Fey), one of the lead characters, Regina George, says “I know, right?” after a friend says “Wow, your house is really nice.” However, it’s likely that people were saying “I know, right?” as far back as the ‘90s. Some people claim the phrase comes from suburban Los Angeles or the Valley Girl subculture (which might explain why Tina Fey wrote the line for a trendy teenage girl character).
