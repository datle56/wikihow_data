      "title": "Cut boards for the top.",
      "content": "Cut boards for the top. Use a table saw or hand saw to cut boards to the length you would like your coffee table to be. 32 inches (81 cm) is a good length to try, if you’re not sure what size to make it. Cut four standard boards approximately two inches thick and eight inches wide, known as 2x8s, to this length to serve as the top of your table. [1] X Research source You can also use 2x4s or other boards. Just cut enough so that the overall width of your coffee table, when the boards are laid side-by-side, will be to your liking. It is also possible to make a coffee table top from a single, wide slab of suitable wood. However, this might be harder to find at your local hardware store."

      "title": "Piece the top together.",
      "content": "Piece the top together. Put wood glue on the long, two-inch thick sides of the boards you are using for the top, and slide them together so that they form one large, flat surface. Make sure that the ends line up evenly. Use long clamps to hold them in place while the glue dries. [2] X Research source You only have to glue the sides of the boards that are touching each other."

    {
      "title": "Secure the top.",
      "content": "Secure the top. Cut 2x4 boards so that you have two lengths of 32 inches (81 cm) each. Position them so that they lie across all of the boards that you glued together to make the top. Place one on each side a couple of inches from the narrower edge of the top. The narrow ends of the 2x4s should be flush with the long sides of the coffee table top. Attach them to the top using wood screws. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add sides (an apron), if you like.",
      "content": "Add sides (an apron), if you like. This step is optional, but can add a bit of extra charm to your project. Cut two 2x4 boards the length of your table, and two more its width. Cut the ends of each board on their narrow side at a 45 degree angle. Glue the boards to the sides of your coffee table top so that they are flush with the top. Clamp them in place, and nail or screw them to the top once the glue has dried. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the pieces for the legs.",
      "content": "Cut the pieces for the legs. Using 4x4s, cut four pieces to the height you would like your coffee table to be. Approximately 17 inches (43 cm) should be a comfortable height. You will also need to cut two pieces of plywood to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) by 26 inches (66 cm). Finally, cut two pieces of 2x4 to the length of 19 inches (48 cm). [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Piece the legs together.",
      "content": "Piece the legs together. Take one of the pieces of plywood you cut and attach one leg to each end, screwing the plywood down on the top (square end) of each leg. Position one of the 2x4 pieces you cut 4.5 inches (11 cm) from the bottom of the other end of the legs. Screw through the legs into the 2x4 so that it sits between the two legs. Repeat this step for the other set of legs. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Stain or paint your coffee table pieces.",
      "content": "Stain or paint your coffee table pieces. You can choose to paint your table in a vibrant color, use varnish for a natural look, or choose a stain to give it a rich, rustic look. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, and paint/stain all of the pieces of your table, allowing plenty of time for them to dry before continuing. [7] X Research source Usually, manufacturers will recommend sanding the wood surface before you finish it with paint or stain. For a classy look, you can use a light-colored stain for the tabletop, and a darker one for its legs."

      "title": "Attach the legs to the top.",
      "content": "Attach the legs to the top. When everything is dry, turn the tabletop over so that the bottom with the 2x4s is facing up. Turn the legs over so that the plywood attaching them at the top is sitting on top of the 2x4s. Attach the legs by driving screws through the plywood into the 2x4s. Turn everything over, and your table is done! [8] X Research source Make sure that the legs are evenly spaced on the bottom of the tabletop before you screw them into place."

      "content": "Build a modular coffee table out of crates. Look for any kind of wooden crates, like those that hold wine, apples, eggs, or milk. The crates can be new or vintage, but you will need four of the same size. Stain or paint them as you like. Once they are dry, lay the crates on their sides and screw them together so that they form one large square. [9] X Research source The sides of the crates will serve as the tabletop. Use the parts originally meant to hold the wine, milk, or other items as storage or shelf space below the tabletop."

      "content": "Put a pallet on legs. Find a wooden pallet used for shipping, and four legs from an old piece of furniture or purchased new from a hardware store. Screw one leg into each corner of the bottom of the pallet. Paint or stain the whole table. Add a piece of plexiglass on top of the pallet for a smoother feel."

      "content": "Use an old door as a coffee table top. Look for an old wooden door at a thrift store or flea market. Cut the door to about half its size (unless you want a very long coffee table). Attach four furniture legs (new or old) to the flat surface of the door, one to each of its corners. You can paint or stain the door if you like, but for extra vintage charm, leave it as-is. For a sturdier coffee table, you can screw the door to the top of an existing coffee table, or two small end tables of equal size, instead of just attaching legs to the door’s corners."

      "content": "Repurpose an old window as a table top. Glass makes a nice surface for any coffee table, but the frame of an old window adds a chic touch. Attach furniture legs to the corners of the window, or simply screw the window on top of a basic end table to have a small but unique coffee table. [10] X Research source If you have a wooden box approximately the same size as your window, you can attach the two pieces together at their edges with hinges. That way, the window will still serve as the coffee table top, but the box will provide added storage."

      "content": "Repurpose an old suitcase. For this project, all you have to do is drill a hole in each corner of the back of a vintage suitcase, with the front-facing portion now facing up. Then, drive screws through the holes and into the tops of four wooden or metal table legs. The closed suitcase serves as a coffee table, but opening it reveals a stylish storage space. For added strength, you can cut a piece of plywood to the size of the interior of the bottom of the suitcase. Place it in the bottom, and drive screws through it into the tops of the legs you are attaching."

      "title": "Use reclaimed wood.",
      "content": "Use reclaimed wood. Many cities now have locations that offer reclaimed wood for sale. You can often find beautiful and unique pieces that are great for coffee tables. Find a slab that’s a good size for this purpose, and use a simple finish like varnish or polyurethane to preserve the natural look. Then, attach existing table legs to the bottom. Leave imperfections like knots in the wood for a touch of rustic charm. You can also build your own legs by using 4x4 wood cut to your preferred length. . Some reclaimed wood centers also sell stumps or thick slices from tree trunks. If you find one of these, you can also just place the glass top from an old round table on top of the chunk of wood for a simple coffee table. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Give an existing coffee table a makeover. For a really simple project, you can take a coffee table you already have, and paint or restain it. Remove the glass, if it has any, and use paint/stain remover to strip the old finish off. Add a new paint or stain color that you prefer. [12] X Research source Old coffee tables can usually be found at thrift stores, flea markets, and yard sales, just waiting for a makeover."
