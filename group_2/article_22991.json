      "title": "Email Roblox directly at info@Roblox.com.",
      "content": "Email Roblox directly at info@Roblox.com. If you have multiple questions or your question feels kind of complicated, explain your situation over email. This way, you can walk them through everything you need help with. Only do this if you can’t find relevant information about your problem online or in their support system. For example, if you’re getting a confusing bug that’s keeping you from performing an action in game or your account is corrupted somehow and you don’t know what to do, email them. This will probably take longer than using their support system, since Roblox customer support won’t see your email right away."
