      "content": "Do squats. [1] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. Doing squats is a great exercise not only to tone and lift your buttocks, but also to help build overall lower body strength. To do squats: Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Your feet should be facing forward, rather than turned out to the side. Tighten your stomach muscles for stability. Place your hands in a prayer position, with the palms touching. They should be parallel to your chest, but not touching. Bend your knees and squat down as if you were going to sit on a chair. Stop when your thighs are parallel to the ground. Be careful that you squat downward, rather than forward. Perform your first squats sideways in front of a mirror, so that you can check your knees and the curvature of your back. Pause at the bottom. Then, rise again squeezing your buttocks as you stand. You should feel your gluteal muscles and upper thighs working to lift you to a standing position. Repeat this exercise in reps of 10-20. Keep in mind that squats are a strength training and cardio exercise so they should be difficult. Reduce the repetitions to 10 if you cannot keep the proper form throughout the exercise. Increase the intensity of this butt-lifting exercise by adding hand weights. Use 2 to 5 lb hand weights and hold them down at your sides as you squat down."

      "content": "Try plie exercises. The plie is actually an exercise that got it's start in ballet studios. A common exercise for dancers, doing plies is another great exercise to lift your butt. [2] X Research source Move your feet out so that they are slightly wider than hip width apart. Your toes should be turned outwards away from your body at about a 45 degree angle. Check whether you are in proper position by ensuring your knees line up with your second toes. If they do not, turn out your feet less. Your knees must track over the second toe to keep the pressure from falling into the knee joint. Raise your arms out to the sides so they are parallel to the floor, like a ballet dancer, as you squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor. If you cannot plie to a parallel position, do a smaller move and work toward the full squat. Pause at the bottom. Then, slowly lift yourself back up to a straight position squeezing your glutes as you come back up to the starting position. Repeat the exercise 10 to 20 times. You can increase the intensity by holding a kettle bell with both hands. The process of turning out the legs will concentrate the effort in a different part of the glutes."
