      "content": "Opt for maxi dresses to look long and lean. You don’t have to stick with shorter hemlines to look sleek and slim. Go for solid maxi dresses that don’t add bulk with pleats or pockets. Ensure the bottom of the dress just brushes the floor, rather than showing your shoes or ankles.

Print dresses actually have camouflaging features that help you hide areas you may feel insecure about. However, you should opt for small prints to make your frame look smaller, rather than large prints which give the impression of a bigger surface area.
