      "title": "Decide whether you should call in sick.",
      "content": "Decide whether you should call in sick. It is possible that you are too sick for work and should stay home. By staying home you can prevent yourself from getting worse and help prevent the spread of illness. You might also help speed along your recovery so that you are more productive when you do return to work. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Think carefully about whether you are better off working or focusing on your recovery. If you have a high fever (over 101 degrees Fahrenheit) or spots on your throat, you might have to consult your physician. You should also talk to your doctor if you have trouble staying hydrated or if your symptoms do not get better after a few days. [4] X Research source Many workers cannot afford to take time off because of illness. If this is the case, then you will have to find ways to take care of yourself even while working."

      "title": "Ask if you can telecommute in lieu of a sick day.",
      "content": "Ask if you can telecommute in lieu of a sick day. It might be possible for you to get your work done from home instead of from the office. This option is great for employees (who can focus a bit more on recovery) and for employers (who do not have to worry about the spread of illness). Talk to your workplace to see if this is an option. In order for telecommuting to work, you will likely require a secure laptop and a high-speed internet connection as well as a reliable phone."

    {
      "title": "Stay calm.",
      "content": "Stay calm. Being expected to work while ill can be a source of stress. However, stress weakens the immune system and might prolong your recovery time. Take a few deep breaths and tell yourself that you will be all right. Even though you are ill, you will be able to be productive as well as recover from your illness. It might not be ideal, but you will get through this illness."

      "title": "Organize your work if you feel like you're coming down with something.",
      "content": "Organize your work if you feel like you're coming down with something. Sometimes we have a day or two of warning before we get sick. Perhaps you might feel run-down, achy, or sleepy. When you feel a cold or other illness coming on, organize your work tasks so that you do not lose productivity during your illness. Get ahead on as many tasks as you can, and consider taking some work home with you so that you don't have to come into the office. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Break up large tasks into smaller chunks.",
      "content": "Break up large tasks into smaller chunks. Illness makes it hard to focus and can also reduce your stamina. In order to get work done, approach your work as a series of small, manageable tasks. The Pomodoro technique, where you work in short bursts of 25 minutes and then take a short break, is especially useful when you are sick. For example, rather than putting together an entire presentation, tell yourself that you will simply make one slide at a time. After each slide is complete, allow yourself a break to recover: take a short nap or drink some tea."

      "title": "Work on low-stakes projects.",
      "content": "Work on low-stakes projects. If you can, focus on lower-stakes projects while you are ill. This can help prevent yourself from making silly errors on important tasks. Consider carefully whether it is necessary for you to do crucial, important work when you are feeling poorly. Catch up on busy-work whenever possible. For example, a day when you are ill might be an excellent time to do mundane, mindless tasks like cleaning out your email inbox, filing documents, or putting together next month's calendar. Try to avoid tasks that require high-level thinking, such as writing a crucial research report. It is also a good idea to work on first drafts instead of final drafts of papers and projects. [6] X Research source You can reread your drafts when you are feeling more like yourself. This will reduce the likelihood of major errors in the final version."

      "title": "Set priorities carefully.",
      "content": "Set priorities carefully. Workers who are ill are only 60% as productive as normal. [7] X Research source This means that you have to think very carefully about what kinds of work you actually have to accomplish while ill. Examine your deadlines and your calendar in order to prioritize which tasks have to be completed during your sick day."

    {
      "title": "Keep your expectations reasonable.",
      "content": "Keep your expectations reasonable. Acknowledge from the outset that you will not be as productive as normal while you are ill. Be kind to yourself and resist the urge to run yourself ragged. If you push yourself too hard while you are ill, you might delay your recovery or you might feel even sicker. Be productive if you have to, but allow yourself some time to relax and recover."

      "title": "Consider delaying certain meetings and tasks.",
      "content": "Consider delaying certain meetings and tasks. Sometimes we do not have a choice about what work we have to accomplish. But other times we might be able to rearrange our schedules. If you are sick, think about whether there might be some meetings that would be more productive when you are feeling better. Ask about postponing any meetings that are not time-sensitive or meetings where you will be expected to perform at your highest level.

      "content": "Take breaks frequently. People who are sick need more rest than usual and also need to stay hydrated. Be sure that you are allowing yourself lots of time to rest in between work tasks. Go to the water cooler, get tea at a nearby coffee shop, or simply rest your eyes at your desk for a few minutes. [9] X Research source You will be more effective if you do not push yourself too hard, too quickly."

      "title": "Ask for help.",
      "content": "Ask for help. Reach out to your neighbors, friends, family, and coworkers if you have to work while sick. Perhaps they might help you out around the house, bring you some soup, or be able to lend a hand with editing an important document. Everybody gets sick sometimes, and your loved ones and coworkers will sympathize with your plight. [10] X Research source If your coworkers help you with your duties, be sure that you express your gratitude and that you return the favor when your colleagues feel ill."

      "content": "Drink three times as much water as coffee. It is important to stay hydrated when you are sick. But sometimes we need caffeine in order to get through a workday when we are under the weather. Feel free to indulge in the occasional cup of coffee to get through this tough time, but be sure that you are drinking water as well. Drink 3 cups of water for every cup of coffee you have.

      "content": "Take a nap. If you are working from home, let yourself take a nap every now and again. Use naps as a reward to treat yourself when you accomplish an important task.

      "content": "Make a schedule for your return. If you are working from home or only working a half-day while you are sick, take a few minutes to organize your return to full-time work. Make a list of the most important tasks that you will have to accomplish, and begin to envision how you will accomplish these. Set a reasonable schedule to make sure that you catch up on what you might have missed during your illness."

      "title": "Reward yourself.",
      "content": "Reward yourself. Use rewards for finishing goals each day. Treat yourself with comfort foods, hot beverages, naps, or your favorite movie to watch while sick. Feel proud that you could accomplish so much, even during your illness."

      "title": "Consider alternative forms of productivity.",
      "content": "Consider alternative forms of productivity. Perhaps you feel too ill to accomplish your tasks for work or school. Your brain might be too sluggish, or perhaps you cannot even get yourself out of the house. If you are feeling so poorly that you cannot focus on work, let yourself be productive in other ways. Maybe you can catch up on sleep, which will make you more effective when you return to the office. [13] X Research source Or maybe you can clean your house or prepare some meals to put in your freezer, leaving yourself more time to work later in the month. Think about other ways that you can be productive, even if you are too ill to focus on your job."

      "content": "Purchase supplies. Many of the ways to alleviate your symptoms involve specific medications, supplies, foods, and beverages. You might have to plan a trip to a local drugstore or grocery store in order to stock up on these supplies if you don't have them handy. Consider asking a friend or family member to pick up these supplies for you if you are too under the weather to leave the house."

      "title": "Stay hydrated.",
      "content": "Stay hydrated. The most important key to recovering and feeling better is staying sufficiently hydrated. Keep a bottle of water with you at all times. It is also a good idea to have a good supply of hot tea nearby: hot tea is not only hydrating but it can also soothe a sore throat. Avoid alcohol while you are sick because it can dehydrate you and slow your recovery time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use nasal spray.",
      "content": "Use nasal spray. An over-the-counter saline nasal spray can help when you have a stuffy nose, sinus headache, or seasonal allergies. Nasal spray helps your body to flush out mucus and allergens, which will help you clear your head. Nasal spray can also help soothe your nose if it feels dry and irritated during a cold. When you use nasal spray, be sure that you keep facial tissues or a handkerchief nearby. You will likely have to blow your nose immediately after using the spray."

      "content": "Purchase over-the-counter medications. Many symptoms of common illnesses can be soothed with over-the-counter medications. For example, cough drops and syrups, decongestants, pain relievers, and anti-nausea medications can all be purchased without a prescription from your doctor. Don't combine medications to ensure that you don't experience adverse reactions. Be sure that you read the instructions carefully, take only the recommended dosage, and be on the lookout for allergic reactions. Even over-the-counter medications can cause side effects: do not treat them like candy."

      "title": "Avoid irritants such as smoke.",
      "content": "Avoid irritants such as smoke. Many illnesses are exacerbated by irritants in the environment such as smoke or chemical scents. Try to stay away from these irritants if you can. For example, do not hang out in a breakroom if smokers use it for their cigarette breaks. Stick to clean, controlled environments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a vaporizer.",
      "content": "Use a vaporizer. A vaporizer or humidifier can help a sick person breathe normally and can help break up nasal blockages. Breathing in wet, humid air also keeps the mucus membranes lubricated, which allows the body to fight infection more effectively. Use a vaporizer overnight or, if possible, at your work desk in order to breathe and feel better."

      "title": "Eat healthy, comforting foods.",
      "content": "Eat healthy, comforting foods. Sometimes illness can make you feel less hungry than usual.

      "title": "See a doctor if you're not feeling better in a week.",
      "content": "See a doctor if you're not feeling better in a week. It is wonderful that there are so many options for alleviating symptoms. However, easing a symptom is not the same thing as a cure or a full recovery. In many cases, a symptom reliever does not shorten recovery time at all. If you cannot shake your illness after seven days, you might want to consult a physician to make sure that you do not require prescription medication in order to recover fully."

      "title": "Avoid your colleagues if possible.",
      "content": "Avoid your colleagues if possible. If you cannot avoid going in to school or the office, do your best to keep your illness contained.

      "title": "Wash your hands often.",
      "content": "Wash your hands often. When you are sick, it is a good idea to wash your hands more often than normal. Use warm water and soap, and wash your hands for at least 15 seconds to make sure that you are fully cleaning your hands. This will help prevent the spread of infection around the office, such as when you touch doorknobs or computer keyboards. [16] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cover your mouth.",
      "content": "Cover your mouth. When you cough or sneeze, use your sleeve or elbow to cover your mouth. Sneezes and coughs spread infection easily, and you do not want to expose your colleagues. Covering your mouth with your hand might lead to you spreading germs when you touch doors, computers, or other objects around the office. Your elbow is much safer."

    {
      "title": "Disinfect surfaces.",
      "content": "Disinfect surfaces. When you are sick, use disinfectant cloths and sprays to wipe down communal surfaces. Be sure to clean doorknobs, drawer pulls, and the refrigerator door handle. Any surface that both you and your colleagues are likely to touch should be disinfected."

    {
      "title": "Don't share items.",
      "content": "Don't share items. Do not lend your colleagues your computer, mug, stapler, or pen when you are ill. If they ask to borrow these items, warn them that you are feeling under the weather. It is better for them if they borrow an item from another, healthy colleague."

    {
      "title": "Use disposable items while you are contagious.",
      "content": "Use disposable items while you are contagious. It is terrific to use reusable items most of the time. That is better for the environment and often better for your pocketbook. However, you are allowed to cheat a bit when you are feeling sick and contagious. Splurge on disposable coffee and tea mugs, disposable silverware, and paper plates. This will allow you to throw away your used items to minimize your colleagues' exposure to your infection."
