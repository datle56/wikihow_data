      "content": "Add 1/3 cup of mayonnaise to the egg bowl. As shocking as it may seem, mayonnaise is a perfect substitute for milk when making cornbread for the lactose intolerant. You won't really notice the difference in taste in the cornbread; it's mainly for holding your cornbread together so it doesn't crumble apart. It's a myth that all mayonnaise contains milk/aged milk, but some brands will have milk added to it. Pay close attention to the ingredients listed on the mayonnaise bottle."

Make sure that the pan you are using is \"Deep Dish\" as if you were about to bake a layer of cake. Using thin cookie sheets may result in your cornbread cooking entirely too fast thus breaking apart, and then you'll have burnt cornbread cookie-looking things. That doesn't sound tasty, right?

[5] X Research source This baking process may take 20 minutes maximum. Always remember to constantly check on your food because it will cook fast meaning it may also burn fast. Different oven racks may make the cooking time a few minutes longer or a few minutes shorter, always keep a watchful eye on the mix."
