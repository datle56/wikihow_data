      "content": "Fill a fireproof bowl with salt, nettles, and cloves. Fill the bowl with at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of kosher or sea salt. Spoon dried nettles around the edges, and stick five cloves equidistant from each other into the salt, like the points of a star."

      "title": "Write your intentions on a small, blank piece of paper.",
      "content": "Write your intentions on a small, blank piece of paper. Ask the universe to balance out the person’s life. Karma is entirely personal, and can’t be affected by others. If you ask for the person to suffer for what they did, you’ll be creating new negative energy (which could come back as your own bad karma!). Consider writing something like: “[Person] learns the lesson associated with their actions,” or “[Person]’s life is swiftly balanced.”"

      "title": "Carve the person’s name into a candle and wrap the spell around it.",
      "content": "Carve the person’s name into a candle and wrap the spell around it. Use a new, small, black candle , and tie the spell on with twine. Drip an oil of your choosing on the candle, and then sprinkle it with cayenne pepper. Cayenne heats things up a little and gets the spell moving faster. If you’re worried about your own karma, you can also use a purple candle. In candle magic, purple is associated with psychic abilities and cleansing of bad karma. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the candle into the salt, light it, and let it burn down entirely.",
      "content": "Put the candle into the salt, light it, and let it burn down entirely. Watch the flame as the candle burns, and think about your intentions. Keep them totally positive and don’t wish harm on the other person, you’re just asking the universe to speed up a little, not to hurt someone. [2] X Research source Concentrate on your intentions the entire time. Candle magic is thought to work by focusing the energy of your thought on the flame, which broadcasts it to the universe."

      "content": "Call upon the Norse god Forseti when you’ve been wronged. Forseti is a minor Norse god who was said to settle disputes and create laws. [3] X Research source Basically, he’s the judge-god. When you’re absolutely sure you’re in the right and someone else is in the wrong, call upon his aid. This spell is often used for legal issues—if someone has committed violence with no legal consequences, use this spell."

    {
      "title": "Send Forseti your gratitude and present the situation to him.",
      "content": "Send Forseti your gratitude and present the situation to him. Feel a warm light of gratitude and truth grow inside of you, then offer it to Forseti. Once you feel his presence, either picture what’s happening in your mind, or tell him through words. Include how you feel about the situation as you project it to him."

      "title": "Ask Forseti to bring you the justice you deserve.",

Once justice has been served, thank Forseti and send him more gratitude in the form of spiritual light. By calling in a neutral third party, you reduce your chances of creating any bad karma for yourself."

      "content": "Anoint a candle with oil, then roll it in pepper and oregano. Rub oil over the entire candle —you can use any oil you’d like, even cooking oil. [4] X Research source Cover the oil in black pepper and oregano, then place it in a candle holder . Oregano is thought to aid in protection and letting things go, and black pepper is thought to clear blocked energy and relieve negative emotions. If you think that you’ve been cursed by this person, burn bay leaves during the spell, as well. Use a black or white candle."

      "title": "Lay down a small mirror and put the candle on top of it.",
      "content": "Lay down a small mirror and put the candle on top of it. Light the candle and say this incantation: Return to your source Leave me in peace If the path is blocked The magic will cease. [5] X Research source This spell takes into account the possibility that the person has magical protections around them. By doing a reflection spell (instead of a hex) you can confidently send negative energy back to someone without creating more of it yourself."

It was never even there.Now, it dissolves completely, disappears, and returns to the nothingness from whence it came, now and forever, in every direction of time.

      "title": "Karma is the law of cause and effect.",
      "content": "Karma is the law of cause and effect. According to psychic Kari Samuels, karma is the balancing aspect of the universe: “Instead of looking at things as bad karma…look at it [as] how have you tipped the scales of balance in your life.” Because of this, intention is very important, as, as Samuels says, you’re trying to “balance your actions so that they have more positive outcomes.”"

    {
      "title": "Negative feelings towards yourself or others can create karma.",
      "content": "Negative feelings towards yourself or others can create karma. Because of this, working through those feelings can cleanse your karma, and “releas[e] [you] from that karmic connection.” When you overcome that connection, old patterns from your life fall away. You may find yourself constantly dating people who live far away from you—that could be a karmic pattern. By focusing on finding someone close to you, you can break that pattern."

      "title": "People’s karma can only be affected by themselves.",
      "content": "People’s karma can only be affected by themselves. Since karma is a balancing act of your own actions, no one else can change your karma…and you can’t change anyone else’s karma, either."

    {
      "title": "Reduce bad karma by forgiving people.",
      "content": "Reduce bad karma by forgiving people. One of the ways you gain negative karma is by trying to get back at people. Any mean-spirited thought or action eventually comes back to you. To keep your own karma clear, forgive people who have wronged you. Jennifer McVey notes that “people are not their actions.” By removing “personal intent” from a situation and considering the other person’s circumstances “you don’t have to work [on] forgiving that person…[when] you understand it at every level of view, you just let it go.”"
