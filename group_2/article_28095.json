      "content": "Roll the piece of paper into a ball. Roll the paper into a ball by grabbing it between the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of both hands. Push all your fingers together with the paper in the middle. Keep doing that until the piece of paper is a small ball."

      "title": "Put the paper ball in your mouth.",
      "content": "Put the paper ball in your mouth. If you don’t have much spit in your mouth, now is a good time to take a drink. You want to make sure you have enough spit to soak your spitball completely. Sometimes it helps to chew on it a little to make sure the spit covers the whole thing. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Get ready to launch.",
      "content": "Get ready to launch. Now that you’ve soaked your spitball, you can launch it with your weapon of choice. If you’re spitting it from your mouth or blowing it through a straw you don’t need to remove it from your mouth. Just launch. If your weapon is to throw it, take it out of your mouth first. Once you’ve soaked your spitball with spit, you can take it out of your mouth and launch."

      "content": "Tear two pieces of paper into smaller squares. Your smaller pieces don’t have to be an exact size, but keep in mind you’ll be putting more than one layer onto your spitballs so make two sizes (one large enough to fit over a smaller ball)."

      "content": "Roll your smaller pieces into little balls. To do this, grab the paper between your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Squeeze your fingers together with the paper in the middle. Keep doing that until the piece of paper is a small ball."

      "content": "Grab another piece of paper and wrap it around your spitball. Make sure you grab one of the larger pieces you ripped from your two pieces of paper. Wrap it around your soaked spitball. Push down with your fingers until the spitball becomes a larger ball."

      "title": "Take another drink.",

      "content": "Take it out of your mouth. Once you’ve soaked your spitball, take it out of your mouth and get ready to either throw it with your fingers, or flick it with your fingers or a ruler. It should be big enough to fly pretty far."

    {
      "title": "Throw it with your fingers.",
      "content": "Throw it with your fingers. This method works with either single-layered or multi-layered spitballs. Multi-layered spitballs will usually travel farther. Put the spitball between your thumb and middle finger, pull your arm back, aim, and throw."

    {
      "title": "Spit it out of your mouth.",
      "content": "Spit it out of your mouth. This method works best with single-layered spitballs because they’re easier to spit out. Place the spitball between your lips, take in a deep breath, and blow as hard as you can. The spitball should pop out from between your lips, straight at your target. You might need to be standing close to your target for this launching method to work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow it through a straw.",
      "content": "Blow it through a straw. This is another method that works best with single-layered spitballs because they fit better in a straw. You can also use a pen for this method. [2] X Research source Put your spitball inside of a straw, pushing it in as far as you can. Take a deep breath and put your mouth on the straw so no air can get in. Blow as hard as you can. Your spitball should pop out of the other side of the straw, right at your target."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flick it with your fingers, or a ruler.",
      "content": "Flick it with your fingers, or a ruler. This method works best with multi-layered spitballs because you get more velocity. Curl your middle finger into your thumb to form a circle, so that the nail of your finger is touching your thumb. Press them together so there is tension between your fingers. Put the spitball in the spot where your middle finger meets your thumb. Right between them, on the outside of your middle finger. Push your middle finger out, away from your thumb. This should make the spitball fling up and out, toward your target."
