      "title": "Make sure you have your ID and wallet.",
      "content": "Make sure you have your ID and wallet. You’ll need to provide identification in order to enter a strip club. You’ll also need to have cash for tipping. Make sure you have your wallet with your ID so you’re able to get into the club, tip, purchase drinks, and pay for parking, if necessary. [1] X Research source Most strip clubs have ATMs inside, but they may charge you to use them. Pull out any cash that you think you’ll need ahead of time so you don’t need to pay to use the ATM."

      "content": "Check to see if the club has a dress code by asking the bouncer. Some strip clubs will have specific policies regarding what you can wear into the club. For example, tank tops, large gold chains, or white shoes could be prohibited. [2] X Research source A polo and jeans are usually fine to wear, but some clubs may have a different dress code."

    {
      "title": "Ask the bouncer if there is a cover charge.",
      "content": "Ask the bouncer if there is a cover charge. Before you try to walk into a strip club, you need to know if you need to pay a charge to enter. Ask the bouncer or security person working the front door if there’s a cover charge or a drink minimum for you to enter the club. [3] X Research source You may need to pay the cover charge in cash only, so be sure to have at least $20 in cash on hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show your ID to the bouncer.",
      "content": "Show your ID to the bouncer. Near the entrance of the strip club will be a bouncer who is monitoring who comes and goes. Present your ID to them so they can make sure you’re old enough to enter. If the strip club has a cover charge, pay the bouncer to let you in. [4] X Research source You can use a driver’s license, official government ID, or even a passport to provide identification to the bouncer."

      "title": "Order a drink at the bar when you get into the club.",
      "content": "Order a drink at the bar when you get into the club. The drinks at strip clubs are often overpriced but are how the club makes much of its money because the dancers are often contract employees. Even if you’re not drinking alcohol, when you enter the club, head to the bar and order a drink to show that you plan to be a good customer. [5] X Research source If you don’t plan to drink alcohol, order a non-alcoholic cocktail or mocktail like a cranberry juice with club soda and a lime or a virgin Shirley Temple. Many strip clubs have a drink minimum or require that you order a drink every 30 minutes in order to stay in the club."

    {
      "title": "Find a seating area for you and your group.",
      "content": "Find a seating area for you and your group. After you’ve ordered a drink, look for a table or a seating area where you can relax. Don’t sit next to the stage unless you plan to continuously tip the dancers on stage. [6] X Research source Make sure everyone in your group knows where your table or seating area is so they can find you if they get separated due to a private dance or a trip to the bar."

    {
      "title": "Check for posted rules of conduct.",
      "content": "Check for posted rules of conduct. The rules and etiquette of strip clubs can vary widely, especially in regards to things like tipping and touching. Look for a posted sign on the wall that lists the rules of the club or ask a staff member so you don’t risk being kicked out for breaking a rule. [7] X Research source For example, in New Jersey, you can’t tip strippers while they’re on stage. You’re supposed to tip them afterward."

      "title": "Be okay with saying “no” to a stripper or your friends.",
      "content": "Be okay with saying “no” to a stripper or your friends. If you aren’t comfortable, aren’t in the vibe yet, hesitant to spend money on a private dance, or you don’t want to buy a dancer a drink, it’s okay to say no. Don’t make up an excuse or feel pressured to give in. [8] X Research source You don’t have to do anything that you don’t want to do. Don’t feel the need to give in to peer pressure if your friends or family try to get you to do something that you’re not comfortable with. When declining, do not be rude (or violent) or ignore strippers or waitresses. Politely decline (i.e. “No, thank you” or “I’m good for now thanks”)."

      "title": "Ask the price before you agree to anything.",
      "content": "Ask the price before you agree to anything. To avoid getting suckered into expensive dances, drinks, or promotions, it’s important that you directly ask the price of a service beforehand. Don’t wait until after a private dance to discuss the price or you could be overcharged. [9] X Research source For example, if a dancer offers to give you a private dance in a VIP room, you can ask something like, “That sounds fun! How much would that cost?”"

      "content": "Respect the dancers, bouncers, and bartenders. Strippers are human beings who deserve respect just like anybody else. Don’t be rude, dismissive, or insulting to anybody that works at the strip club. [10] X Research source Respect the wishes and boundaries of the dancers. If going to the VIP room, always ask where you can touch them. If they say they’re uncomfortable with something, don’t get pushy or upset. Don’t ask for a dancer’s phone number or out on a date. Think of strip teasing and lap dancing as performance art. If a dancer denies your request or walks away from you, don’t be offended or chase after them. Many dancers enjoy their jobs at a strip club. Don’t try to “save” them or get them to leave their job."

      "content": "Don’t ask the dancers for their real names. Most dancers use aliases that they’ve developed for the strip club for privacy reasons. Don’t be rude and insist on getting their names or information about their lives outside of the strip club. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid drinking too much alcohol.",
      "content": "Avoid drinking too much alcohol. Getting wasted is never a good look, even at a strip club where drinks are served and you’re encouraged to let a little loose. It’s also risky to get so drunk that you don’t know where you are or you make poor decisions and spend too much money. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Park in a secure location if you drive. Some strip clubs will have a private parking lot that is monitored by security. If you’re going to a strip club at night, make sure you park somewhere nearby and visible so you can return to your car safely. [13] X Research source Criminals may believe that you have cash on you if you’re leaving a strip club. Be safe and park somewhere visible and near the bouncers or security of the strip club."

Because they’re at a strip club, people will assume that he has cash on him and try to take advantage of him. He could end up getting robbed as well."
