      "content": "Decide what kind of straps you want. Different straps will require different amounts of fabric, so before buying your fabric you will want to figure out what kind of straps you want to sew on. [1] X Research source The most common strap type is a straight back strap, where the straps are attached to the front and go straight over your shoulders, where they attach to the back of your dress. Another strap type is a cross back strap, where the straps start in the front on one side and then cross in the back and are attached to the other side of the dress in the back. The third basic type of strap is the halter strap, which attach at the front of your dress, go up your shoulders and tie behind your neck."

      "content": "Put on your dress. Once you decide what straps you want, you will need to put on your dress to get accurate measurements for your straps. You also need a flexible measuring tape to take the measurements for your straps. The measuring tape will mimic the straps of your dress so you can see how much fabric you will need.

      "title": "Pin one end of the measuring tape at the neckline of your dress.",
      "content": "Pin one end of the measuring tape at the neckline of your dress. Wearing your dress, pin one end of the measuring tape where you would want your strap to start in the front of your dress. Both straps will be the same length, so it doesn’t matter which side you are measuring from. [3] X Research source Make sure you are using the beginning of the measuring tape, the end of the tape that starts at zero. This will make measuring a lot easier."

      "title": "Swing the measuring tape over your shoulder.",
      "content": "Swing the measuring tape over your shoulder. With the end of the measuring tape pinned in the front, put the other end of the tape over your shoulder. Reach back with your arm and pin or hold the measuring tape to where you would want the strap to attach to the back. [4] X Research source If you chose a straight backstrap, the measuring tape should be swung over the same shoulder. If you chose a cross back strap, the measuring tape should go over your shoulder and go diagonally across your back. If you chose a halter neck, the measuring tape should go up your front to the back of your neck."

      "content": "Note the measurement. Go to a mirror, still with the measuring tape pinned in the back or held in place with your hand. With your back to the mirror, look over your shoulder. You should be able to see where the measuring tape in the back is being held in place. Take note of the number in inches where the strap should end.

      "title": "Add to this number.",
      "content": "Add to this number. You will want to make the length of fabric you purchase a little more than the actual measurement of the measuring tape. This gives you some leeway when you are making the straps. [6] X Research source For straight back and crossback straps, add four inches to the number. For instance, if your strap was 16 inches (40.6 cm), add four inches onto this so the final measurement is 20 inches. For halter straps, add about 12 inches (30 cm) on to this number. You will need enough fabric to be able to make a tie in the back, so you will need more excess fabric."

After you have figured out the measurements for the straps, you will need to decide what fabric to use for your straps. You will want the straps of your dress to look like they match your dress. The easiest way to do this is to find a fabric the same colour as your dress. [7] X Research source Most fabric at stores like Jo-Ann Fabrics have fabrics organised by colour. You may want to bring your dress along with you if you are matching the colour of the strap to the dress. You can also take fabric from the bottom of the dress to use as your straps.

Pick one of the more dominant colours in the dress and find fabric that matches that colour. [9] X Research source For instance, if your dress is beige with yellow flowers and green leaves, try to find fabric that is either beige or yellow, depending on what you prefer. Even though the straps aren’t patterned, matching the fabric to the main colour in the dress will make the straps look like they belong on the dress."

      "content": "Find a fabric that complements, not matches, your dress. If you don't want your straps to match your dress exactly, you could also find a fabric that looks good with it, even if it's not the same colour. For example, if your dress is a pastel yellow, you could find fabric in a pastel green that would look good with your dress colour. More extreme contrasts in color and texture may be more suitable for casual rather than formal dresses."

      "content": "Make sure the material of the fabric suits the material of the dress. If the materials look mismatched, the straps will look out of place. The easiest way to do this is to match the fabric of the straps to the fabric of the dress. For instance, if you are wearing a silk dress, find a silk fabric for the straps. You can also pick fabric for the straps that adds a decorative element to the dress. For instance, you can use a lacy or differently-textured fabric to liven up a basic dress."

You need to multiply the number because you will be folding the fabric in half width-wise and sewing it to create your strap.

[15] X Research source For instance, say you calculated that you needed 20 inches (50.8 cm) of length for your strap and 1¼ inches of thickness. If you got a yard of fabric, cut a 20x1¼ inches rectangle. This will be the material you will use to make your strap."

This way you won't be able to see the stitching when you are wearing the dress. If your dress does not have lining, make sure to use thread that matches the color of the straps to make the stitching less noticeable. [25] X Research source Hand-stitch vertically so that the two inches of strap fabric is stitched against the dress. Then stitch horizontally about ¼ inch from where the straps hit the neckline. If you are sewing halter straps, this is the final step. Halter straps tie at the neck, so you do not need to sew the straps in the back."
