While you might have some 3% hydrogen peroxide in your medicine cabinet, you can also go to a beauty supply store to find 6% as it usually is not readily available at grocery stores or drug stores. Beauty supply stores will sell 6% hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agent.

Allow them to measure out the yeast and mix in the correct amount of water, heated to 105–110 °F (41–43 °C). Have your little one stir it to get out all the clumps.

Do not let your kids handle the hydrogen peroxide unless you think they are old enough. [3] X Research source If your child is too young, have them squeeze the dish soap and food coloring into the bottle. You can also add glitter to make it more fun. Make sure the glitter is plastic and not metal-based because peroxide should not be used with metal. Stir the mixture yourself or have your child do it if old enough.

You can allow your child to pour the yeast, but if they are young, stay within arm’s distance to ensure the bottle doesn’t spill onto them. Use a short bottle with a wide base for stability. Make sure the neck is narrow to increase the effect. [4] X Research source The fungi in the yeast immediately cause the hydrogen peroxide to decompose and strip off an extra oxygen molecule. The yeast acts as a catalyst as it causes the hydrogen peroxide molecule to release an oxygen molecule. The stripped off oxygen molecule takes the form of a gas and once it hits the soap it creates fluffy foam bubbles, while the rest stays as water. The gas looks for an escape route and the foam “toothpaste” gushes out of the bottle. [5] X Research source Make sure the yeast and hydrogen peroxide are mixed well for optimum effect."
