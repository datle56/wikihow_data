Check to see if the blooms have any wilted or dried-up petals, which may indicate that the roses aren’t as fresh as you’d like. While a red rose bouquet is traditional, roses come in many beautiful colors, like white, pink, orange, and yellow. You can even dye roses to match your preferred shade or the favorite color of the person you’re gifting them to."

Move the flowers around and experiment with different layouts and orientations until you find one that you like. If you plan to add more than just roses to your bouquet, choose a variety of flower types that differ in shape, size, and color. [4] X Research source Include flowers that have different textures and petal textures to create a more dynamic look for your bouquet. Just make sure that the shades of each flower complement the others and create a harmonious color palette. Carnations in the same color as your roses can be a great addition to make the bouquet seem larger at an affordable price. Add filler greens and foliage to create a more natural background. Eucalyptus, fern, and ivy are all popular floral fillers. If you want to add even more dimension to your rose bouquet, cut the stems of your flowers to different lengths to create more depth while arranging them (you can make the stems a uniform length later on)."

If the bouquet won’t be in a vase for a few hours, spritz it occasionally with water to keep it fresh. To add a final decorative touch, add a pretty bow to the ribbon wrapped around the stems. Also, consider attaching a personal note, small keyring, or sentimental trinket to the bouquet."

[5] X Research source In a loose rose bouquet, reflexing the roses adds to the natural and romantic look of the arrangement. To reflex your roses, start by choosing roses that are already fully open and have petals that are slightly curled outward, which will make them easier to reflex. Then, gently remove the outermost layer of petals (aka the guard petals) and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut each stem at a 45-degree angle. Find the base of the rose where the outer petals meet the stem. Gently grip the first petal at the base of the flower and bend it back toward the stem. [6] X Research source Work your way around the base of the flower and repeat this step with each petal. Avoid forcing the petals backward, which may cause them to tear. Work your up the flower one layer at a time, continuing to gently bend each petal backward until you reach the tip of the rose. Blow firmly on the center of the flower to encourage a beautiful and billowing center, thereby finishing your reflexed flower."

Start at the top of the holder’s “stem” and wind the floral tape around. Pull the tape taut as you roll the tape all the way down to the bottom of the bouquet holder’s handle, then work your way back up to the head. If your bouquet holder doesn’t have notches, you can simply wrap the tape around the base of the head and make sure the adhesive is sticking properly. If your holder has “notches” around the base of its head, wrap the tape around each notch to secure it in place, then wrap around the underside of the head until all the plastic is covered. You can leave the bouquet holder as is, or you can hot glue natural leaves or greenery to the underside of the bouquet holder to further camouflage it. For a classic rose bouquet, it’s best to use a straight-handle bouquet holder . Slanted holders are typically reserved for cascading bouquets. [10] X Research source"

Replace its water source daily with lukewarm water and spritz over the blooms with spring water. On the wedding day itself, store the flowers in a cool room until the last possible moment. Before taking them out, spritz the undersides of the petals and leaves with a bit of hairspray to keep them looking fresher for longer. Keep spritzing the roses with spring water throughout the wedding itself until the bouquet is no longer needed. The best day to make your wedding bouquet is the day before the wedding. However, you can make the bouquet up to 5-7 days ahead of time as long as you keep it fresh with the preceding tips."

[19] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021. Cut the stems of your roses down to 2 ⁄ 3 cm (6.7 mm) and remove any thorns, leaves, or wilted petals. Cut one 5 cm (50 mm) segment of floral wire for every rose that you have, then wrap the wire around each stem until secure. Bend any excess wire downwards and wrap floral tape around the sharp edges. Start arranging your floral corsage by laying down a layer of flat green leaves, then a layer of greenery (e.g., rosemary, eucalyptus, ivy), then a layer of roses (or another statement flower). Add some filler flowers (e.g., gypsophila, lavender, stephanotis) and position them in a way that you’d want them to sit on a wrist. Use floral tape to secure all of your stems together, then wrap a thin piece of ribbon around the stems so it’s covering the tape. Cut another long piece of ribbon and attach the center of it to your arrangement. Place the arrangement on your wrist and wrap the ribbon around your wrist to secure it with a bow. “If you’re making your corsage one day ahead of time,” Cho advises, “be sure to mist the corsage with water spray, cover it with a paper towel, and place it inside of an airtight container or Tupperware.” [20] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021."

[21] X Research source Cut the spiral out along its lines, then roll the paper according to the spiral shape. Start at the narrow end and tightly roll the paper toward its center. Once you reach the center of the spiral, press it firmly over the base of the rolled paper to create the bottom of the rose. Slowly release pressure on the rose to make it larger, if desired.

[22] X Research source Apply another dot of hot glue on top of the fold, then fold the folded part of the ribbon again to create a triangle—mimicking the center part of a rose. Continue this technique while rolling the ribbon inward. As you work your way around, continue applying small dots of hot glue every 2 inches (5.1 cm) to make sure the folds stay together. Once you’ve run out of material, glue any excess ribbon to the bottom of your rose.
