      "content": "Find a power supply for your computer. The power supply that you buy depends on the computer's motherboard and housing size, meaning that you'll need to research your motherboard model to see which power supplies will fit. [1] X Research source You can usually find power supplies in tech departments or stores, as well as in online shops like Amazon and eBay. Make sure that you buy a power supply that is optimized for your region. Power supplies for European markets use different voltage settings than the ones used in North American markets."

You'll need at least one screwdriver (typically a Phillips head) to open the CPU housing, which is usually the right-hand side of the CPU box when looking at the back of the box. You may need a different screwdriver for your power supply as wellâ€”look at the screws that came with the power supply to determine whether or not this is the case."

      "content": "Set the power supply's voltage switch. If there's a voltage switch on the power supply, switch it to the 110v or 115v setting. This will ensure that your power supply provides ample power without damaging the components to which it's connected. Not all power supplies have voltage switches, and those that do normally have the switch set to the standard of the region for which they were purchased."

      "title": "Find the power supply's intended location.",
      "content": "Find the power supply's intended location. Power supply units (PSUs) typically sit at the top of the case; this is why the computer's power cable usually plugs into the top-back section of the case. Refer to your computer's instruction manual for the proper placement of the power supply unit, or look for a rectangular cut-out on the back of the case. If you're removing an old power supply, look for a power plug on the back of the case to find the power supply."

      "content": "Insert the power supply. The power supply should have a distinct \"back\" with plugs and a fan, as well as a \"bottom\" with a fan on it. The \"back\" should face the back of the case, while the \"bottom\" should face the internal part of the case.

Find the main power cable on the power supply (usually the one with the largest plug) and attach it to the long, rectangular port on the motherboard, then attach the secondary power cable to the motherboard.

The plug used to attach the power supply to the motherboard is usually a 20- or 24-pin connector."
