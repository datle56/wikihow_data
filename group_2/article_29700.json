      "content": "Cup your hands at a distance around the wheel. You may notice the wheel moving, but scientists will tell you that the warmth of your hands causes the air on that side of the wheel to heat up; since heat rises, the warm air goes up, creating an upward current that spins the psi wheel. Try other approaches that can't be discounted as caused by heat. You don't even need to use your hands."

      "title": "Concentrate on moving the wheel; visualize energy flowing from your body, out of your hand, and pushing the wheel.",
      "content": "Concentrate on moving the wheel; visualize energy flowing from your body, out of your hand, and pushing the wheel. Does it work better when you do that? If so, you might want to put that psychic energy to work and make a psi ball or use dowsing rods ."
