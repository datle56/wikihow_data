      "content": "Recognize what the acts of the sinful nature are: \"Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; Idolatry and witchcraft; Hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; Drunkenness, orgies, and the like.\" (Galatians 5:19,20). Paul groups these sins together because they are the basic fruits of the sinful nature. Paul says \"if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeed of the body, you will live.\" If we put to death all of these acts of our sinful nature we will live, but the choice is ours. We can chose to walk in the flesh or in the Spirit as Christians."

We will live out the fruit of the spirit rather than the misdeed of our flesh."
