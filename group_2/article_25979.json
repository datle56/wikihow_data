      "title": "Move your candle to a good area.",
      "content": "Move your candle to a good area. You should put your candle on a surface that's heat resistant, such as stone. That way, you won't risk catching the surface on fire. In addition, make sure the candle is in an area without drafts, as drafts can push the flame out from the candle, causing a fire. It's also a good idea to remove anything flammable near the candle, such as papers, fabric, or dried floral decorations. Make sure the candle is at least a foot from curtains."

    {
      "title": "Pull out a match.",
      "content": "Pull out a match. You can use regular-sized matches if the candle isn't too deep. If it is, you may need a fireplace match. Hold the end of the match between your finger-tips, so it has plenty of room to burn. [1] X Research source If the candle is too big, you can also use a piece of spaghetti or fettuccine. [2] X Research source If you don't have matches, you can use a toothpick, as well, but you'll need to move more quickly as the flame can move faster."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim the wick.",
      "content": "Trim the wick. If the wick is too long, it presents a potential hazard. The wick should be about 1/8th of an inch long before burning. You can use scissors or a wick trimmer to cut it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light the match.",
      "content": "Light the match. Strike the match on the side of the box to light it. If you're using a piece of spaghetti, you can light it from the match. [3] X Research source If you don't have a match or lighter, you can use a gas stove to light it from the flame. You can also light a toothpick this way. [4] X Research source You also press the end of the spaghetti against the heating element in a toaster or even the oven to light it. Just be sure to be extra careful not to touch any of the hot parts yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the candle sideways.",
      "content": "Turn the candle sideways. Turning the candle sideways helps keep you from getting burned. Since flames burn upwards, if you try to put your hand down in the candle, the flame is coming up towards your hand. [5] X Research source When the candle is sideways, you can stick the match in sideways, and the flame will go up towards the side of the candle instead of your hand. [6] X Research source While you don't want to move too slowly, as a flame goes down a match quickly, you also don't want to jerk too quickly and drop the match. Move in at a steady pace."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the flame to the wick.",
      "content": "Hold the flame to the wick. Once you've got the match or spaghetti in the candle, hold the flame up to the wick sticking out. Watch to see when the wick ignites. When it does, remove your hand, and blow out the spaghetti or match. Set the candle back upright. For extra safety, run some water on the match or spaghetti before throwing it in the trash. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stay with the candle.",
      "content": "Stay with the candle. While the candle is lit, it's important to stay with it. If you leave it unattended, you run the risk of catching something on fire."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure your candle is in a good place.",
      "content": "Make sure your candle is in a good place. Put on something heat resistant, so it doesn't catch the area on fire. Also, remove anything flammable from the area, such as paper. In addition, make sure your candle isn't too near curtains or anything else that could blow into it. Also, feel for drafts, as drafts can blow the flame to something flammable."

    {
      "title": "Cut the wick.",
      "content": "Cut the wick. Your wick should be about 1/8th of an inch long. Cut it back to this height, as a long wick can be a safety issue. If you don't have a wick trimmer, just use scissors."

      "title": "Get out your barbecue lighter.",
      "content": "Get out your barbecue lighter. These lighters are not cigarette lighters. They have a long barrel, meant for lighting a barbecue grill. You can find these in the barbecue section, but you'll also find them with other lighters. [8] X Research source You can use a cigarette lighter on a shallow candle, but it won't work well on a deeper candle, as you're likely to burn yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt the candle a bit.",
      "content": "Tilt the candle a bit. With a longer barrel, you probably won't need to turn it completely sideways, but tilting it can help you light it. [9] X Research source Hold the candle in your non-dominant hand and the lighter in your dominant hand. If the candle is short enough to use a cigarette lighter, you won't need to tilt it much at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flick the lighter on.",
      "content": "Flick the lighter on. Adjust the flame height by moving the button on the side or top. Turn it towards the \"-\" to make the flame smaller. Also, most lighters have a safety that you need to push before you squeeze the trigger. Hold it down while you squeeze the trigger. [10] X Research source Squeeze the trigger slowly, as the trigger starts the fuel. If you go too quickly, it won't reach the spark when it should to create a flame, meaning it may seem like it's not working. [11] X Research source You need to hold the trigger down to keep the flame going. With a cigarette lighter, you usually need to turn the wheel before you can push the button. It's a move you do in one fell swoop with your thumb."

    {
      "title": "Hold the lighter to the wick.",
      "content": "Hold the lighter to the wick. Put the flame in the candle. Let the flame go against the tip of the wick. Watch to see when it ignites, then pull the lighter away. Let go of the trigger to put the flame out, and set the candle upright on the surface. Always pay attention to your burning candle. Don't leave it alone, as it can easily be blown into something flammable. You could have a fire before you know it."

    {
      "title": "Don't trim the wick the first time.",
      "content": "Don't trim the wick the first time. Some people say that trimming the wick the first time you use a candle causes it to burn unevenly. A larger flame can help start the wax melting properly. [12] X Research source However, always supervise the burn carefully."

    {
      "title": "Let it burn enough the first time.",
      "content": "Let it burn enough the first time. Your candle should burn for an hour for every inch it is in diameter, at least for the first time. Therefore, if you measure four inches across the top of the candle, that means it needs to burn for four hours. The purpose is that you want to make sure the whole top layer of the candle melts. If it doesn't, you'll get a tunneling effect as the candle burns down. In other words, it will just melt down the center of the candle, instead of melting the whole candle. Doing it this way will help you burn your candle more evenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't burn it for short stretches.",
      "content": "Don't burn it for short stretches. To prevent tunneling after you burn it the first time, you should burn it for longer stretches at a time rather than shorter. Shorter stretches won't melt the wax all the way to the edges like you want. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use the foil trick.",
      "content": "Use the foil trick. Take a piece of foil folded over several times, and wrap it around the top of the candle. Tip it slightly over the top of the candle, forming a small lip. [14] X Research source You can do it while the candle is light, though the top will be hot. Otherwise, light it after you put the foil on. [15] X Research source This trick helps to melt the wax more evenly. You can get special lids for candles that achieve the same purpose. [16] X Research source"
