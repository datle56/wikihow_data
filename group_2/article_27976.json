Think about what you're going to do after school or where you'd travel in the world if you could go anywhere. Think about different versions of your favorite characters. Make-believe you can fly or have some other superpower. Just let your mind wander, and take a little break. When you come back, you'll realize more time has passed than you would have expected. [1] X Research source Don't let your imagination wander too far. Try to refocus on class material by incorporating it into your flights of fantasy. For example, if you're bored in math class, try to include the day's lesson in a fantasy about robots to keep you grounded and learning. Do these robots battle each other using the quadratic equation?"

As long as your teacher doesn't look too closely at what the words are, it will definitely look like you're taking notes. Write a journal entry or write a note to your best friend.

That means you need to focus on writing down the main ideas. Your teacher should help you with this by emphasizing what's most important a few times. They may even say what you should be writing down. [13] X Research source Additionally, pay attention to what your teacher writes on the board or projector. You know those ideas are important."

Maybe think about memories or write your notes in your own words. If you're just writing it exactly as the teacher says it, you may not be actually taking it in. Plus, you're not engaging your brain, so you're more likely to get bored. However, if you try to put it in your own words, you'll be more engaged and learn more at the same time.

However, when you break your time up into smaller pieces, it may seem to go faster as get through smaller chunks. Of course, you're just doing this in your head, but this little mind game can make it seem like you're getting through school faster. For instance, you could break up periods into \"starting class,\" \"getting information,\" \"taking notes,\" \"getting the homework assignment,\" and \"preparing to leave.\" You could even write these sections in your notebook and cross them off as you get through them. Alternatively, you could do specified chunks of time, such as the first 15 minutes, the second 15 minutes, and so on. This is very effective when combined with distractions that will make each 15-minute period go by quickly."

Try coming after school. You could say something like, \"Hi, Mrs. Jones. I came here to ask you to consider a favor. I know the class is already short, but I was wondering if maybe we could take a short stretch break in the middle. Moving around a little can really help me focus better, and I think other students might feel the same. I completely understand if you don't want to do it, but I'd appreciate it if you thought about it.\""
