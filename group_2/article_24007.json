Place a spacer behind it to ensure that it’s in the correct location. Make sure the brackets are positioned so that the latches hinge at the top of the bracket and open out.

      "content": "Create starter holes to make drilling easier. Once you have a bracket held in the position you want it in, hold a screw against one of the holes on the side of the bracket. Tap the screw gently with a hammer to create a starter hole. Do this again on another one of the holes located on the side of the bracket. Repeat this process on the other side of the window where the other bracket is located. [3] X Research source"

Make sure that your hand that’s holding the bracket is as far away from the screw as possible, and then use a power drill to drill the screw in.

      "content": "Install support brackets if you have a big set of blinds. Larger sets of blinds often have a support bracket that should be located at the top center of the window. If this came with your set of blinds, install it after your mounting brackets are in place. This should help keep the middle of your blinds from sagging. [5] X Research source"

Make sure to position these evenly on the headrail and avoid placing them anywhere where they may interfere with mechanisms inside of the top of the blinds.
