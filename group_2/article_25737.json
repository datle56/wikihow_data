      "title": "Understand the style.",
      "content": "Understand the style. The contemporary ninja varies from the classic perception portrayed by movies. The formal gown worn by the ninja is a navy blue gown with a covered face. In action, a ninja acts more like a chameleon than a warrior. There are many articles that tell you ninja clothes (shinobi shozoku) should be tight-fitting to avoid making noise. The clothes should instead fit your body in a loose style."

      "title": "Dress for stealth.",
      "content": "Dress for stealth. You will need clothes that fit the environment around you. The idea of camouflage is to distort your shape so you won’t be easily identified. Matching the people around you has become important for the modern ninja. This sometimes means studying the people around you and being able to easily adapt. Being unnoticed is important for a ninja. Your nightclothes should be dark blue and comfortable. Consider wearing a keikogi, a martial arts training top, and a hakama, or loose fitting formal pants. The bottom parts of your hakama should be tucked into your tabi (ninja boots) and tied with a string for each foot. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use everyday clothes.",
      "content": "Use everyday clothes. You don't need to spend a lot of money at a specialty store for the authentic look. A traditional wardrobe doesn't create a ninja.

The lower you are, the less chance they'll see you. When ascending stairs, if they are creaky, walk on the side of them, closest to the wall."
