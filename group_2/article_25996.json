      "content": "Get a propane heater that's the right size for what you need it for. Generally, the bigger the propane heater, the more heat and carbon monoxide it'll make. Use the British Thermal Unit (BTU) measurement on the side of the propane heater to determine which size is best for you. BTUs measure energy. A single BTU is the same as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 millilitre (0.034 fl oz) of water 1 °F (−17 °C). [1] X Research source Small propane heaters can create up to 5000 BTUs in the space of an hour. These heaters are perfect for camping and other outdoor activities. Large propane heaters emit between 10,000 and 45,000 BTUs in 1 hour. Larger heaters are better for heating large warehouses or building sites."

      "content": "Buy a propane heater with plenty of safety features. As mentioned above, propane heaters are dangerous if you don't use them properly. Most of these machines are built with safeguards. The most vital safety feature is an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) alert. Heaters with this feature will sound an alarm when oxygen levels start to get low. Look for other safety features for your heater too, such as: Heat-resistant burners Rain- and wind-resistant shields Lightweight body for easy handling Manual shut-off options"

      "title": "Use the heater outdoors.",
      "content": "Use the heater outdoors. Propane heaters are dangerous indoors because there's not enough oxygen available to dilute the carbon monoxide. Outside, propane heaters are very safe to use because of how much oxygen is available. You should only use the heater indoors in a large space with plenty of air and ventilation. Avoid using the propane heater in a small, enclosed space like a tent or a bedroom."

      "title": "Avoid falling asleep with the propane heater on.",
      "content": "Avoid falling asleep with the propane heater on. If you're in a well ventilated or spacious room and you're feeling cold, you might want to turn the propane heater on for a few minutes to warm the room. It's incredibly dangerous to do this. If you fall asleep, the propane heater will continue pumping carbon monoxide into the room while you consume the oxygen. If you're asleep and the heater is still on, you could end up unconscious. If you wake up and you've been breathing the carbon monoxide for some time, you'll be in a state of confusion."

      "title": "Set the propane heater up outdoors before you light it.",
      "content": "Set the propane heater up outdoors before you light it. As mentioned above, the heater is very dangerous if it's lit indoors. If you have a garage, open the door completely and place the heater near the entrance. Otherwise, place it outdoors on a non-combustible surface like asphalt or concrete. [2] X Research source If the propane heater is heavy, use a hand-truck, a trolley, or a wheelbarrow to move it."

      "title": "Check the regulator for damage or wear and tear.",
      "content": "Check the regulator for damage or wear and tear. The regulator controls the flow of gas in the propane heater and lowers the pressure in the tank. The regulator is a circular device with a rubber cap sticking out of it, usually found at the bottom of the heater. If your regular is damaged, cracked, or badly worn, you'll need to replace it. [3] X Research source Buy a replacement regulator if you need to at the local heating store."

      "content": "Remove the valve cap and attach the heater to the tank. Find the valve cap at the top of your tank, sticking out at the top of it. Pull the cap off the valve. Hold the heater upright, insert the heater's regulator into the valve, and secure it by twisting the rubber fastener. [4] X Research source If you have difficulty removing the valve cap, put on a glove. The glove will allow you to use more force without damaging your hand."

If this is the case, use extra long matches or a lighter. [6] X Research source Don't touch the mesh screen with the flame, hold it about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from it."

By giving it time to cool down, you reduce the chances of an accident. [10] X Research source After the 15 to 20 minutes have passed, test the heat by placing your hands around the head of the propane heater. Don't touch it, but put your hands near it to feel if there's any heat coming from it."
