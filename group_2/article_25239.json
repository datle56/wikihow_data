Ground is most useful for sending large quantities of mail at once, handling oversized packages, and saving money on things that aren't urgent. [6] X Research source With Priority Mail, delivery is guaranteed within 1-3 days. To make sending large items more affordable, you have the option of mailing them in a flat rate envelope or box, which costs a fixed rate regardless of weight (up to 70 pounds (32 kg)). [7] X Research source First Class mail also usually goes out in 1-3 days, but items are limited to 13 ounces (370 g) in weight. Heavier items will require additional postage. [8] X Research source"
