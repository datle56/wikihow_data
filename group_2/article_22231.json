      "content": "A popular public spot is a great choice to help your date relax. If you meet someone you’re interested in for the first time, stick to places that are well-lit, easy to find, and have other people nearby. The person you bring on a date will feel a lot more safe and be able to unwind. There are lots of options for you to choose from. As long as the atmosphere is interesting and you can hear each other talk, you’ll have a good time. [1] X Research source You can go to a place you know well. That way, you can talk about all it offers, like the best appetizers, drinks, or performers. You can also try a spot you’ve never been to. Tell the person you’re dating it’s your first time and that you’re glad it’s with them. Decide if you’d prefer a romantic or casual atmosphere. You might feel more confident in different settings. For example, you might really know your way around wine, or you might know the best tacos in town. Choose somewhere you can easily talk to (and flirt with) your date, like a coffee shop. The more you talk, the more relaxed you’ll both feel. Reader Poll: We asked 549 wikiHow readers who've had successful first dates, and 64% of them agreed that the best date location is a coffee shop.

      "content": "Wear clothes that send the right message. Stick to a casual and cool look that shows off your personal style. Focus on simple cuts in your shirts and pants that give your date an idea of what your body looks like. Avoid outfits that are too dressy, like a suit and tie, since you want to look effortlessly cool and attractive. [2] X Research source Be well-groomed to enhance the first impression. Shower, pop in a breath mint, and put on a signature scent. Use one statement piece to impress your date . It can be a shirt with a unique print, a swank watch, or a leather bracelet. Keep the rest of your look understated. For example, if you choose to style your hair, then you can wear a white v-neck and denim jeans."

      "content": "Begin with some quick affection to test the waters. Only initiate physical touch, like a hand on their shoulder, if they suggest they are okay with that kind of contact. They might start with a pat on your knee or they may lean in really close. Show that you’re intrigued by their attention and open to a lot more of it. You can rub their arm or sit close enough that your legs touch. [5] X Research source You can also verbally encourage them. For example, you can say. “Oh! Hey, there. That feels nice.” Feel free to dote on them. If they say you’re cute and give you a hug, return the favor . Pull them into a warm embrace and tell them, “Thanks! I think you are, too.” You can also compliment your date’s physical features. For instance, you can admit, “I’m sorry, but I have to say… you have the most stunning legs.

A great tactic is to tell them you aren’t in a rush and can spend all day or night with them. [6] X Research source As the hours go by, the talk should get more and more honest. You’ll be more comfortable with each other. If you’re both giving each other a lot of eye contact throughout the whole date, it’s likely that the chemistry between you two is strong. If your date hugs you or becomes even more physical later in the date, they’re expressing attraction to you. You should still check in and see if they’d like the date to go on even longer."

A heavy makeout session is a great way to let your date express themselves physically and give you lots of signs that they’re interested in sex.

Say what you’re interested in and reassure them that you understand if they have a different goal for the night. [9] X Research source Make sure your date hasn’t had alcohol or isn’t extremely tired before going to your place. Their decision should be fully informed. Your date should know how they’re going home and that they can leave whenever they want. Pay attention to verbal and non-verbal consent.

They might also want to play out specific fantasies and hope to stay the night. Before you jump into intimacy, start off with clear expectations. [10] X Research source Let your date share their preferences with you and tell you the kind of sex they like the most. If you offer to give them a back rub before sex, let them enjoy the massage instead of using a “quid pro quo” arrangement. “Quid pro quo” means you get back exactly what you give. Be willing to re-negotiate sex throughout the night. Your date might decide they want to be less intimate, or they may be comfortable with a new option."

Maybe they’d like a personal lubricant, some towels, or even a specific toy. Make sure you have all the essentials for a memorable night. [11] X Research source If you’re having casual sex, you and your date should use protection and get tested at least every six months.
