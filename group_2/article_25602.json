Take the right end of the lace and feed it through the bottommost eyehole on the right, feeding the lace in the direction of the opposite eyehole on the left. Make sure the lace goes over the flaps of the shoes and not under. [1] X Research source When you lace your shoes this way, the laces should go down into the eyehole, rather than starting underneath and coming up.
