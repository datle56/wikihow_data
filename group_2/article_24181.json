      "content": "Measure the length of each wall in your room. Use a tape measure to find the length of each wall in the room where you’re installing your ceiling. Write the dimensions of your room either in a notebook or directly on the wall 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) from the top so you can easily reference them later. [1] X Research source If your room is square or rectangular, you only need to measure the length and width."

      "content": "Make a line between 4–6 in (10–15 cm) down from the tops of your walls. Leave at least 4–6 in (10–15 cm) of space from the top of your wall to your line so you have room for fixtures and to put in your tiles. Use a 4 ft (1.2 m) level and draw a straight line with your pencil completely around your room. [2] X Research source Snap a chalk line if you don’t want to draw the lines on yourself. Hold the string of the chalk line against your wall and snap it so the line transfers onto the drywall. If you plan on installing a large fluorescent light panel, make your line 6 in (15 cm) down."

      "title": "Use a pair of tin snips to cut wall angles to the lengths of your walls.",
      "content": "Use a pair of tin snips to cut wall angles to the lengths of your walls. Wall angles are long L-shaped pieces used around the walls of your room to support the tiles and runners. Since wall angles are usually sold in 8–12 ft (2.4–3.7 m) lengths, trim them down with your tin snips to match the lengths of your walls. [3] X Research source If you have a corner that juts out from your wall, cut the wall angles going on those walls 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) longer than your measurements. If you want a mitered finish in the corners, cut the wall runner bottom-most wall angle at a 45-degree angle. If your walls are longer than the wall angles, butt 2 of them together by lining up the ends."

      "content": "Screw the wall angles into the studs along the line you drew. Use a stud finder to locate the studs in your walls and mark their locations with a pencil. Line up the top of the wall angle with the line you’ve drawn on the wall. Use 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (3.2 cm) screws and electric screwdriver where you marked the studs to secure your wall angles in place. [4] X Research source Double check that your wall angles are level as you install them."

Measure the length of your room that runs perpendicular to the wooden joists of your ceiling. Cut the runners with a pair of tin snips to the correct length. [5] X Research source If your room is longer than the length of a main runner, use the clips on the ends of the piece to attach them together."

Snap the chalk line to leave a line on the joists. Move over 4 ft (1.2 m) and make another line on your ceiling. Keep moving across your room until you reach the other edge.

Attach a lag bit onto your electric screwdriver, and set an eyelet inside the bit. Start placing your eyelets 3 joists away from the wall along each of your chalk or string lines. Keep adding an eyelet at every third joist. [7] X Research source Eye lit screws can be purchased from your local hardware store."

Feed the other end of the wire through one of the circular slots on the runner, and bend it up with your pliers. Twist the wires around themselves at least 3 times to keep them secure. [9] X Research source Make sure your joists are level as you keep adding wires. Adjust where the bend is in the wires if one side is higher than the other."

Measure in 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) from any edge that doesn’t have a flange and draw a line with a pencil. Follow along the line with a utility knife, only cutting halfway through the tile. Make another cut on the side of the tile at the same depth as your first cut to remove the flange piece. [13] X Research source This only needs to be done if your tiles don’t have flanges already."
