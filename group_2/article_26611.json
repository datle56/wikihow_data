The test is actually looking at DHEA-S because this is the form of DHEA your adrenal gland secretes. [2] X Research source Your doctor will likely tell you that it is important to lower your DHEA as high levels can cause aggression and irregular blood pressure, among other health issues. Luckily, a benefit of reducing your DHEA levels is that most of these health concerns will disappear as your numbers drop. [3] X Research source"
