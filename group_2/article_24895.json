      "content": "Wipe off stains or scuffs immediately. The longer you let stains set in, the harder they will be to remove. Prevent this problem by wiping off things, like mud or wet sand, as soon as you can. Use a damp cloth or sponge with a drop of dish soap, or use pre-moistened sneaker wipes. Throw some sneaker wipes in your gym bag, or keep them for on the go activities."

Every time you come home from wearing your shoes, spray a little Fantastik, 409, or whatever your poison may be and wipe it off with a paper towel or dishcloth. Do not use a cleaner with bleach, because it can discolor shoes. Spray just enough to clean dirt and scuffs. You don't need to drench them."

Wipe polish on with a soft cloth, like an old t-shirt, and let it dry for a few minutes. Take a clean side of your old t-shirt to lightly buff out any scuff marks. White leather shoe polish is good for solid white shoes. Use a neutral shoe polish on white shoes that have accent colors. A neutral polish goes on clear and can be used on other leather shoes or bags. [5] X Research source Try to apply the polish in an extra-thin layer.
