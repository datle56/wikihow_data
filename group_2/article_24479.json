      "content": "It’s totally normal if the relationship is less than a year old. The “honeymoon phase” refers to the period early on in a relationship where everything is still new and fresh. Couples tend to not fight during this period because the excitement and momentum of the new relationship makes it easy to gloss over things you might otherwise argue about. This phase typically lasts 6-12 months, so don’t worry if you aren’t arguing and the relationship isn’t all that old! [1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If a year passes and you still aren’t arguing about anything, don’t worry just yet. Every relationship is different and your honeymoon phase may just be longer than average. If you and your partner start fighting at some point after 6-12 months, don’t assume something is seriously wrong. This is par for the course, and while it may be unpleasant now, it’s an important step in growing your relationship."

      "content": "It’s nearly impossible to never argue in a long-term relationship. No two people see the world in exactly the same way, and it’s absurd to expect people in a committed relationship to never argue. Every couple will have their disagreements, and that’s totally okay. If you and your partner have just started arguing and you’re worried that it’s a warning sign, relax. This is totally healthy and normal. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Think about just how much you’d need to agree on in order to never argue in a long-term relationship. What to eat for dinner, where to rent your first apartment, when to get married, what religion you should raise your children under—you’d need to see eye-to-eye on all of it. That’s just unrealistic!"

      "content": "It is healthy so long as you’re at least disagreeing. We tend to imagine arguments in relationships as shouting matches full of passion and aggressive romance. In reality, that’s not the only way to fight. Quiet conversations where two people disagree in a respectful way 100% qualifies as conflict. So long as you and your partner are at least doing that, don’t worry about the lack of yelling. [3] X Research source It’s possible that you and your partner argue all the time and it just doesn’t feel like it. If the two of you ever have calm disagreements, you’re arguing. You’re just doing it in a super healthy way!"

      "title": "It’s not healthy if one of you is actively avoiding uncomfortable topics.",
      "content": "It’s not healthy if one of you is actively avoiding uncomfortable topics. Some couples never disagree or argue at all because one partner is intentionally stepping around something they’re unhappy about. This is not good, since those negative feelings will just build up over time. This can lead to frustration, resentment, and anger. If the two of you always seem to agree over anything and everything and this has been going on for years, you may want to sit down and discuss it to see if this is a potential issue. [4] X Research source Checking in with your partner to let them know that you’re not going to be mad if they have something on their mind is a great way to set the stage for them to open up. [5] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. If you’re upset about something and you’ve been actively avoiding the topic, consider writing your feelings down and giving the letter to your partner. It’s often scary to say how you feel out loud, and a lot of people find it easier to process their feelings on paper."

      "content": "This is common when one partner has more power than the other. While many people lash out when they feel like they have less control than their partner does, some people just shut down—especially if they need something their partner provides that they can’t get anywhere else. A total lack of fighting can be common in these unhealthy relationships where one partner has a lot more power than the other. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if one partner is a stay-at-home parent who has no income and they rely on their partner to provide for them, it’s pretty understandable that the stay-at-home partner would actively avoid rocking the boat. These relationships will benefit deeply from couple’s therapy. It can be hard to fix an unequal relationship once it’s already established if you don’t get some outside help."

If you’re holding out for the perfect relationship where you and your dream partner never argue, you’re probably going to be disappointed. [7] X Research source Look for someone who is kind and treats you with respect. So long as they fulfill those two requirements, your fights shouldn’t be too crazy.

      "content": "It helps each person reassert independence and establish boundaries. Arguments demonstrate where the line is for each person in a relationship. This is vital in a health relationship. If one partner absolutely can’t stand it when the dishes go undone and that’s super important to them, it’s important to establish that early. Fights also remind couples that each partner is an individual. Autonomous couples are happy couples! [11] X Research source Autonomy refers to a person’s ability to control themselves. Fighting is one way for a partner to say, “I want control over this aspect of our relationship” to the other. This is actually really key when it comes to negotiating authority and mutual respect in a partnership."

That may seem like a small thing but arguing is a skill, and mastering that skill before you really need it is a big deal. One day, you and your partner may disagree on something serious, like marriage, having kids, or finances. Learning how to disagree productively by that point is essential. [12] X Research source Every couple argues differently, and learning what triggers your partner, what escalates fights, and what brings them back into a productive space is going to be important one day!"

      "content": "The “argue and makeup” cycle strengthens your bond as a couple. Conflict can bring people closer together, and that’s especially true for romantic relationships. Clashing over something important to both of you can be miserable as it’s happening, but compromising and making up usually brings you closer together. In this sense, fighting makes your relationship stronger! [13] X Research source The one scenario where this isn’t true is if you and your partner consistently have the same fight over and over again. That’s usually a sign that the two of you need to address an underlying problem that you may not have identified yet."

You should both feel comfortable expressing a desire for something you need, and if you aren’t doing that just to avoid a fight, it needs to be addressed. [15] X Research source If you’re the one who has a need going unmet, sit down with your partner and say, “Hey, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this for a while, but I’ve been putting it off. I really need…” Try to discuss it in a calm, friendly way, and if there’s some friction, then that’s okay! You’ll work through it. If you suspect your partner has an unmet need, remind them regularly that you just want to make them happy and that you’ll never be upset if they have an issue they want to talk about. Some people just really need that reminder to feel comfortable expressing themselves. [16] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021."

If there is a concrete point of friction that either you or your partner are actively tiptoeing around it, any negative feelings being harbored are just going to get worse over time. If something really bothers you, say so! If you think something is bothering your partner, encourage them to speak up. Even if it triggers a fight now, you’ll be better off in the long run. [17] X Research source t-avoidance-can-impact-a-relationship If you occasionally notice your partner is “off” and you suspect they’re mad at you but won’t say anything, remind them that you’ll be okay if they say what’s on their mind. If they do finally open up, thank them for being honest—even if their complaint annoys you a bit in the moment. If you’re upset about something but you really don’t want to fight, just say that!

      "content": "Affirm them before criticizing, and stay cool and collected. Go out of your way to say something productive and nice before you work your way into any complaints or criticisms. This should soften any negative feelings and keep things calm, which is essential. Nothing productive happens when you’re shouting at one another, and remaining relaxed, honest, and friendly is key to making progress. [20] X Research source For example, if you’re upset that your partner never gets you flowers, you might say, “I love you very much, and I know you express your love for me in your own way, but I really love it when you get me gifts every now and then.”"

      "content": "Focus your complaints on behaviors, not personal characteristics. Remind yourself that it’s “us versus a problem,” not “me vs. you.” From this perspective, your focus should be on things you or your partner does—not who they are as a person. When you start talking about your issues with your partner as a person, it can put them on the defensive. [21] X Research source This is where using “I” language is helpful. Always saying “you never…” and “you are…” can make it feel like an attack. Think about the difference between, “You’re a slob,” and “I feel like you don’t clean up after yourself sometimes.” [22] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. As another example, say you’re mad that your partner takes forever to call or text you back. You might feel like saying, “You don’t care about me enough to even pick up a phone.” What will they hear there? “You don’t care about me…” Instead, you might say, “I’d appreciate it if you were more responsive when I call or text you.” Reader Poll: We asked 937 wikiHow readers about the most effective ways to heal a relationship after a tough argument with a partner, and 81% agreed that healthy communication, including active listening, an apology, and taking accountability for your actions, is key.

It gives both partners time to cool off and process how they feel. On top of that, giving each person the ability to “call timeout” can keep arguments from getting out of hand. This will really help keep your disagreements from turning into shouting matches. [23] X Research source Despite popular belief, it’s totally okay to “go to bed angry.” Sometimes, sleeping on it gives people the time they need to calm down and work through the issue in their head.
