      "content": "Use primer to even out your skin texture before applying makeup. Primer is a Korean skincare staple. Rub a pea-sized amount of primer into your face prior to applying any other products; this will make your face a more even \"canvas\" on which to apply the rest of your makeup. [2] X Research source It doesn't take much primer to be effective. In fact, applying too much primer can cause the primer to stick to itself rather than your face and leave your skin looking a bit cakey."

      "title": "Apply natural-looking foundation",
      "content": "Apply natural-looking foundation , concealer, or BB cream to cover blemishes.

      "content": "Use natural-colored eyeshadow. Try white or beige eye shadow to ensure your makeup will go with most outfits. Opt for skin tones rather than more colorful or flashy hues. [3] X Research source While the ulzzang aesthetic is about looking effortlessly natural, if you do want to add a bit of pizzazz to your look, glam up with some shimmery eyeshadow —just keep the color in the champagne or pink family!

      "title": "Apply eyeliner",
      "content": "Apply eyeliner to accentuate your eyes. A little makeup can go a long way in making your eyes appear bigger. Apply a thin line of black or dark-colored eyeliner to your top lid to make your eyes seem larger. Avoid applying black to your lower lid, though, as this may end up making your eyes appear smaller. [5] X Research source While black eyeliner will make your eyes look bigger, you can also apply white eyeliner to your eyes to make them pop.

      "content": "Consider getting circle contact lenses for a more dramatic ulzzang look. You don't have to have naturally large eyes to give the illusion of ulzzang beauty. Circle lenses give off the illusion of large eyes, even if you have smaller eyes. See an ophthalmologist and ask your parents before wearing cosmetic lenses.
