      "title": "Gather about 10 darts to make your grenade.",
      "content": "Gather about 10 darts to make your grenade. Use streamline, whistler, or micro Nerf darts to make a grenade. Get together at least 10 of the same type of darts and choose ones that aren’t bent or torn so you can form a tight bundle. [1] X Research source Streamline Nerf darts are thin orange darts with orange rubber tips. The whistler darts are the ones with the orange body and black rubber tip on the end. Micro darts are the classic orange darts with the blue suction cups on the end. You could also use whistling Mega Darts for your grenade."

      "title": "Hold the darts together to form a hexagon shape.",
      "content": "Hold the darts together to form a hexagon shape. A hexagon is a 6-sided shape that will allow you to tightly pack the darts together. Align the darts so they’re even and facing the same direction and there aren’t any tips sticking out. Form a hexagon and keep the tips even with each other. [2] X Research source A hexagon shape lets you make a tight bundle with the round darts."

      "title": "Double-wrap a rubber band around the necks of the darts.",
      "content": "Double-wrap a rubber band around the necks of the darts. Take a standard rubber band and wrap it around the necks of the bundle of darts, just below the rubber tip. Then, wrap the rubber band around the darts a second time so they’re held together tightly. [3] X Research source The bundle needs to be tight so there’s enough pressure to send the darts flying when the grenade goes off. Try to put the rubber band just below the tips of the darts so it’ll pop off when you throw the grenade."

    {
      "title": "Attach another rubber band to the bottom to keep the darts secure.",
      "content": "Attach another rubber band to the bottom to keep the darts secure. Take another rubber and wrap it around the bottom of your grenade, just to make sure it doesn’t go off until you’re ready to toss it. Don’t double-wrap the rubber band. Keep it loose so it doesn’t bend or damage your darts. [4] X Research source Securing the grenade makes it easier for you to carry it around until you’re ready to throw it."

    {
      "title": "Hook a paper clip around the bottom rubber band to make a pin.",
      "content": "Hook a paper clip around the bottom rubber band to make a pin. To add some dramatic flair to your grenade, take a standard paper clip and thread the end between the bottom rubber band and the darts. Allow the paper clip to hang loosely until you’re ready to pull the pin and throw your grenade. [5] X Research source You don’t have to add a pin if you don’t want to."

      "title": "Pull the pin and remove the rubber band from the bottom.",
      "content": "Pull the pin and remove the rubber band from the bottom. When the time is right and you’re ready to toss your Nerf grenade, pull the paperclip pin to remove the rubber band from the bottom. Get a good grip on your grenade, take aim, and get ready to toss it. [6] X Research source Try pulling off the pin with your teeth to make it more dramatic! Make sure you don’t have any teammates in the area so they don’t get hit by the darts when the grenade goes off."

      "title": "Shout something to let people know you’re about to throw a grenade.",
      "content": "Shout something to let people know you’re about to throw a grenade. In the heat of a Nerf fight, let your teammates know you’re about to toss a grenade. Shout something like, “Fire in the hole!” or “Tossing grenade, take cover!” That way, you’re teammates won’t get caught in the blast. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Throw the grenade so the end with the rubber band strikes a surface.",
      "content": "Throw the grenade so the end with the rubber band strikes a surface. Aim your throw and toss your grenade so the end with the rubber band hits a hard surface like the floor or a wall. When the grenade makes contact, the rubber band will pop off and the darts will go flying, so take cover! [8] X Research source Try aiming at a wall above the enemy so the darts rain down on them."
