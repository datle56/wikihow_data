      "content": "Get a blood test to check for iron deficiency. Your doctor can easily check your iron levels to see if they are within the normal range, but it will require going for a blood test. For this test, a phlebotomist will remove a small vial of blood from a vein in your arm and send it to a laboratory for testing. [7] X Research source If your doctor suspects you're anemic, they'll likely do a complete blood count (CBC) and ferritin test. It's possible to test your iron levels, but your lab results will be affected by your day's diet. The blood test can confirm if you are anemic, and it will also confirm what type of anemia you have. For example, you might be anemic due to a deficiency in iron or due to a deficiency in folate or vitamin B12."

      "content": "Look into medications to treat stomach ulcers. If you’re bleeding internally, such as due to stomach ulcers, you might become anemic. Stopping the bleeding is necessary to treat the anemia, so your doctor will likely recommend medications for the ulcers if they suspect this is the cause of your anemia. [9] X Research source Take the medications exactly as your doctor instructs you to and don’t stop taking them without checking first. Don't take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if you have a stomach ulcer. They can aggravate your ulcer and may increase your bleeding risk, which can make your anemia worse."
