As your corn matures, its tassels should turn from green to brown. Avoid harvesting the corn until the tassels' green color has disappeared completely.

If the kernel releases a milky fluid, your plant is ready for harvest. [5] X Research source If your corn kernels are not mature, they will be firm and won't release a milky fluid. If that's the case, smooth the silk and husk back over unripe kernels. Your corn will still mature without any problems. [6] X Research source"

Pick off the silk one hair at a time or use an old toothbrush to rub them off. [11] X Research source Microwaving the corn can make it easier to husk. Set the microwave power to high and heat the unhusked corn for 2 minutes. Put the silk and husks in a large container or trash bag to make cleanup easier."
