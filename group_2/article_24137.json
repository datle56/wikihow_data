      "content": "Ensure your computer can run Windows XP. First, it's important to remember that Windows XP is extremely old and vulnerable to viruses and malware. Computer repair specialist Matt Ham doesn't recommend installing it on your computer. If you have an older PC that doesn't support Windows 10 or 11, consider Windows 7 instead, and running any XP-specific software in compatibility mode. But if you want to experiment or install XP on a virtual machine, read on. If you built the PC yourself and used much older hardware that was compatible with Windows XP, or you're installing on a virtual machine, you'll be fine as long as the minimum requirements are met or exceeded: 233 MHz Intel or AMD CPU 64 MB of RAM 1.5 GB of available drive space Super VGA (800 x 600) or higher display adapter However, things get tricky if you want to install Windows XP on a modern computer. While any modern PC has more than enough power to run Windows XP, finding drivers for your hardware, including SATA hard drives, will be tough. Sometimes, the built-in drivers will be enough to support the most crucial hardware, but you'll probably run into problems with sound cards and network interfaces."

      "content": "Get Windows XP installation media. If you don't have a Windows XP installation CD or DVD, you'll need an ISO image. You can then use the ISO image to install Windows XP on a virtual machine or create a bootable installation disc . The safest place to download a Windows XP ISO image is from Archive.org, but you'll still want to use your more modern OS's antivirus tools to make sure these files don't have a malware infection: Windows XP Pro Service Pack 3 x86: https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86 Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 3: https://archive.org/details/WinXPHomeEditionSP3x86 You can find even more options at https://archive.org/details/operatingsystemcds ."

Or, if you have an old computer that had Windows XP installed, you can usually find the product key sticker somewhere on the hardware. You may be able to find product keys online, but it might be tough to activate them, as phone activation for Windows XP is no longer supported. Some users on the Microsoft Answers forum have had success activating Windows XP by calling their local activation number found in this Microsoft tool . [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your computer to boot from CD/DVD. If you're installing Windows XP on a PC using a CD or DVD, you'll need to set your computer to boot from the optical drive instead of from the hard drive. This will allow you to load the Windows XP setup files before your computer boots to its installed operating system. You can change the boot order in the BOOT menu in your BIOS . To enter the BIOS of your computer, you usually press the setup key (which might be F9 or DEL) when your computer starts or notifies you that you can enter \"setup\". In the BOOT menu, set the order so that your CD/DVD-ROM drive is set as the first boot device. If you are installing Windows XP from a USB drive , make sure that the USB drive is set as the first boot device. You may need to have the USB drive inserted for it to appear as an option."

Press any key on your keyboard to start the Setup program. Setup will load files necessary to begin the installation, which may take a few moments. Once the loading is complete, you will be taken to the Welcome screen.

      "content": "Select the partition you want to install on. You will see a list of available partitions on your installed hard drives. If you are installing Windows XP on a new hard drive, you should see only one entry labeled \"Unpartitioned space.\" If you have a previous version of Windows or Linux installed on your computer, you will potentially have multiple partitions. Ham notes that if you want to completely wipe the machine before installing, you can delete any existing partitions. Installing Windows XP will erase all the data on the partition you choose. Select an empty partition or one containing data you do not care about losing. To delete a partition, select it and press D . This will return them to “Unpartitioned space”. Any data on the partition will be lost when it is deleted."

Enter the size in megabytes (MB) for the new partition, then press Enter . By default, the partition will be set to the maximum amount of available space. Unless you plan on creating multiple partitions, you can usually leave this at its default. Windows XP requires at least 1.5 gigabytes (1536 MB) for its installation files, but you will want more than this for programs, documents, downloads, and other files. 5 GB (5120 MB) is a good baseline amount for Windows XP, with more if you plan on installing a lot of programs. You can create multiple partitions on a single drive. This can allow you to separate your programs from your movies and music, or to install another operating system. Windows XP can only be installed on one discrete partition."

      "title": "Format the partition as NTFS.",
      "content": "Format the partition as NTFS. Select your new partition and press Enter , then select \"Format the Partition using the NTFS File System\" and press Enter . NTFS is the preferred file system type, supporting more disk space per partition than FAT and including security features at the file system level and system-level compression. There are almost no situations anymore where choosing FAT would be preferable. If your partition size is larger than 32 GB, you will not be given the option to choose FAT. It is highly recommended to avoid Quick Format, as this skips an important process that checks the hard drive for errors or bad sectors. This scan consumes most of the time taken when performing a full format. If there are errors on a disk at the physical level, it's best to catch them now rather than later. The system will now format the partition. The time this process requires depends on the speed and size of the drive. The larger the partition, the longer the process will take."
