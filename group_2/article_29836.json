      "content": "Begin with a leather square. 1'x1' is a good starting size for this piece of leather if you're working with a standard pistol. For a larger handgun, cut it to make sure you can wrap your weapon in it. You'll be making the pocket that holds your weapon with this piece; this is the holster. Fold the leather in half over the top of your weapon. When you do so, the handle should stick out. This is how you would grab your weapon if you need it."

      "title": "Cut the top corners off of your square.",
      "content": "Cut the top corners off of your square. Using scissors or a utility knife, cut triangles out of the top corners. Your triangles should be an inch tall for a pistol. For a larger gun, you can cut up to 3” off. You should easily be able to fold the leather over your weapon and have a spare inch. This will be plenty of material to work with because it will stretch."

      "title": "Soak your leather.",
      "content": "Soak your leather. Take your leather and soak it thoroughly in water. This will take a few minutes. Eventually, it will become pliable. Once this happens, squeeze the excess water out of it. The side of the leather than is less tough is the inside of your leather. This side will soak water in better than the rough face of the leather."

      "content": "Wrap your leather around the mold of your pistol. Do this with the middle of the leather piece over the barrel and have it wrap under the trigger. Using stretching blocks, put pressure on the leather around the mold and stretch it out. You should have one block on each side of the leather and it should be as close to the mold as you can. This will help the leather stretch once you clamp the blocks into place. You can use any clamps that you want, as long as they will hold the blocks in place tightly."

Rough cut it to be the size of your weapon. Cut it with your razor knife. [1] X Research source Place a piece of spare leather between the leather that you're cutting and the table. This protects your table and your razor blade. Cut it bigger rather than smaller. Cut along the outside of the line that you've traced. This way you can match them up and cut them down until they are perfect. It is possible to cut them down more and more, but if you start off by cutting too much off, you can't add to it."

It will still be damp, but when you take off the clamps, it should be starting to hold the shape of your mold. Dampen the outer piece of the holster once again. You want it about ¾ as damp as the original time that you dampened it. This means it will be wet, but won't leave water on your hand when you touch it."

If you don't let the leather set in the proper position, your weapon won't fit correctly.

If you don't use one, it will be too difficult to get the needle through. A pronged punch looks like a fork. Simply place it with the prongs facing into the leather, lined up where you want to make indents. Hold it steady and hit the top of the punch with your hammer. The prongs will go into the leather, but not all the way through. Pull the punch out and continue doing this all the way around your insert."

Start wherever you'd like on your holster and go all the way around. Finish is the same stitch hole that you started in. Knot your string onto your needle to make it easier for you. This will take a lot of strength to get the needle through the leather. Keep using the guide-holes that you made with your pronged punch. If you miss a hole, take the needle back through the way it came and fix it. Your leather will pull unevenly if you don't."

Once again, take your prong and make stitch indents around the shape of the bottom of your weapon. If you make the stitch too close to where your weapon sits, you won't be able to fit your weapon in your holster. If you need to, you can keep the weapon in the holster while you stitch the remaining side. #Clean you edge. After this stitching is done, use your knife to finish shaping your holster.

Place a small strip of leather (no more than 3”) and lay it on your holster, over the strap. Stitch this strap onto both the holster and the strap. It will take a lot of strength to attach this strap because you will be going through up multiple layers of leather. Be sure to use your prong punch and hammer to create insertion holes for the stitches."
