      "title": "Start with a square sheet of paper.",
      "content": "Start with a square sheet of paper. You can use any size of paper you want, but something around 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) will work the best. [1] X Research source Choose something colorful; double-sided scrapbooking paper will work the best because it has a design on both sides. Alternatively, you can use recycled toilet paper rolls. Use shipping paper and paint and color it. You can even reuse any old paper box for arts and crafts."

      "title": "Trace four diagonal lines from the corners of the square toward the center.",
      "content": "Trace four diagonal lines from the corners of the square toward the center. Place a ruler on the paper so that it goes from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Use the ruler as a guide to trace a neat line. Repeat this step for the top right corner and the bottom left corner. [2] X Research source You can also fold the paper corner-to-corner twice to make an X instead. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut partway across each line.",
      "content": "Cut partway across each line. Stop when you are ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the center. Do not cut all the way to the center, or your pinwheel will fall apart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring every other corner to the center.",
      "content": "Bring every other corner to the center. Your paper will have short, stubby corners and long skinny ones. Make sure that you are only folding the long, skinny corners to the center. Also, make sure that the corners all overlap in the center. [4] X Research source Do not fold the paper. You want it to remain curved."

    {
      "title": "Stick a pushpin through the center.",
      "content": "Stick a pushpin through the center. Make sure that you catch all four corners, and that the pin goes out the middle of the paper. Rotate the pin in the paper to widen the hole. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add a few small beads onto the end of the pin.",
      "content": "Add a few small beads onto the end of the pin. You will only need 1 to 3 beads. Make sure that they are all the same size and shape. These beads will help lift the pinwheel away from the dowel and allow it to spin. Avoid using plastic pony beads; they are too big."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the pilot hole in the dowel.",
      "content": "Make the pilot hole in the dowel. Use a thumbtack to make the hole, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) down from the tip. [6] X Research source Press a thumbtack into the dowel until it sticks, then lightly strike it with a hammer. Pull it out when you are done. Soak the dowel in warm water for a few minutes first; this will help prevent it from breaking."

    {
      "title": "Press the pinwheel into the dowel.",
      "content": "Press the pinwheel into the dowel. If the pin is loose, take it out, add a bead of glue into the hole, then push it back in again. Give the pinwheel a test spin, then pull the pin out further, if needed. If part of the pushpin is sticking out of the back of the dowel, you will need to fold it down with a pair of pliers."

      "content": "Cut a hexagon shape out of paper. Draw or print a hexagon directly on the paper you will be using. Cut the hexagon out using a pair of scissors or a metal ruler and a sharp blade.

Make sure that the corners overlap in the middle of the pinwheel. Do not crease or bend the paper, however; you want to keep those nice curves! [10] X Research source"

Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to cut the paper into four, 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strips. [11] X Research source Some scrapbooking paper has a white strip along the bottom edge for the price and label. You should trim this off first.

Work one strip at a time, otherwise, the paper will be too thick to cut neatly. [13] X Research source You don't have to do this step. This will simply give the pinwheels a more ornate edge."

Place it against the narrow end of the next strip, then press them together. Keep connecting the strips until you have one long strip.
