      "content": "Cut a piece of cardstock into a 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) rectangle. Measure your paper to find the desired dimensions and mark them with a pencil. Then, cut along the lines to create your bookmark. [1] X Research source Adjust the dimensions if you want the bookmark to be smaller or bigger."

      "title": "Draw a picture on the cardstock rectangle to add a design element.",
      "content": "Draw a picture on the cardstock rectangle to add a design element. Use a pencil to create an outline of your picture and then color it in with markers, colored pencils, or crayons. You can draw anything you want on your bookmark! [2] X Research source Try drawing an animal, such as a dog, cat, bird, or mouse. Draw a landscape, such as a view of the beach, the mountains, or the desert. Keep it simple with a couple of stick figures, shapes, or symbols."

      "title": "Glue on paper cutouts or pictures if you want a collage on the bookmark.",
      "content": "Glue on paper cutouts or pictures if you want a collage on the bookmark. Cut shapes out of construction paper or cardstock, cut pictures out of magazines, or use a few photos of your own to decorate your bookmark. Apply a bit of white glue onto the back of the cutout or picture and press it onto the bookmark wherever you want it to go. [3] X Research source Try cutting out hearts and stars for a simple way to decorate your bookmark. Cut pictures of people, animals, places, or things out of a magazine and paste these onto your bookmark. Choose a picture of your family, significant other, or child and glue it onto the bookmark."

      "content": "Add an inspirational quote to make your bookmark more meaningful. Use your bookmark as a reminder to help keep you in a positive mindset! Choose an inspirational quote or message and write it on your bookmark using colored pencils, crayons, or markers. Some options include: [4] X Research source “Each person must live their life as a model for others.” -Rosa Parks “No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.” -Robin Williams “You are enough just as you are.” -Megan Markle “You get what you give.” -Jennifer Lopez"

      "content": "Punch a hole in 1 end of the bookmark and tie ribbon through it to add flair. For an extra finishing touch on your bookmark, use a single hole punch to make a hole about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the end of the bookmark. Cut a piece of ribbon about 8 in (20 cm) long, insert it through the hole, and tie it in a bow. [5] X Research source If you have a specialty hole punch, you can cut out shapes, such as a heart or star, and string the ribbon through the hole."

The paper should look like long, thin strips of ribbon. [6] X Research source Don’t worry if the strips seem too long for a bookmark. You will be weaving them together so your finished bookmark will be about half as long as the individual strips are now."

You can use it as is or decorate it however you like! Try drawing on your bookmark with marker or crayons, or paste on some paper cutouts to make a face on it. [18] X Research source"
