      "content": "Low vibration is an energy frequency associated with negativity. According to wellness and spirituality communities, everything in the universe (every atom, object, and living thing) is in constant motion, vibrating at a unique speed that determines a person or object’s “vibrational energy.” High vibrations are associated with happiness and good health, while low vibrations are connected to negative emotions and physical ailments. In theory, making lifestyle changes can help you adjust your vibrational frequency and bring yourself into alignment (spiritually speaking). Terms like “vibrations” and “frequencies” may sound vaguely scientific, but keep in mind this is a spiritual philosophy rooted in self-care and self-improvement."
