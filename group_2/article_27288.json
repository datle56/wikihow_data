      "title": "Find a pool noodle.",
      "content": "Find a pool noodle. Red or white is best but any color will do as you can cover them to create the desired effect. This process won't ruin the noodle so they can be reused after the holiday season and thrown back into the pool or lake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the noodle.",
      "content": "Bend the noodle. Measure the noodle into three equal parts. Only bend the top third of the noodle. This will create the cane-like shape. You’ll want to keep it in place like this for about 20 minutes. You can do this by simply holding it, sitting on it or placing books on top of it. If you want to save time, simply eyeball the appropriate bend spot and bend according to your preference."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure with fishing line.",
      "content": "Secure with fishing line. Tie the fishing line around the two parts of the bend. This will ensure the shape holds. You can always readjust the shape later if you don’t like it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create the stripes.",
      "content": "Create the stripes. If the noodle is red, use white electrical tape to create stripes or vice versa. If you’ve chosen another color like purple, you will cover the entire noodle in a solid color of tape first before creating the alternating colored stripes. Diagonally, wind the red or white tape around the noodle and presto! [1] X Research source You’ve created a foam candy cane. If you’d like your stripes to be extra precise, measure two to three inches for each stripe (or larger if you prefer giant stripes). Make a small mark with a pencil. When winding the tape around the noodle, let the marks serve as a guide along the way. This will keep your stripes even and a consistent size."

      "title": "Make an outline.",
      "content": "Make an outline. Using a sheet of plywood and a garbage can lid (anything round will work), trace a half circle to create an arch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a channel.",
      "content": "Create a channel. To keep the PVC from wiggling around when bending, create a channel by placing small pieces of scrap wood along the outline. These should be placed about 4-5 inches apart on either side of the line you’ve drawn. [2] X Research source It’s best to drill these in place so they don’t shift."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the PVC.",
      "content": "Bend the PVC. Place your template on the ground and grab your ½ inch PVC. Measure the noodle into three equal parts. Using a hairdryer, begin to slide the PVC through the channel, heating it along the way so it’s bendable. [3] X Research source Only bend the top third of the noodle. If you want to save time, simply eyeball the appropriate bend spot and bend according to your preference. Be careful not to hold the heat source at the same spot for too long as it could melt. This will take several minutes so take your time. Wait until it’s cooled before popping it out of the template."

      "content": "Slide the noodle over the PVC pipe. Depending on the size of your PVC pipe, you may need two noodles."

      "title": "Cover with duct tape.",
      "content": "Cover with duct tape. Cover the seam where the two noodles meet (if applicable) first. Otherwise, go ahead and cover the entire cane with white duct tape. Due to the curves and noodle material, the tape may not lay perfectly flat."

      "title": "Create stripes.",
      "content": "Create stripes. Diagonally, wind the red tape around the noodle. You can further customize the decoration with glitter, bows, etc. If you’d like your stripes to be extra precise, measure two to three inches for each stripe (or larger if you prefer giant stripes). Make a small mark with a pencil. When winding the tape around the noodle, let the marks serve as a guide along the way. This will keep your stripes even and a consistent size."
