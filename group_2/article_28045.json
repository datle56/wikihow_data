      "title": "Put a ceramic dinner plate in the freezer for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Put a ceramic dinner plate in the freezer for 30 minutes. This rapidly cools the plate down and helps to create a fire-proof surface to help you with your trick. When you take the plate out of the freezer, check that it feels cold. If it doesn’t feel cooler than the air temperature, leave it in the freezer for another 30 minutes to cool down. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a freezer, put the plate in the fridge for 1 hour instead."

      "content": "Cut the striking strip out of a matchbox. Remove the tray of matches from the matchbox and use a pair of scissors to trim off the striking strip. Try to trim off all the extra cardboard from around the striking strip, as this will create a more concentrated smoking powder. [2] X Research source The striking strip is the coloured area on the side of the matchbox."

      "title": "Remove the cardboard backing from the striking strip.",
      "content": "Remove the cardboard backing from the striking strip. Peel the cardboard off the non-coloured side of the striking strip. This will make the smoking powder stronger and creates a more impressive trick. [3] X Research source If you’re having trouble peeling off the cardboard backing, use a craft knife to help lift up the cardboard."

      "title": "Fold the striking strip in half lengthways.",
      "content": "Fold the striking strip in half lengthways. Fold 1 of the long edges of the striking strip onto the other long edge. This helps to make the striking strip burn a little slower. Press down on the crease to secure the fold. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the striking strip on the plate and light it on fire.",
      "content": "Place the striking strip on the plate and light it on fire. Hold your lighter over 1 end of the striking strip to light it on fire. Wait for the flame to completely burn out before you touch the ash. [5] X Research source Keep an eye on the strip as it burns to make sure that it doesn’t spark. If it does spark, quickly pat out the fire with a heavy cloth or use a fire extinguisher, if necessary."

      "title": "Pick up the brown residue with your gloved fingertips.",
      "content": "Pick up the brown residue with your gloved fingertips. Push the burnt paper remains out of the way and then rub your gloved fingertips over the brown residue. Try to pick up as much of the brown residue as you can, as this will make the smoke trick last longer. [6] X Research source Try to concentrate the residue on your fingertips rather than your fingers, as this makes the trick easier."

    {
      "title": "Rub your fingers together to create smoke.",
      "content": "Rub your fingers together to create smoke. The friction between your gloved fingers will cause the brown powder to turn into smoke. This makes it look like there is smoke coming out of your fingers! To make the trick more impressive, stand a short distance away from your audience so that they can’t see the brown powder. [7] X Research source Wash your gloves after you have finished the trick to remove any remains of the brown residue."

      "content": "Leave this trick for adults to demonstrate. Any tricks that involve fire contain an element of risk. For this reason, it is best to ask an adult to try this trick for you. If you do decide to try this trick yourself, make sure that you have an adult closely supervising.

Have a fire extinguisher on hand to put out any fires. [10] X Research source Make sure that you know how to use the fire extinguisher so that you can quickly and effectively put out the fire, if needed."

      "content": "Complete the trick over a fireproof surface to minimise the risks. If possible, light the striking strip over a fireproof surface, such as concrete or steel. This helps to prevent any sparks from turning into a fire. If you don’t have a fireproof surface, move any objects that could easily catch fire, such as paper and fabric. [11] X Research source"
