      "content": "Melt 1/4 cup of butter over medium heat. Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the butter is completely melted. Reduce the heat slightly if the butter begins to brown. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Slowly sprinkle flour over the melted butter.",
      "content": "Slowly sprinkle flour over the melted butter. Use a wire whisk to incorporate the flour into the butter and prevent it from clumping. The butter and flour will form a roux and look like a thickened paste when completely combined. [2] X Research source"
    },

      "title": "Pour broth into the pan and whisk it.",
      "content": "Pour broth into the pan and whisk it. Use the whisk to stir the roux of flour and butter off the bottom of the pan and mix it into the broth. Whisk the mixture until the roux is fully mixed into the broth and all clumps have been broken down. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Simmer the broth and wine on low for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Simmer the broth and wine on low for 1 hour. Stir the red wine into the broth using a circular motion. Be sure the wine is thoroughly incorporated into the mixture. Then, allow the red wine demi glace to simmer on low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. After an hour, he liquid should have reduced to approximately half its original volume in the pan. [4] X Research source Reduce heat slightly if there is any buildup on the bottom of the pan. This is a sign that your sauce is too hot and could burn. Reducing the broth and wine by half concentrates the flavor and thickens the sauce."

      "title": "Dip a spoon into the demi glace and examine the back.",
      "content": "Dip a spoon into the demi glace and examine the back. The demi glace is ready if it glazes the back of the spoon and stays on it. Simmer the sauce for an additional 20 minutes if the demi glace is still runny when you test its consistency. Then perform the same consistency test to check the thickness of the sauce.

      "title": "Melt another 1/4 cup of butter over low heat.",
      "content": "Melt another 1/4 cup of butter over low heat. Slowly pour the butter into the demi glace. Stir the sauce continuously as the butter melts so it mixes completely into the sauce."
