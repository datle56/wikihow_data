      "title": "Talk to your provider about using numbing creams ahead of time.",
      "content": "Talk to your provider about using numbing creams ahead of time. Explain how you’re apprehensive about the pain and ask about local anesthesia options—some clinics carry them, and there are plenty of over-the-counter numbing creams, sprays or patches that are safe to use on your own. Apply them 30-60 minutes before your appointment for the best results. Confirm with your provider where the shot will be administered so you can numb up the correct spot. Always ask about using numbing creams ahead of time since not all offices or clinics carry them and you may have to supply your own."

      "content": "Distract yourself with calming activities in the waiting room. Let your thoughts drift from anxiety about the injection to happier, calmer feelings. Check your email, social media, listen to music, or even watch a movie on your phone while you’re waiting to get your mind off the shot. Some people even bring a friend along with them! [2] X Research source Try squeezing a stress ball or playing with a fidget spinner to work out some of your nervous energy. Bring a book or magazine to read if that’s more interesting and distracting to you than social media or music. Remember that your doctor or nurse may not want you listening to your headphones during the actual appointment."

      "title": "Stroke, rub, or massage the injection site before and after the shot.",
      "content": "Stroke, rub, or massage the injection site before and after the shot. Ask your provider where the injection will be—most are given in the upper arm while most blood draws happen in your inner arm just below the elbow. Then, use your hands to gently rub and apply light pressure to the skin around the site for several minutes. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Massage the site while you’re in the waiting room, while you’re in the exam room, or even while you’re commuting to the doctor’s office. Do not rub or apply pressure to the injection site if the shot included medications like Lovenox or heparin since these can cause extra bruising. [4] X Research source This tactical stimulation prepares the skin for the added pressure of a needle and reduces the amount of pain you’re likely to feel."

      "title": "Distract yourself with conversation or something else in the exam room.",
      "content": "Distract yourself with conversation or something else in the exam room. Make small talk with the injection giver or with a friend or family member that’s accompanying you—the topic doesn’t matter as long as you’re diverting your attention to the conversation. If you’re more introverted, focus on an interesting poster on the wall or tune in to a catchy song playing in the background. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Ask your provider if it’s alright to scroll your phone during the shot if you think that’s the best way to keep yourself distracted. Try distracting yourself by imagining you’re on vacation or reciting poems and song lyrics to yourself (out loud or in your head). Pretend the needle is going into a different part of your body than the injection site so you’re not anticipating pain in the actual spot."

While you’re sitting in the exam room, place your hand on your thigh, relax your shoulders, and just let your arm hang until it’s time for the shot. [6] X Research source Try breathing exercises to reduce pain and relax your mind and body, too. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Wait until the provider tells you the needle is out before looking back at the injection site since you might not feel it move.

      "content": "Hold your breath or cough during the injection. Take a deep breath a few seconds before the shot and hold it until the needle is out. The activity is distracting and increases your blood pressure, which can raise your threshold for pain tolerance. The reduction in pain is small, but every little bit helps!

      "content": "Keep the body part that got the injection moving to relieve soreness . Continue doing your regular activities unless your doctor tells you to rest the injected muscles. If it’s an arm injection, try raising it up and moving it in circles to keep blood flowing around the injection site. [11] X Research source Movement helps the medicine circulate away from the injection spot more quickly, which relieves potential swelling or discomfort faster. Depending on the injection and location, you might be asked to avoid heavy lifting or vigorous activity for at least a few hours afterwards."

      "content": "Use hot and cold treatments after the shot to manage pain and swelling. Use a cold compress on the injection site for up to 1 day afterward to prevent or reduce possible swelling. If there’s any pain or soreness lingering, use a heating pad or warm washcloth to relax and soothe the area. [12] X Research source Apply hot or cold treatments for up to 15-20 minutes at a time, several times throughout the day. Do not apply ice or cold compresses directly to your bare skin."

Also consider pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). [14] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Ask your doctor if it’s safe to use these after an injection in case they interact with the injected medication.

Be honest and explain that shots can pinch or hurt for a second, but it won’t hurt for very long. [15] X Research source Act out the doctor’s visit with a stuffed animal ahead of time. Show them where the injection will go and bring the toy to the appointment for support. [16] X Research source Try not to fib and say the shot won’t hurt.

Do your best not to look tense or worried about how your child will react to the shot since young children can pick up on and feel those emotions, too. Treat the appointment like any other errand—just a quick item to check off your to-do list. [17] X Research source Try not to say “everything will be OK” to comfort them. This phrase usually pops up when there’s a problem, and your child might get worried.

[18] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Ask your healthcare provider if the shot can be administered in a sitting position—a lot of times, kids are more fearful when they have to lie flat. If they’re struggling to sit still, hold them firmly but comfortably in your lap to calm them. [19] X Research source If your child is an infant, swaddle them tightly in a blanket with one leg exposed for the shot. Don’t hold your child down against their will since this can be a traumatizing experience. Use comforting touch or distractions to calm them instead."

If you can’t find a large fatty area to hold, inject at 45 degrees (preferably with a shorter needle like a 5/16 in (7.9 mm) one ). If you’ve got a good handful of skin and fat, inject at any angle between 45 and 90 degrees.
