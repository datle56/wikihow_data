      "content": "Use the thin handle of a comb to decrease tension at the scalp. Slip the thin end of a long-handled fine-tooth comb underneath cornrows or tight braids to get some relief. You could also use the blunt end of a skewer or the eraser end of a pencil. Gently wiggle the eraser, skewer, or handle to loosen the braid at the scalp. Be careful and take your time so as not to ruin your braids. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that the braids will loosen up on their own over time."

Spritz the braid spray on your scalp to prevent itching and lubricate your braids, which will soften and loosen them. [2] X Research source Look for soothing sprays made with aloe vera, tea tree oil, sulfur, or lavender oil. Use this spray when you're getting ready in the morning and throughout the day as needed to reduce tension caused by tight braids."

      "content": "Massage your scalp with oil every day for 1 to 2 minutes. While you have braids in, it's important to do daily scalp massages with oil. Use 1 tbsp (14.8 mL) of a pure, natural oil like avocado, castor, coconut, jojoba, or almond oil. Apply the oil to your scalp, then massage it in with your fingers using gentle, circular motions. Do this for 1 to 2 minutes each day. [3] X Research source Try adding a few drops of essential oil to the oil you choose to scent and refresh your scalp. Peppermint essential oil can help with scalp itchiness, so consider using that for your daily scalp massages."

      "title": "Take a warm shower to increase your hair's elasticity.",
      "content": "Take a warm shower to increase your hair's elasticity. Warm water will open up your hair shafts, making your braids looser and more elastic. Jump into a warm shower and allow the water to run over your scalp and through your braids. Rub your scalp gently at the base of the braids as the warm water falls over them to encourage loosening. Avoid being rough with your braids. After getting out of the shower, use a towel to remove excess water from your hair by gently patting your braids. If your hair is naturally curly, wetting the braids may cause frizziness."

    {
      "title": "Use a hair steamer to loosen your braids.",
      "content": "Use a hair steamer to loosen your braids. You can pick up a hair steamer at your local beauty shop, or visit the salon and use theirs. Set up the hair steamer, then sit under it. Direct the steam at your braids, concentrating on the places you are feeling the most tension. Sit under the hair steamer in 10-minute sessions, with short breaks in between, until your braids feel better. You can apply a deep-conditioner to your scalp before sitting under the steamer to increase the relief."

      "content": "Wrap a warm, damp towel around your head for an hour. Applying moist heat directly to your braids will increase their elasticity and relieve tension. First, wet a towel with warm water. Wring out the excess moisture, then gently wrap the towel around your head like a turban. Leave your hair under the towel for an hour before removing it."

      "content": "Avoid returning to a stylist that consistently braids too tightly. One comment to a stylist is all it should take to get them to loosen up their braiding style. If you inform your stylist that the braids are too tight but it continues to be a problem, don't return to that person for future braids. Research other stylists in the area and book an appointment with someone new. [5] X Research source Look for customer reviews of the stylist you have in mind to see what others are saying about their techniques."

      "title": "Avoid updos for several days after getting new braids.",
      "content": "Avoid updos for several days after getting new braids. Putting your braids up on top of your head in a bun or other updos can increase tightness, especially right after you've had them done. After getting your hair braided, wear it down for a couple of days to avoid added tension on your scalp. Try letting your braids hang loosely around your shoulders. If you want them out of your face, tie your braids back gently in a low ponytail. Use a loose hair tie made of fabric and avoid rubber bands."

Though you may have spent a hefty chunk of change getting your hair braided, if they are way too tight and are causing you pain, the best solution is to remove them. You can take them out yourself or go back to the hair salon and ask your stylist to take them out. Let your stylist know that they are too tight and are causing you pain. [6] X Research source"
