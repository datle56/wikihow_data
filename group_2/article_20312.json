If you have an iPhone or an iPad on which you're logged in with an Apple ID that you've never used to purchase an Apple Music subscription, you can try Apple Music for free for three months. Apple Music allows you to download and listen to a huge selection of songs for free. At the end of the three months, you'll need to pay for any additional months or cancel your membership. Unfortunately, this is more of a quick fix than a long-term solution—Apple Music songs will be deleted from your iPhone if you cancel your subscription."
