No freeways, and no boats to drive your car on. If there is a pedestrian-friendly ferry on your route, you should not enable \"Avoid ferries.\" \"Avoid tolls\" usually doesn't matter either way, but there are some situations in which you should disable this. For example, if you're crossing a border with a toll for cars but not pedestrians, having \"Avoid tolls\" on would not send you through the crossing. Disable \"Prefer fuel-efficient routes.\" If you're driving, this option might give you a longer route if Google thinks it'll save you gas. Since you're walking, it's not worth the risk.
