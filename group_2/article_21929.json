      "content": "A hard launch is the official debut your relationship on social media. Unlike a soft launch, when you vaguely hint at your partner but keep your relationship status or their identity a secret, a hard launch leaves no doubt that you’re together. [7] X Research source It usually comes in the form of a post that features cute and romantic couple pictures. A hard launch often has no build-up, surprising all but your closest friends and family. Some people soft launch their relationship before they do a hard launch Instagram post. Others only do a hard launch—even waiting until they’re engaged or married to share their relationship on social media. Hard launches aren’t just for relationships. You can hard launch other life milestones like moving, starting a new job, a pregnancy, or having a baby."
