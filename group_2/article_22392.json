Once the initial one week period of isolation is over, the new cat is successfully using the litter box, and appears comfortable in his new environment, allow him to explore the rest of the house. However, only do so after placing your existing cat in another room; it is still too soon to bring the two cats together. This exploring opportunity will allow the new cat to become familiar with the existing cat’s smell. If you prefer, you can exchange the two cats’ bedding overnight. This too will allow the cats to become acquainted with each other’s smell."

This is an exciting turning point, however, this initial introduction must be done slowly and carefully. Introduce the cats together by placing a barrier between the two of them so there is no way they can come in full body contact. For instance, you might place them in adjacent rooms with the door shut. Be sure that you are home to monitor the two cats’ interaction regardless of which barrier method you choose. Do not let the cats interact until they both appear fairly calm around each other. Mild aggressive behavior, such as hissing and then walking away, can be normal behavior for cats who have been apart for several weeks. Aggression is one way that cats communicate with one another, and mild aggression is usually okay as long as they are not fighting. [8] X Research source"
