      "title": "Listen for noises when you turn the steering wheel.",
      "content": "Listen for noises when you turn the steering wheel. If you hear a whining, moaning or shrieking sound, your power steering system pump could be seriously low on fluid."

      "title": "Notice how freely the steering wheel turns.",
      "content": "Notice how freely the steering wheel turns. Normally, you should be able to turn the steering wheel with little effort whenever you want to steer the car into a curve or around a corner. If you find it a major effort to turn the steering wheel to turn the car, your power steering system is going out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for power steering fluid leaks.",
      "content": "Check for power steering fluid leaks. If you notice a stain on the ground under your car when it sits for a long period, fluid may be leaking from your car. If the stain appears amber, pink or red, it may be power steering fluid. If you have trouble figuring out what color the stain is, place a sheet of white butcher paper under your car when you leave it parked for several hours. The color will be easier to see against a white background."

      "title": "Warn other drivers.",
      "content": "Warn other drivers. If your power steering fails while you are moving at high speed, your first instinct will be to panic. Instead, turn on your flashers and honk your horn to let other drivers know you are having sudden car problems. This will cause them to get out of your way. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Move toward the side of the road.",
      "content": "Move toward the side of the road. Do this as carefully as you can; without power, it will be much harder to steer your car. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the car to a gradual stop, slowing the car gradually.",
      "content": "Bring the car to a gradual stop, slowing the car gradually. Slamming the brakes may throw the car into a skid that would be difficult to steer out of with power steering and almost impossible to steer out of without it. If your car's power steering goes out because of the engine stalling, your brakes will feel stiffer if you have power brakes, forcing you to hit the pedal harder and depress it lower than normal. You may also have to downshift to a lower gear or use the friction of a guardrail, gravel shoulder or cement divider to slow the car enough for the brakes to do the rest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Restart the engine if it stalled.",
      "content": "Restart the engine if it stalled. Turn the steering wheel in either direction to see how well it turns. If it turns as freely as usual, pull back onto the roadway and continue driving as normal. If it doesn't, either drive slowly to the nearest mechanic or call for a tow truck."
