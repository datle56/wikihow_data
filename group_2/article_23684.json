      "content": "Add healthy fatty foods to your diet. The best-known means of naturally increasing your body’s bile production is to eat more foods with lots of healthy fats. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some of the best fatty foods to eat include avocados, fatty fish like salmon, and various nuts. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Some good nuts to eat for better bile production may include cashews and almonds in particular. You might be able to increase your bile production by eating fats in general. However, it’s better for your overall health to stick to healthy fats."

      "content": "Consume polyunsaturated fats to lower your cholesterol as well. Polyunsaturated fats do a markedly better job of lowering the amount of cholesterol in your body than saturated fats do. Since they also help to increase your body’s bile production, this makes polyunsaturated fats a particularly good part of your optimal diet. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aim to have 15–20% of your calories come from polyunsaturated fats per day (1 gram of fat contains 9 calories). [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Some foods that contain polyunsaturated fats include: [5] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Walnuts Sunflower seeds Flax seeds or flax oil Olive oil Canola oil Corn oil Soybean oil"

      "content": "Drink semi-skimmed milk to help empty your gallbladder. Studies have shown that drinking 250 mL (8.5 fl oz) of semi-skimmed milk can empty your gallbladder by nearly half. Since the gallbladder stores the bile produced by your liver, this is a good way to quickly increase the amount of bile released in your body. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Note that this won’t necessarily increase the amount of bile produced by your liver. This method is a particularly good solution for people whose bile problems stem from their gallbladder. Study participants who drank semi-skimmed milk saw the volume of their gallbladders change after about 40 minutes."

      "content": "Try celery, radishes, and artichokes to increase bile healthily. Some people report that eating these foods (or an extract from them) naturally increases the amount of bile in your body. More studies are needed to confirm the effect of these foods, but preliminary findings show that artichoke extract can increase bile production temporarily after consuming it. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Similarly, animal testing shows that radishes can increase the gallbladder’s bile secretion. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source These foods are said to stimulate your liver’s bile production, so this may be a good option for you if you have bile deficiency from liver problems."

      "content": "Eat garlic and onions for a tasty way to increase bile. Some studies suggest that adding garlic or onions to your meals may be a good way to increase the amount of bile in your body. These foods also prevent the nucleation of cholesterol in your gallbladder, meaning they help to prevent the formation of gallstones.

      "content": "See a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis of your condition. In order to embark on the right treatment regimen, it’s important to know exactly what’s causing your bile deficiency. For the best results, visit a gastroenterologist who specializes in the digestive tract and who will have the most experience dealing with bile and the gallbladder. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor will likely perform a visual examination of your reported symptoms and may have a blood test done to check for certain liver and gallbladder diseases. Some common causes of low bile include gallbladder conditions, cholestasis (the slowing or stopping of bile in your biliary system), liver conditions, or blockages in your bile ducts."

      "content": "Be sure to stay hydrated throughout the day. Since bile is composed primarily of water, your bile production tends to suffer when you’re dehydrated and increases when you drink. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aim to drink around 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water a day for men or 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) a day for women, but note that you should drink more water if you exercise a lot or you’re pregnant. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Drink water whenever you feel thirsty or hungry and have a glass with every meal. If you often have trouble staying hydrated, consider investing in a portable water bottle that’ll make it easier to drink water throughout the day. Try to drink water as soon as you wake up. This is a good way to increase your hydration in the morning and to set yourself up for a healthy day overall."

      "content": "Avoid eating too much sugar or processed food. Having a diet high in sugar and processed foods is closely linked with gallbladder disease, which can affect your body’s bile production. Since sugars and processed foods are also linked with several other health problems, it’s probably best to avoid them as much as you can. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try munching on sweet fruits like grapes, apples, and strawberries if you have a craving for sugary foods. If you think your bile problems are the result of eating too much sugary or processed foods, talk to your doctor to get an official diagnosis. It’s important to make sure you don’t have a more serious illness like gallbladder disease."

      "content": "Consider taking bile salt supplements. Bile salts may help to regulate your body’s bile production if you have gallbladder problems, as well as lower your cholesterol. However, you should only take this course of action if recommended by your doctor to correct an underlying condition as more study is needed to verify the efficacy of bile salts in humans. However, animal testing has shown that bile salt supplementation can help the digestion and metabolism of fats. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can buy bile salt supplements at most pharmacies and vitamin stores. Follow your doctor’s recommended dosage instructions exactly as excess bile salts that make their way into the colon can trigger side effects including diarrhea.
