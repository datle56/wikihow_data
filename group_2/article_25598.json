      "content": "Push each end of the lace up through the bottom tabs. Thread the shoelace through the center tab at the bottom of your shoe and pull the lace taut so it’s the same length on both sides. Then, push the left lace up through the bottom left tab. Grab the right lace and thread it up through the bottom right tab. [1] X Research source Nike Air Max 95s have fabric tabs that you thread the laces through in place of the traditional metal eyelets. However, the fabric tabs work the same as the eyelets."

Then, thread the lace up through the tab above and diagonal to it on the left side of the shoe.

Then, push the laces up through the tabs above them on the opposite side of the shoe. Just work carefully and slowly so the laces don’t get twisted. [4] X Research source Note : There are no tongue slits for the 3 tabs at the top of the shoe. Simply thread the laces up through the tabs above and diagonal to them."

Then, thread the laces up through the loop from underneath. Simply pull on the laces to tighten the knot. [5] X Research source Feel free to tie your laces in a different way, if you prefer. For instance, tie them in a knot behind the tongue and tuck them out of sight. Or, tie a traditional bunny ears knot."

Then, lightly pull the lace up through the tab above it and on the right side of the shoe. Just don’t pull the lace taut to keep the lacing loose. [7] X Research source Tip: Hold your finger under the shoelace as you thread it through the tab. This keeps the lacing loose by preventing you from pulling the lace taut across the tongue."

To keep the laces from coming undone, create a loop near the base of the tab. Then, pull the lace through the loop to tie a knot . This gives your shoes a casual, relaxed look. [10] X Research source As an alternative, thread the left lace up through the top-right tab. Then, push the right lace up through the top-left tab.
