      "title": "“I look good in orange” is a meme about being okay with jail time.",
      "content": "“I look good in orange” is a meme about being okay with jail time. TikToks featuring this meme (like this one from creator @loyalpbboet) typically say, “When another girl talks to him but I look good in orange.” This is a coded way for the TikToker to imply that they are okay with going to prison—and wearing an orange jumpsuit—as punishment for harming the person who’s talking to their partner. The meme is like a jokey warning to people who approach your partner, exaggerating what people are driven to do when they feel jealous—like in the viral SZA song “Kill Bill.” This meme isn’t used only by girls. Guys have posted the same meme, acknowledging that anyone can be jealous in a relationship."

      "title": "“I look good in orange” is an example of algospeak.",
      "content": "“I look good in orange” is an example of algospeak. Algospeak refers to using code words to avoid censorship online. Reporter Taylor Lorenz coined the term to describe the phenomenon of TikTokers using terms like “mascara,” “unalive,” “corn,” and “panorama” to talk about topics like sex and relationships, violence and death, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These codes arose because people suspected their videos would be hidden by the algorithm if they contained explicit language. [2] X Research source “I look good in orange” is an example of algospeak. Instead of saying something like, “I would fight anyone that flirts with my partner and go to jail,” TikTokers make a veiled reference to the act."

      "title": "Know that experiencing jealousy in a relationship is common.",
      "content": "Know that experiencing jealousy in a relationship is common. While not everyone feels jealous when someone talks to their partner, it’s okay if you do. It could stem from being cheated on in the past or having valid concerns about someone flirting with your partner. Whether or not feelings of jealousy are valid depends on the situation, but it’s best to communicate with your partner when you feel jealous , says Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC. Ratson says you can start with something like, “When you talk to this woman or flirt with that woman [...] it makes me feel kind of sad and down.” Don’t place blame on your partner—focus on working through your feelings together. When you find yourself feeling jealous, pause to acknowledge and accept the feeling. Only then can you address it. If you push it down, you might let feelings build up and manifest as resentment toward your partner. [3] X Research source"

Jealousy like what’s joked about in the “I look good in orange” meme is unhealthy—and even abusive if you actually try to harm people who talk to your partner or control who your partner sees. If you find yourself exhibiting these behaviors, consider seeking counseling to address the root of your insecurities and learn healthy coping mechanisms. [4] X Research source Don’t forget to communicate openly with your partner. They may not realize that what they’re doing upsets you."

      "content": "Orange usually looks best on people with warm undertones. You have warm undertones if the veins inside your wrist appear more green than blue. If your skin tone is too deep for the vein test, wear a white T-shirt and look at your face. Does it appear more yellow than pink? That’s another sign you have warm undertones. [7] X Research source Still stuck? Take our simple quiz to find out your skin undertones. If you’re considered an Autumn or a Spring color season after a professional analysis, you have warm skin undertones. Some people have neutral undertones, which means they’re flattered equally by colors meant for cool and warm undertones."

      "content": "Orange peel theory In January 2024, “orange peel theory” went viral on TikTok. The trend saw users like @angelac0123 asking their partner to peel them an orange as a way to test if they were willing to do a small task to make you happy. The theory was that a good partner would peel the orange, while someone who didn’t really love you would refuse the request. [11] X Research source Like many TikTok theories, orange peel theory lacks a scientific basis. It’s not wise to gauge someone’s love for you based on whether or not they’ll peel a fruit for you in a specific moment—there are many other ways people show love and kindness."

      "content": "The Boyfriend/Girlfriend Effect In 2023, people began uploading videos to TikTok showing what they dubbed “The Boyfriend Effect.” The trend showcases how they look before and after a relationship. Usually, they’re dressed up before they get a boyfriend, and dress casually without makeup after. The theory is that they become confident with their natural look because their partner makes them feel comfortable being themselves. [12] X Research source Some TikTokers made “The Girlfriend Effect” trend in late 2023. However, it’s slightly different from the boyfriend effect. TikToks about the trend show guys having a glow-up once they get a girlfriend, presumably because she empowers them to find their sense of style. [13] X Research source"
