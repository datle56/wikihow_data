      "title": "Choose an interior mount if you have sturdy, square window frames.",
      "content": "Choose an interior mount if you have sturdy, square window frames. An interior mount involves hanging the shades inside of the window frame. This is a good option if your window frames are deeper than 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm). When you use an interior mounting style, you'll attach the Roman shades to the downward-facing surface on the upper interior of the window frame (often called the frame's “ceiling”). [1] X Research source Mounting your Roman shades in the interior style is a good option if you have strong window frames that can bear the weight of the heavy shades. An interior mount also gives a more finished look, and it doesn't cover up the top of the window-frame molding."

      "title": "Check if the window frame is level before mounting the brackets.",
      "content": "Check if the window frame is level before mounting the brackets. As a result of old age or poor construction, window frames often have a slightly uneven “ceiling.” Use a level to test whether or not the frame is even. Hold the level up against the frame's “ceiling,” and make sure that the small bubble is clearly in the middle of the marked section on the tool. [2] X Research source If you're using an exterior mount, you won't need to check that the frame itself is level, since you won't be attaching the shade to the frame."

      "title": "Shim the frame if it's not level so your Roman shades hang evenly.",
      "content": "Shim the frame if it's not level so your Roman shades hang evenly. If your frame ceiling is not level, you will need to insert a couple small shims to even it out. Begin by using a hammer to pry off the molding from around the edges of your window frame. Then, place the tapered end of a shim between the window frame and the wall on the low (sagging) end of the frame. Lightly tap the shim in by at least 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) to raise that side of the frame. Use your level to see if the frame is evened out after every 3-4 hammer taps. A shim is a thin, angled piece of wood that will make the ceiling level when nailed in place. You can purchase shims at any hardware store or home-improvement store. Once the window frame is level, snap off the ends of the shims that are sticking out past the end of the frame. Then, use your hammer to reattach the molding around the window frame. You should be able to stick the nails back in the same holds that you pried them out of earlier."

      "title": "Measure the shade's headrail with a tape measure.",
      "content": "Measure the shade's headrail with a tape measure. The shade's headrail is the long top metal piece of the shade, from which the fabric shades themselves descend. Measuring the headrail will help you find the location where you'll mount the brackets that hold up the headrail. Hook the metal prong of your tape measure and extend the tape to the far end of the headrail. Then use the tape measure to find the width of the interior of your window frames. [3] X Research source Note that if the headrail is longer than the window frame is wide, you must use an exterior mount."

      "title": "Mark the 2 bracket locations on the frame with a pencil.",
      "content": "Mark the 2 bracket locations on the frame with a pencil. Extend your tape measure to the exact length of the headrail, and hold it up inside of the window frame, against the frame's “ceiling.” Lightly mark the endpoints of the headrail. Then, measure in 3 inches (7.6 cm) on either side of the headrail's endpoints. Mark these 2 spots with a pencil. These markings will indicate where you'll hang the 2 brackets. [4] X Research source For example, say that the headrail measures 24 inches (61 cm) long. To find the locations for the brackets, measure in 3 inches (7.6 cm) on either side. So, you'll place 1 mark at the 3 in (7.6 cm) point and another at the 21 in (53 cm) point. Once you've marked the locations for the brackets, you can erase the light markings that indicated the endpoints of the headrail."

      "title": "Place an “X” on the 2 screw locations for each of the brackets.",
      "content": "Place an “X” on the 2 screw locations for each of the brackets. Pick up 1 of the C-shaped metal brackets and hold it in place on top of the pencil markings you just drew. The bracket should have 2 screw holes. Use your pencil to place a small “X” in each of the holes. You'll use these markings to insert the screws that hold the brackets in place. [5] X Research source Then, repeat the process, holding the bracket up in the second bracket location that you marked earlier. Use a pencil to marking the 2 locations where you'll insert screws to hold the second bracket in place."

      "title": "Drill pilot holes upward into the “ceiling” of the window frame.",
      "content": "Drill pilot holes upward into the “ceiling” of the window frame. Insert a 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) drill bit into your electric drill. Hold the drill vertically with the bit pointing up, so that the tip touches 1 of the “X” spots you just marked. Drill a pilot hole in each of the 4 marked locations. Drill each pilot hole 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. [6] X Research source If you didn't drill pilot holes, the screws used to hold up the brackets would splinter the wood."

      "title": "Screw the brackets into the pilot holes with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Screw the brackets into the pilot holes with a screwdriver. Place each bracket on the marked location on the wall. Line up the brackets with the pilot holes that you just drilled in the window frame and slip the 2 screws through the holes in the brackets. Use a screwdriver to screw them in place. [7] X Research source Use the brackets and screws that came with your Roman shades for installation. This makes installation more convenient and cheaper than if you had to buy new screws from a hardware store. Different brands of Roman shades may have slightly different installation methods. If you get confused, follow the specific directions that came with yours."

      "title": "Slide the shades into place in the mounted brackets to secure them.",
      "content": "Slide the shades into place in the mounted brackets to secure them. Roman shades are outfitted with twin brackets that click into place with the brackets you've attached to the wall. To install your shades, slide the top of the shades forward until the two brackets click into place. Make sure that the headrail is centered over the window. [8] X Research source At this point, the shades should be secured in the frame. If you need to remove them at a later date, just give a sharp tug in the direction opposite the way you slid them into position."

      "title": "Drive a head screw into each end bracket to secure the shade.",
      "content": "Drive a head screw into each end bracket to secure the shade. Lift up the Roman shade so that you're looking beneath it at the bottom of the brackets. Pick up the short 2 in (5.1 cm) head screws that came with the Roman shade kit and thread them into visible hole in each of the 2 brackets. Using your screwdriver again, tighten the head screw firmly into headrail. [9] X Research source These head screws will prevent the headrail from popping out of the bracket if you give the cord too sharp of a tug."

      "title": "Use an exterior mount if the window frames are rectangular or shallow.",
      "content": "Use an exterior mount if the window frames are rectangular or shallow. Selecting an exterior mount makes the most sense if your frames are less than 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) deep. To find out if your frames are rectangular, measure diagonally across your window frame with a tape measure. First measure inside of the window frame from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. Then measure again from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Compare the 2 numbers to figure out if your window is square. [10] X Research source If the 2 measurements differ by over 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm), your windows aren't square and you need to use an external mount. Exterior mounts are helpful if you would like to make a window appear larger than it really is. An external frame is also the best option if you have walls made of a strong material, like wood, brick, or concrete. Also use an exterior mount if your window frame is worn or splintering and would like to cover it up."

      "title": "Measure the headrail and mark the locations of the endcaps on the wall.",
      "content": "Measure the headrail and mark the locations of the endcaps on the wall. The headrail is a long metal upper piece of the shade that the shade's fabric comes down from. Take the length measurement of your headrail and of the top of your window frame. Find the midpoint of both distances, and center your headrail above the window frame. Mark the location of both endcaps of the headrail on the wall with a pencil. [11] X Research source Large Roman shades used in an exterior mount may have multiple metal brackets to support the shades' weight. In this case, the additional brackets will be spaced evenly within the space between the 2 edge brackets located 3 inches (7.6 cm) in. Mark these locations on the frame or wall as well."

      "content": "Mark 2 points 3 in (7.6 cm) in from the ends of the headrail. These points are where you'll center the 2 brackets that hold up the Roman shade. Use your tape measure to measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) in from each side of the measured length of the headrail. Then use a pencil to mark both of the 2 locations on the wall above your window frame with a small “X.” [12] X Research source If your Roman shade headrail comes with multiple loose brackets, space them evenly over the top of the shade."

      "title": "Pre-drill pilot holes if you're installing shades onto drywall or plastic.",
      "content": "Pre-drill pilot holes if you're installing shades onto drywall or plastic. With an exterior mount, you could be dealing with either of these types of materials. Since plastic and drywall are a little brittle, drilling directly into them could fracture the material. To drill a pilot hole, drill a hole through the wall above the frame using a 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) drill bit. Each of the 4 pilot holes you drill should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. [13] X Research source These screws and fasteners should be included with the Roman shade when you purchase it. If not, you can purchase them from a hardware store."

      "title": "Use a carbide drill to drill pilot holes in concrete, stone, brick, or tile.",
      "content": "Use a carbide drill to drill pilot holes in concrete, stone, brick, or tile. These materials are dense and sturdy and a regular steel drill bit won't be able to penetrate them. If you are mounting your exterior Roman shades on one of these substances, you'll need to use a 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) carbide drill bit drill the pilot hole. Hold the drill so the bit is at a 90° angle to the wall, and drill the 4 pilot holes each 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. [14] X Research source Carbide is a type of coating that manufacturers put on the tip of steel bits to make them carbide bits. Carbide bits are sharper than ordinary steel bits, and will retain their sharpness even after drilling through concrete or brick."

      "content": "Screw the brackets into the pilot holes with a screwdriver. Place 1 of the brackets in position so that its 2 holes line up with 2 of the pilot holes you just drilled. Set the tip of a screw in each of the holes. Then, using your screwdriver, turn the screws clockwise until they're held tight against the wall. Repeat the process with the second bracket. At this point, you're almost finished! [15] X Research source Unless parts are missing from the shade-installation kit, you shouldn't need to purchase any additional brackets or screws. If you are installing your Roman shade in material other than wood, you will need different types of screws or fasteners. For example, you will need to use hollow wall anchors or toggle bolts if you are hanging Roman shades in plastic or drywall."

      "title": "Attach the shades' headrail to the wall by snapping it in to the brackets.",
      "content": "Attach the shades' headrail to the wall by snapping it in to the brackets. For exterior-mounted Roman shades, the headrail should have 2 indentations where it snaps onto the brackets. Angle the headrail upward and push the top into the brackets, then pull downward until the headrail snaps into place. This should secure the headrail (and attached shades) in place. [16] X Research source In some sets of shades, you may need to snap the headrail into place first and then snap the shades into the headrail once it's in place. To remove the headrail at a later date, tilt the headrail downward and give it a sharp tug out and away from the wall."

      "title": "Pull on the cord that adjusts the shades to raise or lower them.",
      "content": "Pull on the cord that adjusts the shades to raise or lower them. Give the cord a tug to verify that the shades are secure and functional. If the shades come away from the wall when you pull and release the cord, check to make sure that all screws and fasteners are tightened. You may also need to snip off small plastic loops holding the shade in its “closed” position. [17] X Research source If you've opted for a set of cordless Roman shades, you can raise and lower the shades simply by grasping the handle behind the shade and raising or lowering it to the level you'd like it to be at.
