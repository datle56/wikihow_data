You should get a restraining order if your abuser has caused either physical or mental harm in the past or if they pose a possible threat in the future. There are many actions that can be considered threats. It is abuse if they threaten to or do inflict physical harm through attacks, strikes, or rough physical contact to you or your children. It is abuse if they commit sexual assault or molestation against you or your children. It is also a threat to you if they harass or stalk you or your children. The destruction of personal property is also considered a threat to you and your children's life. For example, a woman and her children are being bothered by the woman's previous boyfriend. One day he breaks into the woman's house or car window. When this happens, the woman can file for a restraining order on behalf of herself and her children. Even if the boyfriend still lives in the home, she can get a restraining order if he has acted violently toward her and her children."
