Remember, the strength of your tea depends on how much water you add at the end, so feel free to select your favorite black tea as the base flavor! Turkish teas are divided into 3 main strength classes: strong dark teas known as koyu; medium deep brownish red teas called tavşan kanı, which means rabbit's blood; and weak light teas called açık. [1] X Research source Try dark tea leaves like Darjeeling, Assam, and Nilgiri for a nice strong base. Purchase herbal teas like mint, apple, rosehip, or lemon ginger if you prefer your tea with a stronger flavor."

If you're going to use tap water, let it run on cold for about 10 seconds before filling up your pot so it absorbs heat faster. [2] X Research source"
