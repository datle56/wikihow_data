      "content": "After your bottle has been rinsed and dried, pour a large amount of pure sea salt into the bottle. You should use enough so it covers the entire bottom of the container. Salt dries out the skin and helps heal any 'open wounds', almost like scabbing over. You want this inside your piercing."

      "title": "Next, pour the hydrogen peroxide into the bottle with the salt.",
      "content": "Next, pour the hydrogen peroxide into the bottle with the salt. Don't use too much, the purpose of this is to get into the piercing and foam out any infection. Peroxide is also good to use as mouthwash if you have a gum infection."

      "content": "Now, open your bottle, and pour a small amount (about 2 cupfuls) of Isopropyl Alcohol into the bottle. Isopropyl Alcohol kills germs on contact, instantly. It also adds a scent to your mixture."

      "title": "Add two small drops of Tea Tree Oil to the mixture, using a small dropper.",
      "content": "Add two small drops of Tea Tree Oil to the mixture, using a small dropper. The purpose for this is because tea tree oil is a natural anti-septic, and it will further kill any infection/germs/bacteria in the piercing, or on the jewelry and skin itself. Also, it adds moisture to the skin around the site, to avoid peeling and dry, itchy skin. It also adds a nice scent to your cleanser."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a small amount of Vegetable Glycerin to the bottle.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of Vegetable Glycerin to the bottle. Add more than a few drops, but not as much as the alcohol. This is a more important step, although not mandatory. I strongly suggest it, because the Isopropyl Alcohol and Sea Salt are both astringents,and will severely dry out your skin in and around the piercing. Vegetable Glycerin is an all-natural skin cleanser, and it adds moisture and balance to skin. It also increases skin elasticity, and is very gentle. You can even eat it to loosen your stools!"

    {
      "title": "The last optional step is to add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to your cleanser.",
      "content": "The last optional step is to add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to your cleanser. I add this to mine because my skin becomes irritated and flaky due to the drying agents of sea salt, peroxide and isopropyl alcohol being continuously exposed to my skin 3+ times every day. Jojoba is a golden oil that is naturally found in a nut. It adds a large amount of oil to skin/hair. It is a skin softener, and if added to your mixture, will guarantee that your skin won't be damaged by the cleanser."
