It also removes many security measures Apple has in place. This puts your iPhone at risk of downloading viruses and malware. Some apps may stop working on a jailbroken iPhone. In rare cases, the jailbreak process can render your iPhone inoperable. Jailbreaking is not supported by Apple and will void any warranty you still have on your iPhone. Continue at your own risk. Also be aware that all jailbreaks for iOS 12 and higher are semi-untethered jailbreaks. This means the jailbreak will work until you restart your iPhone. Once you restart your iPhone, you will need to use the Checkra1n app on your computer to reactivate the jailbreak."

This puts your phone at greater risk of viruses and malware. Some apps and services may stop working on a rooted phone. Many carriers do not support rooting your phone and may deny access to their network. In most cases, rooting your phone will void the warranty from your carrier or phone's manufacturer. Continue at your own risk. Many phone models and carriers do not allow you to unlock the bootloader. If you are unable to unlock the bootloader, you may be able to find an unofficial way to unlock your bootloader at https://forum.xda-developers.com/ . If you can't find an unofficial way to unlock the bootloader on your phone, it is unlikely you will be able to root your phone. Unlocking the bootloader on Samsung phones will break the Knox security system.
