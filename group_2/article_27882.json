      "title": "Buying quality products can help your manicure last.",
      "content": "Buying quality products can help your manicure last. We know nail products can get expensive, but more often than not, the price ensures a longer-lasting product. Even if you buy the cheapest nail kit, always add a higher-end nail glue to your purchase. The better glue you have, the longer your manicure will last. [1] X Research source Nail experts recommend looking for nail glues with a fine-tip brush applicator and a quick-drying formula (these will be labeled on the product’s packaging). [2] X Research source The nails themselves matter, too. Look for press-on nails that are durable and well-made. Thin nails can be flimsy and lead to more issues. Always read reviews to find reliable options, as price doesn’t always reflect quality."

      "content": "Wearing the wrong size nails can cause them to pop off prematurely. So, measure your nails before pressing on your manicure, and then file or cut the nails down to fit perfectly over your natural nails. [3] X Research source Shape your press-on nails so they lay flush with your nail bed and don’t overlap with your cuticles or skin. [4] X Research source As for the length of your nails, opt for whatever fits your daily life best. For instance, if you work with your hands throughout the day, choose a shorter manicure to avoid snagging your nails."

      "content": "Drying and roughening up your nail beds ensures the press-ons adhere well. Doing a little bit of preparation before applying fake nails can go a long way. While simply pressing the nails on is convenient, it could cause them to pop off sooner. Here’s what you can do: Clean the surface of your natural nails with acetone or nail polish remover to get rid of any oils. [5] X Research source Buff the surface of your nails with a buffing tool so the fake nails have something to adhere to. [6] X Research source Apply a base coat to your natural nail before applying the press-on glue or adhesive to protect your nails from potential damage. Dry your nails completely before applying press-on nails, and avoid exposing them to water for at least an hour before application. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Double gluing your nails can help your fake manicure last even longer.",
      "content": "Double gluing your nails can help your fake manicure last even longer. Simply add a thin layer of glue to your natural nail, covering it completely. Then, put a drop of glue in the middle of the back of the press-on nail, avoiding the edges. [8] X Research source Coat your natural nail well with adhesive or glue to avoid air bubbles or pockets. This can cause your press-on nail to rise, leading it to fall off faster. So, always add an even layer to prevent them from popping off prematurely."

      "title": "Secure the press-ons firmly to your nail beds so they last.",
      "content": "Secure the press-ons firmly to your nail beds so they last. When applying your press-on nails, hold each fake nail onto your natural nail for at least 30 seconds before letting go. This secures the bond between the glue and your real and fake nail, giving the nails the best chance to last. [9] X Research source As a general tip, apply your fake nails at an angle for the best results. Place the nail up against your cuticle line and press it down at a downward angle.

      "content": "The quick application of press-on nails may be why they fall off. For longer-lasting press-ons, try the alternative method of painting your natural nail with a clear gel polish . Then, cure or dry them under a UV light for 10 to 15 seconds. Lastly, apply a thin coat of gel polish to the back of the fake nail before pressing it onto your nail, curing it for another 10 to 15 seconds. [12] X Research source This trick replaces the need for adhesive or glue, creating a stronger bond with the gel polish. Check the packaging of your press-on nails before trying this trick, as some products caution users against curing as it could warp the nails."

When you wash your hands, dry your nails quickly and efficiently. Try to also avoid washing your hair to ensure the adhesive dries and secures to your nails completely. If you need to wash the dishes or do any household cleaning, wear gloves. [14] X Research source"
