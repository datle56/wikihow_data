There are two versions of BitTorrent available for Windows: BitTorrent Classic is the traditional desktop version of the app. You can use it to download , share, and schedule torrents, and even manage your torrents remotely using the Android version of the app. There are more customization options in Classic than the Web version. BitTorrent Web runs in your web browser. It has many of the same features as BitTorrent Classic (minus remote downloading and scheduling), but also allows you to earn BTT cryptocurrency tokens, which you can then use to increase your download speeds. [1] X Research source You can also use the Web version to start playing torrented music and videos before your download completes. If you're familiar with uTorrent , you'll notice that the download options for uTorrent and BitTorrent are identical—both apps are now developed by the same company and have nearly identical interfaces."
