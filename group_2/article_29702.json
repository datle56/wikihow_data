For regular Snapchatters, Snapchat creates a public profile for them when they create an account, as long as they're 16 or older and public profiles are available in their region. A regular public profile lets Snapchatters show off their creativity and allows them to start growing an audience. It's a great way for artists, influencers, or other individuals without a business to connect with their audience on another social platform. Snapchat doesn't automatically create a public profile for business accounts. Someone at the business must create a public profile for the business account via the Snapchat Ads Manager. A business public profile allows businesses to connect with their customers. Businesses can post content about their business to their page, and they can also use the public profile to start advertising on Snapchat. Snapchat even allows businesses to set up a storefront on their public profile so customers can buy from them directly in the app."
