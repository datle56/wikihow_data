      "content": "Combine the sugar and eggs in a bowl until a pale-yellow paste forms. Then, mix in the vanilla and salt. Smaller servings of microwave brownies can be made directly in a mug, but because you are working with such a large amount, you'll need to mix it in a separate bowl first. If you are vegan, mix 2 tablespoons (14 grams) of flaxseed meal with 5 tablespoons (74 milliliters) of water in a small dish. Wait 5 minutes for it to thicken, then add to the recipe. [3] X Research source If you are using the vegan option, consider adding ½ to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 grams) of baking soda as well. This will help make the brownies more tender. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the flour and cocoa powder in a separate bowl.",
      "content": "Mix the flour and cocoa powder in a separate bowl. Use a fork to break up any lumps, clumps, or chunks. Mixing these two ingredients separately will help them mix into the rest a little more evenly."

      "title": "Sift the flour mixture into the sugar, butter, and egg mixture, and fold the batter until evenly mixed.",
      "content": "Sift the flour mixture into the sugar, butter, and egg mixture, and fold the batter until evenly mixed. Sifting will help the batter to not have lumps and will result in a smoother batter with no grainy texture. There should be no lumps, clumps, or chunks when you are done. Be careful not to over-mix, however, or your brownies will end up too tough and chewy. Consider adding 1 cup (125 grams) of chopped walnuts for a crunchy texture. [6] X Research source If you don't like walnuts, you can try another type of nuts, such as pecans or pistachios."

      "content": "Pour the batter into a lightly greased glass baking dish. The ideal size to work with is 8 by 8 by 2 inches (20.32 by 20.32 by 5.08 centimeters). For extra texture, scatter ½ cup (90 grams) of chocolate chips or chunks on top of the batter after you have poured it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Microwave the brownies, uncovered, on high until cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes. After every minute, you will want to pause the microwave and rotate the baking dish. Keep cooking until there is a 1¼ inch (3.18 centimeters) wide moist spot in the center. Cooking times will vary depending on the strength of your microwave. A 1,100-watt microwave will cook brownies in about 3 to 4 minutes. [8] X Research source"

A 1000 watt microwave will cook a brownie in abut 1 minute and 40 seconds. [13] X Research source When cooked, there will be no liquid left. The brownie will still look a little moist, however. You do not need to cover the mug when cooking it. If you don't know how strong your microwave is, start at 1 minute, then cook at 30-second intervals until fully cooked."
