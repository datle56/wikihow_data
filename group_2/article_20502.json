      "title": "Yes, SHEIN offers a one-time refund without requiring a return.",
      "content": "Yes, SHEIN offers a one-time refund without requiring a return. When some customers start a return on SHEIN , they receive a message that reads, “You are welcome to keep the item without returning it, no return label will be sent.” If you receive this message, it means that SHEIN will refund you for your order, but you do not need to send the order back to them. However, this seems to happen at random, and it may not apply to all orders. If you do not receive this message, you’ll likely need to return your items to receive your refund."

      "content": "This one-time refund without a return is issued at random. There’s no concrete way to make sure you receive the message that allows you to keep your purchased items while receiving a refund. There are, however, several unconfirmed theories about how to increase your chances of being selected. Some people believe that SHEIN will allow you to keep your items if they are low in cost. If the cost of picking up and shipping the item outweighs the cost of the item itself, SHEIN might issue the message allowing you to keep your purchase and still receive a refund. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that this only occurs one time per person. It can only occur for one purchase made through your specific SHEIN account with your payment method and address."

      "content": "This policy could increase brand goodwill and loyalty. Returning items to get a refund can be a bit of a hassle. By offering to refund certain orders without requiring a return, SHEIN increases convenience for customers.

      "title": "The cost of returning the item could be higher than the cost of the item itself.",
      "content": "The cost of returning the item could be higher than the cost of the item itself. If you’re trying to return a very inexpensive order , the cost of picking it up and shipping it back to SHEIN may outweigh the cost of the order itself. In these situations, it makes more sense for SHEIN to allow you to keep the item. By doing this, SHEIN would actually be saving money. [2] X Research source"

Indicate the reason for the return, and then click “Next Step.” SHEIN’s website states that you can only return unworn, unwashed, undamaged items that still have the original tag attached. The website also includes a list of items that are not eligible for return or exchange. The list includes: Bodysuits, lingerie, beauty underwear, event and party supplies, DIY supplies, pet supplies, and accessories (except scarves, bags, and mermaid blankets). SHEIN does not offer refunds on cosmetics if the hygiene seal is broken. [3] X Research source"
