      "content": "Whip up a super easy outfit using a baby onesie. Choose a baby onesie that fits your dog and put it on your pup. Mark a hole for your dog's tail and an opening for their crotch so they can go potty while wearing the outfit. Take the onesie off your pup and cut out the holes. Review this handy chart that converts infant and toddler sizes to dog sizes: [1] X Research source Newborn : Up to a 7 lb (3.18 kg) dog 3 Months : 7-12 lb (3.18 kg-5.44 kg) dog 3-6 Months : 12-16 lb (5.44 kg-7.26 kg) dog 9-12 Months : 17-22 lb (7.71 kg-9.98 kg) dog If the onesie is a little big, mark the loose portions. Take your dog out of the onesie, cut off the excess fabric, and sew the sides of the onesie back together."

      "content": "Make a cute winter set with a low-cut sock and an extra low-cut sock. Cut the toe off the low-cut sock. Measure your dog from its neck to its arms. Add 0.12 inches (0.30 cm) to this measurement so the sweater fits your dog comfortably. Mark the measurement on the sock. Then, draw a circle at the point where your dog’s arm is on each side, and cut out the circles to make arm holes. Grab the extra low-cut sock. To make a scarf, make two cuts from the cuff of the sock down to the toe. When you’re done, you’ll have one strip of cloth. [2] X Research source If you want to make your dog a matching beanie, cut two slits into the toe of the low-cut sock for your dog’s ears. If you want your dog to be color coordinated, use an extra low-cut sock that’s the same color as the low-cut sock. If you want your dog’s scarf to add some variety, choose an extra low-cut sock with a different color or texture."

      "content": "Grab an old fleece shirt and scissors to make an upcycled jacket. Use your dog’s back measurement to determine the length of the sweater. Cut the sleeve off the fleece jacket. Measure the distance to your dog’s front legs and use a marker to label the points for your dog’s arm holes. Cut around the points that you marked down. Make sure the holes are large enough for your dog’s paws to fit through. [3] X Research source Roll the cuff of the sleeve to make a collar for your dog’s jacket. It will add a cute decorative touch to the jacket. If the collar is a little too tight for your dog, cut the cuff of the fleece sleeve."

      "content": "Use an old white sweater and scissors to whip up this t-shirt. Cut downwards from the sweater’s shoulder to remove the sleeve. Mark the measurement from your dog’s neck to its tail on the sleeve. Cut out a hole that your dog’s head can fit through. Draw two semi-circles at both sides of the sleeve and cut them out to make the arm holes. Draw a big U-shape at the bottom edge of the sleeve and cut out an opening so your dog can go potty. [4] X Research source To give the t-shirt a symmetrical look, fold the sweater sleeve longways. Draw a U-shape at the opposite end of the sleeve and cut it out. To create a chic collar for your dog, fold over the neck of the doggy t-shirt. If you want to give your doggy t-shirt a special touch, use fabric markers to add fun designs or write a little message."

      "content": "Use a free pattern and fabric to create darling doggy jeans. All you need is a single diagram to get started. Click one of the patterns below for the size that fits your dog. Take out elastic and cut a strip out according to your dog’s waistline measurement. Sew the ends of the strip together to create a waistband. Lay your 2 patterns next to each other and on top of your fabric. Trace around them and cut out your doggy jeans. Place the waistband into the upper portion of the doggy jeans and sew it in place. [5] X Research source Size XS Pattern (8 in (20 cm) waist) Size S Pattern (10 in (25 cm) waist) Size M Pattern (12 in (30 cm) waist) Size L Pattern (14 in (36 cm) waist) Size XL Pattern (16 in (41 cm) waist) Size XXL Pattern (18 in (46 cm) waist) Go for fabric with a denim print if you want the “blue jeans” look. Use fabric with a soft texture like velour if you want a sporty style."

      "content": "Sew a bib, belt, and pillowcase together for a dress that pops. Cut a strip of fabric that matches your dog's waistline. Sew on a strip of hook-and-loop fastener that's the same length to make the dress’s belt. Measure your dog from the middle of its back to where you want the skirt to end. Use the measurement to cut out a strip from a pillow case. Ruffle the top edge of the strip and hem its sides. You’ve now made the skirt piece. Sew the it to the dress’s belt. Then, sew the bottom of the bib to the other end of the dress’s belt. [6] X Research source Choose a bib with any color and design you like, from a floral print to a cute tartan pattern. For extra flair, pick up one with ruffles or lace frills. Fit your dog’s neck through the collar of the bib and secure the belt around its waist."

      "content": "Grab a reusable bag and sew a coat together for a rainy day. Choose a bag made out of a waterproof material, like nylon or vinyl. Disassemble the bag with a seam ripper. [7] X Research source Print out a free dog coat pattern like this one . Lay your pattern on top of the bag. Trace it and cut out the shape from the pattern. Sew a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam around the main piece of the coat. Hem the belly band of the coat. Attach hook-and-loop fastener tape to the belly band. Also sew hook-and-loop fastener tape to the side directly across from the belly band so you can secure the jacket when it’s on your dog."

      "title": "Use fabric, elastic, hot glue, and a rubber band to make a fancy bow tie.",
      "content": "Use fabric, elastic, hot glue, and a rubber band to make a fancy bow tie. Cut out a large and a small piece of fabric. Take the large piece of fabric and fold it vertically so its ends overlap by about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm). Fold it back and forth in order to create an “accordion fold.” Pinch the fabric in the middle and wrap a rubber band around it to create a bow tie shape. To create a center, wrap the smaller piece of fabric around the middle of the bow tie. Secure it at the back with hot glue. Attach an elastic band to the back of the bow tie—it acts as a dog collar for your pet. For a small bow tie, your pieces of fabric should be 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) w x 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) h and 4 inches (10 cm) w x 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) h. For a medium bow tie, your pieces of fabric should be 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) w x 6.25 inches (15.9 cm) h and 4 inches (10 cm) w x 2 inches (5.1 cm) h. For a large bow tie, your pieces of fabric should be 10.25 inches (26.0 cm) w x 7 inches (18 cm) h and 4 inches (10 cm) w x 2 inches (5.1 cm) h ."

      "title": "All you need is tulle, ribbon, and an elastic band for this adorable skirt.",
      "content": "All you need is tulle, ribbon, and an elastic band for this adorable skirt. Cut a 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) wide elastic band so it’s the same length as your dog’s waist. Connect the ends of the elastic bend with a safety pin. Lay down your tulle and cut out 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) strips. Hot glue a ribbon onto the elastic band. Fold your strips of tulle in half. Drape them over the elastic band. Tie the strips of tulle to the elastic band. Repeat this process until the elastic band is covered with strips of tulle. [8] X Research source When you fold the strips of tulle in half, you’ll make the strips of tulle puffy. This adds volume to the tutu."

      "content": "Make it with green felt, a yellow doggy t-shirt, hook-and-loop fastener, and a paint pen. Use a gold paint pen to draw cross-hatched lines on the t-shirt. Cut out leaves of various sizes from a sheet of green felt. Cut a long strip out of your sheet of green felt. Wrap in the shape of a cylinder. Hot glue its ends in place. Cut out a strip of One-Wrap hook-and-loop fastener that’s the circumference of your dog’s head. Hot glue the bottom of your green felt cylinder to the center of your strip of One-Wrap hook-and-loop fastener. Hot glue your leaves onto the cylinder. [9] X Research source To create some volume to the pineapple headdress, layer your green felt leaves on top of each other when you hot glue them on the felt cylinder. Fit the pineapple headdress onto your dog—the strap should fit securely under your dog’s jaw. Then, slip your dog into the t-shirt you spruced up. Voilà! Your pet will instantly give everyone a dose of sweetness when it walks around in its new getup."

      "content": "Use ribbon, a towel, and basic sewing to make a cool superhero cape. [10] X Research source Place the towel on your dog. Wrap ribbon around your dog’s chest and mark where to cut it. Then, cut off a piece of ribbon. Repeat this process for their belly. Sew the ends of one ribbon to the part of the towel that’s right over your dog’s front legs. Repeat this process for the second ribbon, but position the ends of the ribbon to the part of the towel that’s right above your dog’s belly. The towel can have your favorite superhero’s logo or have a bright, bold color like red, yellow, or blue. Choose a towel that’s the best size for your dog—it should end roughly 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) above your dog’s tail. When you want the cape to be a cooling towel, soak the towel with cool water. Then, put it on your dog and tie the ribbons up."
