      "content": "Go to the East 161st Street stop for a direct way to reach the stadium. The subway station is right outside the stadium. Many different subway lines connect to that station, so you can reach it no matter where you’re coming from. Head toward the Bronx, which is the area of New York City right above Manhattan. Transfer trains as needed to head toward the stadium. [1] X Research source Before traveling, plan out your route. Try using a subway map like the one at http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html . All of the city’s subway stations have free maps. Take one with you to help you get where you need to go."

      "title": "Take the D line train if you’re traveling from west Brooklyn or Manhattan.",
      "content": "Take the D line train if you’re traveling from west Brooklyn or Manhattan. This line stops at the 161st Street station, so you’re sure to get to the stadium if you ride it. Most of the stops on the way operate all day. Look for the big, orange decal with the letter D on the front of the train to know you’re on the right track. [2] X Research source The D line trains from Manhattan don’t stop at Yankee Stadium from 6:15 AM to 9 AM and 4 PM to 6:45 PM, which are their busiest hours. If you’re coming from Manhattan during the busy hours, you will need to go to the next station and walk, take a bus, or transfer to the No. 4 train."

      "title": "Board the #4 train if you’re traveling from the east side of the city.",
      "content": "Board the #4 train if you’re traveling from the east side of the city. Consider the #4 train as the east side’s answer to the D line train. They have similar routes since the No. 4 also starts in Brooklyn and passes through Manhattan. It runs all the time and always stops at the 161st street station. [3] X Research source Look for the green decal with the number 4 on it to find the correct train. It’s a great choice if you’re coming up from the south side of the city or the upper part of the Bronx."

      "title": "Ride the B line train if you’re traveling during a weekday.",
      "content": "Ride the B line train if you’re traveling during a weekday. The B line is an alternative to the D line and # 4 trains you might normally take when going to the stadium. It is a weekday-only train. Conveniently, it runs during the busy hours when the D line skips the 161st Street stop. Take advantage of it for evening baseball games throughout the week. [4] X Research source The B line follows a similar route to the D line. It spans at the southern end of Brooklyn and runs up through western Manhattan to the north end of the Bronx."

      "title": "Transfer to another subway line if you’re coming from further away.",
      "content": "Transfer to another subway line if you’re coming from further away. No other lines run through the Yankee Stadium subway station, so you will have to transfer trains during your journey. This will depend on where you’re coming from. As long as you get on either a D, B, or #4 train, you can get to the stadium. Another option is to hop on a railroad train, bus, or walk from a different subway station. [5] X Research source If you’re coming from Queens, which is to the south, look for the #4 train at stops like Grand Central and the 59th Street station. Long Island doesn’t have any direct lines, so take a train to Penn Station. Walk to 34 St-Herald Square, then take the B or D subway to the stadium. To travel east from New Jersey, head to Penn Station. Take the E subway line to 7th Avenue, then transfer to the B or D line."

      "title": "Pay for subway tickets when you enter the station.",
      "content": "Pay for subway tickets when you enter the station. New York City subway stations all have ATMs that print tickets. When you get to the station, put in your destination, then pay for the fare. The cost is $2.75 USD for a single trip no matter where you’re headed. You don’t have to pay extra if you need to transfer to another train on your way to the stadium. [6] X Research source To make traveling easier, consider buying a MetroCard at the ATM or a booth at the station. You can use the ATM to add money to the card, then swipe it at the turnstile so you don’t have to buy tickets whenever you travel. The subway stations are manned, so ask an attendant if you have questions. Head to a ticket booth or press the green help button at the booth to talk to an attendant. Ask them for a route to the stadium."

      "title": "Ride the bus if you’re already in New York City.",
      "content": "Ride the bus if you’re already in New York City. Public buses are a great way to beat the traffic around the stadium. If you don’t like using the subway, ride the bus. It may be faster than getting to a subway station that links up with the one in front of the stadium. Bus routes run throughout the city and several of them stop near Yankee stadium.

There are a few possible stops close to the stadium, so check the electronic sign on the front of each bus to see where you’re going. The sign will have the bus number and Yankee Stadium on it. When you reach your stop, push the tape or one of the stop buttons around the windows and handrails inside the bus. The Bx6 and Bx13 buses stop at East 161st Street and River Avenue, which is right in front of the stadium. Take the Bx1 and Bx2 buses to East 161st Street and Grand Concourse. Take a very short walk west to find the stadium. Ride the BxM4 bus to Grand Concourse and East 161st Street if you’re coming from the south. If you're traveling from the north, take it to East 158th Street instead."

A ride costs $2.75 and you can transfer to another bus if you need to without paying extra. When you climb on the bus, look for a coin box next to the driver. You can also pay with the city’s digital travel ticket, the MetroCard. To buy a MetroCard, head to a nearby subway station. Metrocards are reloadable cards that make traveling easier. Load some money onto the card using cash, debit, or credit at a subway ticket ATM or booth."

      "content": "Travel by train if you’re traveling from outside the city. Although New York City has a pretty extensive subway system, it isn’t perfect. Yankee Stadium is easier to reach from some places than others. If you’re outside the main subway lines that run to the 161st Street stop in front of the stadium, check the train schedule for a more direct route. Be sure to check the game day schedule to make sure the trains are running. [7] X Research source For a map of accessible train lines, visit http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/yankees/yankee_service.htm .

Head to the closest train station, then check the information boards to find the train you need. Look for either the Hudson, Harlem, or New Haven lines, depending on where you’re coming from. Most of them go directly to the 153rd Street stop right outside of the stadium. [8] X Research source The New Haven line, for instance, runs from the Bronx to New Haven, Connecticut, in the northeast. It’s a quick way to get into the city if you’re out there. The Harlem line runs from Harlem, which is south of stadium. It doesn’t go directly to the stadium, so be sure to get off at the Harlem or Melrose stops. The Hudson line starts near Yankee Stadium and travels northwest along the Hudson River."

The shuttle train heads directly to Yankees Stadium, so you’re not out of luck if you’re trying to catch a weekday ballgame. The station is in Manhattan, so get there through the subway or another method. It’s an easy way to reach the stadium without having to deal with game day traffic.

Besides the usual traffic of a big city, you’re also contending with numerous people crossing the streets. It’s a hassle if you’re not used to it. However, it’s doable if you’re willing to arrive early. [11] X Research source For your best chance at handling the traffic, get to the stadium 2 to 3 hours in advance. You won’t be able to evade traffic on the way out, but you will have an easier time parking on the way in."

It is located along the Major Deegan Expressway, also known as I-87. The expressway runs north and south between the stadium and the banks of the Harlem River. If you’re on the expressway, the stadium will be to the east, so look for it as you’re driving. [12] X Research source If you’re driving north, look for Exit 4 to East 149th Street and the 145th Street Bridge. You could also keep going to Exit 5. If you’re moving south on the expressway, watch for Exit 5 to East 161st Street and the Macombs Dam Bridge. The stadium is a few minutes east of the highway. Head in the opposite direction from the bridge. The expressway isn’t the only road leading toward the stadium, but it’s the easiest one to navigate. Look up a road map to plan your route if you intend on driving through the city streets. [13] X Research source"

These areas are great if you don’t want to walk very far, but they do get a little pricey. Expect to fork over $25 to $30 if you’re going to the stadium for an event. If you’re looking for something cheaper, park further away. [14] X Research source For example, the 164th Street garage and 2 other lots are right behind the stadium. Also, look for the East 161st Street and Ruppert Plaza garages to the west. If you’re looking for cheaper lots, try going west across the Macombs Dam Bridge. The lots there are often half the price. Walk or take a bus to get back to the stadium. If you’re worried about being able to find an available spot, download the SpotHero parking app on your phone. Use it to book a parking spot in one of the lots."

There are many people in the area, so safety isn’t a concern. [15] X Research source Street parking is first come, first serve, so don’t anticipate finding anything right away. Drive around for a little bit. If you go early, you can get to a parking garage if you don’t find anything."

Yankee Stadium doesn’t have any street parking outside, but it does allow for pick-ups and drop-offs if you call ahead in advance. Call (718) 579-4510 or (718) 579-4595 if you use a text telephone. Stadium officials will be more than happy to help arrange whatever you need to enjoy your time there. [16] X Research source The nearby parking garages all have spots for people with disabilities. However, NYC doesn’t honor parking passes from other states. You need a New York disability placard to display in your car window. For another accessibility option, call a wheelchair taxi at 646-599-9999 or by using the Accessible Dispatch NYC app. Buses also accommodate wheelchairs. Take advantage of the East 161st Street stop outside of the stadium to travel this way."
