HIV rash usually causes blotches and spots on the skin, red for people with fair skin and dark purplish for people with dark skin. The severity of the rash varies from patient to patient. Some get a very severe rash that covers a large area, while others only have a minor rash. If the HIV rash is the result of antiviral medications, the rash will appear as raised reddish lesions that cover your whole body. These rashes are called “drug eruptions”."

HIV rash can occur at any stage of infection but generally, you notice it two to threes weeks after you have contracted the virus. This phase is called seroconversion, which is when the infection becomes detectable via a blood test. Some people may skip this phase and develop HIV rash in the later stages of having the virus. HIV rash can also be caused by an adverse reaction to anti-HIV medicines. Drugs like Amprenavir, abacavir, and nevirapine can cause HIV skin rashes. During the third phase of HIV infection, you can develop skin rashes due to dermatitis. This type of HIV rash appears pink or reddish and are itchy. It can last from one to three years and is usually found on your groin, underarms, chest, face, and back areas. You can also get HIV rashes if you have Herpes and are HIV-positive."

If you are already on anti-HIV medication and the rash is mild, your doctor will tell you to continue taking the medication as the rash should go away after one to two weeks. To reduce the rash, especially the itching, your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine, such as Benadryl or Atarax, or a corticosteroid-based cream. [4] X Research source"
