Ensure that the steam can circulate around the garment. [1] X Research source Do not hang the tulle from the shower curtain rod since you’ll be running the shower. If you’re smoothing the tulle on a dress, hang the dress on a padded hanger. To get wrinkles out of a tulle veil , attach the veil to a clip on a hanger. For a tulle tutu , hang it on a tutu hanger to ensure that it keeps its shape."

Then, turn the shower on and make the water hot enough that the room begins to fill with steam. [2] X Research source Keep the bathroom door open to prevent the tulle from becoming too moist. If the room isn’t getting steamy enough with the door open, it’s okay to close it."

      "content": "Run a clean, dry towel across the tulle to smooth it. Wrap a clean, white towel around your arm so it’s completely enclosed in the fabric. It’s important to use a white towel to prevent colors from bleeding onto the tulle. Once the room is steamy, slowly brush your towel-covered arm down the tulle. Repeat this as many times as needed to remove light wrinkles. Keep the shower running until you’ve finished steaming out the wrinkles. When you’re done, turn the shower off and move the tulle garment out of the bathroom. Hang it somewhere it won’t get wrinkled until you’re ready to wear it."

If you’re using a large steam machine , hang the item on the steamer’s pole. If you’re using a handheld steamer , hang the tulle from a shower rod, a wall hook, or in an empty closet.

      "content": "Fill the steamer and heat it for 5 minutes. Ensure that the steamer has enough water in its tank to create lots of steam. Then, turn on the steam machine and leave it to heat up for about 5 minutes. This helps ensure it will be hot enough to steam your tulle properly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Point the steamer nozzle at the wrinkles to remove them. When the steamer is ready to use , steam will start to come out of the nozzle. Hold the nozzle and move it about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from the wrinkled tulle. Keep moving the nozzle over the tulle until the wrinkles flatten and disappear. Depending on the fabric, you’ll probably need to hover the steam over it for a few seconds. [5] X Research source Once the wrinkles are removed, turn off the steamer and keep your tulle in a place it won’t get wrinkled until you’re ready to wear it."

Let the iron heat up until it produces steam when you turn the iron down. [6] X Research source If the iron doesn’t have a steam setting, it’s usually best to try a different method. It is technically possible to iron tulle by setting the iron to the lowest heat setting. However, this does risk damaging or melting the fabric, so try it at your own risk. If your iron is prone to leaving rust spots, avoid using it to steam the tulle."

[8] X Research source Keep the iron about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the tulle and hover it over the wrinkles for a few seconds. The steam from the iron should flatten the wrinkles out. If you’re using an iron on a low heat setting rather than a steam setting, place a press cloth (like muslin or a thin cotton fabric) over the tulle to protect it from the heat. Then iron the press cloth as you normally would with smooth, continuous strokes. Check beneath the press cloth regularly to make sure the tulle isn’t damaged. Once you’re finished, turn the iron off and allow the garment to cool. Hang it somewhere it won’t get more wrinkles."

If you’re trying to remove wrinkles from an article of clothing that has tulle attached, read the clothing’s fabric label first. [9] X Research source If the item is made with another delicate fabric (like wool), don’t put it in the dryer. Plain fabrics with tulle, such as plain tutus or veils with no embellishments, are safe to put in the dryer. For example, don’t use the dryer to remove wrinkles from a wool dress with tulle embellishments, as wool will shrink in the dryer. Avoid using the dryer to remove wrinkles from large items of clothing, such as wedding dresses. Don’t use the dryer if your tulle has rhinestones, pearls, or lace glued onto it."

Run the dryer for 3 to 5 minutes so it warms up. Some dryers have a delicate setting, which is the lowest heat setting, and some newer dryers have a permanent press setting, which works well for removing wrinkles."

Simply hanging the tulle on a clothes hanger is a gentle and effective way to remove wrinkles over time, as it leverages the fabric’s natural relaxation and smoothes its appearance. Hang the tulle in a well-ventilated area somewhere it doesn’t touch the ground. Check on it periodically over the course of a few days to a few weeks.

      "content": "Mist the tulle with water to remove light wrinkles. Fill a spray bottle with water and lightly mist the entire surface of the tulle, ensuring it’s evenly covered. Allow it to dry completely, then iron the fabric using an iron with a steam setting. For extra wrinkle-removing power, add a bit of fabric softener to the water or use a wrinkle releaser . [12] X Research source Cleaning expert Bridgett Price also recommends wrinkle release sprays: “I love the Downy release sprays. They're great for traveling; they're great for a quick refresher. Say you didn't get to your dryer in time, or let's say the dryer didn't get all the wrinkles out. I spray Downy release on my clothes and give it a great shake. The wrinkles come out like magic.”"

Mix a mild detergent (like laundry detergent or dish soap) in some cold water and swirl the fabric in the mixture to clean it. Rinse the garment in clean, cold water, then squeeze the water out, being careful not to wring the fabric. Lay it flat to air dry and prevent wrinkles. [14] X Research source It may be okay to wash some tulle garments in the washing machine if you use a delicate setting. Check the fabric care label to be sure, as tulle may rip and snag in the washing machine."

      "content": "How do I get wrinkles out of tulle without a steamer? If you don’t have a steamer, one of the easiest ways to get wrinkles out of tulle is with shower steam. Simply hang the item up in your bathroom, turn the shower on a hot temperature, and wait for the bathroom to fill with steam. The steam will relax the fabric and remove the wrinkles. [18] X Research source It’s also possible to remove wrinkles in the dryer, with an iron, or by simply hanging the garment up for a few days to a few weeks. It may also be possible to remove wrinkles with a hair dryer. Dry cleaner and laundry specialist Ayad Mirjan says, “Spray water on your garment, [then] dry the garment with a hair dryer. If the wrinkles are still visible, place your garment under your mattress overnight.” If you try this method, be sure to use the lowest heat setting possible, and don’t hold the blow dryer too close to the tulle, as it could melt. Test an inconspicuous area first."
