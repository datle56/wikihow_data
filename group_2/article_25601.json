Thread the lace along the underside of the Converse, bringing both ends up through the bottom set of eyelets. This will create a horizontal bar connecting the two bottom eyelets. Pull the ends of each lace until they’re even so that your laces are symmetrical. [1] X Research source This is the most traditional, common lacing style for shoes of all types because it’s simple and comfortable."

[5] X Research source You can also tuck the laces underneath the tongue or the sole of the shoe if you don't want your laces showing.

[20] X Research source The extra holes in the side of your Converse are primarily used for extra ventilation, but some shoe owners use them to lace their shoes.
