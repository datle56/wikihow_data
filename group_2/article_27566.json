      "content": "Choose your colors. The single chain pattern makes it easy to incorporate as many colors as you want. Decide whether you want the whole bracelet to be the same color or if you want to make a pattern with more than one. You could alternate colors or incorporate every color of the rainbow. You might want to count your rainbow bands to make sure you have enough of the colors you want. If your run out it will be noticeable in your finished bracelet. You will need 25 to 30 bands total for this bracelet. Organize your bands in an organizing case, so you can separate all the different colors. If you don't have a rainbow loom organizing case, you can just as easily use a bead organizer or a jewelry box with lots of compartments."

      "title": "Slide the band over a pencil.",
      "content": "Slide the band over a pencil. Take the same band and stretch it a little so you can slide it down to the middle of a pencil. The pencil will help you hold the pattern in place as you create it, taking the place of a loom. Use a pencil that's narrow enough so that the band fits over it loosely. If the band is too tight, it'll be hard to slip it off the pencil, which you'll need to do as you create your pattern. You can also use a popsicle stick or a chopstick if you don't have a pencil handy."

Now the two ends of the bracelet are joined together, and the bracelet is complete. Try it on to see if you like the size. If you want it to be smaller, just pull out the last few bands until it's the right length, then rejoin the ends with the C-clip. To make a longer bracelet, slip the 2 loops of the last band back over the pencil, then add new bands as needed."

To figure out when it's long enough to make a bracelet, wrap the fishtail around your wrist. It's ready when the two ends are long enough to meet.

This sounds tricky, but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to do it really quickly. If you need help handling the tiny band, you can use a crochet hook to help you pull it out and twist it. Once the band is twisted around all of the tines, push it down a bit so that the twists are in an even line. Pull on either end to adjust the band so that all the twists are the same size."
