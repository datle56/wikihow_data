      "content": "These cleaners keep grime from building up. Look for an automatic or continuous cleaner . These products release cleansing and disinfecting solutions into your toilet every time you flush, so that you don’t have to scrub your toilet bowl nearly as often. [1] X Research source Some of them are gel packets that clip into the bowl, and others are refillable cartridges that go in the tank. Follow the instructions on the package to install yours and find out how often to replace or refill it. Home cleaning specialist Daniel Olin says it’s an especially good idea to get one of these products if you have hard water. “The water quality of your house or apartment has a lot to do with [stains], he says. \"So, if you live in an area where the water is prone to staining the bowl, you’re going to want to get one of those auto dispensing products to keep in the upper deck of the toilet, and that will save you a lot of cleaning time,” Olin says. If you plan to do a periodic deep clean, remove the automatic cleaner first. This will prevent you from accidentally creating toxic fumes by mixing different cleaning chemicals together.

      "content": "These tablets release cleaners with every flush. Toilet cleaning tablets slowly release bleach or other cleaning chemicals into your toilet water, preventing the buildup of grime, bacteria, and bad odors. This is an easy way to cut back on scrubbing. Simply drop the tablet into the bowl and replace it as often as recommended on the package. While the instructions on these tablets usually advise you to put them in the toilet tank, putting them directly in the bowl reduces chemical wear and tear on the hardware in your tank. These tablets gradually dissolve over time, but cheaper ones can sometimes break apart and temporarily slow or clog the drain on your toilet. To prevent problems with flushing, go with trusted brands instead of the cheaper generic tablets."

Pour the soda in around the edges of the bowl to cover as much of the inner surface as possible. Let it sit in the toilet overnight, then flush it the next morning. [4] X Research source You can also pour Coke into a spray bottle and spritz it directly on hard-to-reach areas. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that Coke will dissolve some stubborn stains, but it won’t actually disinfect your toilet. For a deeper clean, follow up with a disinfectant spray or gel to kill lingering bacteria."

      "content": "This is a great option if you’re dealing with rust and hard water stains. According to the experts at Cleanzen Cleaning Services, white vinegar has a strong acidic property that can tackle rust effectively. Here are their instructions: After lifting the toilet tank lid, add white vinegar directly into the tank water until the fluid sits roughly a half-inch below the rim. Leave the toilet untouched for 12 to 24 hours, depending on the severity of the problem. To flush the vinegar from the tank, flush the toilet at least three or four times. Vinegar is a gentle acid, but it can still irritate your skin, so you should always wear gloves when cleaning with it."

      "content": "These gentle cleansers may reduce the need for scrubbing. To make grime-busting toilet bombs, combine ¼ cup (48 g) of citric acid, ½ cup (260 g) of baking soda, and 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of liquid dish soap in a bowl. Fill a few small bath bomb molds with the mixture and let them set for 24 hours. Drop a bomb into your toilet bowl and let it dissolve to loosen stains and dirt. Let it sit for several minutes before flushing the toilet. [6] X Research source Some cleaning bloggers recommend adding a few drops of your favorite essential oil for a boost of fresh scent. This is a good option for removing mild, light stains. If you still see any stains, toss in another bomb or wipe the stains away with a rag or brush."

      "content": "This combination can banish hard water stains. Pour about 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar into your toilet and swish it around with a toilet brush, making sure to coat any stained areas. After about a minute, sprinkle baking soda liberally on any stains, then pour on another 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar. Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes, then stir it around with the toilet brush again and flush to rinse away any remaining grime. This fizzy combo can also break up clogs in your toilet drain. [7] X Research source Baking soda is a gentle abrasive and a natural water softener, which can also cut through many stains. Vinegar is also excellent for dissolving lime stains and mineral deposits. If there are still any stains in the bowl, wipe them away with a rag or sponge. As an added bonus, baking soda by itself is great for boosting the health of your septic tank . Pour 1 cup (221 g) of baking soda into your toilet bowl and flush it once a week to maintain a good pH balance and prevent clogs and backups. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Bleach both disinfects and banishes stains. Most cleaning experts recommend using products that contain bleach , since it’s so effective at tackling germs, rust, and stains. [9] X Research source Start by pouring a bucket of water into your toilet bowl. This causes it to flush without triggering the tank to refill the bowl. Next, coat the entire bowl with a bleach-based cleaner, and let it sit for at least 2 hours, then flush your toilet to rinse the bleach away. [10] X Research source While scrubbing is usually an important part of the cleaning process with these types of cleansers, you might get away with minimal scrubbing—or none at all—if your toilet isn’t too heavily soiled. If you’re not crazy about the idea of using harsh chlorine-based bleach in your toilet, look for a product that contains a gentler alternative, such as hydrogen peroxide . [11] X Research source To avoid creating toxic fumes, never mix bleach with other household cleansers! [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Sometimes a little gentle wiping is enough. If you’re dealing with dirt that isn’t too set in, put on some rubber gloves and wipe it away. Although it sounds a little gross, you can even use your fingernail through the glove to dislodge stubborn buildup. In addition to being chemical-free, this method is a good option if you’d rather steer clear of toilet brushes, which can be a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. [13] X Research source If there are any difficult stains or hard water deposits in your toilet bowl, house cleaning specialist Eduardo Peralta recommends trying out pumice or a Magic Eraser to target them."

Empty the bowl by pouring a bucket of water into the bowl or shutting off the water supply to the toilet, then flushing. Mix 1 part muriatic acid with 5 parts water, then fill the toilet bowl with the solution. Close the toilet lid and let the acid sit for 2-3 hours. [14] X Research source Muriatic acid can damage your plumbing if you flush it. The instructions on the package may advise you to scoop it out of the toilet with an acid-safe container or neutralize it with baking soda. When using muriatic acid, always wear protective equipment, such as acid-proof rubber gloves, safety goggles, a respirator mask, and thick clothing that completely covers your skin. [15] X Research source Keep the bathroom well ventilated, and don’t let anyone use the toilet until you’ve removed the acid."

      "content": "This is a good option if you have very mineral-rich water. If white vinegar or other acidic cleaners just can’t keep up with the mineral stains in your toilet, you may need a water softener or conditioner. [16] X Research source Do a search for a water softener installation service near you. A good water softener will keep limescale, rust stains, and mineral deposits from building up in your toilet bowl. You may be a good candidate for a water softener if you use well water, which is often rich in stain-causing metals and minerals. Unfortunately, this option can be very pricey, with most water softening systems costing at least $1000."
