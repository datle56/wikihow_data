      "content": "The word most commonly appears as “kudos.” When writing or speaking the word, most native speakers always use “kudos.” Though it ends in “s,” “kudos” is most often regarded as singular, rather than plural. It’s what’s called an “uncountable noun,” meaning you can’t actually count the number of kudos—it’s an abstract concept, not a literal object. [5] X Research source Other grammar experts argue that a singular “kudo” does exist as an evolution of the word “kudos” and a result of the changing English language."
