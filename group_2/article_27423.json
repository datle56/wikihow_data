      "title": "Pour the sugar onto the parchment paper.",
      "content": "Pour the sugar onto the parchment paper. Pack the sugar into the base of the pan very tightly with a spatula or another tool that is stiff and flat. The height should be similar to a commercial sugar cube, around 1.27cm/1/2 an inch. If you want sugar pieces that aren't shaped like cubes, pour the sugar into oven-safe candy molds or muffin tins. If you have candy molds that aren't oven safe, you can still use them. Pour the sugar into the molds and use a spatula to flatten the tops. Instead of putting the molds in the oven, cover them loosely with parchment paper and leave them on the counter overnight. They'll be hard by morning."

      "content": "Score the sugar. Using a knife, cut the sugar sheet into cubes of the size you want. Try to cut neat, even squares. Do not forget this step; if you do, you will end up with a sugar block, rather than sugar cubes."

This method works best if you choose silicon ice cube trays with cute shapes, such as hearts, stars, animals or something quirkier than the same old cube. Silicon trays are the best because you'll be able to remove the sugar cubes much more easily, with less likelihood of damaging them."

Don't make it too gooey or wet, or the sugar will dissolve. At this stage you can mix in a few drops of food coloring to make colored cubes. Consider adding a few drops of vanilla, almond, or lemon extract to make flavored sugar."
