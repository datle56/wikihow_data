      "content": "Strike up deep conversations with him. Astrologer Angel Eyedealism stresses that \"Pisces men love people who are sensitive, colorful, musical, and artistic in some way.\" Your man craves deep discussions about art, mysticism, science, and philosophy, while superficial topics, like gossip or celebrity culture, are his pet peeves. Most Pisces love to read, so asking him about his favorite book is a great way to kick off a deep chat. [3] X Research source You might say: \"Tell me about a book that changed your life as a kid.\" \"Who’s your favorite philosopher and why are you drawn to them?\""

      "content": "Be positive and optimistic . This empathetic sign absorbs the emotions of those around him. Because of that, Pisces prefer the company of optimists. If you often find yourself feeling down or acting negative around your man, he’ll absorb and reflect those emotions right back at you. His sensitive nature won’t allow him to withstand this kind of atmosphere for long, so try to be positive and upbeat. [4] X Research source If he tells you he's had a bad day, validate his emotions so he feels understood. Then, try to find the silver lining and share it with him. You might say, \"I would feel down if my boss said that to me, too. But him urging you to work harder also means that he values what you're doing. He's depending on the work that you do and that's a good thing.\""

According to astrologer Angel Eyedealism, \"Pisces men like people who are compassionate, sensitive, and make an effort to relate with others.\" A judgmental attitude is a real turn-off for a Pisces. This sign champions acceptance and personal freedom for everyone no matter what. He would never judge a person by their choices or appearance, and he won't react well if you do it, either. It may even be a deal breaker for him. A Pisces man sees his true soulmate as a kind, open-minded individual. For example, if he shares his political views with you and you don't identify with them, don't dismiss what he's saying outright. Instead, respond with something like, \"You know, I've honestly never looked at it from that perspective before. This conversation is giving me a lot to think about.\""

If he suddenly seems sad or sulky for no reason, he’s probably just on a downward swing. He may not want to talk about it, and that’s okay! Just be there for him and allow him to feel whatever he needs to feel without interfering or asking for an explanation. During these times, he wants the comfort of your presence more than anything else. For example, you can listen to music with him, share a bottle of wine, or just kick back and enjoy a good movie together."

Connecting on a deep level is extremely important to this sign. A Pisces in love tends to ask penetrating questions about their partner’s feelings, dreams, and beliefs, and he truly wants to know what they have to say. Sharing these things with your man will help you create the rock-solid bond that Pisces want. [5] X Research source You might say something like, \"You know what I've always dreamed about? Being an interior designer. I've never felt confident enough to pursue it, though.\" Pisces particularly enjoy conversations about spirituality and the mysteries of the universe, so don’t hold back.

Your man loves using his imagination and he's probably juggling several creative projects or hobbies. Since he’s more likely to be tinkering away on various artistic projects at home, be sure to give him ample space and time to work on them. It’s really important to encourage a Pisces' creativity in whatever way you can. For example, if he's a musician and he plays you a tune he's been working on, tell him how awesome it sounds and encourage him to finish the composition. If your guy spends a lot of time painting in his studio, try to avoid interrupting him unless you're bringing him a snack or a cup of tea. Later on, you can say something like, \"I love how dedicated you are to your art. Have you ever thought about showing your work at a gallery? I can get in touch with a local curator I know if you're interested.\""
