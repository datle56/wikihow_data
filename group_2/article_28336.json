[1] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. Your crush may not be interested in you yet, but taking the time to comfortably show them your personality and truly get to know them may change their mind. If you’re not already on speaking terms with your crush, try to hang out with them and strike up a friendship. Slowly become a fixture in their life by hanging around and seeing if a friendship blossoms. If you go to school or work together, try to leave at the same time to give you opportunities to chat. Better yet, take up the same extracurricular activities as them so you get more time together. Strike up casual conversation with them : “Boy, that math test was a bear, wasn’t it? How do you think you did?” With enough surface-level, relatable chit-chat, eventually, a friendship may bloom. If you’re both on social media, follow your crush and initiate some conversation there . Having an online presence can also help you stay on your crush’s radar even when you’re not physically together.

Once you’ve gotten to know your crush a bit better and established some trust, gently broach the subject of your love lives. Ask them what they’re looking for in a potential significant other, and share your relationship goals, too. This will help you find out if you’d actually be a good match—plus, sharing deep, personal feelings like this may also strengthen your bond and make them trust you even more. Consider asking your crush about their crush—what they see in her, why they think they’d be a good match—but avoid trying to change yourself to be what you think your crush wants. The right person for you will like you for who you are."

      "content": "Speak nicely about your crush’s crush. Jealousy may make it tempting to speak poorly of her, but remember, she hasn’t actually done anything wrong (and she might not even be aware the person you like is into her). If you speak nicely about her and express curiosity about your crush’s love life, they’ll appreciate that you’re supportive of them and invested in their personal affairs. Your crush probably won’t appreciate you bad-mouthing the girl they like, and they might end up thinking you’re a negative person. They may also opt to not talk to you about their crush anymore, and we’re guessing you like hearing updates about their love life! Another way to think about it is, if you trash the girl your crush likes, you’re essentially trashing your crush’s opinion, which is sure to push them away from you. If you care about your crush, respect that they’ve (currently) got feelings for this girl."

While you don’t want to speak poorly of the girl they like, you may be able to redirect your crush’s romantic attention to yourself by talking them up . Over time, they may begin to realize how good you make them feel about themselves, and they may realize you’re the one they really want to be with. Point out the qualities about them that you like: “You’ve got such a great laugh! I could listen to it all day,” or “You’re the smartest person in our class, seriously. What a brain.” While your ideal result is them falling for you, be sincere in your compliments, and try not to count on them developing feelings. While being supportive and encouraging gives you a way better chance of winning their affections , in the end, they may still not want to date, and that’s OK. In that case, at least you have a great friend!"

While a crush can make you freeze up and not know what to say, letting your guard down and having fun with them can make you seem more confident and alluring.

Develop inside jokes with your crush, and laugh at their attempts to be funny. Everyone appreciates someone who laughs easily!

Now that you’ve learned more about your crush’s likes and dislikes—especially their views on relationships—you’re in a better position to show them how you embody what they want in another person. They may not realize how much you have in common—show them! Subtly let them know that the two of you have similar interests or shared hobbies: “You’re going to the Billie Eilish concert? So am I! We should go together!” Communicate what you're looking for in a relationship, and they may realize you're both on the same page: \"I just want someone I can be myself around, someone who's in it for the long haul.\""

If you know you and your crush don’t align, don’t pretend to be anything you’re not.

Not possessing the traits your crush finds attractive doesn’t mean they’re wrong or that you’re wrong—you might both just be looking for different things! And that’s OK."

Exercising and giving yourself regular pep talks can help you feel more confident and capable, and complimenting others and smiling will make you seem more alluring to them. [6] X Research source"

Paradoxically, appreciating your friendship and not putting any pressure on romance may actually make your crush want you: they may be attracted to the idea of dating someone who has already shown themselves to be a fun, reliable pal. But even if they don’t develop feelings for you, you’ve got a wonderful new friendship to be grateful for.
