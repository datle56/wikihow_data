      "content": "Slow down. There are times when you are so used to doing everything in a hurry that you don’t notice how fast-paced your life has become. Simply reading the words, “Slow down,” will allow you to pause for a moment and notice. This step is mentioned first so you will carry the thought with you throughout this article and beyond. Avoid multi-tasking. It has become popular, if not clichéd, to multi-task. Research indicates, however, that there is a point where the quality of what you are doing declines when you try to focus on too many tasks at once. [1] X Research source Just because everyone is doing it doesn’t mean you have to. Find your threshold of diminishing return on the number of tasks you can work on. Your goal is to do things well so you can feel good about your accomplishments. Do nothing as if it were something . There is an art to doing nothing. Many people struggle with taking time to pause and regroup. Even if it is taking a five-minute break to do nothing , do it."

      "content": "Reduce your commitments. If you have current commitments to do something, then follow through until the tasks or events are complete. However, from this point forward, take on fewer commitments. You may struggle at first, but focus your intent on simplifying your life, and this will bring about greater peace within you. Allow your end goal to motivate you and to quiet your feelings of guilt. Limit the number of times you say, “Yes” by keeping a tally on your calendar. First, determine your “comfort level” for how many events you can peacefully manage. Second, stick to that number. Do not always be the good guy who says, “Yes.” Instead, pick your spots. When you are asked to participate in an event, try not to quickly answer. Instead, pause for a moment to work out if the event will truly enrich your life. If it won’t, it is probably best to say, “Thank you for inviting me, but I need to pass.” Develop an ability to say, “no” by communicating your intent. There are times when some people will not take “no” for an answer. This is your cue to share a bit more information with the person and set your boundary. [2] X Research source Consider reinforcing your \"no\" with something like, “You are so kind to think of me, but I’m making some changes in my life that are really important to me, my family, and my health, so I am going to have to decline.” The person will likely support your decision."

      "content": "Eliminate extras. Conspicuous consumption may describe your life, or at least you might practice excessive consumption. Conspicuous consumption entails lavish or wasteful spending in an attempt to show others your level of social prestige [3] X Research source while excessive consumption is using more than is absolutely needed. Simplifying your life will drastically cut into the amount of “extras” you have grown accustomed to. The goal is to reduce the extra expenses so you won’t be so tied down by financial obligations. Question if you really need that second iPad or newest electronic gadget, or that twice-a-day trip through the coffee retailer. Just say “no” to your overindulgence and “yes” to your desire to live a simpler, more peaceful, and satisfying life. Each time you are faced with a decision, try, consciously, to make a decision that will align with the long-term self-interests that you have worked out. Find fulfillment in the simple things in life– spending time with friends, in nature, or creating something with your own hands. You will find that intrinsic rewards will improve your motivation and overall satisfaction with your life."

A well-organized home is a healthy home. Eliminating surplus items that you no longer use will help declutter your home, your emotions, and your thoughts. [4] X Research source When your external world is free of clutter, so will be your internal world. Take a minimum of 10 minutes a day to organize your surroundings. Use the weekend or your days off to take on bigger projects like cleaning closets, drawers and garages. Sort your items into three categories: Keep; donate; and throw away. Giving away lightly used items to charitable organizations gives others an opportunity to enjoy the items and provides jobs for the workers who process the donations. With each donation you make you are helping the community, which enhances your self-esteem.

They are a guiding force in decision making. Identifying your values can be a challenge, but it is worth the effort. To identify your values, think about the times in your life when you were the happiest, most proud, most fulfilled and satisfied. Make a list and determine what you valued about those situations. Perhaps you value the creativity, adventure, loyalty and hard work each of these situations provided. Maybe you realize that you value your family the most. These will be a driving force in everything you do. If you want to live a simple peaceful life, then you might value serenity, resourcefulness, stability, and health."

You will know if your activities are in line with your values by the way you feel. You will feel satisfied and content. When it comes to activities that conflict with your values, the opposite is true. You will have a strong feeling that something is wrong and you are unhappy.

You have identified your desire to live a simple and peaceful life and now you must determine clear objectives, implement them, make adjustments as needed and monitor your progress. [8] X Research source Determine clear objectives. One objective may be that you set a schedule and keep a log of your decluttering efforts. Self-monitoring leads to real change. [9] X Research source Pick a start date for your plan and start. Don’t delay the inevitable. Start as soon as possible. Recognize your growth and reward yourself. If you successfully meet your daily, weekly or monthly objectives, celebrate your accomplishments. Perhaps you could go to a movie, attend a sporting event or plant a tree in honor of someone you admire. Positive reinforcement will motivate you to continue with your plan. If a strategy isn’t working for you, then stop using it. Find an alternative and plug it into your plan. Don’t look at it as a failure; instead look at it as a correction in the course toward your goal. Your new behaviors will build over time and become second nature to you. As your behavior becomes more natural, you can lessen your strict adherence to your plan and still maintain positive outcomes. [10] X Research source"

Are my negative feelings helping me or hurting me? Do my thoughts aimed at retribution toward this person have any actual impact on the other person? The obvious answers to the questions are no, no and no. Next, respond with gratitude-filled statements: I feel good that I am letting go of my resentment for this person; My focus on moving forward is helping me feel better; I am focused on improving my life rather than destroying someone else’s."
