      "content": "Consider your insurance coverage. If you have health insurance, confirm your coverage online or with a customer service representative. Along with other basic personal information (such as your birth date and social security number), remember to have your health insurance ID number handy for when you log-in online or speak to a representative on the phone. Find out whether Viagra is covered under the prescription coverage component of your insurance plan. If Viagra is not covered, you may want to check to see if similar drugs that help treat erectile dysfunction, like Cialis or Levitra, are covered by your health insurance plan. You can then ask your doctor if these might work for you. If you don't have any health insurance, consider purchasing a plan. You don't need a health insurance plan to purchase Viagra, but prescriptions are usually cheaper with one. There are many factors to considering when shopping for health insurance including rate, coverage, HMO vs. PPO vs. EPO plans, deductibles, etc. Should you choose to buy health insurance, take your time to shop and compare before making a purchase. Knowing whether or not you have insurance to cover the medication will make a difference in how you obtain it. If Viagra is covered by your insurance, the prescription co-pay is usually the same at all pharmacies, so there is no need to shop around for the best price. And having your doctor's office directly submit the script means that your prescription will be ready faster. However, if your Viagra is not covered by insurance, taking the script with you gives you the time to shop for the best price."

      "content": "Take your Viagra prescription to a pharmacy. This is the more traditional method of getting Viagra. Your doctor may send the script directly to your pharmacy of choice, or you can take the script into a pharmacy. After the pharmacy receives your prescription for Viagra, it may take a few minutes, or even a day for the pharmacy to fill your prescription. When you pick up your prescription, be prepared to pay your co-pay if you are insured, and the entire cost of your prescription if you are not insured. If you have health insurance, make sure you bring your health insurance ID card with you and give it to the pharmacists. The pharmacist may want to talk to you about usage and risks. This is standard for any new prescriptions and may be useful for you."

      "content": "Purchase Viagra online. The online world does big business in selling Viagra and, unsurprisingly, online scams are quite common. If you opt to buy Viagra from an online retailer, you should take some precautions and do your research. Make sure the online pharmacy or other retailer is legitimate. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy has a website where you can check to see if an online pharmacy is licensed and accredited as a Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site (VIPPS). Watch out for the following warning flags: the price seems much cheaper than other online sellers; there is no contact information, such as a phone number or address, provided on the website; the seller doesn't require a prescription for Viagra in order to sell it to you; the medication comes in different forms other than the three doses (25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg), such as \"fast-dissolving strength,\" \"soft-tab,\" etc. Be careful when ordering the medication online that you have input the right prescription and dose. Check as well when you receive the medication that it is the exact dose and type of medication that your doctor instructed you to take. [5] X Research source"
