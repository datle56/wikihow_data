      "title": "Prepare the ski rope.",
      "content": "Prepare the ski rope. Cut the rope to 9 meters/354 inches. Singe the ends to stop fraying (use a lighter, hot plate or candle flame). Place the hammock on a flat surface such as a clear long table or the floor. Patiently thread the rope through the first hole of one dowel. Then push the rope all the way down the casing and up through the exact opposite dowel hole at the other long end of the hammock. Pull the rope over and leave about 1.6 meters/62 inches of it out. Then, thread the rest of the rope down through the other dowel hole on the same short side, then through the casing down to the other dowel hole at the beginning end. The two loose ends of the rope (the other end is an unbroken arc) should measure about 1 meter/39 inches each. Adjust if needed."

Push the singed rope end into the open weave at least 40-50 cm/15.7-19.5 inches. Press down on it, then tug tight. The rope will stay embedded and won't pull apart (test it by tugging). If the rope you're using does do this, tie a firm knot instead."

Then open the weave as above, feed in the other rope end and pull tight to seal. You could also not create the loop. Instead tie large knots at the dowel entry point to prevent the rope from slipping through, then tie the loose ends around a large object such as a tree trunk or hang from hammock hangers attached to porch poles, etc."

      "content": "Wrap the rope around a tree several times. Then send it across to the opposite tree or anchor point. Repeat the wrap and tying process at the other end of the tarp or blanket. This will ensure a taut line is drawn above the hammock bed, which you can pull on to get in and out of the hammock. It also provides a place to hang a rain fly. If you don't want the fly rope, you can always cut your rope in two, keeping the head and foot sections separate. Use the tarp as a rain fly. If the tarp is twice as long as you are, double it over and hang above the hammock. This will create a fly for keeping off rain or for providing shade."
