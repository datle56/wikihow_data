      "content": "Move in closer. You have to be close to each other to kiss , and the less distance a guy has to travel to kiss you, the easier it is for him to give it a try. So get close. When the moment seems right, put your face close to his and look at him expectantly. You could also try moving in as though you're going to kiss him. For example, you could try giving him a long, intimate hug, and before you unwrap your arms or pull your body away, lean your head back. This will give him a chance to move in for the kiss."

Alternatively, bring up your first kiss or a silly story about a bad kiss you've had. Then, bring up how much better you've gotten since then. It might be the feeder line he needs to lean in and see for himself. [1] X Research source"

Are you into it?” [2] X Research source If he says no, don’t freak out. Stay calm, say, “Okay, no worries,” and change the subject.

Then move your eyes back up to meet his and smile demurely.

However, overdoing it will make it look unnatural and can be a huge turn off. Focus on using physical draws to bring attention to your lips rather than piling on layers of lipgloss or lipstick."
