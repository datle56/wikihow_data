      "content": "Stimulate milk production with a breast pump . Two months before you want to start breastfeeding, begin using a breast pump. The breast pump will stimulate the hormone prolactin , which causes your body to produce milk. [4] X Research source Begin by pumping 3 times daily for 5 minutes at a time. Do this for at least 2 days. Slowly increase your pumping frequency until you are pumping for 10 minutes every 4 hours. Set an alarm to pump at least once during the nighttime. Once you feel comfortable with this, increase the frequency slowly until you are pumping every 2 to 3 hours for 15 to 20 minutes."

      "content": "Supplement your supply with formula or pumped breast milk. With induced lactation, you probably won't come up with quite enough breast milk to nourish a child, especially during the first few weeks—this is totally normal! In between nursing, feed your child with formula or breast milk you have pumped. You may also use pasteurized milk from a donor. [7] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Continue to use your breast pump when you bottle feed. This will encourage your breasts to continue producing milk. Ask your doctor about getting a supplemental nursing system . This device attaches to your breast, delivers donor milk or formula, and will also help stimulate milk production."

This will help awaken the nursing instinct, and your baby should begin to breastfeed within the hour. If you have induced lactation, do the same, but have some formula or donated milk on hand to supplement what you have. [8] X Research source If you wait too long to start nursing, it can lower your milk supply."

There are many ways to signal to your body that you want to nurse, though it may be enough to hold your baby against your bare skin. To simulate your milk-ejection reflex, try doing the following: [10] X Research source Apply a warm compress or towel soaked in warm water to your breast. Stroke your breast lightly with your fingertips. This will relax you and can stimulate your milk-ejection reflex. Massage your breast much like you would conduct a self-exam . Press your fingers flatly and firmly against your milk glands and milk ducts. Massage them in slow, firm circles. Massage from the outside in a spiral towards the areola. Lean forward and lightly jiggle your breasts. Gravity should help draw milk into your nipples."
