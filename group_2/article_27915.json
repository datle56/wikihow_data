The quickest way to wear a razor blade is to let it rust. When water causes the metal blade to oxidize, tiny particles of rust form on it. You may not be able to see them, but those particles corrode the blade, dulling it. Additionally, in hard water areas, letting the water dry onto the blade leaves behind scratchy crystals which prevent you getting a close shave. Pat the razor dry on a towel to remove loose water droplets. Be sure you don't wipe it with the towel, because the blade will likely catch on the threads, dulling the blade.
