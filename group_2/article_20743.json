      "title": "Ask about things you're interested in.",
      "content": "Ask about things you're interested in. Focus on open-ended questions that expand the conversation. This type of question doesn't have a one-word answer but instead requires the person to discuss something in more depth. As they talk, you'll learn things about them as well as find new things to ask them further about. [1] X Research source When you're first getting to know someone, it's usually best to stay away from controversial or overly personal questions, but this depends on the context. For example, politics is usually not a great opening topic, but it might be fine if you met someone at a political rally or community organizing event. If you're not sure how the person feels about whatever you want to ask about, you can start by asking them if they're interested in the topic. For example, you might say, \"Hey, how do you feel about dinosaurs? I think it's a shame that now that we're adults no one ever asks what our favorite dinosaur is anymore.\""

      "content": "Listen actively to stay engaged. When you listen actively , the person knows that you're paying attention and you're interested in what they have to say. Show that you're listening by making periodic eye contact , turning towards them, and nodding or making affirmative noises occasionally. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source When the person's finished what they have to say, it can be helpful to summarize it in your own words. That shows them that you were listening and also gives them an opportunity to correct anything you might've misunderstood. Make some comment about what the person said before you dive in with whatever you want to say or ask another question. For example, you might say, \"It sounds like you really like working at the animal shelter—that's awesome! I always had dogs growing up. Do you have any pets right now?\""

      "title": "Pay attention to how the person responds.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how the person responds. Body language and other cues help you understand their level of interest in the topic. This is important information if you're trying to get to know someone better or decide if they'd make a good friend. If they seem disinterested or uncomfortable with something you've brought up, it's usually best to simply transition to another topic without drawing attention to it. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if they don't seem comfortable talking about their family, you might turn the focus instead to the place where they mentioned growing up. You could say something like, \"Did you say you grew up in Atlanta? What a coincidence—my sister just moved there. Where was your favorite place to go in the city?\" While you do want to keep things light, it's always possible that you might hit a nerve. If you've asked about something that's made the person seem more deeply troubled, apologize and show empathy . For example, you might say, \"Oh, you seem upset by that topic. I'm so sorry, I'll remember to avoid it in the future. Would you like something to drink?\""

[4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if the person is talking about a recent accomplishment, you might say, \"Congratulations! I really admire how you stuck with it. I'm sure you had to overcome some hurdles to get to that point.\" A compliment is also a great way to start a conversation if you're not sure about an opener. For example, you might say, \"Wow, I love your scarf! It looks so warm and cozy. Is there a story behind it?\" Reader Poll: We asked 164 wikiHow readers, and 48% agreed that the best way to start a conversation when introducing yourself to someone at a party is to compliment something they are wearing .

      "content": "Empathize when they share their feelings. Let them know that you understand where they're coming from. Especially when you're just getting to know someone, they likely aren't looking for advice or assistance. Instead, they just want to connect with you a little and know that they're not alone or weird for feeling the way they do. [5] X Research source For example, if they mention that they've been having car trouble recently, you might say, \"That sounds so frustrating. I hope you find out what the problem is soon so you can put this behind you.\" If they've shared that their nephew's 5th birthday is coming up, you might say, \"Oh, you must be so excited.

[6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Keep in mind that this sharing is a two-way street. Avoid getting too personal too quickly or you could make them uncomfortable. Telling a favorite story of something that happened to you in the past is a great way to share your thoughts and feelings without getting too personal. It's also great to let them know your intentions! If you want to get closer to them, you might say something like, \"It's been really great getting to know you and I'd love to get to know you better.\" [7] X Research source"

Remember that they're getting to know you too and you don't want to come on too strong. Giving them a little space also shows that you respect them, and respect goes a long way in establishing a close friendship. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that just like romantic dating, friendships don't always work out. If the person you're trying to get to know seems uninterested in getting closer to you, try not to take it personally. When you're first getting to know someone, it's often a good idea to save texts for when you're finalizing plans to meet somewhere in person. As long as you're both local, it's usually preferable to get to know someone face-to-face."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if your new friend mentioned they were anxious about a performance review next week, you could follow up and ask how it went. Depending on their answer, you might ask them out (either to celebrate or to cry on your shoulder). If your new friend mentioned that they have to take their dog to the vet, you might text them after the appointment and ask them how it went.

For example, if the two of you are connected on social media and they've expressed interest in an upcoming event, you might message them and ask if they want to go with you. If you've already got something planned, you might also invite them along. For example, if you're talking about art, you might say, \"I was planning on going to a museum opening on Thursday.
