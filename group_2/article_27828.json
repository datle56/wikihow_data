      "title": "Damp skin locks in the scent of the perfume to make it last.",
      "content": "Damp skin locks in the scent of the perfume to make it last. Spritz on perfume or body mist right after getting out of the shower. Pat your body dry first, then add the perfume. Scents can soak into your skin when it’s moisturized, lingering for long periods rather than simply evaporating right away. Remember to apply it directly—not spritz into the air and walk through the cloud of perfume. Spraying it directly onto your skin makes it last longer."

      "title": "Moisturized skin absorbs the perfume’s scent more effectively.",
      "content": "Moisturized skin absorbs the perfume’s scent more effectively. After your shower (or if you don’t have time for one), apply a moisturizer (body oil or body lotion) before spritzing on the perfume. Rub the product into each area that you plan to spray with perfume. Your skin will still be primed for perfume and retain its fragrance longer. An unscented moisturizing lotion is the easiest choice since you’ll be applying scented perfume afterward. Use an unscented deodorant , too. Scented deodorant can clash with the perfume and diminish its scent. However, if desired, you can match the scents of your moisturizer and perfume. Many beauty brands even offer moisturizers and perfumes as matching sets, so you don’t have to find a match yourself."

      "content": "Petroleum jelly holds the scent in place longer. In place of a moisturizer, spread a thin layer of petroleum jelly on your pulse points before applying perfume. Petroleum jelly has a similar moisturizing effect on your skin, locking in the perfume. Once applied, petroleum jelly will preserve the fragrance throughout the day. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The heat of your pulse points can activate and diffuse the perfume.",
      "content": "The heat of your pulse points can activate and diffuse the perfume. Spritz perfume on the insides of your wrists and elbows, behind your ears, or on your sternum. The base of your throat, backs of your knees and ankles are also good point. Because your skin is thinnest in those areas, they produce more heat than the rest of your body. As the perfume warms up, it activates, and its scent radiates out from each spot. Spray some perfume over your heart, too! Of all your pulse points, your heart is the strongest, so it can effectively diffuse the scent of the perfume. Don’t rub your wrists together while applying perfume to pulse points. Rather than enhancing the scent, rubbing causes the fragrance to break down faster. You can also do a general sweep of your body from head to toe while applying perfume, but applying to pulse points is a good way to ensure the scent sticks."

      "content": "Add extra fragrance to your hair by styling it with the scented brush. While it’s not a good idea to spray perfume directly onto your hair since the alcohol in perfume can cause damage, applying it via your hairbrush is a safer method. Spray a little perfume onto your brush, and then run the brush through your hair several times to spread the scent around and produce a lingering effect."

      "content": "Perfume clings to clothing fibers longer than it does to skin. Spray a little perfume into the air and wave your clothes around, or spritz perfume on the inner lining of your shirt, jacket, or scarf. [2] X Research source Although perfume is designed to work with skin and activates fastest when exposed to body heat, it can cling for long periods to your clothing since fabric absorbs scents quickly. Be careful not to spray perfume directly onto clothes that stain easily, like silk. Perfume may smell slightly lighter on your clothes than on your skin, but it should still essentially smell like your perfume of choice!"

      "title": "There are different perfume types, and eau de parfum is the strongest.",
      "content": "There are different perfume types, and eau de parfum is the strongest. While shopping for perfume, you may have noticed that they’re labeled either eau de toilette (EDT) or eau de parfum (EDP). Eau de parfum typically has a higher concentration of fragrance oil, making it more powerful and long-lasting than eau de toilette. If you want your perfume to last, EDPs are your best choice. [3] X Research source Generally, eau de perfumes last about 5 hours while eau de toilettes last 3 hours. However, you can make both last longer using the other tips on this list!"

      "title": "Base notes like vanilla, sandalwood, and cedarwood last longer.",
      "content": "Base notes like vanilla, sandalwood, and cedarwood last longer. While you might enjoy a floral or citrus-scented perfume, they both tend to fade faster than perfume with vanilla or wood. Florals and citrus are top notes; you can smell them the fastest, but they’re not as strong as base notes. Pick a perfume and make sure it has plenty of base notes, as it’ll be more likely to last the day. [4] X Research source “Edible” notes like honey, chocolate, and vanilla all last a very long time, so any perfume that contains those base notes is a great choice!"

      "title": "Layering perfume enhances the scent and moisturizes your skin.",
      "content": "Layering perfume enhances the scent and moisturizes your skin. You can layer a couple of different sprays or use two different types of perfume (spray and roll-on oil, for example). First, test how two fragrances will smell together on a perfume test strip first. Once you have a pair, apply the heavier perfume with base notes first and the lighter perfume with top notes second. [5] X Research source If you don’t want to do the testing yourself, some brands even offer paired fragrances designed to be layered together. Not only does layering prolong the time your perfume lasts, but it’s also a great way to develop a signature scent for yourself."

      "title": "Perfume oils are more concentrated and have a stronger fragrance.",
      "content": "Perfume oils are more concentrated and have a stronger fragrance. Since you roll a stick of perfume oil directly onto pulse points rather than spritzing it, roll-on perfume oil is extremely reactive and diffuses when exposed to body heat. It's made with more fragrance oil than spray perfume and has a stronger scent. [6] X Research source Plus, it hydrates your skin which increases its longevity. Roll-on perfume oil is also usually compact and easy to carry around. Toss some in your purse and bring it with you throughout your day so you can reapply as necessary!"

      "title": "Solid perfume",
      "content": "Solid perfume activates best when spread across pulse points. Like perfume oil, solid perfume goes right onto your skin—and doubles as a moisturizer, which helps the scent of the perfume linger. [7] X Research source Scoop some of the perfume onto your finger and then rub it on your wrists, throat, inner elbows, knees, and the back of your ears, letting it diffuse around you for a long-lasting scent."

      "title": "Light and heat break down the fragrance in your perfume faster.",
      "content": "Light and heat break down the fragrance in your perfume faster. Pick a safe cupboard, a shelf with plenty of shade, or a cool nook to store your perfume . If you leave it on your bathroom counter—or any place that gets light, heat, and humidity regularly—the perfume won’t last as long and will begin to lose its scent. [8] X Research source If your perfume came in a box, it helps to keep it stored in the box long-term to protect the bottle from light exposure. Discard your perfume when it expires. Perfume has an average shelf life of 3 to 5 years, though some may last as long as 10. Check the perfume’s packaging for a more exact expiration date."
