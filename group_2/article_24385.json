      "title": "Introverted Intuition uses inner-world thinking and patterns to process information.",
      "content": "Introverted Intuition uses inner-world thinking and patterns to process information. In the Myers-Briggs personality test, Intuition is the perceiving cognitive function, which determines how you take in the world around you. Someone with Introverted Intuition, or Ni function, most likely enjoys research, metaphors, symbolism, and factual evidence. They’re quickly able to identify patterns, have great observational skills, prefer living in their inner world, and have a knack for knowing things. [1] X Research source In a nutshell, those with an Ni function: Experience “out-of-the-blue” moments. Can solve creative, logical, and spiritual problems quickly. Understand multiple perspectives. May seem critical or stubborn. Value truth. Are easily irritable, overwhelmed, and frustrated."

      "content": "INFJs and INTJs have Introvert Intuition as a dominant function. In Myers-Briggs, 4 mental functions classify your personality type, which can be broken down into 2 categories: dominant and auxiliary functions. The dominant function is the first letter and function and is the core of your personality. [2] X Research source The auxiliary function develops after the dominant function and doesn't necessarily represent a letter in your type. [3] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Because of this, you can have Introverted Intuition as an auxiliary or secondary function if you’re an ENTJ or ENFJ. Having Introverted Intuition as a dominant function is incredibly rare, as INFJs and INTJs make up an estimated 2% of the population. In total, there are 4 different perceiving functions in Myers-Briggs: Introverted Sensing (Si) Extroverted Sensing (Se) Introverted Intuition (Ni) Extroverted Intuition (Ne)"

      "title": "You’re an INFJ or INTJ.",
      "content": "You’re an INFJ or INTJ. You definitely have Introverted Intuition if you have “the Advocate” or “the Architect” personality type. You’re an introvert at heart and most likely enjoy spending time alone rather than in a group. You’re also an excellent observer and prefer to think about the big picture and the “whys” of life.

      "title": "You enjoy abstract concepts.",
      "content": "You enjoy abstract concepts. Even if you’re not an INFJ or INTJ, you may have Introverted Intuition as an auxiliary function if you like finding the deeper or hidden meanings of things. For instance, when reading a book, you read between the lines, naturally finding symbolism and allegory in the smallest of details. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "You think ahead. If you’re constantly thinking of the future, you may have a bit of Introverted Intuition in you. You look at your life in the grand scheme of things and focus on how you can reach your goals and what the future holds.

      "content": "You notice problems faster than others. In other words, you have plenty of “A-ha!” moments throughout the day. Perhaps you see a flaw in someone’s relationship, job performance, or situation. Either way, if you have a habit of weeding out and seeing issues before anyone else, you likely have Introverted Intuition."

      "title": "You get overwhelmed easily.",
      "content": "You get overwhelmed easily. If learning many new things all at once stresses you out, you probably have Introverted Intuition. You’re intelligent and observant, but getting swamped with too much information can be overstimulating, especially in social settings."

      "title": "Introverted Intuitives look at the big picture of life.",
      "content": "Introverted Intuitives look at the big picture of life. These individuals don’t dilly-dally on the small details but rather piece them together to find a more expansive meaning before diving into deeper concepts. They’re extremely observant and often find themselves guiding loved ones to lasting relationships. Overall, an Introverted Intuitive’s life is full of epiphanies that spark greater ideas. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Believe it or not, being an Introverted Intuitive isn’t always a walk in the park. Many of these individuals struggle to make changes in their own lives. While they’re always willing to help others, it may be harder for them to see problems in their day-to-day routine. Keep in mind that every Introverted Intuitive is different. While they have similar personality traits, their overall personality type can alter how their Ni function affects their life."

      "title": "Extroverted Intuitives see the details before the big picture.",
      "content": "Extroverted Intuitives see the details before the big picture. Individuals with an Ne dominant function look at details and imagine the possibilities it can create. In comparison, those with an Ni dominant function look at the big picture before breaking down the details. [8] X Research source Think of it like this: Extroverted Intuitives look at an atom and see every possibility in the universe, whereas Introverted Intuitives see the whole universe and break it down into an atom."

      "title": "Introverted Intuitives focus on deeper meanings.",
      "content": "Introverted Intuitives focus on deeper meanings. One of the main differences between these 2 perceiving functions is that Introverted Intuition is an inner-world process, whereas Extroverted Intuition is an outer-world process. Introverted Intuitives analyze the deep meaning of details in terms of symbolism and metaphor, while Extroverted Intuitives expand information found within the details. [9] X Research source In other words, Extroverted Intuitives are constantly asking, “What’s possible?” while Introverted Intuitives are questioning, “What does this mean?” [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Introverted Intuitives are constantly taking in new information.",
      "content": "Introverted Intuitives are constantly taking in new information. Although it can be overwhelming for them, Introverted Intuitives are always connecting dots and gathering new information—they can’t “turn off” their observational skills. Extroverted Intuitives, on the other hand, aren’t always searching for deeper connections but prefer to live in the moment."
