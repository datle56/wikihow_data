      "content": "Carry a reusable water bottle so you will not need bottled water. While bottled water is convenient, it is also really bad for the environment. Not only does it create trash, but it also uses more resources because it’s shipped to the store. To be more eco-friendly, make it a habit to carry a reusable water bottle with you everywhere so that you can drink water on the go. [1] X Research source Plastic bottles are usually the lightest and most convenient. Look for one that says it’s BPA free. You can also find aluminum and glass water bottles that are a great option if you don’t like using plastic."

      "content": "Use reusable bags while you’re shopping. Shopping bags make it easy to carry your items home, but they also pollute the planet. Skip the store’s shopping bags and bring your own instead. Use a backpack or tote that you already own, or purchase a couple of reusable bags from the checkout area at your local grocery store. [2] X Research source You can use your reusable bags at most stores, including clothing or bookstores. Keep your bags in your car so that it’s less likely you’ll forget them."

      "content": "Reuse items to save them from the landfill. Before you throw something away, look for ways you might reuse it. Try re-purposing items or making green crafts. This will help you keep trash out of the landfill. [3] X Research source For example, instead of throwing away a jar, you might use it as a glass, vase, or storage container. Similarly, you could use a piece of cardboard to make a wreath. You can find ideas for green crafts by searching online."

      "content": "Reduce the amount of time you spend using electronics. While electronics are really fun and likely help you feel connected to your friends, they also use up a lot of energy. Schedule breaks from your electronics so you can use them less. During your breaks, do something fun like going for a walk, playing a game with your friends, or pursuing a hobby. [4] X Research source Invite your friends to connect with you in real life. For instance, instead of playing online video games together, go to a local park."

      "title": "Skip products that have a lot of packaging.",
      "content": "Skip products that have a lot of packaging. Products that come with a lot of packaging are bad for the environment because the packaging is waste. Even if you recycle the package, it’s still an unnecessary waste of resources. Do your best to pick products that have as little packaging as possible. This can keep more trash out of landfills and save natural resources. For example, let’s say you’re buying a notebook for school. If you’re choosing between a notebook that’s wrapped in plastic and one that isn’t, pick the unwrapped notebook."

      "content": "Buy second-hand products or borrow items instead of buying them new. Buying stuff generates more waste and pollution, so try not to purchase things you don’t need. When you do need something, shop local thrift and second-hand shops or use online resale shops. If you can, borrow items that you don’t use often, like tools, from a friend or family member.

      "content": "Buy sustainable and ethical clothing when you need something new. You don’t have to sacrifice your sense of style to go green, but it’s best to avoid cheap, trendy clothing. Instead, buy clothes that are made well and will last you a while. Similarly, research the brands you buy to make sure the clothes aren’t made by underpaid, mistreated employees. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Choose clothes that fit you well and look great on you. This way you’ll always be in style even if you aren’t following every trend. You might spend more money on new items when you buy better clothes. However, this typically saves you money in the long-run because the clothes will last longer."

      "content": "Conserve electricity by turning off lights and unplugging electronics. Electricity is typically generated by burning fossil fuels or using other natural resources. To help protect the planet, cut down on how much electricity you’re using. Here are some tricks to keep your electricity use low: [7] X Research source Turn off lights when you leave a room. Take advantage of natural lighting from windows during the daytime. Unplug electronics when you aren’t using them. Wash your clothes on the cold setting so you don’t use energy to heat the water. Change your light bulbs to energy-efficient light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent light (CFL) or light-emitting diodes (LED). Set your thermostat a few degrees higher during summer and a few degrees lower in winter. Then, wear less clothing if you’re feeling hot or more clothing if you’re cold. This can save electricity and cut down on your heating or cooling costs."

Here are some great options: [8] X Research source Turn off the water when you’re brushing your teeth, washing your hands, or doing the dishes. Take short showers instead of baths. Use a bucket to catch water in the shower so you can use it in your garden. Run your dishwasher only when it’s full. Avoid using sprinklers in your yard.

      "content": "Make your own cleaning supplies. Commercial cleaning products often contain harsh chemicals and come in bottles that you’ll likely end up recycling or throwing away. On the other hand, using homemade cleaning products helps you keep your home safer and helps keep trash out of the landfills. Use white vinegar, baking soda, and lemons to clean your home. For instance, you can use white vinegar with a spritz of lemon as an all-purpose cleaner. If you like, add a few drops of essential oil to make it smell better. Similarly, you can scrub your bathroom and kitchen counters using a paste of baking soda and warm water."

      "content": "Eat less meat because it takes more resources to raise. Raising animals for food requires feed, water, land, and transportation. When you add up these resources, animal products put a lot more strain on the planet than plant foods. To reduce your footprint, eat more vegetarian meals. If you eat a lot of meat, try doing a meatless Monday. Then, slowly introduce more meatless meals into your life."
