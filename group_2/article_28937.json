      "content": "Select a metal or wooden hoop. Pre-made metal or wooden hoops are easy and work great for dreamcatchers. The size of the hoop you buy really depends on how big you want your dreamcatcher to be. However, if this is your first time making a dreamcatcher, try a 5 to 8 inch (13 to 20 cm) hoop. These hoops are neither too big nor too small for beginners. [1] X Research source These hoops can be found at your local crafts store in the yarn and crocheting aisle. Embroidery hoops are another good option for dreamcatchers. [2] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020."

Use a length of lace that is 18 times greater than the diameter of the hoop you are using and with a width no larger than the width of a shoelace, which is about 0.5 in (1.27 cm). [3] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. For example, if you are using a 5 in (13 cm) hoop, use 2.5 yd (2.3 m) of lace. If you do not want to use suede lace, then you can also use ribbon ."

Cut the string so that its length is ten times the diameter of the hoop. Traditionally, natural-colored string is used, but you can use any color you want. [4] X Research source For example, if you are using a 5 in (13 cm) hoop, then you will need 50 in (127 cm) of string."

When you are wrapping the suede lace, make sure there are no spaces between the pieces of lace. Once you have wrapped the glued section, use a small binder clip to hold the lace in place and wait for the glue to dry . This will take about five minutes. [6] X Research source Wrap the suede lace tight enough so that you can’t see the hoop underneath. Use regular craft glue . If you are using regular ribbon, tie a double or triple knot at the starting point instead of using glue to secure the ribbon."

Place a thin line of glue on at least four evenly-spaced spots on the hoop as you continue to wind the lace around. This will ensure that the lace stays in place. [7] X Research source Make sure to use the small binder clips to hold the lace in place where the glue is. Tightly wrap the lace around the hoop so that each loop is touching but not overlapping one another. If you are using ribbon, use the same strategy to secure the ribbon around the hoop."
