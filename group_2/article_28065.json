      "content": "Call, text, and message them constantly. Over communicating with a person can be just as destructive to a relationship as failing to communicate with that person. Make yourself appear needy and insecure by constantly check-in with them via phone call, text, or direct message. Further your cause by contacting them at inappropriate times, such as in the middle of class, a meeting, or a family meal. This will demonstrate that you have little respect for boundaries. With each passing day that you blow up their phone, they may fall more and more out of love with you."

      "title": "Be critical of them.",
      "content": "Be critical of them. Partners accepting of each other’s flaws and quirks. Cast yourself in a shallow and unflattering light by nitpicking every action and decision made by the person who loves you. Criticize their hair, clothing, movie selection, career choice, and car. Your incessant negativity may just drive them away."

    {
      "title": "Be controlling.",
      "content": "Be controlling. In many relationships, partners are able to retain some degree of autonomy over their own life. Deny the person you wish to drive away the ability to make a decision without consulting you first. Your domineering facade may motivate them to cut ties with you so that they can regain control of their life."

      "title": "Stop making your relationship a priority.",
      "content": "Stop making your relationship a priority. In a healthy relationship, couples make time for one another in their busy schedules. If you wish to passively hint that this person is no longer worth your time, limit your interactions with them. Instead of hanging out with your partner or the person crushing on you, pick up a hobby, play video games, hang out with other people, or become highly focused on your career. Eventually, they may decide you aren’t worth their time either. When you do spend time together, act distracted or leave early. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not show any support. Couples loyally support each other through the highs and the lows of life. If you wish to give this person a reason to stop loving you, revoke your support. Do not attend their sporting events or concerts. Do not ask them about their test or pitch. When they come to you for help or advice, minimize their problems or support the other party. Your inability to provide moral support, may make them search for someone more loyal. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Act distant.",
      "content": "Act distant. Partners rely on words and actions to communicate their feelings with each other. By withholding your ability to be vulnerable, you will successfully create an emotional void in your relationship. Refuse to share your feelings—when you are hurt, refuse to talk about it. Avoid all forms of physical contact. Overtime, they may deem you emotionally unavailable and an undesirous partner."

      "title": "Consider your decision carefully.",
      "content": "Consider your decision carefully. Do not flippantly decide to terminate a relationship or convince an individual that you are not worth loving. Before you take any actions you may later regret, pause to contemplate your desire to emotionally distance yourself from this person. Furthermore, determine if you can commit to cutting this individual out of your life. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Accept that the other person is entitled to react as they choose. It is unrealistic to assume that you are capable of or entitled to controlling someone’s emotions. This person is not required to reciprocate your desire to move on or your lack of romantic feelings. Allow them to feel what they feel and give them the time and space they need to process this change. [6] X Research source"
