This is normally enabled by default, but you can check first. To do this: Restart your computer. As soon as it begins to restart, press the key that allows you to enter the BIOS/UEFI settings. This varies by make and model, but common options are F2 , F10 , Del , Esc and F12 . Find the Boot menu, which may be labelled as Boot Options , Boot Order , Boot , or similar. Usually, you can move through different tabs using the arrow keys. Look at the list. The order the devices are listed in is the order in which your computer will look for operating system information. Follow the onscreen instructions (which will usually involve the arrow keys or the + and - keys) to move the CD/DVD drive or Optical Drive to the top of the list. Find the Exit menu and select Exit Saving Changes or similar. If a confirmation prompt appears, click Yes to confirm the changes. Your computer will now restart automatically and attempt to boot from the CD first as specified."
