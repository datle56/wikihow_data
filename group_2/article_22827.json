      "content": "Research your city's regulations related to natural gas. Many cities around the world have banned natural gas hookups and are phasing out existing natural gas lines. Cities have or might already have done this include New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. If you can't use natural gas, you will still be able to use electric or induction."

      "title": "Get a gas stove that attaches to the gas source you have in your home.",
      "content": "Get a gas stove that attaches to the gas source you have in your home. Your home will either use propane or natural gas, so your appliance needs to match the fuel. Before you buy your new appliance, check the gas source in your home so you can get the right type of stove. If you don’t currently have a gas line installed in your home, then you need to have one put in before you can run any gas stove. [1] X Research source If you have one type of fuel in your home and you want to switch, then you need to have a professional install the gas lines for you. If you have the wrong type of appliance for your gas system, you may be able to have a technician convert it for you. Propane burns more efficient than natural gas and the emissions do not harm the environment."

      "content": "Check that you have a 120-volt grounded outlet and range-quality gas valve. Electrical plugs for stoves have a 3-prong outlet adaptor, so the outlet you plug into must be grounded. Plug a circuit tester into the outlet where you plan on installing your stove to see if it’s grounded, and fix it yourself or hire an electrician if it’s not grounded. Then check the gas line to make sure that the gas line has a range-quality valve. If not, you may need to hire a technician to install one on the gas line for you. You can buy a circuit tester from your local hardware store."

      "content": "Clean your work area so there’s nothing in the way of your new stove. Clear any countertops nearby and make sure there isn’t anything on the floor around the area where you’re installing the stove. Sweep the area to clean any dust or dirt from the area so it isn’t as dirty under your new stove. Double check the width and depth of the space where you’re installing the stove to make sure your appliance fits, and make any adjustments that you need to. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Level the feet of your new stove so they sit on the ground flat.",
      "content": "Level the feet of your new stove so they sit on the ground flat. Have a helper assist you with tipping the stove backward and laying it on a towel so you can access the feet. Rotate the feet on the bottom of the stove counterclockwise to extend them further or clockwise to retract them. Loosen or tighten each of the legs by the same amount and tip it back up to test if it’s level. If the stove wobbles, adjust any feet that are too long or short until it’s sturdy. [3] X Research source Your floor may not be perfectly level, so your stove may wobble even if all the feet are the same length."

    {
      "title": "Check that the stove’s gas valve is in the off position.",
      "content": "Check that the stove’s gas valve is in the off position. Locate the gas valve for your stove on a pipe near your floor behind your old stove or where you plan on installing a new one. The valve should already be off, but confirm that it’s turned perpendicular to the pipe so there isn’t a natural gas leak. Once the gas is off, you can continue working. [4] X Research source Don’t work on your stove while the gas is still on because it’s unsafe to breathe and is extremely flammable. If you come into a strong smell of natural gas, turn off the valve and leave your home before calling emergency services. Do not use any electronics or items that create a spark."

      "title": "Apply pipe sealer to the threading on the stove.",
      "content": "Apply pipe sealer to the threading on the stove. Get a pipe sealer that’s made to use for gas lines; otherwise, the gas will leak through the seam. Use the brush on the cap of the pipe sealer to apply a thin layer to the threaded section on your stove, which is usually located near the bottom corner. Make sure you create a complete seal around the threading so the gas can’t escape. [5] X Research source You can buy gas pipe sealers at hardware stores. You can also use pipe sealing tape if you have it. Wrap the tape around the threading 2-3 times to form the seal."

      "title": "Attach a regulator to the stove if it doesn’t already have one.",
      "content": "Attach a regulator to the stove if it doesn’t already have one. A regulator is a box-shaped piece of pipe that controls the pressure of the gas entering your stove. While most stoves come with a regulator built in, you may have to attach one to some models. Buy a regulator that matches the brand and output of your stove and screw it onto the pipe threading you applied the sealer to. Spin the nut on the regulator clockwise until it’s hand-tight, and then use a wrench to tighten it as far as you can. [6] X Research source You can buy stove regulators at appliance stores or online."

      "content": "Seal the threading on the regulator with the pipe sealer. Dip the brush back into the gas pipe sealer and rub it around the threading on the end of the regulator. Make sure you make a complete seal or else the gas could leak out from your pipes. Work within 5 minutes after you apply the sealer so it doesn’t dry before you attach it. [7] X Research source Only use a sealer meant for gas pipes to prevent leaks."

Make sure the flexible gas line has the same size threading on the end or else it will not fit your stove without an adaptor. Screw one end of the gas line onto the regulator’s threading by hand. When you can’t turn it anymore, hold the nut on the regulator in place with channel lock pliers and tighten the end of the gas line using a wrench. [8] X Research source You can buy flexible gas lines from hardware or appliance stores. Don’t reuse an old flexible gas line since it may be more prone to leaking."

Screw the flexible gas line clockwise by hand until you can’t turn it anymore. Grip the nut on the main gas pipe with channel lock pliers so it doesn’t move around, and use an adjustable wrench to tighten the flexible pipe more. [9] X Research source Be careful not to overtighten the pipes since they could crack or get damaged."

      "content": "Turn the gas back on for your stove. Find the valve on the main gas pipe for your stove, which should be perpendicular to the pipes and in the off position. Rotate the valve so it’s parallel to the pipes so the gas is on. This allows the gas into the flexible line and stove so you can check the seals between the pipes. [11] X Research source If you can smell natural gas after you turn on the gas, then immediately turn it off and reseal the gas lines."

      "content": "Spray the soapy water onto the gas line connections to your stove. Hold the spray bottle as close to the connections you sealed and spray some of the soapy water onto them. Make sure you apply the soapy water all the way around the pipe so it’s completely wet. If there’s a gas leak, the soapy water will start to bubble around the connections so you know that there’s a small leak. Check each of the connections you made and mark any of them that are leaking. [12] X Research source If the soapy water doesn’t bubble, then you don’t need to make any changes."

      "content": "Turn on each burner individually to test them. One by one, turn each burner on your stove onto high until you hear the igniter clicking. The igniter will take about 4 seconds before the flame starts, but it may take slightly longer the first time you turn it on. Once the flame starts, turn the burner to low to ensure the gas flow adjusts properly. Turn the burner off when you’re done testing it before moving onto the next one. [15] X Research source If the burners do not work, then you may need to check your gas supply line again to see if the valve is turned on. If it is, then you may need to contact a technician to check your stove for you."
