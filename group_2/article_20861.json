      "title": "Choose a lollipop or candy in a flavor you know your partner likes.",
      "content": "Choose a lollipop or candy in a flavor you know your partner likes. If you're not sure what they like, try a safe, popular candy, either something minty or fruity. Avoid chocolate, though, since rubbing chocolate on your lips might look a bit unappealing (and will also ruin the surprise!). Peppermint, cherry, grape, watermelon, or cinnamon are great flavors for a candy kiss. Hard candies tend to work best, since you can dissolve the flavors onto your lips and tongue."

      "content": "Wet the candy and rub it on your lips like lipstick. Suck on the candy for a few moments to get it wet. Then, rub it across your lips 3-4 times like lip gloss to spread the flavor. Do this just moments before you go in for the kiss—if you wait too long, the flavor will fade. Also, the sugar in the candy might give you bad breath over time. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do this when your partner is distracted, so that the flavor of the kiss is a sweet surprise! Be careful not to spread the candy across your face. Keep it just to your lips so that you look your best, and you don’t have distracting sticky residue."

      "content": "Kiss your partner! If you think your partner is up for it, you may want to keep the candy in your mouth (if it's a hard candy, like a butterscotch or mint). Baller says to make a move by grabbing your partner’s hips or pulling them close by the hand. Press your lips firmly but gently to theirs, so that the flavor comes across. After a few seconds, pull away and give them a flirty smile. To be extra flirty, pass the candy from your mouth to theirs. Just keep in mind that there’s a chance they’re not into this. And use caution; this could be a choking hazard."

      "content": "Pick out a candy flavored lip gloss or chapstick. There are loads of candy glosses and lip balms out there to choose from. Go with something powerful like peppermint, or choose something more interesting like root beer. It’s up to you! Stay away from flavors you know your partner doesn’t like. Plenty of people don’t love cinnamon, for example. When in doubt, choose a fruity flavor."

      "title": "Apply the lip gloss to your lips.",
      "content": "Apply the lip gloss to your lips. Give the gloss or balm 2-3 strokes across both lips, then pop your lips together to distribute it. You want enough that your partner notices, but not so much that it’s caked on or super tacky or sticky. Do this right before you plan to make your move, so that the flavor is strongest, since balms and glosses tend to break down pretty quickly. [2] X Research source Give your kiss a boost by wearing a fragrance that is similar to the flavor of your lip gloss, like a fruity perfume to match a fruity gloss. It’ll make the kiss that much more powerful."

Then, just pull your partner close and plant a kiss on their lips! Let your lips linger on theirs for a moment, like 1-2 seconds, so that the flavor really comes across, then pull away."

      "content": "Exfoliate your lips beforehand to make them nice and soft. You don't want your lips hard or chapped and dry. Exfoliate them with an exfoliating lip scrub or a toothbrush dipped in petroleum jelly to remove any dead, flaky skin and leave your lips smooth and soft. [3] X Research source Make your own lip scrub by combining a pinch of brown sugar and a little honey, olive oil, or coconut oil. Gently rub the exfoliant or toothbrush over your lips using small, circular motions. Don't be too rough. Wipe your lips with a washcloth to remove all the petroleum jelly or lip exfoliator."

      "content": "Moisturize your lips to keep them soft. Instead of a lip gloss or chapstick, which can seal the skin on your lips and keep moisture out , look specifically for a hydrating lip moisturizer and apply it right after showering. [4] X Research source Choose a lip moisturizer with vitamins A, B, and E, which moisturize and help with absorbency. Apply a few drops of vitamin-rich sesame seed oil if you are in a pinch. Just be sure to do this a few hours before the kiss, since the sesame flavor might overpower the candy."

      "title": "Brush your teeth and tongue about 30 minutes before the kiss.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth and tongue about 30 minutes before the kiss. If you're going to use a real piece of candy and not a flavored lip gloss, the minty flavor of the toothpaste may interfere with the sweetness of the candy and create a bad taste. You definitely want to start with a clean mouth, however, so make sure you brush your teeth 30-60 minutes before you think you're going to kiss your partner, so the mint flavor has time to fade. [5] X Research source If you're planning to only flavor your lips, try to brush your teeth right before you meet your partner."

      "title": "Choose the right time and place.",
      "content": "Choose the right time and place. If this is a first kiss , or you’re kissing a new partner, timing is crucial! Choose a romantic moment, like at the end of a date, or when the two of you are alone together in a quiet spot. Or, if you’re kissing a longtime partner, you might just surprise them in the middle of the day, when you’re spending time together. Jacoby reminds us that it’s important to get consent for a first kiss, which is as simple as asking! Keep in mind that not everyone is comfortable giving passionate kisses in public. If you’re out and about, you might keep it brief and short."

      "content": "Touch them with your hands to add some passion. Baller says that a “bit of light physical contact” can really elevate a kiss. He suggests placing your hand on your partner’s arm while you kiss, or grabbing them by the hips. You might also gently hold their jaw or chin to pull their face toward you to make it more passionate . Or, put your hand on their thigh, or wrap your arms around their neck. Don’t be afraid to get physical!"

      "content": "Mix it up, go with the flow, and match their vibe. Baller says that “You want to fit together like a puzzle.” A kiss is a two-way street! It’s also like a dance. When you kiss, match your partner’s energy. If they start to pull away, let them. If they go in for another, or start to get a little more passionate, follow their lead, as long as you’re comfortable. Also, don’t be afraid to take the lead, either! If it feels right, you might add a little tongue, which can also help make the candy flavor come through, if you prepped by sucking on candy. You might also pull away and end the kiss with a quick peck on the cheek . Remember to breathe! If you need air, just pull away and smile, then go back in."

      "content": "The candy kiss challenge is a popular online trend for couples. In the challenge, one person eats a candy, which they keep secret from their partner. Then, the couple kisses and the second person has to guess which candy their partner just ate based on the flavor of the kiss. (In some versions of the challenge, partners swap candy without looking at it and have to guess what they have in their mouth.) It’s a goofy, sweet, and romantic way to get a little flirty and intimate with your partner. The trend is big on YouTube and TikTok, where many popular influencer couples gave it a shot. It’s unclear where the trend started, but the earliest videos were uploaded to the internet about 3 years ago."
