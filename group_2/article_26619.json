      "content": "Avoid taking iron supplements. Since red blood cells determine your hematocrit level, avoid taking iron supplements, which can increase the production of red blood cells. If you have any condition that affects your iron levels or red blood cells, you should not take iron supplements.

      "content": "Stay hydrated. Dehydration increases hematocrit levels because it lowers all water content in your body (including plasma in your blood), increasing the ratio of red blood cells to blood volume. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This means that when you are severely dehydrated, your hematocrit level will be elevated; on the other hand, if you have a sufficient amount of water in your body, your hematocrit level should remain normal. [4] X Research source If you don’t like the taste of water, try sparkling water or add a slice of lemon or lime. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Electrolyte drinks, like Gatorade or Powerade, can replenish fluid in your body, but they are usually high in sugar. Limit drinking them when you sweat or work out. [6] X Research source Generally, men should drink about 15.5 cups of water daily, while women should drink about 11.5 cups. You may need to drink more fluids if you’re sweating, in a hot environment, or taking medications that make you retain water.

      "content": "Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Alcohol and caffeine are diuretics, which can make you urinate more often and lead to dehydration. [8] X Research source To keep your hematocrit levels low, skip the soda, wine, hard liquor, and beer, and stick to water or unsweetened juices."

      "content": "Eat grapefruit every day. Some studies show that eating half to a whole grapefruit per day can lower your hematocrit levels. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You could eat half a grapefruit with your breakfast and eat the other half as a snack at midday. This is because naringin, a flavonoid seen in high concentrations in grapefruit, can lead to phagocytosis, which is a process that naturally removes red blood cells from your blood, converting them into other uses."

      "content": "Add more antioxidants to your diet. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals, which have been linked to cancer and other heart diseases. When you consume supplements or foods rich in antioxidants, you prevent oxidative damage to your red blood cells, making sure they can effectively bind and carry oxygen. [10] X Research source Good sources of these are prunes, beans, and berries. [11] X Research source Antioxidants also protect red blood cell function and integrity, and may prevent chronic diseases.

      "content": "Stick to lower altitudes. Areas with high elevation have a lower oxygen concentration than areas with lower elevation. An area of more than 8,000 feet (2,438.4 m) above sea level is considered to have “thinner oxygen.” Studies show people living at high altitudes may have higher hematocrit levels, since blood plasma volume decreases. [17] X Research source To adapt to the environment, your body produces more red blood cells to compensate for the low oxygen level. As a result, it increases your hematocrit levels."

      "content": "Stop smoking . Nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products impairs blood circulation by reducing oxygen delivery by your red blood cells. [18] X Research source The body compensates for the problem of having low oxygen levels by having the bone marrow produce more red blood cells, increasing the hematocrit levels in your body.

PV causes the bone marrow to produce too many red blood cells. [21] X Research source Do not jump to any conclusions if you have a high hematocrit count. Consulting your doctor is the best way to know how to reduce your hematocrit level effectively, and the only way to know why your hematocrit level is high."
