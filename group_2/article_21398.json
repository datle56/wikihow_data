      "content": "Use thick, healthy cuttings that are least 12 inches (30 cm) or longer. To take a cutting , use a pair of pruning shears to cut off a thick, healthy-looking branch from a mature plumeria plant. Target brown or darker green branches, as these colors indicate that the branches are mature and suitable for cutting. If you're making the cuts yourself rather than purchasing them online or in-store, it’s best to take the 12-inch (30 cm) cuttings in the early spring. [1] X Research source Clean your garden shears with rubbing alcohol so you don’t spread bacteria or disease to your plumeria cuttings."

      "title": "Cut the flowers and leaves off the branch using pruning shears.",
      "content": "Cut the flowers and leaves off the branch using pruning shears . Existing flowers and leaves will compete with new root growth and inhibit the growth of your cutting. To prevent this, use your sterilized pruning shears to cut off any leaves or flowers from your cutting at a 45-degree, downward angle. Check the cut you made at the end of the branch. If it’s jagged, clean it up by re-clipping the end at a downward, 45-degree angle using pruning shears. Be sure to wear gardening gloves , as the plumeria has a sticky sap that can get on your hands and clothing."

      "content": "Dry out the cuttings in a shady, humid area for 1-2 weeks. It’s necessary to dry out your cuttings before you plant the plumeria. Let your cuttings sit for 1-2 weeks in a shady, humid area to allow the freshly cut end to callous over and dry out. [2] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source If your plumeria cutting doesn't callous over, it won't root, making the drying-out period an essential step."

      "content": "Store the cuttings in a cool, dry area until you’re ready to plant them. Once the plumeria has calloused and dried, the cuttings are ready for planting—hurray! If you plan to store the cuttings before planting them, wrap and secure the cut end of the cutting with plastic wrap and a rubber band.

Your pot size will determine how large your plumeria can grow, so opt for a bigger pot if you’re aiming for bountiful blooms! Ensure your pot of choice has drainage holes on the bottom so water doesn’t pool and rot your precious cutting. [4] X Research source Each plumeria cutting will need a separate pot."

Fill the pot 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the brim to give the cutting enough medium to grow in and to prevent overflow when you water.

Dip the cut end of the cutting into a cup of water first, then dip 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the cutting into the root growth hormone powder.

To do this, plant a stake deep into the soil in the pot, then attach the stake to the cutting with wire or string. This will help hold the cutting in place as the roots form."

During this stage, plumerias require very little water and should only be watered about once every 10 days. [8] X Research source Plumeria should be kept in temperatures above 60 °F (16 °C).

However, if your area is suffering from a drought or the plumeria is indoors, thoroughly soak the top of the soil and let the water drain out of the bottom of the pot once a week. [9] X Research source Don’t overwater your plumeria, as this will kill it. If the soil 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep feels moist, it doesn’t need water."
