      "content": "Using one-word responses will make him miss hearing your thoughts and opinions. Some time-sensitive and planning questions or statements do require an answer like ‚ÄúDo you want Chinese for dinner?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out. Be back at 12.‚Äù Even though you‚Äôre answering him, you‚Äôre still ignoring him by giving him less attention. [3] X Research source Give straight answers that require no explanation. Blunt answers like ‚Äúokay,‚Äù ‚Äúnah,‚Äù and ‚Äúfine‚Äù show that you‚Äôre listening but don‚Äôt want to engage in a full conversation. Your voice matters, so show him how valuable you are by removing yourself from detailed conversations. If he texts you ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù respond with a üëç or a short ‚ÄúOk.‚Äù"

      "content": "Let him leave a voicemail so he learns not to take your attention for granted. Take your time reaching out to him, waiting hours or even days to call him back. If he sends you a text, leave him on read. [4] X Research source By seeing that you read his message but didn‚Äôt respond, he will wonder why you‚Äôre not talking to him and if he could have done something to hurt you. Only respond if he has a question you alone can answer, especially if it has to do with child care or finances. Wait a couple of hours before hitting that redial button so he knows you‚Äôre still mad. Changing his ringtone can help you be prepared when he calls. Instead of scrambling to find your phone when it rings, you can let it go to voicemail when you hear his ringtone."

Do something you love while he thinks. You can teach him a valuable lesson by just being out of the equation. Give him time to question what he‚Äôs done, and let him realize how much he misses you when you‚Äôre not there."

Invite some guy friends over for a movie night or go to a sporting event together. Post a group picture on social media to show your boyfriend how much fun you‚Äôre having! Be careful not to be overly flirtatious. You don‚Äôt want to give your boyfriend the impression that you‚Äôre cheating. Keep it cool and casual. Remember that he‚Äôll come after you if he wants to.
