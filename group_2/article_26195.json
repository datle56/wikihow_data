While you might be tempted to cut it out cold-turkey, To avoid the urge to constantly check your email and social media when you’re trying to lock in, Pauer advises choosing set times that you’ll check them.

      "content": "Take a 10-minute break every hour. “Your brain needs rest in order to be productive,” Pauer explains. “Schedule and take regular breaks throughout the day (ideally 5-10 minutes every hour) to maximize your energy and ability to focus.” If you don’t have that much time to pause, try to take a break every 2 or 4 hours at a minimum. When it is time to lock in, you’ll feel more ready. Another option is to practice the Pomodoro technique. To follow this method, take 5-minute breaks after every 25 minutes of work. After four 25-minute intervals, take a longer 15-30 minute break. [6] X Research source"
