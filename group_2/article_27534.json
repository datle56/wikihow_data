In fact, you won't build muscle unless you take in plenty of calories to feed muscle growth in your legs. This doesn't mean you should go wild and eat everything you want, but when your aim is to get bigger legs, getting more calories is essential. Eating 3 regular meals plus snacks filled with high quality foods will also help you gain some healthy weight, adding shape and definition to your legs.

      "content": "Do intense workouts. Your leg muscles are used to carrying your body (and whatever else you’re holding) up and down stairs and everywhere else you go throughout the day. To make these muscles grow, you need to focus on doing workouts more intense than those you might design for parts of your body that don’t get as much exercise. That means every workout you do should get your heart rate up and cause the muscles in your legs to “burn,” so to speak. You need to break down the fibers and have them build back up stronger and bigger. For each exercise, lift as much weight as you can lift using the correct form for 10 reps. If you can lift the weight easily for 15 reps, it’s too light. If you can’t lift it more than a few times without needing to stop, it’s too heavy. Add more weight after a few weeks to keep up the intensity. Use explosive bursts of energy, rather than slowly going through the motions. Exercising explosively builds the muscle fibers of the legs. Be slow on the eccentric motion, then explosive on the contraction."

This way your muscles get a chance to rest and get stronger in between workouts. It also keeps you from plateauing by keeping your muscles in a state of \"shock,” putting them through the process of breaking down and building back up every stronger. [9] X Research source If you do a hard workout that includes squats, box jumps, and leg curls one week, switch to stiff-legged deadlifts, lying leg curls and lunges the next week.
