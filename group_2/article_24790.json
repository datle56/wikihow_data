      "content": "Splash cool water on your face to slow down condensation. By lowering the difference in temperatures between the outside of the goggles and your face, you might be able to decrease the amount of fog that forms on the lenses. Splash a little bit of cold water over your face 4 or 5 times immediately before putting your goggles on to cool your face down. [1] X Research source While this might work on the fly, this isn't a great long-term fix. Consider investing in different goggles if the problem persists."

      "content": "Rub a small amount of saliva on the inside of the goggles for a cheap solution. Just before putting on your goggles, spit lightly into each lens. [2] X Research source Use one finger to lightly spread the saliva around the lenses until both are covered, building up a small film that can reduce fog. [3] X Research source While this isn’t a long-lasting method for preventing fog in your goggles, it is one of the most effective methods that won’t cost you a cent. Use this technique if you need to stop your goggles from fogging up for a short period of time."

      "title": "Try using baby shampoo or another liquid soap to stop condensation.",
      "content": "Try using baby shampoo or another liquid soap to stop condensation. Put a small drop of a liquid soap on your finger and rub it around the lenses of your swimming or work goggles. Dip the goggles in some clean, non-chlorinated water and wash the soap away. A tiny amount of soap remaining on the inside of your goggles will stop fog from forming on the plastic. Make sure you wash the excess soap out of the goggles before putting them on, so as to avoid getting soap in your eyes. Using baby shampoo or something similar may also help, as it will hurt less if you get it in your eyes. Instead of soap, you can also use a tiny amount of shaving cream smeared thinly over each lens. Again, make sure you wash it off to avoid getting any minty gel in your eyes as you swim. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub a cut potato over your lenses to repel water. Cut a small chunk from a potato to expose some of the flesh. Rub this over the lenses of your goggles to build up a thin protective layer that will work to repel water and moisture from sticking. Wash the lenses in clean water to remove any visible residue. [5] X Research source While this may work on plastic lenses, it’s generally most effective when used on goggles with lenses made from glass."

      "title": "Clean your goggles with toothpaste and a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Clean your goggles with toothpaste and a toothbrush. Put a small amount of toothpaste on the inside of your lenses. With a clean, damp toothbrush, spread the toothpaste around and lightly scrub the inside of the lenses. Rinse your goggles in clean, unchlorinated water to remove any leftover toothpaste. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source The light abrasion of the toothbrush and the toothpaste will remove any protective film on the lenses, as well as giving it a thorough clean. A thin layer of toothpaste will remain, that can help prevent fog from building up on the lenses."

      "content": "Opt for an anti-fog spray or fog prevention wipe for a long-term solution. If you don’t like the idea of putting saliva or soap on the inside of your goggles or don’t find that either of these methods lasts long enough, you can also purchase anti-fog products from your local sporting goods or swim store. You should always follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided, but here are a few products and the recommended way to use them. [8] X Research source Spray a small amount of anti-fog spray on the inside of your goggles. Use a clean cloth to rub it into each lens before rinsing them clean. This will get rid of excess spray and leave a thin layer on the inside of your goggles. Take a single fog prevention wipe from its packet and use it to wipe down both lenses of your goggles.

      "title": "Choose protective eyewear that sits further from your face to reduce fogging.",
      "content": "Choose protective eyewear that sits further from your face to reduce fogging. The main cause of fogging in protective eyewear or masks is moisture from your breath or face getting heated and trapped inside the goggles. Look for eyewear with better ventilation, or that will sit further from your face to reduce the amount of moisture and heat that can build up on your goggles."

      "content": "Purchase anti-fogging swimming goggles for an easy solution. There are several different types of swimming and scuba goggles that come pre-coated with a layer of material that prevents fog from forming. [10] X Research source Look at your local swimming or sports store for goggles that are marked as “anti-fogging” or something similar to easily reduce condensation."

      "title": "Burn away the protective film over the inside of your scuba goggles.",
      "content": "Burn away the protective film over the inside of your scuba goggles. Scuba diving masks are often made with a thin, protective film coating the inside of the lenses, which will easily accumulate fog. Hold a lighter around 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the lenses and move it around, trying to cover the whole surface of the glass. Let the goggles cool naturally before rinsing them. [11] X Research source Make sure not to burn or melt any silicon, rubber or plastic insulation around the edge of the goggles, as this may stop them from being entirely waterproof. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this yourself, your local diving shop may be able to burn your goggles for you."
