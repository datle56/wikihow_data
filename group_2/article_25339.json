      "title": "Lift your pinky back further than 90 degrees.",
      "content": "Lift your pinky back further than 90 degrees. Rest your palm and forearm on a flat surface, bending your elbow at a 90-degree angle. Reach over with your other hand and lift your pinky finger back towards your body. If it goes further than 90 degrees, you have hypermobile fingers in that hand. [1] X Research source Repeat the test with your other hand. Give yourself 1 point for each pinky that you are able to lift back further than 90 degrees—up to 2 points total for this part of the test."

      "title": "Push your thumb back to touch your forearm.",
      "content": "Push your thumb back to touch your forearm. Hold your arm out straight in front of you so your palm faces down. Press your thumb towards your inner forearm with your other hand. If you can push it all the way back so that it touches your forearm, you have hypermobile thumbs. [2] X Research source Repeat the test on your other thumb. You get 1 point for each thumb that can touch your inner forearm—up to 2 points total for this part of the test."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your elbow upwards more than 10 degrees.",
      "content": "Open your elbow upwards more than 10 degrees. Hold your arms outstretched, even with your shoulders. Your palms should be facing upward. Lower your wrist and forearm to open your elbow further so that it appears to bend backward. If the bend seems greater than 10 degrees, give yourself a point for each elbow. [3] X Research source If you're doing this by yourself, stand in front of a mirror. You may also find it easier to do one arm at a time rather than trying to assess both at once. This level of hypermobility can be difficult to measure on your own. If a physical therapist were conducting this test, they would likely use an instrument called a goniometer to measure the angle of your joints."

      "title": "Extend your knees backward more than 10 degrees.",
      "content": "Extend your knees backward more than 10 degrees. Stand with your knees locked and extend them backward as far as possible. If your knees extend further than 10 degrees backward, add 1 point for each side to your score. [4] X Research source If you're doing this by yourself, stand sideways in front of a full-length mirror and evaluate one side at a time. As with elbows, hypermobility in your knees can be difficult to assess on your own. Consider any extent to which you can bend your knees backward from the straight locked position to indicate hypermobility."

    {
      "title": "Bend at the waist and place your palms on the floor.",
      "content": "Bend at the waist and place your palms on the floor. Stand with your feet together and your knees straight. If you can bend from the waist and place your palms flat against the floor in front of your feet without bending your knees, you have a hypermobile spine. [5] X Research source If you can do this with your knees locked straight, give yourself 1 point."

      "title": "Total your points to find your Beighton hypermobility score.",
      "content": "Total your points to find your Beighton hypermobility score. Add up the points from each of the joints tested. A score of 4 or greater indicates you have generalized hypermobility. In basic terms, this means many of your joints have a greater range of motion than what is considered normal. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even if you have a relatively low score, you may have hypermobility in other joints that aren't evaluated in the Beighton test, such as the jaw, neck, shoulders, hips, ankles, and feet."

    {
      "title": "Evaluate the levels of pain and stiffness in your joints.",
      "content": "Evaluate the levels of pain and stiffness in your joints. If you have hypermobility, feeling pain or stiffness in your joints is extremely common. This is especially likely after physical exercise and may also be more apparent in the evenings. [7] X Research source If you feel joint pain after exercising, you may want to change the type of exercise you do. High-impact exercises are particularly hard on hypermobile joints. For example, if you run, you may switch to a lower-impact exercise, such as biking, and see if you notice a difference."

      "title": "Review your medical history for joint dislocations.",
      "content": "Review your medical history for joint dislocations. If you've frequently experienced joint dislocations, such as a dislocated shoulder, this may be a symptom of hypermobility syndrome. Recurring soft-tissue injuries, such as sprains or ligament tears, may also signal that you have hypermobility syndrome. [8] X Research source The types of injuries you've experienced also depend on the type of activities you've done. For example, if you play soccer, recurring knee injuries may not necessarily indicate hypermobility syndrome because soccer is hard on the knees."

      "title": "Determine if you have any digestive issues.",
      "content": "Determine if you have any digestive issues. Many digestive system problems, such as acid reflux , constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are also present in people who have hypermobility syndrome. Although doctors aren't entirely sure why, it is believed to be caused by weakened muscles in your digestive tract. [9] X Research source Occasional digestive issues aren't typically considered a symptom of hypermobility syndrome, even if you also have hypermobile joints. On the other hand, a chronic condition for which you are under medical care could be considered a symptom. Urinary incontinence also may be a symptom of hypermobility syndrome."

      "title": "Note if your skin is fragile or bruises easily.",
      "content": "Note if your skin is fragile or bruises easily. Many people with hypermobility syndrome also have thin, stretchy skin that is fragile and easily damaged. If you tend to bruise easily or frequently develop stretch marks, that could be a symptom of hypermobility syndrome. [10] X Research source Stretch marks and frequent bruising can also be symptomatic of other conditions, not necessarily hypermobility syndrome. For example, if you've recently lost a lot of weight or were recently pregnant, you may have stretch marks, but they wouldn't be considered a symptom of hypermobility syndrome."

      "title": "Discuss your symptoms with your doctor.",
      "content": "Discuss your symptoms with your doctor. If you have hypermobile joints and more than one of the symptoms of hypermobility syndrome, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Tell them you believe you have hypermobility syndrome and list the symptoms that have led you to believe this. Your doctor may prescribe medications to ease joint pain, stiffness, or other symptoms. They may also suggest activities you should avoid or lifestyle changes you can make. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Hypermobility syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, especially if your doctor doesn't have your full medical history. Your doctor will test the flexibility of your joints and may order blood tests or X-rays to rule out other conditions before making a diagnosis. If you have a history of recurring joint dislocations or soft-tissue injuries, tell your doctor the injuries you've experienced and the context in which you were injured. They will evaluate whether the injuries are a possible symptom of hypermobility syndrome. Your doctor may also refer you to a geneticist or a rheumatologist for more specialized evaluation."

      "content": "Monitor your body positioning to keep your joints neutral. Mentally check in with your joints and adjust as necessary to keep them in a neutral position. This may take conscious effort at first, but after a while, you'll get in the habit of keeping your joints in a neutral position (neither flexed nor fully extended.) Joints that are hypermobile are often loose. Keeping them in a neutral position prevents further weakening of the surrounding muscles. If you spend long hours engaged in repetitive motions, such as typing or knitting, take breaks and allow your joints to rest. Make sure you do not lock your knees while standing. Keep them slightly bent or soft. [12] X Research source Correcting your posture can also help decrease back and neck pain, which are common if you have a hypermobile spine.

      "content": "Get a referral for a physical therapist from your doctor. A physical or occupational therapist can prescribe specific stretches and exercises to help ease joint pain and strengthen the muscles supporting hypermobile joints. Getting a referral from your doctor may get you an appointment sooner than if you tried to book one on your own. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Some physical therapists will want to work with you themselves. However, they'll typically give you a range of exercises to perform at home each day. If any stretches or exercises prescribed by your physical therapist cause you pain, let them know as soon as possible so they can evaluate your joints and adjust your program."

      "title": "Strengthen",
      "content": "Strengthen and condition the muscles around the joints. The looser joints associated with hypermobility may cause the muscles around those joints to be weaker than they normally would. A basic strength training program can help build those muscles to reduce joint pain as well as decrease your risk of injury. [15] X Research source Start your strength training program slowly, using only your body weight as resistance for the first 2 to 4 weeks, especially if you've never worked out with weights. When you feel comfortable, gradually increase the resistance, starting with small weights and working your way up. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist before you start strength training. They may suggest some exercises that would help you and particular exercises and movements to avoid. Try doing isometric exercises to strengthen your joints without putting stress on them. For example, you could do straight leg raises while lying on your back."

      "content": "Engage in low-impact cardio exercise 3 to 5 times a week. Cardiovascular exercise improves your blood flow and the oxygenation of your muscles. This may decrease your joint pain and reduce stiffness in your joints. Low-impact activities, such as swimming or cycling, won't cause further stress to your joints.
