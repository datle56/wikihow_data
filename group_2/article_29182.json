      "title": "Boil the potato.",
      "content": "Boil the potato. Place 1 small potato in a medium stockpot and cover with water. Place the pot on the stove on high heat to bring it to a boil. Allow the potato to boil for 5 to 10 minutes, or until you can easily pierce it with a fork. Remove the pot from the heat, and drain the potato. [1] X Research source After draining the potato, let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes, or until you can comfortably touch it. Potatoes brighten and lighten skin because they contain catecholase, which reduces dark spots by inhibiting melanin production. They also contain vitamin C, which helps with pigmentation and natural starches that gently exfoliate, promoting a more radiant complexion."

      "content": "Mash the potato and add the oil. Place the cooled potato in a small bowl, and use a fork to mash it. Next, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil and mix it with the potato to form a thick paste. [2] X Research source You can substitute sweet almond oil for the olive oil if you prefer."

      "content": "Apply the mask to your hands and allow it to sit. When the potato and oil are mixed, carefully cover both of your hands with the mixture. Let the mask sit for at least 15 minutes so it has time to penetrate and soothe the dry, irritated skin. [3] X Research source When you apply the mask, gently massage it in in a circular motion for the best results."

      "content": "Combine all of the ingredients. In a small bowl, mix 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons (14 g) of honey, and 2 teaspoons (10 g) of baking soda. Stir the ingredients together until they are fully combined. The citric acid in the lemon helps lighten dark spots and other discolorations on your hands. You can substitute lime juice if you prefer."

      "content": "Mix all of the ingredients. Add ½ avocado, 1 egg white, 2 tablespoon (11 g) of oats, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice to a small bowl. Use a fork to completely blend the ingredients and form a thick paste. [5] X Research source Because the mask recipe calls for so little avocado, it’s the perfect use for any leftover fruit that you may have. Avocado moisturizes effectively due to its healthy fats and vitamins E and C, which hydrate and nourish the skin."
