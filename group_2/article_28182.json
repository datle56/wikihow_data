      "content": "Stack 12 sheets of tissue paper on top of each other. You can choose any color you want. Generally, it looks more realistic if you use the same color for all 12 sheets. Use the normal 13 by 20 in (33 by 51 cm) size of tissue paper for a larger decorative flower. [1] X Research source If you’re making them as decorations for a party, follow your color palette."

      "content": "Fold all 12 sheets together accordion-style. Start with a 1 in (2.5 cm) fold, then follow each fold accordingly by alternating the fold direction. Crease each fold so it will hold its shape. When you’re done, the paper should look like 1 in (2.5 cm) wide stack. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Round the ends with scissors for more realistic petals.",
      "content": "Round the ends with scissors for more realistic petals. Use a sharp pair of scissors to round or point the ends of the stack. This will be a pretty extra touch and make your tissue paper flower look more realistic. [3] X Research source Make sure your scissors are strong and sharp in order to cut through that many layers. If they’re too dull, they’ll mangle the paper and make rough cuts."

      "content": "Cut a 18 in (46 cm) piece of floral wire for the stem. Fold the piece of wire in half and slip it over the center of the tissue paper, then tightly twist it closed. Trim the wire as needed or wrap it in green floral tape. [4] X Research source Floral wire works well and looks nice, but you can also use a pipe cleaner to make a stem. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread out the petals one layer at a time.",
      "content": "Spread out the petals one layer at a time. Separate and spread each petal layer, pulling them toward the center of the flower one at a time. This will fluff the petals out and create a beautiful layered effect to mimic the fullness of a real flower. Leave a little space in the center of the flower. [6] X Research source If you want to display the flower on a wall or flat surface, only separate and fluff the layers on one side. Leave the back completely flat so it can easily rest against a flat surface. If you want to suspend the flower, such as with string from the ceiling, fluff out both sides evenly. Leave some space for the center on both sides."

To suspend the flowers, tie a length of monofilament to the floral wire and hang from the ceiling. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Select one or two colors of tissue paper. If you want a simple, classic look, choose one sheet of in pink, red, or coral. For a two-toned rose, grab an additional sheet in a different shade. Some combinations that really pop are pink and ruby or orange and tangerine."

This will create a petal shape. When you finish, gently unfold the accordion-folded strip and lay it out, petals right side up."

[8] X Research source You can make the petals any size you want, but 1 in (2.5 cm) wide is generally a realistic size."

Hot-glue the center, then add more petals to fill out the flower and hide the loop. Continue doing this for all of the wires until the flower is complete. [11] X Research source You can also double up petals for more fullness. Cover as much of the wire with petals as possible--add extra petals in spots where the wire peeks through. If you made leaves, glue those to the base of the stem."
