      "title": "Use standard English.",
      "content": "Use standard English. Standard English is a form of English accepted as the most universally accepted, based mostly on written English. British and American style English are very similar, but vary substantially in accent, some spellings, and pronunciation. Be aware that there are many regional accents and dialects throughout the world. Avoid nonstandard (i.e., ungrammatical) forms such as “ain’t”, “can’t hardly”, “can’t seem to”, “irregardless”, and “anyways”. See the list below (“Nonstandard and Questionable Usage”) and How to Use Commonly Misused Words. Consult a dictionary for proper usage and a style manual, such as Strunk and White’s Elements of Style . Know what phrases, words, and pronunciations your locality uses that is not Standard English. These might be common ones like \"aint\". Or It can be meanings such as \"ugly\" (New England, U.S.A) meaning either possibly \"unattractive\" or \"angry\" depending on context. Understand if a word is slang or not. Slang words are not accepted as formal Standard English even if often understood informally in conversation. They are often highly localized. Examples include: LOL, dead presidents, DIY, or whopper."

      "content": "Keep proper pronunciation in mind. For most words that can be pronounced more than one way (such as \"either\"), all the different pronunciations are correct. For a few, such as \"mischievous\", one pronunciation is preferred. What the \"correct\" pronunciation is may depend slightly on your region. Words like \"Aluminum\" are pronounced quite differently in British English and American English. While neither is incorrect, you may want to speak in the same manner as the people you converse with."

      "content": "Watch major network TV news, and other programming that uses Standard English. Newscasters in particular are very careful to present language that is grammatically clear and well articulated. Therefore, it is usually recommended to people trying to learn Standard English to watch such news programs. Certain other television shows will present very good Standard English, however television ranges wildly in terms of proper English usage. In general, broad-appeal scripted shows from networks tend to have very good English. Reality shows may have speech that is actually closer to what normal speech really is, but may not help you speak closer to Standard English."

      "content": "Expose yourself to writing to pick up structures, tones, and ideas. Not everything in print is perfect, but the vast majority of printed works, such as books and magazines, have been thoroughly edited. Look at what makes good writing good. As you read more, mistakes and problems will start to \"look\" or \"sound\" wrong to you. Correctness will start to feel natural. If you want to write with a particular style or in a particular genre, read things that are related to that. You will tend to adopt styles and ideas from what you read."
