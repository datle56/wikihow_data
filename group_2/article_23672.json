USPS then sends it to US Customs and Border Protection (Customs or CBP for short), where Customs agents inspect it to ensure it doesn't contain illegal or restricted products and assess it for duties and taxes.

      "content": "Customs typically holds packages for 1-2 business days, per some sources. In some cases, your package may go through Customs in less than 24 hours or several days (or even weeks). The speed with which they process your package may depend on the volume of packages entering their facility during that specific time period or other factors, like unpaid duties and fees."

At this point, Customs has completed their inspection and assessment and approved the package for entry into the country. [3] X Research source They are now in the process of sending the package back to USPS, who will sort it and transport it to a postal facility near your address. After that, you should be able to either pick up your package at your local USPS facility or receive it at your doorstep."

The timeliness of the delivery is influenced by factors such as how far your delivery address is from the USPS Sorting Facility and the volume of packages that USPS is currently processing.

As a result, your package may not get inspected or assessed for several days or even weeks. [6] X Research source For example, if you're expecting an international shipment to arrive around Christmas or New Year's Day, delivery may be delayed because of the millions of other packages that are also moving through the system during that time. If your package has been in Customs longer than 5 business days, contact the carrier responsible for tracking and transporting your item to your address (i.e., USPS, UPS, or FedEx) and ask them to investigate the delay."

If the items are found to be prohibited, Customs will \"seize\" them, meaning you won't be able to receive them and they'll either be sent back to the merchant, auctioned off, or destroyed. You can file a claim if you feel the items were seized without cause or a petition if you were a victim of a crime (i.e., the merchant falsely advertised the product and sent you a prohibited item without your knowledge)."
