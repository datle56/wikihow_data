      "content": "Let it all out. Right now, while you’re in deep pain, it’s important to find some measure of relief or release and process your emotions . Slow down, give yourself some privacy, and let yourself cry, shout, or write about the person you’re mourning. When you get in touch with your feelings in the best way that you can, you’ll give yourself an outlet that’ll help your healing journey. [1] X Research source If you find that you’re in shock and can’t cry, that’s also okay—everyone grieves in different ways.

      "title": "Allow yourself to be vulnerable.",
      "content": "Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Release any idea of what you “should” do, like the idea that you “should” seem happy or peppy in social situations. Also free yourself from the pressure of setting unrealistic standards, like acting “composed” or “strong” when you really feel broken down or drained. Instead, share when you are enduring pain or a struggle so others know your emotional truth—remember, you deserve to be heard. [2] X Research source Your friends and family members won’t need you to act “tough” or put on a “brave face”—instead, they’ll want to know when they should intervene and help you. Let your loved ones know when you’d benefit from a private moment to talk because you’d feel more comfortable in that situation. Ask for someone you trust to be by your side when you go to social events. They can help calm your nerves and take over conversations if you ever become overwhelmed."

[3] X Research source \"Bereavement leave\" is a leave of absence for people facing grief. Consider asking your superior for time off while you grieve. If you're in the middle of a course or class, reach out to your professors or a school counselor to ask for time off.

There’s no need to put a timeline on when you’ll heal from your loss. Just allow yourself to fully experience all your feelings and how much you miss your loved one.

Talk to your friends, family members, or even people in your extended social network—like acquaintances on Facebook—and let them know that you’d value their company and consolation. Remember that your friends love you unconditionally, even when you’re sad or would benefit from some space. Express what would comfort you. For example, say, “I’d love it if I could grab tea with you and share our favorite memories of Mom.” Describe how others can lift a burden from you. You might share, “I’m overwhelmed packing up all of Todd’s clothes. Is anyone free this weekend to help me?” Try not to isolate yourself.

I got back into the swing of things after a couple of months.\" If your timeline for dealing with loss seems different, feel free to politely tell them this.

You may feel like the death of your loved one has made you realize that you need to quit your job, sell your house, or move immediately.

Instead, make sure you talk about your plans with your friends, think about the pros and cons, and wait a few months to see if you're still interested in a shift in circumstances. [11] X Research source Since a dramatic transition can take a lot of mental, physical, and emotional energy, they may leave you more exhausted when you're in the middle of grief.

      "content": "Slowly work on becoming more social again. As you start feeling like you’re moving forward, try to get out of your comfort zone a bit more. Instead of just spending time watching TV with your friend, venture out to a restaurant with a few people, or even go to a small party if you’re feeling up to it. Though you don’t need to force yourself to go out there before you’re ready, prioritize spending time with your loved ones whenever you crave connection. [13] X Research source Remember, you don’t have to fill your social calendar in order to heal. Even if you just accept a small number of invitations, you’re still making great progress.
