[1] X Research source Then, wipe down the entire ski with soapy water and a sponge to remove dirt and dust so your paint and glue adhere to the ski’s surface. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the base of the ski. The base is the flat part of the ski that makes contact with the ground and is where you’ll place the shot glasses. [3] X Research source Exclude the tail and the tip from your measurement—they curve upward and don’t give shot ski users a good grip on the ski. Putting shot glasses on the curved tip or tail of the ski forces the shot ski user to drink at an angle (AKA, you’ll have to clean a puddle of liquor off the floor)."

      "title": "Mark your shot glass placement with a permanent marker.",
      "content": "Mark your shot glass placement with a permanent marker. First, divide the length of the base by the number of shot glasses you want to include on the ski. Then mark where the glasses will go, making sure the distance between glasses is equal. [4] X Research source Leave at least 18 inches (46 cm) between glasses to avoid crowding. Most shot skis have 4 shot glasses on them, but you can include more or less depending on the length of the ski and your personal preference."

      "title": "Use a Forstner bit to drill shallow holes over your markings.",
      "content": "Use a Forstner bit to drill shallow holes over your markings. The bit should be the same size as the diameter of the base of your shot glasses—for most, a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) or 1.375 in (3.49 cm) drillbit works. Drill until you feel that you’ve hit the wooden core of the ski and stop (about 0.175 in (0.44 cm). [5] X Research source Make sure not to drill all the way through the base. Clean out any dust or ski bits left in the hole. Drill safely outside or in a well-ventilated area. Wear goggles and a face mask to keep wood, plastic, or fiberglass particles out of your eyes and lungs."

      "title": "Decorate your shot ski, if preferred.",
      "content": "Decorate your shot ski, if preferred. First, sand the surface of the ski to smooth it down and help the paint stick. Use paint or a paint pen to add any colors or designs you like, or add some fun stickers. Wait for the paint to dry completely before moving on to the next step. [6] X Research source Decorating is easiest after you’ve made the holes but before you insert the shot glasses."

Press a shot glass into the hole and hold it firmly for a few seconds. Repeat with the rest of the shot glasses. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a permanent marker to mark where the shot glasses will go. Divide your base measurement by the number of glasses you’re attaching—this is the amount of space that should go between them so they're equidistant from each other. Make a mark to indicate where each glass should go on the ski. [11] X Research source If possible, leave at least 18 inches (46 cm) between glasses to avoid head bumps while the shot ski is in action. The number of shot glasses you attach is up to you, but most shot skis include 4 glasses. The longer the ski, the more glasses you can comfortably add."

Drill with a Forstner , circular, or paddle drill bit that’s the same size as the diameter of the base of the shot glasses (probably about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm)). Only drill about 0.175 inches (0.44 cm) deep. [12] X Research source Clean out any dust or ski bits left in the hole. Wear goggles and a face mask to protect your eyes and lungs from flying bits of wood, fiberglass, or plastic while you drill. If possible, safely drill the ski outside or in a well-ventilated area indoors."

Trace a circle with the same diameter as the holes on the peel-away back of a sheet of velcro (one for each hole). Then, trace the bases of the shot glasses on the opposite hook-and-loop fastener sheet. Cut out the circles to have a matching hook-and-loop fastener pairing for each shot glass-hole combo. [14] X Research source As an alternative to hook-and-loop fastener, use circular magnets and washers to hold the shot glasses in place on the ski."

Instead of the adhesive on the back of the hook-and-loop fastener, use epoxy or a heavy-duty, clear silicone glue to attach the circles. Cover the entire surface of the hole or shot glass bottom with glue and hold the hook-and-loop fastener firmly in place for a few seconds. [15] X Research source If you’re using magnets instead of hook-and-loop fastener, glue circular magnets into the holes on the ski and metal washers onto the bottom of each shot glass. Ideally, the magnets should sit flush with the surface of the ski."
