      "content": "Detect a woman’s signals. Women are capable of over fifty signals conveyed through body language. While not all of these will be able to be detected, there are a few recognizable quirks you can find. Some of the bigger indicators to look for on a date or in conversation is: She’ll pull up her sleeves and expose her wrist. This is a good signal, and most women are unaware that they do this. This exposes one of the more tender and sensitive parts of the body. She will try to close the distance between you in some way. This can be done in many ways like moving her drink or a menu closer to you. [2] X Research source She’ll find a way to touch you. Some women will do this smoothly. For example, she says “come here” and she’ll show you an app on her phone. Then when you’re near your bodies may touch."

      "content": "Watch for eye contact. Eye contact is the universal body language clue that can communicate so much. Both men and women will use eye contact when they like someone. Try not to hold contact for too long, or else you might ruin the mystique around it. The biggest give away is if they look at you and you both hold eye contact for a moment and suddenly look away. [4] X Research source Pro tip: try to determine whether or not their pupils dilate when they look at you, too. This can indicate interest or attraction! Reader Poll: We asked 2140 wikiHow readers, and 71% agreed that dilating pupils during eye contact is the hardest body language signal to pick up on when you’re figuring out whether or not someone is into you. [Take Poll] So if you’re struggling to read that cue, you’re not alone."
