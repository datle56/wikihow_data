      "content": "Gather your ingredients. To make liposomal vitamin C, you will need some special ingredients and tools. You can find most of the ingredients in a well-stocked grocery store, but you may also order them online. For example, lecithin may be difficult to find in a grocery store. To make liposomal vitamin C, you will need: Distilled water Vodka (40% alcohol) Vitamin C powder or tablets (also sold as ascorbic acid) Powdered lecithin derived from soy or sunflower seeds (make certain the product you buy does not contain GMOs) High power blender Scale that measures in grams or ounces Large glass container, such as a measuring cup or beaker Large mason jar"

      "content": "Measure out nine ounces of distilled water and 12 ounces of vodka. It is necessary to use steam-distilled water for this recipe. Do not use regular tap water. Measure and pour the water and the vodka into the glass container. If you have a measuring cup with measurements on the side, then this is ideal."

    {
      "title": "Add 6 ounces of vitamin C powder to the water.",
      "content": "Add 6 ounces of vitamin C powder to the water. Measure out 6 ounces of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) powder and add it to the vodka and water mixture. Stir the vitamin C into the water and vodka until the vitamin C is completely dissolved. To make sure that the vitamin C powder is fully dissolved, you may also want to heat this mixture in a ceramic pan until it reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). If you are using vitamin C tablets, then you will need to crush them first. You can use a mortar and pestle if you have one or put tablets into a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush them."

    {
      "title": "Blend in the lecithin.",
      "content": "Blend in the lecithin. You will need to weigh out 7 ounces of lecithin and add it to the vitamin C, water, and vodka mixture. You may use soy-derived or sunflower-derived lecithin for this recipe. Then Pour the vitamin C, water, vodka, and lecithin into the blender. Blend the ingredients on high for about four minutes and then put the blender in the refrigerator for a few hours. Then take the blender out and blend the ingredients for four minutes again and then return the mixture to the refrigerator for a few more hours. Continue to blend and refrigerate five or six times over the next 24 hours."

      "content": "Transfer your liposomal vitamin C into a large mason jar. At this point, you have created liposomal vitamin C that you can store and use. It is not necessary to do anything else. Using an ultrasonic unit will increase the number of liposomes that you create, but it is not absolutely necessary since you have already created some liposomes by blending the ingredients."

If you do not already have the materials that you need to improve your liposomal vitamin C, then you will probably have to order some tools online, such as the glass beaker and ultrasonic unit. You will need: One recipe of basic liposomal vitamin C High powered blender 1-liter glass beaker Ultrasonic unit Plastic wrap Wooden spoon"

The beaker that you use will need to be large enough to hold all of the blended ingredients and still fit into your ultrasonic unit. You may want to check before you transfer your liposomal vitamin C."

      "content": "Remove the bubbles with the ultrasonic unit. Pace the beaker with the liposomal vitamin C into the ultrasonic unit for about 30 minutes. The ultrasonic unit will push the bubbles to the surface. After 30 minutes is up, cover the beaker in plastic wrap and place the beaker into the refrigerator for about an hour and then use a wooden spoon to skim off the bubbles that have collected on the surface. Make sure that you follow the manufacturerâ€™s directions for how to use your ultrasonic unit."
