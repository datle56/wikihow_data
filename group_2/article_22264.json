      "title": "Use petroleum jelly to heal and soothe your cracked mouth.",
      "content": "Use petroleum jelly to heal and soothe your cracked mouth. Using a clean, new container of petroleum jelly to avoid germs, rub a small amount on the cracks in the corners of your mouth as often as needed. Petroleum jelly forms a barrier between your skin and saliva, keeping your mouth safe from excess moisture and later, extreme drying. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source There is no hard and fast rule about how much and how often you can and should apply petroleum jelly to your cracked mouth. To start, though, apply a finger-sized dab and use as often as you would use any chapstick. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source While allergies are possible but rare, petroleum jelly is generally safe to use regardless of your underlying cause or condition, making it a great option for anyone dealing with cracks in the corners of their mouth."

      "content": "Rub coconut oil on the cracked area to hydrate your skin. Apply a finger-sized dab of either liquid or solid coconut oil to the cracks on your mouth. Like petroleum jelly, using coconut oil is an inexpensive way to help heal the cracks in the corners of your mouth. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Coconut oil is generally safe to use as often as needed to help heal the cracks in the corners of your mouth. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, try to limit the application of coconut oil to just the cracked skin. Coconut oil may clog pores and cause breakouts."

      "title": "Get a lip balm containing vitamin E and/or shea butter.",
      "content": "Get a lip balm containing vitamin E and/or shea butter. When choosing a lip balm to help heal and soothe the cracks in the corners of your mouth, focus on finding a balm with vitamin E, shea butter, or, preferably, both. Both vitamin E and shea butter are popular lip balm ingredients, and with good reason – these are highly moisturizing ingredients that can also act as healing agents when your lips are cracked. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Like petroleum jelly and coconut oil, shea butter helps form a barrier between saliva and your skin. Vitamin E can help prevent and soothe cracking. It can also help protect your skin from the sun, which can make the cracks in the corners of your mouth worse. Use a lip balm that has 15 SPF or higher to help protect your skin from UV damage."

      "content": "Incorporate foods containing vitamin B into your diet. If you have cracks in the corners of your mouth, incorporating more vitamin B rich foods can help your skin heal and fight any underlying infection. Vitamin B plays a vital role in both helping your body fight infections and keeping your skin healthy, both of which can cause the sides of your mouth to crack. [7] X Research source There are 8 B vitamins, including B-1, B-2, B-3, B-5, B-6, biotin, folic acid, and B-12. The recommended daily intake varies based on the vitamin and your individual needs. Therefore, it is best to vary your diet and incorporate foods that are rich in multiple B vitamins. [8] X Research source A few examples of foods that are rich in various B vitamins are salmon (B-1, B-2, B-3, B-5, B-6, B-12), eggs (B-2, B-5, biotin, folic acid, and B-12), and nutritional yeast (B-1, B-2, B-3, B-5, B-6, folic acid, and B-12).

While only your doctor can fully determine if you have an infection and what type of infection you have, you can start healing the infection and the cracks in the corners of your mouth by eating 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of yogurt daily.
