      "content": "A gym bro is someone who makes going to the gym a big part of their personality. They’re usually male, as the name suggests, and obsessed with things like “gains” or “cutting” or other gym and fitness-related things. When people use the term “gym bro,” they’re often making fun of this specific sort of person who gets weirdly into fitness and is super vocal or obvious about it. [1] X Research source It’s hard to say when or where the term started, but it’s been around for a while, and regained some popularity around 2021-22, when gyms opened back up en masse and people had more encounters with gym bros. Example: “I hate going to the gym in the evening. It’s always full of annoying gym bros.” Example: “That gym bro keeps hogging the pull up bar.”"

      "content": "Use “gym bro” to talk about people who spend a lot of time at the gym. Gym bros come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: a passionate, almost obsessive fixation with fitness. And to achieve that fitness , they’re almost always at the gym. Use the term to describe someone who spends most of their free time pumping iron. Example: “I never see Mike at parties. He’s always working out with his gym bros.” Example: “A lot of the guys at the YMCA are regular gym bros. They’re there even on holidays.”"

They spend all their time in pursuit of the perfect bod. it's a lifestyle, and maybe almost a religion. If you’re gonna get swole, you gotta put in the hours. For gym bros, working out is fun and rewarding, and sometimes the biggest thing they have going for them, so it makes sense. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "They have lots of opinions on the best ways to eat and get fit. Gym bros love to tell you that you’re doing it wrong, and actually the best way to get natty gains is to chug protein shakes, hang upside down from the pull up bar, and eat dog food. [4] X Research source They’re not always licensed fitness trainers, though, so take their advice with a grain of salt. Or a whole shaker. The dog food thing is mostly a joke, but we wouldn’t put it past gym bros to try it. It’s got all that protein, after all…"

Or they hog the leg machine while scrolling for the perfect song to pump their thighs to. Or they give unsolicited advice or comments to other gym-goers. Generally, they’re seen as nuisances around the gym, and could use a little etiquette training. Either that, or they have perfect gym etiquette, and are privy to unspoken laws of the gym you could never even imagine."

They come from the same family as frat bros and jocks, and prefer to work up a sweat over puzzling out questions of philosophy. [5] X Research source The biggest calculations they do is calculating nutritional information and how long it’ll take them to lose their bulk weight. Of course, these are all just stereotypes. There are plenty of diehard gym rats who are perfectly pleasant, intelligent, kind, and every other positive quality that anyone else would have."

People see them as trying too hard, full of themselves, or just plain obnoxious to be around thanks to their obsession with fitness. Generally, you don’t want to be a “gym bro,” if you can help it. Some people even say they’re toxic, given the way some gym bros promote unhealthy and unrealistic body and beauty standards, diets, or routines, as well as a warped sense of masculinity."

These are the guys who come over and respectfully offer tips on your form if you’re doing something dangerously wrong, or cheer you on when you hit a new milestone. These gym bros have a more balanced and nuanced view of fitness, and even if they’re still total fanatics, they’re sensitive to other people’s boundaries. Most people at the gym, gym bros included, are just there to get their workout in and go home. Ultimately, it’s not really worth worrying about what someone else is doing."

Still others are fitness enthusiasts and comedians who make fun of the toxic side of gym culture. If you’re looking to follow any gym influencers, pay attention to their qualifications. A six pack of abs doesn’t automatically mean they’re the best person to take pointers from."

You’ve probably heard this term at places like Planet Fitness, which has a “lunk alarm” that rings whenever someone is trying too hard, and is more annoying than the lunks themselves. Example: “I wish these lunks would at least rack the weights when they’re done with them.” Example: “He has a PhD, but he hasn’t even touched a book in years. He’s gone full lunk.”"
