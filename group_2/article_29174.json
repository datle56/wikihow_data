Cover your hair from the root to halfway down the hair shaft, and then brush your hair along the same length to seal in the product.

      "content": "Place an elastic headband around your head and wrap it around 1 or 2 times. Put the headband around your neck and then push the front up to your hairline. Make sure the sides of the headband go up above your ears. Slowly push the headband back towards the top of your head. When it starts to feel loose, grab one side, twist it and wrap it around your hair like an elastic hair tie. Do this either once or twice. The tighter your headband, the smaller the hair puff. If you wrap your headband around too many times, you will end up with a ponytail instead of a puff. If that happens, just remove the headband, put it back on the front of your hairline and form the puff again, remembering to wrap the headband fewer times. The headband should feel snug, but don’t wrap the band around too tight or it may give you a headache or damage your hair."

Then, start to pull both ends of the tie to form the puff. Secure the style by wrapping the ends of the tie around once or twice and then tying them off. [4] X Research source Tuck any loose ends of the tie in the wrapped part of the tie. The more you pull the tie, the more your puff will shrink. Choose a color that matches your hair color if you want it to blend in, or use a contrasting color to draw attention to the accessory. If you don’t have a hair tie, you can also use a long, thin shoelace."

      "content": "Create a side puff for an easy variation. Instead of pulling your headband or hair tie straight back to put the puff at the center of your head, pull one side of the band to the side. Let your hair fall down like a waterfall down one side of your head. For example, if you want the puff on the right, pull the left side of the band towards the right. It looks best if you keep the puff on top of your head, just a little off-center, rather than pulling it all the way to the side of your head."

Place the part on whichever side you normally part your hair. You can also twist the two sections of hair instead of braiding them."
