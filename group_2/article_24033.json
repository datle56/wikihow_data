      "title": "Place the piece.",
      "content": "Place the piece. Once you've added your glue, put the piece in places and adjust it until it fits snugly. Marking where on the wall the piece needs to line up, in pencil, can help a lot here. Use a wall laser-level if your ceiling is uneven. You can use a box cutter or other appropriate tool to shave a bit off the top of your molding to accommodate dips in the ceiling. [3] X Research source If the piece is long, up high, and you don't have someone to give you a hand, just place a nail in the wall at the line where you know the bottom of the molding will be, roughly 1-2' from the end. You can patch this later."

      "title": "Nail it in place.",
      "content": "Nail it in place. With the molding fit into place, put a nail (add the thickness of the molding plus the drywall and a 1/2\" for the stud to get the nail length) through the molding into the stud closest to the end of the piece. A nail gun will make this much easier. Try to nail the molding in only at the studs or at frames (such as around a window or door), as nailing elsewhere can lead to accidentally hitting a pipe or wiring! [4] X Research source Wait to nail in the last 1.5-2' of a piece until you've fit in the piece that goes next to it. This will help you fit the pieces together more snugly."

[5] X Research source Use wall patching paste or wood putty to fill and mask the holes from the nails. Use caulk around the gaps between the molding and the wall. Caulking is especially important around doors and windows, to help combat moisture issues.

Dry-fit the molding to the wall and mark the back of the molding as close as you can get to the corner. This may be a more helpful measurement than the one you took. Start with whatever measurement is longer, to be safe."

If you are using three pieces of molding to make the turn, you'll usually need to be cutting those at 22.5°. [12] X Research source"

For doors, keep in mind that there are a number of ways to do the corners. You can miter them as discussed above, you can use decorative corner pieces, or you can construct a lintel. All of these options are likely easier than the mitered corners. [14] X Research source Don't forget to accommodate doors. Make sure there will not be any overlap."

It is installed exactly the same as wall molding and can make your floor look much cleaner and professional. [16] X Research source"

Make sure to lay everything out in pencil before you cut your pieces, try to make as many as possible the same size to save time, and make sure you hammer them in at the studs (to avoid hitting wires or pipes). For doing odd angles, such as for stairs, just remember the formula we discussed earlier: take the total angle that needs to be accomplished and divide it by 2 (for the two pieces making the turn).
