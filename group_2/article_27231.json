      "content": "Hydrate the gelatin in water until it's firm. Pour 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of cold water into a heat-proof bowl and sprinkle 2 teaspoons (1/4 ounce or 7 g) of unflavored powdered gelatin over it. Leave the gelatin to hydrate for 5 to 10 minutes. It should start to look thick and gel-like. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Heat the gelatin over simmering water until it melts.",
      "content": "Heat the gelatin over simmering water until it melts. Pour about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water into a pan and turn the burner to medium. When the water begins to simmer, place the bowl with the gelatin in the pan so it sits over the water. Continue to heat the gelatin gently until it melts. [2] X Research source You can stir the gelatin at this point to help dissolve."

      "content": "Stir in glucose, glycerin, and shortening. Add 1/2 cup (170 g) of glucose syrup or corn syrup to the melted gelatin along with 1 tablespoon (18 g) of glycerin and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of shortening or butter. Stir the mixture and heat it until the ingredients melt. [3] X Research source If you don't have glycerin, you can substitute vegetable oil."

      "content": "Stir the mixture into 4 cups (0.5 kg) of the powdered sugar. Put the powdered sugar into a large bowl so you have room to pour in the cooled gelatin mixture. Then, stir it well with a wooden spoon. [5] X Research source The mixture should look sticky and stretchy at this point."

      "content": "Mix in the rest of the powdered sugar as needed. Continue to stir in the remaining 4 cups (0.5 g) of powdered sugar, 1 cup (125 g) at a time. Depending on how firm you want your fondant, you may not need all of the powdered sugar. [6] X Research source You can stop adding the powdered sugar once it becomes difficult to incorporate."

      "title": "Knead the fondant until it's smooth.",
      "content": "Knead the fondant until it's smooth. Sprinkle powdered sugar over your work surface and turn the fondant onto it. Then, coat your hands with some powdered sugar and knead the fondant until it's soft and easy to work with. [7] X Research source If you're in a hot or wet climate, you may need to add more powdered sugar as you work to prevent the fondant from sticking. If the fondant becomes too stiff while you're kneading, mix in a drop of water at a time until it softens."

      "content": "Use the fondant or store it until you're ready to decorate. You can immediately begin rolling out the fondant to decorate a cake or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. To prevent the fondant from drying out, brush it with a little vegetable oil before you wrap it. Then, store it at room temperature out of direct light for up to 1 week. [8] X Research source Avoid refrigerating the fondant because this will introduce moisture which could cause the fondant to become too sticky."

Then, pour in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water and microwave the marshmallows for about 30 seconds or until they melt. [9] X Research source If you don't have a microwave, you can heat the bowl of marshmallows over simmering water."

If you'd like to put the fondant aside, spread a little vegetable oil on the surface of the fondant and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap. Keep the fondant at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. [12] X Research source Put the wrapped fondant in a cool part of your pantry that's out of direct light. You shouldn't refrigerate the fondant because it will introduce moisture that could make the fondant sticky. There are different methods to roll fondant without letting it stick. [13] X Research source You can use powdered sugar or cornstarch as a base instead of flour. [14] X Research source Or you can roll it between parchment papers. [15] X Research source"
