      "content": "Locate a breeder. If you want to adopt a cat from a breeder, make sure to find a reputable breeder. Toygers are extremely rare because they are a designer cat breed. There are only approximately 400 Toygers in the world. This means Toygers can be quite expensive. [9] X Research source Since not all Toygers have the same number of characteristics, the prices vary. Pet Toygers can range from $500 to $2000, while ones that are worthy to be show cats can range from $1500 to $5000. Many pet-worthy Toygers may not have all the physical markers for a show cat, but will have the personality. Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Fanciers Breeder Referral List, and The International Cat Association . If you find a breeder who sells Toygers at a super cheap price, this is a red flag. It may indicate a problem in the Toyger’s breeding. When purchasing a kitten from purebred parents, ask the breeder to show you registration documents or a family tree so that you can get confirmation that the kittens are indeed Toygers."

Go with the company that has the most data about their process in order to get the most accurate results."
