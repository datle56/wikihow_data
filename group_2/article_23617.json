      "content": "Try new things. Novelty stimulates the brain, so being open to new experiences is important to boosting your intelligence. New experiences tend to increase neural activity in the brain, which can help improve intelligence over time. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Be open in your day-to-day life. If a coworker invites you to see a band you've never heard, go. If you have an opportunity to take a trip to a place you've never been, take it. Build a new hobby or skill. Teach yourself to crochet. Enroll in an art class at a local community center. Start a sewing project. Spend time exposing yourself to new information as well. Read an article on a topic that interests you. Go to a museum. Watch a documentary."

      "content": "Challenge yourself constantly. Intelligent people do not settle. When you've mastered a particular skill, challenge yourself further. Keep pushing to the next level, as this will force your brain to work harder. This can expand your intelligence overall. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Brains use a lot of energy during training. While you're attempting to learn something, you are challenging your brain to make connections and learn new things. Once you've mastered a skill, this cognitive growth slows. In order to increase your intelligence, you should keep pushing yourself for a higher level of mastery. For example, say you play a musical instrument. You work hard for a few weeks to learn a new song, and eventually master it. Do not stop here. Challenge yourself by choosing a new, more difficult song. This will put your brain back into training mode, allowing for cognitive growth."

      "content": "Eliminate certain conveniences. While things like GPS and spellcheck are great conveniences, an overreliance on them means you're not pushing yourself to build certain skills. Cutting out GPS for a few weeks can teach you how to find locations by logic and memory. Turning off the spellcheck function on your computer can help you think while you’re writing. Try cutting shortcuts on occasion. There are times, of course, when it makes more sense to use a shortcut. A paper you turn in for a grade in school, for example, should be spell-checked carefully. However, you could stand to go without spell check when chatting online with a friend. Your brain needs exercise to grow. If you want to increase your intelligence, make efforts to challenge your brain during daily activities by eliminating conveniences and shortcuts. Think of this as the mental equivalent of taking the stairs instead of the elevator. For an extra brain boost, turn the spellcheck function back on after you have finished your document and use it to go through your document after you have caught everything you can. Then write down the words you didn’t catch so you can learn how to spell the words you missed. This will help you learn, which will help with giving your intelligence a boost."
