      "content": "Locate the valve on your tires. [1] X Expert Source Howard Fleischmann Automotive Tire & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 4 June 2021. The valve is usually found between the spokes near the middle of your tire. The valve stem should look like a short 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) tube protruding from your tires. It will usually have a black or metal cap on the end of the stem. [2] X Research source The cap on the stem keeps dirt and dust off your valve."

      "content": "Rotate the cap on the valve counterclockwise to remove it. Removing the cap on the valve will reveal the metallic part of the valve. The valve looks like a round hole with a pin in the center of it. [3] X Research source Once you remove the cap, put it safely aside in a plastic bag so you don't lose it."

      "title": "Check the pressure on your tires.",
      "content": "Check the pressure on your tires. Attach a pressure gauge onto the valve on your tires and screw it into place. It should give you a readout for your tire pressure in pounds per square inch, or PSI. Check the owner's manual to see what the recommended pressure should be. [4] X Research source You can purchase a tire pressure gauge at an automotive store or online."

      "title": "Press the tip of a screwdriver on the metal pin.",
      "content": "Press the tip of a screwdriver on the metal pin. There will be a thin metal pin in the center of the valve. You can also use a pair of needle-nose pliers or another small, thin tool. Air will start to shoot out of the valve when you apply pressure to the pin. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Howard Fleischmann Automotive Tire & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 4 June 2021. Lift the screwdriver off of the pin to stop it from deflating."

      "title": "Jack your car",
      "content": "Jack your car up if you're completely deflating your tires. Completely deflating a car or truck tires without jacking up the vehicle can damage your rotors and tires. Find the jack point on the side of the vehicle and use the lever to jack the car up into the air. You can then completely remove the air from the tire safely. Read the owner's manual if you're unsure of how to jack up your particular model of car."

      "content": "Unscrew the metal pin to deflate the vehicle tire faster. Use a pair of thin, 5 inches (13 cm) long needle nose pliers and turn the metal pin inside of the valve counterclockwise. Your tires will lose air in a quicker flow than if you just pressed down on the pin. Use this method if you want to deflate your tires quickly. [7] X Research source Set the metal pin aside in a plastic bag so you don't misplace it. Remember to screw the pin back into the valve once you're done."

      "content": "Fit the end of your tire pump onto your tire. You can usually find the recommended pounds of pressure, or PSI, for your bike tires on the inner part of the tire. Press the end of the tire pump hose onto the end of the valve after you loosen it. Flip the lever on the backside of the tire pump and read the gauge on the pump to see what the pressure level is in your tires. If they are overfilled, you should release some air from them.
