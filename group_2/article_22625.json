[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Before going out, try on different shirts to make sure your top covers your hickey entirely. Shirts with high necklines, like turtlenecks, usually work best. If you don’t have a turtleneck, try wearing a jacket or sweater with a collar that covers your neck. If you don’t normally wear this type of thing, however, your friends may be curious about your sudden change of style. Wear a top that draws attention away from your neck. For example, wear a shirt that has a funny logo, stripes, or an unusual zipper. The busier your top, the less likely people will be to look at your neck. Don’t wear a turtleneck in the middle of summer, as this will be too hot and draw attention to your neck. Depending on where your hickey is, try wearing a tank top with a high collar instead."

Just make sure it stays in place. Avoid wearing jewelry that draws attention to your neck. If you normally wear necklaces or long earrings, opt for cool rings , bracelets, or a watch instead. Depending on your style, another option is to drape a sweater across your shoulders. This is a great option if you love the preppy aesthetic . If you don’t have any accessories that work, stick a bandage over the hickey and make up an excuse . Say you’re covering up a bug bite, a cat scratch, or a burn from a curling iron."

[7] X Research source Bring your makeup with you wherever you go in case it smudges during the day. This way, you can easily slip to the bathroom and reapply it. To make the makeup last as long as possible, apply a translucent powder on top of the concealer to lock it in place. If it looks too powdery, spray some setting spray on top."
