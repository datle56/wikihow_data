      "content": "Choose adhesive hooks for objects up to 8 pounds (3.6 kg). These hooks have adhesive backings that stick to walls, so you don’t have to put a hole in the wall. Weigh the object first so you can pick a hook that will properly support it. [1] X Research source Adhesive hooks come in various sizes and should say how many pounds they will hold. The largest of these hooks hold 8 pounds (3.6 kg) and the smallest are rated for only 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight. For objects that are slightly heavier than your hooks are meant to hold, use 2 hooks."

      "content": "Clean the wall with rubbing alcohol for a better hold. Use a clean rag or paper towel and some rubbing alcohol to scrub the area of any debris. This will ensure that the adhesive will stick firmly to the wall. [2] X Research source If you don’t have rubbing alcohol, you can use warm water mixed with a small amount of dish soap to clean the wall."

      "title": "Determine where on your wall you want to place the hook(s).",
      "content": "Determine where on your wall you want to place the hook(s). Make a small pencil mark where the center of your hook will be. If you are using 2 hooks, measure the width of your object and divide that number into 3. Make your first mark on the wall at the 1/3 position and the second mark at the 2/3 position. For example, if your picture is 9 inches (23 cm) wide, you’d place 1 hook at 3 inches (7.6 cm) in from the edge, and the second at 6 inches (15 cm). Double check that the 2 marks are in line either using a leveler or by measuring down from the ceiling. If the item you’ll be hanging has a wire hanger on the back, be sure to consider the length of the slack. You can test this by pulling the center of the wire tight toward the top of your object. Measure from the bottom of the object to where the wire catches."

If your hook’s adhesive strip is not already on the back of the hook, peel the liner off 1 side of the strip. Line it up to the back off the hook and press down. Some adhesive hooks come with the adhesive already affixed to the back. Skip this step and move on to the next if that’s the case with the adhesive hook you have."

They have large, aggressive threads that hold to the drywall. They act as anchors for a support screw, which is what you will actually hang your pictures from. You will need to buy support screws that are the right size for your anchor. [5] X Research source You can choose between nylon or brass threaded anchors. While the nylon anchors are cheaper, the metal ones hold up better."

If your picture frame or mirror has a wire-hanger in the back, be sure to consider the slack when determining where you want the picture or mirror to hang. If you are using 2 anchors because your item has 2 hooks, make sure to measure the distance between the hooks to determine how far apart your threads should be from one another. If you are using 2 anchors simply to provide more strength, determine their placement by first measuring the width of your object. Divide that number into 3. Place 1 anchor at the 1/3 position and the second anchor at the 2/3 position. For example, if your picture is 9 inches (23 cm) wide, you’d place 1 anchor at 3 inches (7.6 cm) in from the edge, and the second at 6 inches (15 cm)."
