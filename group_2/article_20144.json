    {
      "title": "Find out if she has ever played video games.",
      "content": "Find out if she has ever played video games. She may not be a full-blown gamer, but perhaps she played Mario games when she was younger. Maybe she likes playing an Internet game from time to time. If you know her gaming history, you'll have a better chance of finding a game she'll enjoy now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Present it as quality time.",
      "content": "Present it as quality time. Remind your girlfriend that if you both play video games, you'll be able to spend even more quality time together. However, be aware that it will only count as quality time if she actually does enjoy it, so try not to force an argument about this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Disguise it as exercise.",
      "content": "Disguise it as exercise. If you have a Wii fit, you can make video game playing part of an exercise routine that the both of you can do together. This is one of your best bets to help her find a game she not only enjoys, but will want to play with you as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy her video game items.",
      "content": "Buy her video game items. There are plenty of video game accessories you could buy her that are also stylish. Tetris bracelets or Mario mushroom earrings are both good options for this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a trade.",
      "content": "Make a trade. In the initial stages of trying to get her to play video games, you might have to compromise. Offer to take her out to dinner or watch one of her favorite romantic comedies in exchange."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick out a game",
      "content": "Pick out a game she might like. Odds are she won't like a gruesome first-person shooter game, so use your best judgment on this. Try to choose a game or game system that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short reaction time. Many non-gamers are intimidated by button combinations. If you can, get a game that is multi-player or, optimally, co-op. Consider your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game. Some girls may prefer the brightly colored, all-ages games like Katamari Damacy, Bust A Move, Lego Star Wars, Sims, or just about any Mario game. In general, girls go more for games that involve good characterization and dramatic plotlines. Even a modicum of these factors can make a game a lot more appealing. Persona games are great in terms of good plotlines. Don't get games that involve things like strippers, prostitutes and sex. Unless she has a sense of humor about such things, she probably won't like it."

    {
      "title": "Show her the controls.",
      "content": "Show her the controls. Put your hands over hers and perform basic actions in the game for her to start out. Once her muscles get used to moving with yours, you can move on to having her do it herself. Be patient, she won't pick the controls up straight away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have fun when you play with her.",
      "content": "Have fun when you play with her. If you make it a good time she will enjoy it, even if she's not that into games. Crack jokes, make her laugh and focus primarily on spending time with her, not on winning the game at hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be understanding and supportive.",
      "content": "Be understanding and supportive. When she first starts out, tell her that she will catch on, especially since she's likely to be frustrated at first. Make her feel like this is something that she can do. Let her win. Try not to show any signs of being annoyed. As she keeps playing, she will get better and may enjoy the game itself. Try to find a strong female character that she can look up to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Teach her how to un-cramp her hands.",
      "content": "Teach her how to un-cramp her hands. Her joints and muscles might get tired during her first few sessions. Show her how you usually stretch out your hands, because if she equates video games with sore and stiff hands, she won't want to play any more. You could also give her a hand massage to make her feel better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize that she probably doesn't want to play for eight hours at a time.",
      "content": "Recognize that she probably doesn't want to play for eight hours at a time. When she wants to do something else, don't make her continue to play or make her feel guilty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank her for giving it a chance.",
      "content": "Thank her for giving it a chance. Tell her you had fun and you hope you can play together again sometime."
