      "content": "Place 3 eggs into a small pot on the stovetop. Set a small pot on the stovetop before turning on the heat. Take 3 large eggs and set them at the bottom of the pan. Make sure that there’s enough room for all 3 eggs to rest comfortably, so they all cook evenly later on. [2] X Research source If you want to make a larger batch of egg oil, consider doubling the number of eggs in the recipe."

      "content": "Pour water into the pot until the eggs are covered completely. Add 2 to 3 cups (470 to 710 mL) of cold water to the pot, submerging the eggs completely. Only fill the pot about ⅔-full, as you don’t want any water overflowing once it starts boiling. Once you’ve filled the pot with water, cover it with a lid. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait for the water to reach a rolling boil.",
      "content": "Wait for the water to reach a rolling boil. Turn on or light the stovetop burner beneath the pot of eggs. Keep the lid securely attached to the pot so the heat will be trapped inside, which allows the water to boil more quickly. The water has reached a rolling boil when you can see a lot of steam flowing from the pot. A large number of bubbles should be foaming and rolling throughout the water. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Set a timer for 11 minutes after the water starts boiling.",
      "content": "Set a timer for 11 minutes after the water starts boiling. While softer eggs require less time in the boiling water, you don’t have to worry as much about hard-boiled eggs. Once the timer goes off, turn off the stovetop burner and remove the lid from the pot. Be sure to wait at least 11 minutes so the eggs can cook all the way through. [5] X Research source If you take the eggs out after just 6-7 minutes, you might end up with soft-boiled eggs instead."

      "title": "Place the eggs in cool or icy water for 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the eggs in cool or icy water for 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the eggs out of the hot water before gently placing them in a small bowl of cool or icy water. Let the eggs sit in the water for at least 1 minute before you start removing them. [6] X Research source If the water is cool enough, you can remove the eggs from the pot by hand."

    {
      "title": "Peel away",
      "content": "Peel away the shells from the hard-boiled eggs. Hold the eggs under cool running water to make the shell easier to pick off. Remove the outer shell from the eggs, discarding the pieces into the trash as you go. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t get it off in 1 piece—just do your best to remove it as thoroughly as you can. It’s no big deal if you don’t remove every speck of shell, as you won’t be using the egg white to obtain any oil. [7] X Research source Feel free to compost your egg shells once you’re done with them."

At the heart of the boiled egg, you’ll see the hardened yolk. Use your fingers to pinch and scoop this yolk out. To keep all of the yolks in 1 place, set them aside in a small bowl. [8] X Research source Don’t worry if the hardened yolk peels or chips as you’re removing it—that’s perfectly normal given how soft the yolk is."

Turn on or light the burner beneath the griddle to the highest heat so the yolks can begin to cook and melt.

Continue dividing the pieces until they start resembling scrambled eggs. As you mash up the eggs, try to keep them combined and in the center of the griddle. [10] X Research source You might have to use a spoon to scrape any excess egg off the edge of your spatula as you go."

      "content": "Dump 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of olive oil over the yolks. Don’t worry about the olive oil diluting any potential egg oil—it’s only purpose is to help the egg yolks cook faster. Make sure that the griddle is hot enough for the oil to immediately sizzle after making contact. [11] X Research source"

Every few seconds, flip the eggs over keeping them pushed to the center of the griddle. At this point, the eggs might smell overcooked or on the verge of burning, which is normal for this process. [12] X Research source If you see any excessive smoke, it probably means that a specific patch of egg yolks is burning. Avoid this by flipping the eggs over consistently. Be sure to turn down the heat whenever this happens."

Continue the same process for several more minutes, flipping and centering then egg yolks into the middle of the griddle. Wait for the eggs to start foaming, liquefy, and then turn a dark brown color. At this point, you can turn off the heat. [13] X Research source"

Rub your hands together to spread the oil evenly over your fingertips to allow for a smooth, even application. If you have longer hair, you might need to pour out a little more oil. [17] X Research source While you want to coat your scalp and hair with a thin layer of egg oil, you don’t want to apply a thick layer of product to either of them."
