      "title": "Select your fabric.",
      "content": "Select your fabric. The blanket is made by sewing together two pieces of fabric. You can choose matching fabric for both sides, or you can mix patterns and types of fabric for the bottom and top. Consider how you plan to use your quillow and who it is for. A baseball fan might like a pattern with bats and mitts or the logo of his favorite team; a dog lover might appreciate a pattern of little paw prints. Use your creativity! For a blanket that will cover an adult, you will need 2 pieces of fabric that is 2 yards (1.8 m) long and 60 inches (150 cm) in width, plus an additional 1 ⁄ 2 yard (0.5 m) for the pillow. For a baby blanket, buy two 1 1 ⁄ 2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric. Trim these later to crib size (usually 36 inches b 44 inches) and use the remaining fabric for the pillow. Fleece, flannel, or cotton fabric are good choices to make warm, cozy blankets. You may also find soft, plush fabrics perfect for baby. [1] X Research source If you plan to use your quillow for picnics, consider making one side of the blanket water-proof with either water-proof fabric or a heavy vinyl shower curtain. This will help keep your blanket dry in wet grass and make it easier to clean off dirt and sand. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Select your batting. This is the insulation or padding you layer between your top and bottom pieces of fabric. Look for a high-quality batting that won't separate and isn't too thick, or you may have trouble folding your quilt into the pocket. [3] X Research source Get the same size batting as your fabric (or bigger--you will trim it down). Cotton batting is a popular choice because it is breathable and ages well, plus it's machine washable. If you're looking for cotton batting with a little more \"poof,\" look for one with scrim or a cotton/polyester blend. [4] X Research source Wool batting is durable and is a great choice for a blanket you want to be extra-warm. It is a little more expensive than other batting, and you must be very careful when washing, or it will clump up inside your blanket. [5] X Research source Polyester batting is inexpensive and will retain it's shape, making it ideal for a baby blanket, since it will be washed regularly. It's a little more \"poofy\" than wool or cotton, so don't get one that is too thick. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim your fabric to the desired size. If the dimensions of your fabric aren't already the size you'd like, lay the fabric flat and use a yard stick and rotary cutter to cut through the fabric. Place a self-healing matt under the fabric before you cut. This will make it easier to slice through and won't damage the table or floor underneath. If you aren't sure about the dimensions of the pillow pocket, find the measurement for 1/4 of the length of the main blanket, then add 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) to that number. Then find 1/3 of the width of the main blanket, and add 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) to that number. Remember you will lose roughly between 1/8-1/4 of an inch when you sew the quilt together, depending on the seam."

If you have trouble sewing a straight line, mark the 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) seam with a colored pencil or \"invisible\" marking pen that rinses out with a little water. [7] X Research source You may choose to zig-zag stitch the raw edges as well if you think the blanket will be frequently laundered or get a lot of rough use. Use sharp scissors to trim off the four corners with a diagonal cut. Don't clip your stitches! [8] X Research source Press the edges with a hot iron to lock the stitches and increase the durability of your blanket."

You can skip the final seam and just sew the opening shut with a 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.3 cm) seam, but the blanket won't be quite as durable and the edges may not look quite as clean."

The top of the blanket is one of the shorter sides of the rectangular blanket (the width). If you made a square blanket, the top is whichever side you choose. Measure the blanket on either side of the pillow pocket, making sure it is in the exact center on the edge of the blanket (not the exact middle of the entire blanket). You can sew the pocket on the front or back of the main blanket. It will be concealed if you sew it on the side that is on the ground. If the pillow pocket is on the front of the blanket, you can use it as a storage pocket while the blanket is in use."
