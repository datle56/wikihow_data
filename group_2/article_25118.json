      "content": "Text a friend. Have a conversation with an unemployed friend, or one with a similarly boring job. Turn the volume on your phone off first, and be subtle. Don't stare at your phone endlessly, or your time-wasting will be obvious."

      "content": "Keep your computer activities hidden. Turn your screen away from doors and windows if possible, and mute both the computer and the game. Take some time to make your activities extra-hidden if someone does come in. Hide your Start Bar or Dock. Right-click (or command-click) this and turn Hiding on, so no one can see what you have open. Learn the hotkeys for closing tabs , minimizing them, or switching to another program. To switch programs, try alt Tab on Windows or cmd Tab on a Mac. Don't play games in full screen mode, as these may fail to minimize. If you're extra nervous about getting caught, take a look at these software options for camouflaging your social media sites or anonymizing your internet activity."

      "content": "Entertain yourself online. Visit an online game site like Kongregate, an art gallery like DeviantArt, or search for more specialized sites. It looks like you've found a site called wikiHow… perhaps the front page will have a few interesting links. This one can be dangerous, especially if your computer screen is visible to coworkers or anyone who walks into the room. Some companies even monitor their employees' internet usage. For more \"official\" looking entertainment, measure your typing speed online and try to improve your Words Per Minute ."

      "content": "Read a book. If your job has a lot of downtime, some employers will let you read to pass the time. If you need to be discreet about, bring a small paperback you can stuff into a drawer or coat pocket. Ebooks are another option, and there are many available for free online or in app stores."

      "content": "Invent games with a coworker. If you have a friend in your workplace also trying to kill time, make it more interesting with a silly competition. See who can throw paper into the trash can from furthest away, or who can slip more ridiculous words into conversations without anyone noticing. Here are a few more ideas you can turn into a regular competition throughout the work week: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Attach a binder clip to someone's clothing without her noticing. If you succeed, she has to pass the clip on to someone else. Play \"Photo Assassin:\" randomly assign each person another player as a target. When you take a photograph of your target's face, he loses the game and you take over the target he was assigned. If your workplace has office chairs, compete to see who can complete the workday without touching the office floor."

Start with a beginner origami book or online guide . Stiff, square paper is best, but you can cut your own squares out of regular office paper if you want to make your creations less obvious."

      "content": "Organize your work email. Go through all your unread emails until you've replied to as many as you can. Once that's done, use your mail system's \"folder\" or \"label\" system to organize your mail. You could divide your mail by \"reply by\" date (today, this week, or this month), by project, or by type (announcements, reference documents, and personal). If your email system is based in gmail, you can automatically filter new messages to sort them into the correct categories. If you have a work computer with many documents on it, organizing them can be an endless task – which may be what you're looking for."

      "content": "Make a homemade calendar . You can make a homemade calendar using printer paper, or cardstock paper if it's available at your workplace. This task can take as much time as you need it to, from a quick stapling job to a hole-punched work bound with twine. Once you've cut the pages, use a straight edge to draw six vertical lines, dividing the pages into seven days. Draw four horizontal lines to divide these into five rows, and you'll end up with enough squares to represent a month. Copy an online calendar to label the days, to avoid making mistakes. If you have more downtime, color code each month, and write in holidays and your family's birthdays for a year in advance. If you don't want to cut and construct a calendar yourself, turn an old notebook into a daily planner, with two to three days on each page."
