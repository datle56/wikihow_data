      "title": "Set a goal.",
      "content": "Set a goal. Setting a realistic weight or health goal is a great start to your weight loss plan. It will give you something to track and work towards over the course of a month. Think about how much weight you want to lose, what time frame and other health or wellness goals. Set a goal for how much weight and what target weight you'd like to get to within a month. A healthy rate is generally considered 1 to 2 pounds a week. So what does this mean? Generally, you can lose up to 4 to 8 pounds in a month. Setting a goal to lose more than this amount is generally not realistic. You may also want to set goals about exercise or lifestyle factors. For example, you might set a goal of working out three days a week for 30 minutes. This is a great health-based goal but will also support your weight loss. Remember, dramatic weight loss is risky and often ineffective; the faster you lose weight, the easier you can gain it back. Only real lifestyle changes can give you effective results. “Fad diets”, such as diet pills or liquid cleanses may help you lose water weight, but most work by essentially starving you. Wondering how much weight you can safely and realistically lose in a month? Check out wikiHow’s “Realistically, how much weight can I safely lose in one month?” forum !"

It also can provide information of whether or not your diet and exercise program are effective. Weighing yourself regularly is an easy way to track your progress. Step on the scale one to two times per week and track your weight over time. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You will most likely see the most weight loss in the first week or two during your month time frame. Since weight alone doesn't tell you the full story of your weight loss, you might want to consider taking measurements. This can help you see where you're losing weight. Take measurements around your shoulders, bust, waist, hips, thighs and measure them about once every two weeks. Over the course of a month, you should be able to see some noticeable changes."

You can use it to help you prepare for weight loss, motivate you during weight loss and to help keep you on track to maintaining your weight. Initially, jot down notes about your weight loss or health goals in your journal. Write about how much weight you want to lose and how you're going to track your progress. You may also take notes on what aspects of your diet or lifestyle you think you want to change. For example, you might want to cut out sodas, increase your activity or eat more fruits and vegetables. In addition, you can use your journal to keep a food and exercise diary. Studies have shown that those people who keep track of their food intake and exercise are able to maintain weight loss longer."

One pound of fat is about 3500 calories. To lose a pound of fat per week, you need to eat 3500 calories less than you take in each week.

Subtract 500 calories from a typical day to get a calorie level that will help you lose about one to two pounds per week. Do not go below 1200 calories daily. This may result in nutrient deficiencies, loss of lean muscle mass and slower weight loss long-term.

When you're trying to lose weight and cut calories from your diet during the course of a month, you'll want to focus on eating low calorie, yet nutrient dense foods. These foods will help you meet lower calorie levels while still consuming adequate nutrition daily. Nutrient dense foods are those that are moderately low in calories, but very high in nutrients like protein, fiber, vitamins or minerals. They have high amounts of nutrients for few calories. Lean protein is a great example of a nutrient dense food that will aid in weight loss. It helps keep you satisfied longer throughout the day and when you choose leaner cuts, you'll be choosing lower calorie options. Include a 3 to 4 oz serving of lean protein at each meal and snack.

Try to maintain the same nutritious, weight loss diet while you're exercising. If you must reward yourself or are having a food craving try a lower calorie, more nutritious option. For example, if you're craving something sweet try going for a yogurt and fruit parfait, or a fruit salad. Try to enjoy the endorphin rush that comes after you finish your workout instead of reaching for a snack. For example, you could recline in a chair and focus on how your body feels or take a long relaxing shower. Also, increased exercise may make you feel more hungry throughout the day. Ensure you're eating enough protein throughout the day and are eating regularly. If you need an extra snack, keep it to the 150 calorie maximum."

In addition to strength training and planned aerobic exercise, another way to increase your total calorie burn and weight loss is by moving more throughout your day. Lifestyle activity, or those exercises that are a regular part of your daily routine can help burn additional calories. These are activities that you do daily - walking to and from your car, going up and down the stairs, walking to get the mail or raking the leaves in your yard. Many of these activities do not burn a ton of calories alone. However, when combined by the end of the day, they can make a significant contribution to how many calories you've burned all day long. Increase your daily activities and movement over the course of your month time frame. Try parking farther away, always taking the stairs, going for a short walk break on your lunch hour or doing some light yoga before bed."
