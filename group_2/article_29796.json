      "title": "Select a carrier oil that suits your skin type.",
      "content": "Select a carrier oil that suits your skin type. The carrier oil will be the main substance of the serum, so pick one that’s appropriate for the type of skin you have. Jojoba, grapeseed, and argan oil are good for oily or acne-prone skin. Avocado, rosehip seed, and sweet almond oil are good for dry or sensitive skin. [2] X Research source Apricot and sunflower oil are good carrier oils for normal skin types. You can use two carrier oils if you want to (i.e. if you want the acne-fighting power of grapeseed oil and the moisturizing properties of avocado oil). Just use half of each in your recipe, rather than the full amount of one."

      "title": "Choose one to four essential oils that suit your skin type.",
      "content": "Choose one to four essential oils that suit your skin type. Essential oils are entirely optional and should only be added if you're not sensitive to fragrances in your skincare. If you do decide to use them, you can stick with just one, or add a few drops of three or four different kinds. Regardless of how many you use, pick essential oils that will be good for your skin type. [3] X Research source Choose patchouli, rosemary, or tea tree oil for oily or acne-prone skin. Frankincense, jasmine, and sandalwood oil are good for dry or sensitive skin. Geranium and lavender essential oils are good for all skin types. Test a small amount of each oil on a different part of your skin. If your skin starts to burn, sting, or turn red, you may not not want to use that oil. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before using essential oils."

      "title": "Purchase salicylic acid powder.",
      "content": "Purchase salicylic acid powder. Shop for salicylic acid powder online through retailers that sell cosmetic ingredients. You could also browse large retailers like Amazon to look for a better deal. Buy a small bag or container if you’re just trying the product for the first time and aren’t sure how much you’ll use. Small amounts (under 30 grams (1.1 oz)) will cost around $5, while larger amounts can cost anywhere between $10 and $20. Store extra powder in a sealed plastic bag or container, and place it in a cool, dark, and dry location."

      "title": "Use propylene glycol to dissolve your salicylic acid.",
      "content": "Use propylene glycol to dissolve your salicylic acid. The salicylic acid powder will need to be dissolved before it’s added to your oils, and the best substance to use is propylene glycol. Purchase a bottle of this from a cosmetic ingredient retailer, or check a nearby drugstore to see if they carry it. [4] X Research source You can also use vegetable glycerin as a solvent, but you’ll have to heat it to about 100 °F (38 °C) in a double boiler before adding the salicylic acid. This will ensure that the powder dissolves completely."

      "content": "Find a small glass vial to hold your serum. The vial you choose should be able to hold about 3 fluid ounces (89 mL) and should have a cap that seals. You can select one with a dropper cap or just a regular screw-on cap. Using an amber glass vial will protect your serum from harmful amounts of light. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Add twenty drops of essential oils.",
      "content": "Add twenty drops of essential oils. If you’ve decided to just use one essential oil in your serum, add twenty drops of it to the carrier oil inside the vial. For two different essential oils, add ten of each, or fifteen and five. Divide the drops up depending on how strong you want each scent to be. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a paste of the salicylic acid and propylene glycol. Shake a small amount of the salicylic acid powder into a bowl. Start with about a tablespoon (13 g) of the powder, and then pour in about 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of the propylene glycol. Whisk the two ingredients together until they’re combined in a paste. [8] X Research source Try to achieve the consistency of toothpaste. If it’s too dry, add more propylene glycol. If it’s too runny, add more salicylic acid."

      "content": "Add the paste to the oil at a 2% concentration. Salicylic acid should never exceed a 2% concentration for a leave-on product like a serum. For 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of oil, add 0.04 fluid ounces (1.2 mL) of salicylic acid paste. To add such a small amount, consider getting a measuring cup that measures amounts as small as 1 milliliter (0.034 fl oz), or use an accurate kitchen scale.

      "content": "Test the pH of the serum. An effective BHA serum will be acidic but not too acidic. Buy pH testing strips at a drug store or online. Place one end of the strip in your serum. When the strip changes color, compare it to the color chart that comes with the testing kit to see what the pH is. [10] X Research source A serum that has a pH between 4 and 5.5 may provide a gentle exfoliation to your skin. If the pH is below 3.5, do not use it. This will be too acidic for your skin. You might end up damaging your skin."
