This will let everyone around you know that you plan to make a left turn so they’re prepared to slow down or stop.

If you’re traveling on a road that has 2 lanes in the same direction, turn on your turn signal and move into the left lane so you can safely make your turn. If there’s another vehicle in the lane next to you, slow down a little bit and let them get ahead of you before you change lanes so you don’t cut them off. [2] X Research source Never make a left turn from the right lane of a road with 2 lanes or you could cause an accident."
