Attraction isn’t just one thing—it’s an umbrella term for how you wish to connect with someone (whether that’s romantic, sexual, platonic, or something completely different). [2] X Research source When you’re out and about (or surfing the web), pay attention to who catches your eye. Are you attracted to people of the same gender, opposite gender, or a mix of both? Gay individuals are romantically or sexually attracted to people who are the same gender as them. [3] X Research source Curious about the different types of attraction out there? Here’s a quick breakdown: Romantic attraction: Wanting to be romantic with someone Sexual attraction: Wanting to be sexual with someone Platonic attraction: Wanting to be friends with someone Sensual attraction: Wanting to cuddle and hug someone Aesthetic attraction: Liking how someone physically looks [4] X Research source Do you feel obligated to have a crush on people of the opposite gender (or feel a societal pressure to identify that way)? If so, you might be experiencing compulsory heterosexuality , or a sense of societal obligation to be attracted to someone of the opposite gender.

If you’re more aroused by people who are the same gender as you, you might be gay . If you find more than one/or the same gender as you arousing, you might fall under a different LGBTQ+ label. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that experiences of sexual arousal are extremely nuanced, and aren’t concrete proof that you’re gay. For instance, you can be aroused by gay adult media without necessarily being gay yourself. [7] X Expert Source Marissa Floro, PhD Counseling Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 January 2023."

[9] X Research source Not all crushes are one and the same—some might be rooted in romantic attraction (the desire to date someone), while some might be rooted in sexual attraction (the desire to be sexual with someone). Some people might develop romantic crushes but never actually be sexually attracted to that person—and that’s totally valid!

You may be gay, but you could also be pansexual or bisexual if you sometimes think about the other gender. Think about who you identify with most during romantic or sex scenes in movies or TV.

Tell them, “Have you noticed that I talk a lot about guys? I think I’ve begun to realize that I’m attracted to men and I might be gay.” When you tell your parents, it might help to bring educational resources for parents who have queer children. Say, “I love you, so I want to share something important with you. I’m gay, and I’m proud of it. Since I realized this, I’m feeling really happy and excited about falling in love. I hope you can understand and support me.” Don’t feel like you have to take things slow if you’re ready to come out. If you want people to know your sexual identity, go ahead and tell them. If you're questioning your sexual identity, seek out people you know will be supportive. That might be a friend, a teacher, a leader in your community, or mental health professional. If you live in an area where you don't feel you'd have a lot of support, look for online resources, support groups, and forums that could help you. Coming out is a lifelong journey, not something you do just once. [28] X Expert Source Marissa Floro, PhD Counseling Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 February 2021. Coming out is an individual process. Choosing to ignore the ways that people are pressuring you to come out doesn’t negate your identity in any way.
