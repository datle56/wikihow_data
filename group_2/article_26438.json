      "title": "Coax the zipper back and forth.",
      "content": "Coax the zipper back and forth. Sometimes, even if the zipper is structurally sound, it needs some coaxing to start sliding smoothly. Gently unzip it, then try to zip it back up, repeating as necessary. This will sometimes solve the issue, especially if the zipper just caught on something."

      "title": "Pinch the fabric above or below the zipper.",
      "content": "Pinch the fabric above or below the zipper. If the zipper’s teeth seem like they’re trying to pull away from each other, pinch the fabric below the zipper and gently coax the slider upward. Pinching the fabric above the zipper can also help, as it gathers the teeth together when they’re having a hard time catching. Pinching above the zipper often helps when you’re trying to zip clothes that are a bit too tight."

      "content": "Fix any bent teeth. Over time, a zipper’s teeth can get bent out of alignment, causing many problems for the zipper. Look to see if all of your zipper’s teeth are straight and in line. If they’re not, use a small pair of needle-nose pliers to bend them back into place. Be gentle, as using too much force can pull the teeth off. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a zipper lubricant. Using a specialized lubricant is one of the most straightforward ways to fix a stubborn zipper. [3] X Research source Follow the zipper lubricant’s instructions to apply it correctly, though usually you’ll apply a few drops along both sides of the track and spread it around. Once the lubricant sets in, the zipper should slide easily. Find zipper lubricant online or in most stores that carry zipper repair kits."

      "title": "Rub the zipper with a bar of soap.",
      "content": "Rub the zipper with a bar of soap. The slippery texture of the soap will help the slider move up and down more easily on the zipper. Choose any bar of soap available and rub it on the teeth of the zipper while the zipper is open. Then zip it up and down a few times to get it properly lubricated. [4] X Research source Use petroleum jelly the same way."

Rub a graphite pencil along the inside of the zipper, trying to get into the teeth as much as possible, as well as the back of the zipper. Move the zipper up and down a few times to help get the graphite in place. Then, simply brush off any excess dust. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub the zipper with wax. Almost any wax will do, including wax paper, paraffin wax , candle wax, and even crayon wax. Rub the wax directly onto both sides of the zipper while the zipper is open. [6] X Research source To really loosen the zipper, wipe off any excess from the fabric, then blow over the zipper with a hair dryer. This will melt the wax and allow it to penetrate the teeth better. Once it cools, run the zipper back and forth to test it. If you’re using wax paper, tear off a small sheet and rub it on both sides of the zipper a few times. Run the zipper back and forth to test it, and if it doesn't work, try it again. Make sure it’s wax paper, not parchment paper."

      "title": "Apply lip balm to the zipper.",
      "content": "Apply lip balm to the zipper. Most lip balms contain wax, so they’re also a great lubricant for zippers. Find a lip balm you don’t plan on using anymore and rub a bit on the zipper’s track. Move the zipper back and forth to really get the lip balm in the track and make the zipper easier to move. [7] X Research source If you plan on using the lip balm again, don’t rub it directly onto the zipper. Apply it with your finger, a clean cloth, or another method. This will help prevent any dirt or germs on the zipper from coming in contact with your lips."

      "content": "Try a bit of olive oil. Oil is a great lubricant, and the natural composition of olive oil won’t damage your zipper. Use a cotton swab to dab a few drops above and below the zipper and work it up and down until it glides smoothly. Wipe up the oil with a cloth or paper towel when you’re finished. [8] X Research source Olive oil can discolor some fabrics, so test it in an inconspicuous area first."

      "content": "Try a household powder. Powders can also act as lubricants for zippers. [9] X Research source Choose a common household powder, like talcum powder, baby powder, or even cornstarch. Sprinkle a bit of the powder on the zipper, then move it up and down to lubricate it. Dust off any excess. You may need to wash your clothes or the zippered item after using this method, as powder can be messy."

If rust is present, apply a household anti-rust lubricant, like WD-40 , according to its instructions. Just be careful not to get it on the fabric of the garment. This problem usually happens more often with cold-weather outdoor garments."

Gently scrub the zipper and its track to remove any debris that may be causing the zipper to stick. Then, rinse and dry the item and see if your zipper is less sluggish. [12] X Research source Dish detergent is gentle enough for most fabrics, but test it in an inconspicuous place first to make sure it won’t affect the color of the garment."

      "content": "Use a seam ripper to remove the old zipper. Turn the item inside out so you can see the back of the zipper and the stitching holding it in place. Use a seam ripper to remove the stitches until the zipper is separated from the fabric on both sides. Be sure to measure the old zipper so you know what size to get for the new one. Replacing the zipper may be the best option if you can’t loosen it on your own, if it’s missing several teeth, or if fixing it yourself seems like more trouble than it’s worth."

      "content": "Sew on the new zipper. Line your new zipper up where the old one used to be and pin it in place. If possible, install a zipper foot onto your sewing machine, then sew the zipper into place with a straight stitch. If you don’t want to use another zipper, consider sewing on some hook-and-loop fastener or buttons instead. If you don’t have sewing experience, consider taking the item to a professional tailor. This will be easier than replacing it yourself and it doesn’t cost too much."

      "content": "Fixing zipper teeth that keep popping open Zipper teeth may get out of alignment and create gaps when a zipper slider is loose. Examine the slider to see if it’s misshapen, then use needle-nose pliers to gently crimp the slider until it’s back to its original size. Test each side of the slider with your fingers and make adjustments as needed until both sides are even. [13] X Research source A zipper slider is the mechanism under the pull that brings the two sets of teeth together. Professional tailor Shaelynn Haning says, “Over time, the slider loosens…. So what I will go in and do is use pliers on that bottom edge of the zipper slider and kind of crimp it gently on either side and tighten that area that the teeth are sliding out of on the bottom. That way, there's more resistance and the teeth are coming back together tightly the way that they would have originally.”"

      "title": "Replacing a zipper slider",
      "content": "Replacing a zipper slider Buy a new slider that has the same number that’s stamped onto the original one. Use pliers to remove the top stop (the metal part at the top of the zipper that keeps the slider on the tracks), then move the slider up and off the zipper. Feed the new slider onto the teeth, starting where you removed the top stop. Then, use pliers to replace the top stop with the new one that came with your new slider. If your slider doesn’t have a number stamped on it, take it with you when shopping for a new one so you can measure them. If your slider is stuck in the “locked” position, stick something small like a paper clip under the pull tab loop and pop the lock open. Haning says, “You can purchase sliders in any type of size. So say you've pulled yours off but the teeth still look good, you can actually buy a new slider to slide it right back on.”"

Alternatively, weave a rubber band through the opening in the zipper tab and hook the two loops of the rubber band around your pants button. [15] X Research source Another option is to spray hairspray along the last inch of the zipper teeth. As the hairspray builds up, it should stop it from unzipping itself . However, you’ll likely need to unstick the zipper later on."
