[2] X Research source Make a list of your best traits, your hobbies and interests, and the positive things you’ve done over the past few years, such as volunteering or helping out your grandparents.

Not only will you look confident, but your crush will have to notice you since you’ll be fluttering around like a social butterfly. Say “hi” to everyone. Speak to everyone before the end of the event. Set time limits for how long you will spend in one spot or talking to the same people. For example, after 15 minutes you could make an excuse to walk away. Say, “I’ll catch you guys in a minute. I’ve got to refill my drink.”"

While you don’t want to go overboard, doing a little bit of flirting with body language will be enough to make your crush green with envy. It will work best if you aim your flirty vibes at a group rather than a specific individual because that way no one will think you’re coming onto them. Smile or pucker your lips. Get closer to the other person. Playfully touch their arm. Keep your arms down to your side or gesturing; don’t cross them or fidget."

When they ask questions, only provide half answers so that they have to keep the conversation going to find out what they want to know. By providing a little mystery, you make yourself appealing to just about anyone. For example, hint at your favorite hobby by saying, “The last time I ate tacos was at the cast party for Romeo and Juliet.” When your crush asks if you were in the play, you could half answer and say, “Being part of the show was amazing. I hope I get to do My Fair Lady someday.” This will keep them wondering if you were the star of the show and will make you seem more exciting."

Don’t explain your big plans to your crush. Instead, casually refer to it while you’re within earshot of your crush. You could say, “I’m so tired of taking classes that I don’t need. That’s why I’m going to art school in a few years,” or “You better enjoy my macarons for free while you can because pretty soon they’ll be lining up in the streets of New Orleans for a taste of them.”"

For example, if your crush mentions a party that your group will go to on Friday night, say, “Oh, Saturday I already have tickets to a concert!” Then when they correct you, say, “That’s awesome! I can probably make Friday happen. Thanks for reminding me.” Suggest alternate plans. For example, if your crush asks you to get frozen yogurt on Tuesday, ask them if you can do it on Thursday instead because of a conflict. This will keep them guessing about what you’re doing."
