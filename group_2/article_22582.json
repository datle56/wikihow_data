      "content": "Excuse yourself from what you are doing. This may be hard in a large group of people, so try to get up without attracting attention. Try quickly walking away while the people around you are distracted. Watch where you are going so you don't bump into someone by accident. Remain calm . If you seem nervous, people are more likely to notice. If you don't know the people around you, try to walk slowly so you don't attract attention. If you do know the people, try to make a hasty retreat to the bathroom. Don't slouch or cover the spot. If you do, you will likely attract attention and receive questions. Remember that it’s unlikely others have noticed your accident. You are far more aware of it than anyone around you. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover your pants with a jacket or sweater. This can be an easy way to cover the wet spot on your pants so you can get to the bathroom. It's best to tie it from the back because that's how normal people tie it. If you have a shirt that is long enough, pull it down so it can cover your front area. Wrap the jacket around your waist. Remain calm so you don't look suspicious. Act like nothing is wrong. Calmly get to a bathroom or get home to address the urine as soon as you can."

      "content": "Or, spill your drink on your lap. This generally only works if you are at a restaurant or if you have a drink in your hand, but this can be a good cover if you don't have a jacket to cover your pants. This will give an excuse to why your pants are wet before you can excuse yourself to the restroom. Make a joke that you are clumsy and laugh it off like spilling the drink was an accident. Excuse yourself to the restroom to clean up. If no one saw you urinate, you might even just say that your urine spot is a spilled drink and avoid pouring more liquid onto your clothes.
