Purchase a packet of bean seeds if you want instructions for how to grow them in the ground after they sprout, or use any type of whole, dry beans if you just want to experiment. [1] X Research source To keep the plant compact, opt for a bush bean plant. This will not require a trellis or pole to support it and it will only grow to about 2 ft (0.61 m). If you opt for pole beans, then the vine may grow to 15 ft (4.6 m), so it will need plenty of room to climb. [2] X Research source"

Then, let the beans soak in the water at room temperature overnight. This will help to soften up the outer shells of the beans and make it easier for the plants to sprout. [3] X Research source Don’t use hot water as this could partially cook the beans. Use cool or lukewarm tap water."

Make 2 to 3 indentations per cup that are 1 in (2.5 cm) apart from each other. Place the beans just on top of the indentations in the cotton. Don’t push them down into the cotton or burrow them inside of a cotton ball. [11] X Research source Don’t try to sprout more than 3 beans per cup as they will not have enough room to grow."

The beans will need to get 30 minutes of bright sunlight each day and then you can transfer them to a well-lit spot that is not in direct sunlight for the rest of the day. This is important since too much sunlight can stop the seeds from sprouting. [13] X Research source Do not place the beans in a dark place, such as a cupboard."

The amount of time it takes for the beans to be ready will depend on the type of beans you are growing, so check your seed packet if you’re unsure. For example, green beans are ready when they are about the size of a pencil. Be careful not to let the beans get any bigger than this as they will become tough and stringy. [22] X Research source"
