      "content": "Be patient and monitor your temperature. If an infection is the cause of your fever, it should disappear within 3 to 4 days. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should take your temperature with a digital thermometer twice a day to make sure your fever doesn't get dangerously high. For infants and toddlers, it's best to take rectal readings. Fevers that last longer than 4 days or rise above 103°F or (39.4°C) are reason for concern in adults, while fevers that last longer than 5 days or rise above 104°F or (40°C) are concerning in children. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that body temperature is usually lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Menstruation, feeling strong emotions, and being in a hot or humid environment can also raise your core body temperature temporarily. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source In addition to sweating, other symptoms associated with fevers include: body aches, fatigue, shivering, headache, loss of appetite and flushed complexion. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Visit the ER if you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms: confusion, irritability, convulsions, seizures, difficulty breathing, pain or tenderness in your belly, nausea or vomiting, severe headache, or stiff neck. While waiting out a mild-to-moderate fever, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Fevers trigger sweating, which can quickly lead to dehydration. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove excess clothing or blankets.",
      "content": "Remove excess clothing or blankets. A simple method of lowering a fever is to remove excess clothing and blankets. [8] X Research source Clothes and blankets insulate our bodies and prevent heat from escaping from our skin. So, wear one layer of lightweight clothing, and use one lightweight blanket for sleep when trying to combat a high fever. Avoid clothes and blankets made from synthetic fabrics or wool. Stick with cotton fabrics instead because they breathe better. Remember that your head and feet are capable of losing a lot of heat, so try not to cover your head with a hat or your feet with thick socks while fighting a high fever. Don't bundle up someone who develops the chills from a fever because they can overheat quickly."

      "title": "Take a lukewarm bath or shower.",
      "content": "Take a lukewarm bath or shower. If you (or your child) develops a high fever, lower your body temperature by taking a lukewarm bath or shower. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's important not to use cold water, ice, or rubbing alcohol because it can lower your body temperature too quickly. If you’re giving a child a sponge bath, sponge for 20 to 30 minutes, and stop if they start to shiver. [10] X Research source Taking a bath may be easier than a shower if you are tired, weak, and achy. Alternatively, grab a clean cloth or sponge, soak it in cool water, wring it out, and apply it to the forehead or the back of the neck. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Another good idea is applying a cold pack under your arm for 10 minutes at a time. Do not use it on babies or young children, however, since they can’t always tell if it’s too cold for their skin."

      "title": "Keep well hydrated.",
      "content": "Keep well hydrated. Staying hydrated is always important, but it’s even more important when you have a fever because you lose more water via perspiration. Aim to increase your fluid intake by drinking water, juices, or broth. Men should drink 15 cups of water and women should drink 11 cups of water per day. [12] X Research source Drink cool beverages with ice to try and bring a fever down. Oral rehydration solutions, like Pedialyte, are a good idea because they contain sodium (an electrolyte), which is lost during sweating. [13] X Research source Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, which can make you more dehydrated.

      "title": "Sit or lay near a fan.",
      "content": "Sit or lay near a fan. The more air that circulates around your body and over your sweaty skin, the more effective the evaporative cooling process is. That's why we sweat in the first place, so that our skin and surface blood vessels cool down as the ambient air evaporates the moisture. Being near a fan simply speeds this process up. Therefore, using a fan can make you feel more comfortable and help with accompanying symptoms of a fever. [15] X Research source Don't be so close to a fan or have it turned up so high that it causes chills, as shivering and the resulting goose bumps acts to increase the core body temperature. Air conditioning may be the best idea for a hot and humid room, but a mechanical fan is usually a better choice because it’s less likely to make the room too cold after a while."

      "content": "See your doctor if the fever lasts 4+ days or rises above 103°F. Oftentimes, a fever is a good sign that your body is fighting an illness or infection. [16] X Research source It shouldn't always be reduced or suppressed to prevent serious complications, such as a febrile seizure, coma, or brain damage. Make an appointment with your doctor if your fever doesn't go away after 4 days or rises above 103°F or (39.4°C). [17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor will have all the necessary instruments to take a temperature reading in the most appropriate area—either orally, rectally, under the armpit, or in the ear canal. [18] X Research source Take your child to the doctor if their fever is higher than 104°F or (40°C), or they are: listless, irritable, vomiting, makes poor eye contact, appears very sleepy most of the time and/or has completely lost their appetite. [19] X Research source Since children are smaller and growing, they can become seriously dehydrated if their fever continues more than a few days. Adults should see their doctor if they develop a high fever or any of the following symptoms: severe headache, throat swelling, bad skin rash, light sensitivity, stiff neck, confusion, irritability, chest pain, abdominal pain, constant vomiting, numbness and tingling in limbs and/or seizures. If the high fever is caused by a bacterial infection, your doctor may recommend antibiotics to control or eliminate the infection."

      "content": "Consider taking acetaminophen (Tylenol). Acetaminophen is not only a painkiller (analgesic), but also a strong antipyretic, which means it can trigger the hypothalamus in the brain to lower body temperature. [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In other words, it works by turning down your brain's thermostat. Acetaminophen is safe for lowering a fever in young children, teenagers, and adults—as long as you follow the dosage recommendations on the box. [21] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can take 2 regular-strength Tylenol tablets every 4 to 6 hours. For adults, the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen is 3,000 mg. [22] X Research source Taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too long can be toxic and damaging to the liver. Pay attention to the ingredients in other medications as well. For example, cold medicine can include acetaminophen. Alcohol should never be combined with acetaminophen."

[23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The main issue is that it's typically not recommended for children younger than 2 years (especially infants younger than 6 months) because of potential side effects.
