      "content": "Look for a plant with bright green leaves. If the leaves or stems are yellow or brown, this means that the plant is unhealthy. [1] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source The plant has likely been shipped from China or Taiwan, so it's been through quite a trek. Professional growers take the stalks and braid and curl them into intricate designs. Larger, more intricate designs result in some lucky bamboo plants costing hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A plant kept in a pot can grow up to 3 feet (0.9 m) high. If it's grown in soil outside, it may reach a height of up to 5 feet (1.5 m). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide if you want to grow it hydroponically or with soil.",
      "content": "Decide if you want to grow it hydroponically or with soil. It's probably easiest and a little cleaner to grow in water and stones, though it can also grow in soil. We cover how best to grow bamboo later. Ultimately, it's up to you and will likely be determined by the pot or vase you have available. [3] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source If you do go the stone route, the container should have enough stones or marbles in the bottom to stabilize it. The lucky bamboo will need at least 1 to 3 inches (3-8 cm) of water to thrive. If you want to grow it in soil, well-drained, rich potting soil is best. It needs to stay moist but not soaking at all times. Use organic fertilizer when needed; salts and high phosphorus concentrations in synthetic fertilizers can cause deterioration. Also, you can be sure your soil drains well by simply adding some small rocks to the bottom of the pot."

      "title": "Use the right container.",
      "content": "Use the right container. Put the lucky bamboo in a tall glass vase or ceramic container – no shallow bowls – or leave it in the container it comes in. A clear container is great if you just want to grow the plant hydroponically with some decorative stones; use a regular terra cotta pot if you want to grow it in soil. Keep in mind that the plant needs to be stabilized at its peak height. Your container should be at least 1 foot (30 cm) in height. Using soil? Fill the pot up most of the way with your rich soil and make sure it can drain well."

      "title": "Choose the right spot.",
      "content": "Choose the right spot. Lucky bamboo do best in bright, filtered sunlight – think of the light that creeps through the top of a forest canopy. Direct sunlight will scorch the leaves. And as for temperature, keep it away from the air conditioning or vent. This plant prefers an air temperature between 65ºF and 90ºF. If you want to control the curl of your plant, use a three-sided box (a box with a side cut out). The plant will then bend toward the light. As it curves, change the side the sunlight faces, and the plant will curve back. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the lucky bamboo in a warm spot where it will get indirect light.",
      "content": "Place the lucky bamboo in a warm spot where it will get indirect light. Keep an eye on how much light the plant gets – if anything, too little light is better than too much. While you're gone, turn the air off, too. It'll be nicer for the plant if it's a little warmer. As the seasons change, you may want to move the plant. Take it away from any windows if you're unsure. It'll still get plenty of light in the center of a room."

      "title": "Change the water every week if you're growing it hydroponically.",
      "content": "Change the water every week if you're growing it hydroponically. And as for what water to use, this plant is very sensitive to chemicals like fluoride and chlorine – only use tap water if it's been sitting out for 24 hours (so the chemicals can evaporate. Otherwise, bottled water is best. [5] X Research source Once the plant has grown roots, the roots must be kept covered with water. Again, 1-3 inches is all it takes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Water the plant carefully.",
      "content": "Water the plant carefully. If you're growing your plant in soil, water it just enough so the soil is moist but not soggy. Keep it this way every day. The plant can get dry-rot if the soil is too wet; we cover troubleshooting tips below. You can also spray the leaves with water to keep it moist and humid. Again, use filtered or bottled water to avoid chemical damage. [6] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Encourage more roots by increasing the amount of water in which the plant is growing. More roots mean lusher top foliage; the higher the water is up the stalk, the higher up the roots will grow."

    {
      "title": "Fertilizer your plant every month or so.",
      "content": "Fertilizer your plant every month or so. If you're using soil, use organic fertilizer every month or so so the plant gets enough nutrients (again, go organic as synthetic can cause deterioration). If you're growing it hydroponically, use liquid fertilizer in the water. However, keep in mind that lucky bamboo does not need much fertilizer, so make sure that you dilute the fertilizer to one tenth of its strength. [7] X Research source Add it at the same time as you add the rest of the water; it's best to add fertilizer when the water is clean."

      "title": "Prevent tip burn by using filtered or bottled water.",
      "content": "Prevent tip burn by using filtered or bottled water. Tip burn is when the leaves start to become dry and dead. This often happens when there are chemicals in the water. Setting your tap water out may not be enough – you may need to switch to bottled water to get your plant to look healthy. [8] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Once it gets tip burn, it may be hard to get rid of. Even if you do switch water, some chemicals may reside in the plant. You may just have to wait it out as it should go away eventually."

      "title": "Trim the plant.",
      "content": "Trim the plant. Over time, most of these plants become top heavy. Because of this, trimming is very important for it to stay healthy. Don't cut off the main stalk – just the offshoots. Use sterile snippers to do so. [9] X Research source Trim them off within an inch or two (2.5 - 5 cm) of the base. New shoots will emerge and the plant will be bushier and healthier."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to the color of the leaves.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the color of the leaves. If they're dry and dying, that's a water problem as discussed above. If they're yellowing, that's often a result of too much sunlight or too much fertilizer. If they're brown, try making the area more humid by spraying the plant with water. As for mushy leaves, this plant could be beyond saving. Remove them immediately, change the water, and replant what you have left."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the plant if you must.",
      "content": "Cut the plant if you must. If part of the plant is dying, you may have to cut it off. For example, if you notice that the base of the plant is turning yellow, then this is root rot and the plant will die. You can cut the top of the plant off and replant it, but there is a chance it may not grow. You may also consider cutting the plant if you don't like the shape the plant is taking on. Whatever you do, don't throw away the trimmings – they can be made into a new plant. New shoots will emerge from the bottom, older piece of the plant, and the top section can be potted to grow on its own. If you have a dying plant, get rid of the decaying parts immediately. Take any alive stems or branches and immediately repot them. They may flourish on their own if you take swift action."
