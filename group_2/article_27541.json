      "title": "Pour neem oil, vodka, and distilled water into a bottle.",
      "content": "Pour neem oil, vodka, and distilled water into a bottle. Set a small funnel on a 3 fl oz (89 ml) spray bottle and pour in 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of neem oil. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vodka or denatured alcohol and 4 tablespoons (59 ml) of distilled water. [1] X Research source It's important to use distilled water instead of tap water to prevent the spray from spoiling. If you don't like the strong scent of neem oil, you can leave it out. However, if you're specifically trying to repel mosquitos, consider adding it."

      "content": "Add lemongrass, lavender, tea tree, citronella, and geranium essential oils. Citronella and tea tree essential oils may have strong scents, but they're great at keeping insects away. Pair them with lemongrass, lavender, and geranium essential oils, which smell wonderful and can repel flies, mosquitos, and fleas. Put these oils into your bottle: [2] X Research source 20 drops of lavender essential oil 20 drops of tea tree essential oil 20 drops of citronella essential oil 15 drops of lemongrass essential oil 5 drops of geranium essential oil"

      "content": "Screw the lid on the bottle and shake the spray for 10 seconds. Put the lid on the bottle and screw it on tightly so the bottle is completely sealed.

      "title": "Spray the lemongrass mixture on your skin before going outside.",
      "content": "Spray the lemongrass mixture on your skin before going outside. If you know you'll be going outside in insect or mosquito-infested areas, spritz your skin thoroughly. You might need to reapply the repellent if you'll be outside all day. [4] X Research source Store the repellent at room temperature for up to 3 years. Although you could keep using the spray, the oils will become less effective the longer they're stored."

Set a small funnel on your bottle and slowly pour in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of witch hazel along with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of distilled water.
