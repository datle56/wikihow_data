      "content": "Understand the limitations. When attempting to get two Sims to form a relationship, they cannot be related, nor can they be opposed to each other's traits. While it's technically possible to get two opposite Sims to date, doing so is difficult. Your Sims' genders don't factor into their dating choices."

You will see literal green \"+\" signs appear above both your Sim's head and the other Sim's head while they talk; if you see a large majority of these, your Sims are compatible. [1] X Research source You'll most likely see a few red \"-\" signs as well. As long as you see significantly more green positives than red negatives, you're set to proceed. If you see an influx of red \"-\" signs, you'll have to find a different Sim with whom to pair your Sim."

The easiest, lowest-risk way to do this is by conversing with the other Sim by selecting Friendly as a conversation option and then selecting dialog options such as Ask About Day or Compliment Outfit . You want the \"Friendship\" meter to be at least 50 percent full; any lower than that, your romantic attempts will fail. Avoid flirty (pink) dialog options when building a friendship."

Building romance works in the same way as building friendship: select the Romance conversation option, then select light options such as Flirt or Compliment Appearance . Avoid physical actions until the \"Romance\" bar has grown a few times. Ideally, you'll wait to use physical options until the bar reaches the 30 percent mark. If the other Sim reacts unfavorably to something you do, select the Apologize conversation option before proceeding, then go back to light flirting or complimenting."
