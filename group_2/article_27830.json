      "content": "These botanical blends are all-natural, unlike most store-bought perfumes and colognes, which are made of synthetic ingredients. To make 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) (1 cup) of perfume mist, you will need: 10 tablespoons of alcohol; ½ tablespoon of essential oil(s); 4 tablespoons of distilled water; ½ tablespoon of vegetable glycerin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend the alcohol and essential oil together.",
      "content": "Blend the alcohol and essential oil together. Using a clean container and spoon, slowly stir the alcohol and essential oil(s) of your choice together. Gently swirl the ingredients around about 20 times with your spoon until they are evenly mixed together. Both rubbing alcohol and vodka are acceptable choices for this recipe. However, rubbing alcohol will have a strong alcohol scent that many people dislike, whereas vodka is much more neutral. If you’d prefer not to use any form of alcohol (which some people find too harsh or drying), you can substitute with witch hazel instead. [1] X Research source The essential oils used are a completely personal choice. You can use one that you particularly love by itself, or use several to create different scents and customized blends."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a separate container to mix the glycerin and water.",
      "content": "Use a separate container to mix the glycerin and water. Using clean instruments, mix these two ingredients together. You don’t need to whisk them vigorously – about 15-20 swirls around with your spoon will get the job done. The vegetable glycerin can even be omitted if you wish. However, since it acts as a binding agent for the ingredients, it is recommended that you use it if at all possible. Glycerin also moisturizes and allows the perfume mist to last much longer on your skin. If you do omit it, you will still end up with a great smelling end product, but the scent will fade fairly quickly. You can also substitute vegetable oil, jojoba oil or even olive oil for the glycerin. These oils act as binders and carriers, just as glycerin does. Distilled water is the most recommended choice, but filtered and mineral water will also work. For an even longer lasting scent, substitute rose water or orange flower water for the distilled water. These substances will enhance the scent and nourish your skin."

      "title": "Combine the two mixtures together.",
      "content": "Combine the two mixtures together. Bring the two separate mixes together by either combining them using an entirely new container, or you can pour the contents of one into the other. Stir the ingredients together slowly for about 60 seconds until they are mixed together well."

    {
      "title": "Pour the blend into an 8 ounce spray bottle.",
      "content": "Pour the blend into an 8 ounce spray bottle. Use a funnel if this makes it easier for you to transmit the fluid into a glass or plastic spray bottle. The spray bottle you choose can be new or used, that’s up to you. If you are re-purposing a used bottle, sterilize it first so that you have a completely clean vessel for your blend. Dark containers are the best choice, since even minimal exposure to light can diminish your scent. Plastic bottles hold diluted essential oils, such as your perfume mist, very well. However, never store undiluted essential oils in plastic containers, since the potent oils can damage and deteriorate plastic."

      "content": "Store the mist in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks. During this interval the blend’s ingredients will meld and it will allow the scent to fully develop. Take the bottle out every day and shake it a few times to encourage the recipe to blend. After the two weeks pass, your perfume mist is ready to use!"

    {
      "title": "Keep your mist in a cool and dark environment.",
      "content": "Keep your mist in a cool and dark environment. To preserve the integrity and shelf life of your perfume mist, keep it away from extreme temperatures. Don’t store it in your bathroom, since the heat and humidity will break down its molecular structure. Don’t store it near a window or expose it to sunlight, which will degrade the blend. Hot, humid atmospheres like bathrooms can also encourage bacteria to grow inside your bottle, which is a potential health risk. Make sure your bottle is airtight and keep the cap on it at all times when it’s not in use. The alcohol in your mist will evaporate quickly when exposed to air and your mixture will dry up more quickly."

There are many different formulas and variations you can use to make this hair perfume mist, but all of them feature three basic ingredients – pure vanilla extract, essential oil(s) and rosewater. [2] X Research source Most commercially made products are made with artificial fragrances and harmful chemicals, but this botanical recipe is all-natural, smells great and provides health benefits. To make 4 fluid ounces (120 ml) (1/2 cup) of this hair perfume mist, you will need: 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract; 20-25 drops of essential oil(s); 4 ounces of rosewater; One 4 oz spray bottle (glass or plastic)."

[6] X Research source The major scent groups are floral, woodsy, earthy, citrusy, oriental and spicy. Oils that are in the same scent group usually blend very well together. The most popular and easy to find essential oils for each scent group are: Floral scent group: lavender, rose, neroli and jasmine. Woodsy scent group: pine and cedarwood. Earthy scent group: oakmoss, vetiver and patchouli. Citrusy scent group: orange, lemon and grapefruit. Spicy scent group: clove and cinnamon. Oriental scent group: ginger and patchouli."

For example, you could modify the above formula to be a lavender-heavy scent that only includes 2 oils from the scent group – lavender and neroli. Adjust the lavender amount to be 70 drops. Adjust the neroli amount to be 40 drops. This amounts to 110 drops total, which is what the recipe calls for. Follow the rest of the formula and you’ll have an altogether new floral scent."

Once you get the hang of it, experiment with the proportions, just like you did with the floral group. To get you started, try this recipe to create a woodsy perfume mist: 50 drops oakmoss essential oil; 40 drops patchouli essential oil; 20 drops vetiver essential oil; 10 tablespoons of alcohol; 4 tablespoons of distilled water; ½ tablespoon of vegetable glycerin."

Oriental oils blend well with oils from the floral and citrusy scent groups. Woodsy oils usually blend well with all scent groups. [11] X Research source Experiment! By trying different the oils, mixing across scent groups and modifying proportions, the possibilities are almost limitless."

The naturally occurring chemicals in essential oils can offer medicinal and healing benefits when applied topically to the skin and when inhaled into the lungs. [16] X Research source The range of essential oils with medicinal benefits is wide, but not all of these particular oils make great ingredients for a perfume mist because some of them don’t smell especially pleasant. Luckily, there are plenty of oils that both smell great and provide medicinal value. Roman chamomile essential oil acts as an antispasmodic and sedative; it also provides anti-inflammatory properties and can ease insomnia/promote sleep. Lavender essential oil can relieve headache and migraine pain. It can be applied topically to soothe minor skin irritations and ease insomnia/promote sleep. Clary sage essential oil can relieve menstrual cramps and labor pain. It’s also considered to be an aphrodisiac. Neroli essential oil has antispasmodic properties and can be helpful during pregnancy/delivery. Neroli can also ease postpartum depression. Patchouli essential oil is soothing to the nervous system and has anti-inflammatory properties. Eucalyptus essential oil provides antibacterial benefits and can soothe muscle aches. Through inhalation, eucalyptus oil can both clear the sinuses and boost the immune system. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Exercise caution when using essential oils. Because they are so highly concentrated, essential oils can have negative side effects if used improperly. Consult a doctor before using them if you are pregnant, nursing or have immune deficiencies. If you have sensitive skin, always do a skin patch test before using essential oils topically. Essential oils are far too potent to be applied directly to the skin without diluting them first. Some of them can irritate the skin. [18] X Research source Use the highest grade essential oils that you can find. Check their bottles and packaging for key phrases like “pure grade”, “aromatherapy grade”, “certified organic” and “therapeutic grade.”"
