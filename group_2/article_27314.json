      "content": "Put the potatoes in a large pot and pour in enough water to cover them. Rinse 2 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 pounds (1.1 kg) of potatoes and put them into a large pot without peeling them. Pour in enough cold water to completely cover the potatoes. [1] X Research source Use Russet potatoes for the best texture. You'll need about 4 large potatoes or 6 small potatoes."

    {
      "title": "Boil the potatoes for 20 minutes over medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Boil the potatoes for 20 minutes over medium-high heat. Turn the burner to medium-high and bring the water to a vigorous boil. Keep the lid off of the pot and boil the potatoes until they're tender when you poke them with a fork. [2] X Research source Avoid boiling the potatoes until they become mushy. This would make them difficult to peel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drain the potatoes and place them on paper towels.",
      "content": "Drain the potatoes and place them on paper towels. Turn off the burner once the potatoes are tender. Set a colander in the sink and pour the potatoes into it so the water drains out. Place paper towels on a plate and transfer the potatoes to the paper towel so they dry. [3] X Research source It's important to remove moisture from the potatoes so they don't make the dough soggy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel the potatoes.",
      "content": "Peel the potatoes. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, get out a small paring knife and use to peel away the potato skins. Discard the potato peels. [4] X Research source If you notice any brown spots in the potato, cut away and discard them. To protect your hands, use a tea towel to hold the potatoes as you peel the potatoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the potatoes through a potato ricer.",
      "content": "Push the potatoes through a potato ricer. Put a peeled potato into a potato ricer and press down to push it through the ricer and into a bowl. Repeat this for all of the potatoes. [5] X Research source If you don't have a potato ricer, grate the potatoes against the fine side of a box grater. If the riced or grated potatoes look watery, set them on a paper towel-lined plate for 1 to 2 minutes."

    {
      "title": "Scoop the potato onto your work surface and put flour and salt on it.",
      "content": "Scoop the potato onto your work surface and put flour and salt on it. Transfer the riced or grated potato onto a clean counter or cutting board. Scoop it together so it's in a mound. Then put 2 1/2 cups (300 g) of the flour and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt directly onto the potatoes. [6] X Research source You can use all-purpose or 00 flour. You can find 00 flour in specialty shops and it will make a finer, softer dough."

      "content": "Use your hands to make a well in the middle of the potato mixture. Use your fingers like a scoop and sweep them around the center of the potato and flour mixture. This will make a deep well where you can add the remaining ingredients. [7] X Research source Make the well large enough to hold the eggs and cheese, if you're using them."

      "content": "Crack 1 egg into the well and add the optional cheeses. Add the egg to the center of the well. If you'd like to make creamier pasta, add 1/2 cup (123 g) of ricotta and 1/4 cup (25 g) of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese along with the egg. [8] X Research source Ensure there are no egg shells in the well or your dough will have hard bits."

      "title": "Use a fork to mix the egg with the flour and potatoes.",
      "content": "Use a fork to mix the egg with the flour and potatoes. Take a fork and beat the egg with the cheeses, if you're using them. Once the egg is beaten, use the fork to start mixing in the flour and potatoes from the sides of the well. [9] X Research source While you can use a spoon to mix the dough, it will combine better if you use a fork."

      "title": "Knead the mixture into a soft dough.",
      "content": "Knead the mixture into a soft dough. Use your hands to combine the crumbly mixture. Keep mixing until you have a dough that's smooth and doesn't fall apart. Avoid kneading it too much once it's formed or the gnocchi will be tough. [10] X Research source You shouldn't need to add flour to your work surface at this point because the dough is already crumbly."

      "content": "Cut the rectangle into 8 to 10 short strips. Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to cut across the rectangle. Avoid using a serrated knife which could tear the dough. Make 8 to 10 strips that are about 4 inches (10 cm) long. [12] X Research source The dough should feel light and airy if you haven't over-mixed it."

      "title": "Roll each strip into a long rope.",
      "content": "Roll each strip into a long rope. Move 1 of the strips to the center of your work surface and use the palms of both hands to roll it into a long rope. If you want to make thin gnocchi, roll the dough into a rope that's about 12 inches (30 cm) long. Roll out each of the strips into ropes. [13] X Research source If you want thicker gnocchi, roll the rope about 8 inches (20 cm) long."

For an easier shape, press your thumb into the middle of each piece of dough. [16] X Research source If you don't want to add texture to your gnocchi, you can skip this step and begin boiling the pasta."

      "content": "Boil the gnocchi for 2 to 4 minutes. Continue to boil the gnocchi until they're cooked throughout and they float to the top of the water. Stir them occasionally as they boil to prevent them from clumping together. [18] X Research source Avoid adding oil to the water while the gnocchi is boiling. It's better to stir the pasta to prevent it from sticking together."

Turn the burner to medium and cook the pasta in the sauce for about 2 minutes. [20] X Research source The gnocchi is now ready to be served. Cooking the gnocchi with the sauce will make the gnocchi tender and will help the sauce stick to the pasta. Refrigerate leftover cooked gnocchi in an airtight container for up to 3 to 5 days."
