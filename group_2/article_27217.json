The liability for them is too great to risk it."

They mean business. Search for fireworks supply houses or hobby chemical retailers for sources It may be necessary to grind the aluminum powder in a strainer in order to work out the lumps. The powder must be 400-600 mesh (measure of how fine the powder is)."

[3] X Research source Do not omit this step . A static discharge can ignite the powder, resulting in an explosion [4] X Research source that could ruin your whole day, or your whole house, or send bits of you flying into the neighbor's yard. The correct ratio of potassium perchlorate to aluminum for any quantity of flash powder is 7:3.To make a 5g mix (perfectly suitable for a small bang), weigh out 3.5 grams (0.1 oz) of the potassium and 1.5 gram (0.05 oz) of the aluminum.ie a 7:3 mix"

      "content": "Mix your ingredients. Do not stir, crush, press, or stand upon the mix. Though most flash powders are not impact sensitive, it is very easy to make a very, very unstable mixture. [5] X Research source The best way to mix the powders together is to pour all of the chemicals into a ziploc bag, spray it with anti-static spray, and slowly mix the chemicals by shaking the bag. However, there is some debate as to the safety of this method, so if you do use it be sure to spray the bag with anti-static spray in order to reduce the chance injury. A common method for commercially prepared flash powders is to combine the two powders in a capped plastic bottle and roll it gently between your hands to mix the powders."
