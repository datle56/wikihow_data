Though they're sharing your home, male sure that they're confined to their own spaces at first. Allowing them time to adjust to each others' scents within your home will help them get used to each other. [1] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist.

Consider having a sanctuary room for your cat, who's likely to be more comfortable in a confined space."

      "content": "Swap scents. Animals use smell to \"see\" and understand one another. To help speed this process for your new dog and your resident cat, switch their sleeping blankets so they become used to each other's scent. Or try rubbing a towel on one animal and put it under the food dish of the other. If you have other animals, do this with each animal in the house. Allow your animals to sniff each other when they're in close proximity."

      "content": "Feed the two animals on separate sides of a door. During the time when they're still being separated, start to feed them at the same time, but on separate sides of the same door. For example, if your cat's sanctuary space is in your bedroom, put her food dish by the door inside your room, and put your dog's food dish in the hall.

This will encourage them to associate each others' scent with good things, like food. With each feeding, move their bowls a little closer together, but keep the door closed."

      "title": "Start training your dog.",
      "content": "Start training your dog. If he's a rescue dog, he may already know some basic commands, such as \"sit\" or \"stay.\" If he doesn't, he may learn them quickly. For example, teach your dog to sit by holding a treat above and slightly behind his head. His body will naturally sit in order to access the treat. As soon as his bottom touches the floor, reward him with the treat. Say, \"Good dog!\" in a cheerful voice. Repeat, using identical gestures and voice commands. Being able to follow basic commands (sit, down, come, and stay) will help ease the introduction to your cat."

Your cat should be able to come and go as she pleases, while your new dog should be held on a leash. [4] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist. Keep these initial meetings quite short, and provide plenty of treats and praise so that they continue to associate each other with good things.

Dogs are more likely than cats to learn to associate the treat with behavior. This will also keep the dog's attention on you, rather than the cat. Your cat can then explore the dog with more confidence. [7] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source You can toss some cat treats to your cat as well, but don't allow your dog to catch them. If either pet acts aggressively, such as growling or snarling at the other, calmly distract and redirect him. Finish by calling the dog's name and returning him to his own space. Allow the cat to return to her own sanctuary space, and close the door."

Be aware that some dogs will never be safe around cats. A cat who continually hisses and growls at all types of dogs won't be happy living with dogs. [8] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist. Some dogs and cats just aren't good matches with each other, though they may be fine around other animals. Even though there's likely to be a difficult period at first, if you don't see improvement in your pet's behavior within 48 hours, you'll likely need to consult with an animal behavior specialist. Warning signs include the following: [9] X Research source Warning signs include: If your dog continues to be overly focused on the cat, not taking his eyes off the cat If your dog ignores you, and doesn't follow your commands when the cat is present If your dog lunges at the cat when she moves If your dog lunges, snarls, growls or snaps at your cat even if she's not moving If your cat attacks your dog when your dog is quiet and not moving"

For dogs, the social order is the most important element. To help your dog stay calm, make sure he feels that he's secure in his relationship with you. This is one reason why teaching the dog basic commands and keeping him on a leash for the initial introduction will be important. Make sure your cat's food is out of your dog's reach.

Keep treats in your pocket so you can \"catch them being good.\" Whenever you notice calm interactions between your dog and cat, praise them with a cheerful voice, saying, \"Good dog!\" and offer treats. Whenever your dog doesn't bark or chase cats, you'll want to reward this behavior. Try to avoid situations where you have to tell a dog \"No.\" Telling a dog \"no\" results in stress and confusion for a dog, without any real idea of what the \"right\" behavior might be."
