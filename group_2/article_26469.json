      "content": "Understand the science behind weight loss. Knowing why you must cutting carbs, start exercising, and eat differently will help you adapt your diet accordingly. There are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat, and losing weight rapidly requires dropping a lot of these calories from your diet. For the rest, exercise burns calories and kick starts your metabolism to burn more calories while you sleep. 3,500 calories a day is a lot -- and you need to be ready to sacrifice to make this possible. It won't be a comfortable 7 days, but you can get through it if you keep your end goal in sight. [2] X Research source A calorie is a calorie. This means that, at the end of the day, weight loss is about decreasing the number of calories you eat, no matter what source they're from. A professor in Kentucky once ate Twinkies and lost 27-lbs to prove this point. How? He ate very, very few. [3] X Research source If you feel dangerously nauseous, light-headed, woozy, or tired while on this diet. stop and have a snack. You can still lose a lot of weight by following the basic tenants of this diet, even if you need to \"cheat\" for your safety once or twice."

      "content": "Drop carbs from your diet. If you can do this slowly, before your one-week challenge, you'll have the best results. Carbs are a dietary staple, but they hold a lot of water weight (binding to more water than fat or protein) and are easy to overeat. Try to get yourself below 50g of cards (roughly a scoop of pasta) a day. Switch spaghetti squash for pasta -- it contains less than 1/4 of the calories. Swap an English Muffin for bagels or hamburger buns to save 100 calories. Make a taco salad instead of a burrito. Try to slowly lower your carb diet in the 2-3 weeks before the major weight loss. You body will adapt to the change, and by the time your \"7 days-7pounds\" comes around your body will be ready to drop the weight. That said, dropping carbs for one week will still make a difference. [5] X Research source"

That's not a joke about how vegetables taste bad, that's actual science based on the concept of a \"bliss point,\" which is the amount of calories you need to eat to feel full. Processed foods are specifically made with higher bliss points, but the all-natural goodness of vegetables allows you to eat fewer calories and still feel full. Make a salad with your favorite fruits and vegetables: lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, kale, celery, apples, strawberries, red onions, etc. Keep the dressing to a bare minimum;1-2 teaspoons of oil and vinegar is your best bet."

      "content": "Reschedule your meals for intermittent fasting (IF). IF is one of the best ways to lose weight fast, but no one ever said it was fun. Most commonly, IF involves skipping breakfast, leading to 18 hours or more between meals. Instead of breakfast, eat a single banana when you wake up as a snack. Then you can eat lunch and dinner, with a small snack in between (especially if you're exercising) and start again the next day. This is only a strategy for short-term weight loss. A balanced breakfast each morning is important for long-term dieting, as skipping breakfast often leads to overeating later on. Fasting can increase fat oxidation, helping you shed fat weight much quicker. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

Many companies make \"snack packs,\" and low-cal options, and indulging in something sweet, if in moderation, can actually prevent overeating later. That said, you want to space these snacks out. Instead of having that single low-cal cookie right after lunch, as dessert wait 1-2 hours and have it as a snack. This will keep you less hungry for longer and make it easier to space out your calories. Some good snacks include: A banana A handful of berries. 1-2 tablespoons of nuts.

This is, roughly, how many calories you burn in a day just by existing (a 20lb man burns roughly 2000 lbs). Many websites offer BMR calculators that will get you a more accurate number, as well. Knowing your BMR is essential to determining how many additional calories you need to burn through exercise. For example: You've cut your diet to a measly 1,200 calories a day for the week. Your BMR is 2,200 calories a day. This means that, if you didn't move all day, you'd burn that many calories. You have a 1,000 calorie deficit. This means you need to burn an additional 2,500 calories each day to lose a pound each day. [10] X Research source"

Making a rapid diet switch in an attempt to lose weight quickly often leads to \"rebound weight.\" This happens when, after a grueling 7 days of dieting, you are unable to maintain the extreme habits and instead slide back into bad ones. After your diet is complete, work on gradually shifting your lifestyle to something healthier instead of trying to become super-fit over night. Make time to exercise for 30 minutes 4-5 times a week. Substitute one of your normal meals, such as breakfast, with the new low-cal option. Keep track of your calories -- it prevents you from large swings back towards overeating."
