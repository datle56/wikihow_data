      "content": "Mix all of the dry ingredients in a bowl. Pour the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt into a large bowl and stir with a fork or whisk until everything is well-blended. For less-sweet scones, use 3 tablespoons of sugar. For sweeter scones, increase the sugar to 1/3 cup (65 grams). For savory scones, omit the sugar."

      "content": "Mix the butter and flour mix until it resembles a coarse, crumbly meal. You can use a pastry blade or your hands. The crumbles should be roughly the size of peas. Do not over-work the dough, however; this will result in tough, overly-dense scones. To make chocolate chip scones, add ½ cup (90 grams) of semi-sweet chocolate chips and stir.

Start with a few tablespoons of the liquid, and keep adding and stirring until the dough starts to come away from the sides of the bowl and clump up. You may end up using a little less/more than ½ cup (120 milliliters) of your liquid. To give your scones a little more flavor, consider adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cream or half-and-half. [2] X Research source"

You are cutting the dough in half so that you don't end up over-rolling the dough, which could lead to a tough pastry. Putting the dough back into the fridge will prevent it from becoming too soft too soon. Be sure that you cover the dough going back into the fridge with some plastic wrap."

      "content": "Transfer the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and roll it out. Make it somewhere between ¾ to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 centimeters) thick, but not thinner or it will not rise enough. Keep in mind, however, that the thicker your dough is, the longer it will need to bake. You can create a line in the centre of your scones to cut through when they are baked and ready to fill with cream or butter by rolling out to half the thickness you require then folding your scone mix in half. Cut through both layers to form the individual scones."

Here are some ideas: Make traditional scones by cutting the dough into a 9-inch (23-centimeter) circle, and then slicing it into eight wedges like a pizza or pie.

      "content": "Transfer the scones onto a baking sheet. To prevent sticking, consider covering your baking sheet with some parchment paper. If you have more baking sheets and enough room in your oven, you can roll and cut the other half of the dough; otherwise, you will have to wait until the first batch is done baking."
