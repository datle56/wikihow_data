      "content": "Keep your mutual friends updated about your life. Leos tend to be the leaders in friend groups, and they love to stay up-to-date on the latest drama. [6] X Research source If you maintain your friendships with your mutual friends, they’ll likely talk about you while he’s around, and your Leo ex will probably jump at the chance to get some insider info on how you're doing. Those conversations might bring up memories of your relationship that’ll make him wish you were still in his life. Grab a meal with your mutual friends, go on outings with them, and show up at parties and other social events. This strategy works particularly well if you’re not in contact via text or social media—he’ll get a reminder of how awesome you are without you having to reach out."

      "content": "Use this strategy for a haughty Leo who thrives off attention. Leos care a lot about their reputation and being the center of attention. [12] X Research source Ignoring him for a little bit might make him miss the attention you used to give him, which might push him to seek you out again. Just don’t rely on this strategy for too long, or his wounded pride might make him push you away even further. [13] X Research source After all, Leos secretly crave deep connection. A week or two of distancing yourself should do the trick! This is a great option if he dumped you. Take some time to yourself to heal while you ignore him. Hold off on texting or calling him. Let him make the first move. Don’t like or comment on his social media posts. If you broke up dramatically, try not to engage in the drama. Leos love drama, so don’t give him the satisfaction.

      "content": "Leos are the ultimate protectors. Even if you’re broken up, your Leo man might still feel a responsibility to help keep you safe and happy. While it’s important not to take advantage of him, you can try asking your Leo ex to help you with something small–even a restaurant recommendation or a piece of advice. His instincts as a leader and protector may fire up and make him miss you. [15] X Research source Text him saying, “Can I get your help with something?” Then ask him for help on a topic he likes. For instance, if he’s super tech savvy, ask him for help in picking out a new computer. If you’re still good friends, you can ask him for something deeper, like advice on dealing with a coworker or a tough situation."

[16] X Research source Draw your Leo ex in by being kind and showing him that you’re still there as a friend. Genuinely caring about him will make him miss the emotional connection you once had. Be courteous and compassionate in all your interactions with him, even when you feel hurt. If you’re still friends, ask how he’s doing on a regular basis, and give him support if he needs it. For instance, if you know he has something tough coming up at school or work, text him, “I know you’ve got that tough assignment this week. You’ve got this!” Leos themselves are known for their loyalty, so your lasting devotion to him may spark his own for you. [17] X Research source"

Mention the things the two of you have in common, the amazing memories you share, and the ways you’ve each grown since the breakup. [19] X Research source When he sees all the positive things about your connection laid out, he might be able to envision that beautiful future, too. Remind him of the dreams and goals you shared when you were together. The happiest couples pursue goals together. [20] X Research source Get nostalgic about the good times in your relationship. For example, text him something like, \"I went to that restaurant we used to love on Third Street.\" Don’t speak negatively or gossip about the relationship with any mutual friends–it might get back to him, and the negativity will push him away."
