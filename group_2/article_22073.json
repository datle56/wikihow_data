      "content": "Breathe. Intentional breathing is a simple activity, but it's one of the most powerful ways to create peace of mind. Emotions and breathing are closely connected. If you slow your breath and learn to breathe evenly and fully, your emotions will calm down as well. Breathing practices have been shown to reduce cortisol, the stress hormone. They also activate the \"rest and digest\" part of the nervous system, known as the parasympathetic nervous system. [1] X Research source Here are steps you can take: [2] X Research source Find a comfortable place to sit. Put one hand on your belly and one on your chest. Breathe in deeply from your belly, so that your stomach extends out but your chest stays in place. Hold this breath for a couple seconds and then breathe out. Repeat this sequence until you find a steady rhythm. Try to do this practice for 10 minutes every day."

A flow state is where you are completely involved in an activity without overthinking things. You enter flow states when you are doing things you love and when you are being challenged in a way that's suitable to your abilities. [8] X Research source Do what you love to do. This could be anything from playing darts on the weekend to landing your dream job as an accountant."

Many sources of \"quick fix\" happiness or peace of mind tend to go away the more we engage in the activity, but spending time with people we are close to seems to be an exception. [12] X Research source For example, if you identify with a particular religion, find a good church, temple, mosque, or synagogue to attend. For more examples, join a sports team or a reading group."

Try to make peace with your past in order to exorcise those old ghosts that may still be haunting you. Peace in the present moment can sometimes be blocked by a past that hasn't been dealt with. [14] X Research source Forgive yourself if appropriate. You probably didn't have the same knowledge that you do now. [15] X Research source Let go of your anger. Write about your inner rage privately. No need to hold back or censor yourself because no one will see these thoughts. Itâ€™s important to not keep your angry feelings bottled up inside and let the negativity fester. [16] X Research source Accept what has happened. Playing events over and over in your mind only continues the cycle of hurt feelings. Acceptance and moving forward helps to begin the healing process so you can focus on your future.

      "content": "Forgive other people. It's easy to hold grudges, but forgiving people who have hurt us is really important for mental health and better relationships. If you want peace of mind, you'll need to let go of any bitterness you have toward people from your past. You don't actually need to reconcile with these people if you don't want to; forgiveness is something that happens inside of you rather than between you and another person. [20] X Research source When you forgive, you are allowing yourself to heal because you are letting go of your grievances and negative judgements. [21] X Research source Holding onto grudges can negatively affect you by bringing anger and bitterness into every new situation, not being able to enjoy the present, losing connection with others, feeling like your life lacks meaning, and becoming depressed or anxious. [22] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A good exercise is to write down the names of people you're angry at and the reasons you're angry. You can then say \"I forgive you\" to each of the people. Lack of forgiveness can hurt you more than the other people, so do this for your own sake."

A job that makes you miserable or an unsafe neighborhood may seem tolerable, but they can have strong effects on your mental health and prevent you from having peace of mind. Here are some tips to help you make lasting changes: [26] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Make plans that you will stand by. Make sure when you're in the planning process that it's what you really want. For instance, if you want to move to a new place, make sure it's somewhere that you'd enjoy living in terms of culture, food, political affiliation, etc. Start with small, reasonable steps. Avoid planning to move across the country this coming weekend. If you do want to move, start small by researching housing options, school options, and more. Involve the other people in your life. Don't do it all on your own. Enlist help from friends and family members. If you want to move, ask what they think and see if they will help you pack up."

      "content": "Deal with toxic people. [27] X Research source Toxic relationships can be a powerful obstacle to having peace of mind in your life. These people may drain your emotions and never give anything back. They may take advantage of you. It may feel like everything is about them in the relationship. You may feel uncomfortable being yourself around them. Here are some tips for how to deal with these kinds of toxic relationships: Avoid being in denial. It's easy to make excuses for the people we enjoy being around, but ask yourself how you feel after you've spent time with them. Ask yourself if you actually want to spend time with them or if it feels like you have to. Ask yourself if you expect something from them that you never get. Identify what you get out of the relationship. Even toxic relationships have some kind of draw, or you wouldn't be in them. Maybe the person makes you feel comfortable, even if they hurt you. Maybe they buy you things to make up for their negative behavior. Find alternative sources. The likelihood is that you can find other ways to fill these wants and needs for yourself. You don't need to stick around in a friendship or romantic relationship that's toxic; you can find the same perks elsewhere without all the baggage. Try meeting new people."
