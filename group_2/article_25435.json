      "content": "They insult you or are generally mean to you. If your friend is regularly insulting or belittling you, starting arguments over all kinds of things, or making you feel bad about yourself for who you are, they are not being a good friend . If your friend does this even after you’ve told them to stop, it’s probably time to get some distance from them. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Types of insults can include teasing, sarcasm, and cynicism, comments that may sound like jokes, but are meant to hurt you. Some insults are more subtle, like backhanded compliments (complimenting you for negative things) or guilt-tripping (where your friend blames you for their distresses and problems). [2] X Research source In many cases, your friend may try to pass these insults off as humor, and ridicule you for taking them personally. It is possible that your friend doesn't know they are insulting you. If you are concerned, tell them they’re hurting you. Say, “It might be a joke, but that doesn’t make me feel good.” If your friend didn't know, they may apologize right away."

      "content": "You’re always the one reaching out. A healthy friendship is a two-way street of communication. If your friend doesn't like you, they probably aren't making much of an effort to stay in touch. [3] X Research source This means not just talking, but emails, texting, or any other form of communication. If you and your friend aren't talking very much, it is hard to say that you are still really friends. [4] X Research source You may not talk as often as you used to. Or, if you do talk, your conversations are now very short, and you find that you don't have much to talk about. If you are the only one reaching out and trying to stay in touch, then your friend is probably not interested. Counselor Alicia Oglesby reminds us that “people drift apart a little bit naturally,” and it’s not always a sign they don’t like you, just that you’re both changing. The best thing to do is talk to them about it.

      "content": "They seem cold or closed off. “Both parties should feel they are reaching out and contributing to the friendship,” licensed therapist Jin S. Kim says. But if you hang out with your friend and they seem distant, like their mind is elsewhere, or they’d rather be somewhere else, that’s not contributing. It feels more like they don’t want to open up to you. They might not share what's on their mind, or they might only give you short or one-word answers. Whatever the case, it feels like they’re trying to put space between you."

They may be avoiding you, or they might just think it’s not important to update you. [5] X Research source Friendship takes effort, and you shouldn't learn new things about your friend only through other people or social media. That doesn’t mean they have to be sharing everything with you all the time, but someone who’s a good friend is usually excited to tell you new things about their life."

Maybe they’ve even ghosted you. [6] X Research source If they’re constantly declining plans and don’t make an effort to hang out at all, they’re probably avoiding you. Think about their schedule and responsibilities. Maybe they really are too busy, or are going through something difficult. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt."

[7] X Research source That said, if they’re so busy with other friends that they can’t make time for you, or they prioritize their other friends over you, they’re making a choice about who they’d rather be around. People change, have new interests, and new friends. If your friend appears to be doing other things with new people, then those new people probably fit in better with their new interests. If your friend is not spending more time with others, but becoming withdrawn towards everyone, that could be a sign of more serious issues, like depression .

Go to source A bad friend, or someone who’s not trying to be a friend, isn’t very interested, and isn’t willing to put in the effort to make that connection.

[10] X Research source But as soon as you need something from them, they’re nowhere to be found. That’s a typical example of a one-sided friendship, and it’s not healthy for either of you. If this is your situation, tell your friend that you can’t help them this time, but that you’re down to hang out. If they don’t even want to hang out, you probably have your answer."

Licensed therapist Ebony Eubanks says if you find yourself thinking, “I feel like I can't be me, that we have disagreements and arguments, because of who I am. And that's not what I want” when you’re around them, then it might be time to move on. If your friendship is turning sour, your meetings will be tense, and you may feel anxious or uncomfortable in each other's presence. There may be a larger concern that you are not dealing with, or maybe you two have grown apart. Ask yourself: Do you feel good after seeing them? Do you feel like you want to see them again, or are you dreading the next time you hang out?"

[11] X Research source You may not be as close as you were, but it doesn’t mean they don’t like you or you aren’t friends, just that you’re different people than who you are when you met each other, and that’s normal. Ask your friend if they want to hang out and do something you’re both interested in, like play a sport or take a class, to help you grow closer together again."

Sometimes, when you’re in a friend group, it can feel like you’re fading into the background, or like your friends like each other more than they like you. It’s not because something’s wrong with you—it might just be that you’re not participating enough to get the attention you want. [12] X Research source Take more initiative and invite your friends to hang at your place, or suggest more things to do together.

Licensed therapist Jessica George says that the best course of action is just to talk. “Go to the source, be kind, ask them if something is wrong or if they feel like they have something to discuss,” she says. Ask them about the things you have been noticing that suggest they don't like you. Be open and honest about your concerns. It may not solve all of them right away, but it can clear the air. For example, say, “Hey, things feel weird between us. Can we talk about it?” or, “I feel like we’ve drifted apart, and I wanted to check in.”"

George tells us that “We might suspect or think we understand, but we don’t know until we ask them if things are off in the relationship.” It’s hard to admit, but it could be that you did something to hurt your friend, and now they’re avoiding you. The best course of action is an honest conversation. Be prepared to be apologetic, especially if you think your friend is angry at something you may have done. Showing you are open to compromise and reconciliation encourages your friend to do the same. [14] X Research source If you think you were in the wrong, but are not sure why it might be good to give an open-ended question . You want to allow them to talk, not give a simple answer to a direct question. Ask what is wrong, or what you did wrong. Be sure to give your friend some space after apologizing or asking for a response. This can be a lot to process, and you shouldn't expect an answer right away."

If this is the case, you can still have a great friendship, but you might not be as close as before. That’s okay! You’ll have plenty to talk about when you do see each other."

      "content": "Avoid getting defensive or aggressive. George says to “Avoid being defensive at all costs.” When you approach the discussion as “me vs. them,” it’s harder to actually learn and grow from the situation. Figure out what you are feeling (anger, fear, humiliation) to figure out what you can do next. [16] X Research source When discussing your concerns, use \"I\" Statements. Don't start your complaints with \"You,\" (as in \"You are...\") which makes your opinion seem like a fact. Instead, lead with how you feel when your friend does something negative towards you (\"I feel...\"). After that, name your friend's behavior and why it makes you feel that way. This makes your statement less accusatory. People don't always know the impact of their words and actions. Bringing it to their attention can get an apology. Or, perhaps they did mean it as a personal insult, in which case you will want to think about how much you want to keep this friendship."

Life coach Tracey Rogers says to evaluate your friendship and what you want from it, then ask yourself if it’s still possible to make it that kind of relationship. If it is still possible, don’t give up! But if the friendship is making you more hurt than happy, it may be time to let go. For example, maybe you and your friend have just drifted apart, and all it’d take is a good hangout to bring you together again. On the other hand, maybe you’ve had a huge argument, and it doesn’t seem like they’ll ever apologize, even after you said sorry yourself.

You learned a whole lot in the process, about yourself and how to be a good friend, so try not to feel too bad. [18] X Research source Think of all the good parts of the friendship.
