      "content": "Dip the slices in a mixture of 50% water and 50% lemon juice. The acidity from the lemon juice stops the fruit from oxidising, leading to less browning over time. Plus, it will keep them tasty, too! [1] X Research source You can use fresh lemon juice or store-bought lemon juice. Your pears will probably keep their color for about 8 hours. After that, they may start to turn slightly brown."

      "content": "Yes, if you store them in the fridge or the freezer. If you’re keeping them at room temperature, you can only cut them 1 day ahead of time. Pears taste best when they’re fresh, though, so try to eat them quickly. [2] X Research source If you’re packing pear slices for lunch, try putting them in with an ice pack to keep them fresh."

      "content": "Wrap the slices individually using plastic wrap. You can also use tinfoil or a plastic bag. Make sure your package is airtight to stop the slices from browning over time. [3] X Research source You can also put your pear slices into a plastic container with a lid."

      "content": "Eat the pears within 3 to 4 days. After that, pears start to lose their texture and flavor. They’ll also start to brown, even if you used lemon juice on them. [4] X Research source If the pear slices look brown, soft, and squishy, they may have gone bad."

    {
      "title": "Yes, if you pack them in syrup.",
      "content": "Yes, if you pack them in syrup. Peel, halve, and core the pears, then soak them in a 1:1 ratio of lemon juice and water. Mix 1 2/3 cups (158 g) of granulated sugar with 4 cups (950 mL) of water in a large saucepan, then heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Pour your pear slices and syrup mixture into canning jars, leaving 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of room at the top of the jar. The syrup will help maintain the color and the texture of the pears. It will make them taste slightly sweeter, so they’ll be good for pies and other baked goods. Since you’re freezing your pears, you don’t have to boil and seal your canning jars like you would in traditional canning."

      "content": "Eat the pears within 10 to 12 months. Write a label on your canning jars so you can remember when you put them in the freezer. After about a year, the pears will start to lose their flavor and texture. [5] X Research source Make sure your freezer stays at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) so your pears stay good to eat. Frozen pears will never go bad, but they probably won’t taste great after more than a year in the freezer."

      "title": "Add ascorbic acid to your canning syrup.",
      "content": "Add ascorbic acid to your canning syrup. For every 1 quart (32 USoz) of cold syrup you’re using, add in 1500 mg (1/2 tsp) of ascorbic acid. You can find ascorbic acid at most grocery stores in the canning section. Ascorbic acid is the best ingredient to use for long-term canning. Lemon juice and citric acid are fine too, but they aren’t as good as ascorbic acid. If you can’t find ascorbic acid, use Vitamin C pills instead. Crush up the pills and mix them in with the syrup at the same ratio as you would with ascorbic acid."

Dip your pear slices into the water mixture for 1 to 2 minutes before you can them. Drain your pear slices, but don’t rinse them. That way, they’ll keep some of the acidity in the can so they don’t turn brown."
