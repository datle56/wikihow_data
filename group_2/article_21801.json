    {
      "title": "Purchase a thin curtain rod or PVC pipe.",
      "content": "Purchase a thin curtain rod or PVC pipe. Curtain rods have the benefit of being easily adjustable while pipes may look more uniform and clean on the wall. Look for rods painted in your team’s colors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure your jersey from sleeve to sleeve.",
      "content": "Measure your jersey from sleeve to sleeve. Grab your jersey by the arms and pull them taut, creating a solid line from the upper tip of one sleeve across the neck hole to the upper tip of the other sleeve. Use a ruler to find the exact length of this line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust your rod so it is slightly longer than the jersey.",
      "content": "Adjust your rod so it is slightly longer than the jersey. If you’re using a curtain rod, adjust the segments so they are slightly longer than the length of the jersey. If you’re using a PVC pipe, use a plastic pipe cutter to achieve the same thing. The rod should be slightly longer than the jersey so you can place the ends on hooks without damaging the clothing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure and mark your rod’s end-points on the wall.",
      "content": "Measure and mark your rod’s end-points on the wall. Using a pencil, mark the spot where the center of the jersey’s neckline will sit. Then, divide the length of your rod in half. Use a metal ruler to measure out this distance from the left and right of the center point, making a mark at each end. Hold your rod up to the wall to make sure the points are level. [1] X Research source To make sure your marks are lined up, place your ruler against the wall so that it intersects with both points. Then, use a level to see if the ruler is straight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach hooks at the marked points.",
      "content": "Attach hooks at the marked points. If your curtain rod came with specific hanging hardware, follow the included instructions to attach them to the wall. If they did not, or if you’re using a PVC pipe, attach a nail hook, screw hook, or thick command strip instead. Make sure the hooks are large enough to hold the rod and thick enough to support its weight. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Run your rod through the jersey and hang it.",
      "content": "Run your rod through the jersey and hang it. Push your rod through one sleeve of the jersey and run it through to the other side. If necessary, use small tape strips or Glue Dots to keep the shirt from sliding. Place the ends of the rod on your hooks or hanging hardware."

    {
      "title": "Grab a felt or wood hanger.",
      "content": "Grab a felt or wood hanger. Wire hangers may work for everyday clothes, but they will leave dents in your jersey over time. Instead, use a solid, smooth wood or felt hanger to support your jersey on the wall. [3] X Research source Look for colors that match the jersey itself or the team’s colors. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mark the spot you want your jersey to hang from.",
      "content": "Mark the spot you want your jersey to hang from. Find a spot on your wall to hang your jersey from and make a small pencil mark where the hanger’s hook will sit. Look for areas where the jersey can hang down without touching the ground or furniture. To preserve the shirt over time, hang it away from windows and rooms that get moist or humid. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place a small hook or command strip on the wall.",
      "content": "Place a small hook or command strip on the wall. Make sure the area over your marked spot is clean and clear of debris. For walls that can be altered, push a small nail or hook into the plaster. For walls that cannot be altered, stick a command strip on the surface instead, making sure the hook lines up with pencil mark. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hang your jersey.",
      "content": "Hang your jersey. Place the hanger inside your jersey and put it on the nail or hook. To add to your display, try hanging a picture of yourself in uniform, your favorite player, or a piece of sporting equipment nearby. If your jersey is prone to slipping, use small Glue Dots or similar adhesives to keep the fabric in place."

    {
      "title": "Purchase a large shadow box display case.",
      "content": "Purchase a large shadow box display case. Look for a shallow shadow box or similar container, making sure it is deep enough to hold your shirt and any other objects you will be framing with it. [7] X Research source Look for border colors that match the jersey itself or the room it will be displayed in. Choose a square shadow box if you plan on folding the shirt to show just the number. Choose a tall, rectangular shadow box if you plan on showing the whole jersey."

      "title": "Remove the shadow box’s backing board.",
      "content": "Remove the shadow box’s backing board. Store-bought shadow boxes come with a backing board, typically made of cork or thin wood. Remove this like you would the backing of a picture frame and lay it on a flat surface. [8] X Research source To spice up a backing board, try covering it with cloth or paper that shares or contrasts with the jersey’s colors."

      "title": "Use double-sided fabric tape to attach your shirt to the board.",
      "content": "Use double-sided fabric tape to attach your shirt to the board. Whether you’re folding it into a square or displaying an entire side, you will secure your jersey with the same basic method. Use strips of double-sided fabric tape to attach the body of your jersey to the board. Press down firmly on the board to make sure the shirt is secure."

      "title": "Use dressmaker pins to hold loose fabric down.",
      "content": "Use dressmaker pins to hold loose fabric down. Press small dressmaker pins through the jersey to hold any loose fabric down. Look for spots that will be hidden from view, such as inside the sleeves and shoulders. Cover exposed pin points with fabric tape. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Attach other decorations to the board if you want to.",
      "content": "Attach other decorations to the board if you want to. If you have extra room, try adding some related elements to the shadow box. Small, light objects can be attached just like the jersey itself. For larger, heavier objects, try attaching them with hook-and-loop fastener straps or twine. In some cases, items can be rested against the base of the shadow box itself. [10] X Research source For personal jerseys, try adding equipment you used while playing like gloves, balls, or pucks. For fan jerseys, try adding team memorabilia like flags or player memorabilia like collectible cards."

      "title": "Place a nail or hook on the wall.",
      "content": "Place a nail or hook on the wall. Look at the reverse side of your backing board to see what kind of mount it uses. In most cases, this will be a generic nail mount. For walls you can alter, find the spot you wish to hang your jersey from and insert a nail or whatever object the mount requires. For walls you can’t alter, use a command strip instead. For heavy boxes, make sure to use a strong nail or hook to support the frame’s weight. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Replace the backing board and hang your jersey. When your arrangement is ready, reattach the backing board to your shadow box. Be careful not to bump or alter the objects inside while doing so. Then, hang the frame and enjoy your new decor."
