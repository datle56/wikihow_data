      "content": "Recognize the brown or red-brown color of the roach. American cockroaches are unique from other cockroaches in that they have a red-brown color that has an amber look to it. Most other cockroaches are a muddy brown color. Check to see if the roach you are looking at has a reddish glow to it. [2] X Research source In some cases, American cockroaches are a chocolate-brown color instead of the usual red-brown."

If you see a large cockroach eating something damp, it is very likely that it is an American cockroach. [3] X Research source For instance, an American cockroach might snack on a slice of old bread soaked with beer in the trash."

      "content": "Search for a brown or black egg casing. American cockroaches lay their eggs in a large, cylindrical egg case. If the egg casing is new, then it’ll be brown—after 1-2 days, it’ll look black. The female cockroaches like to drop the casings in less obvious spots where they won’t be in the way, so you might not see them."
