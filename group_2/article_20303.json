Toning certain areas, like the arms and stomach, may make them look trimmer, but to remove fat, you have to focus on exercising your entire body. Losing weight and keeping it off involves a calorie controlled diet and 150-300 minutes of moderate exercise per week (or around 20-40 minutes per day).

      "content": "Build core muscles. Focus on your core muscles by doing exercises that target the abdomen, like crunches, planks, Pilates, or yoga. This won't help you lose fat, but it can make your stomach appear more flat. It can also build lean muscle mass and increase your metabolism so you burn more calories during your normal routine. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The crunch is a classic core strengthening exercise. Lie on your back and place your feet against a wall so they're bent at a 90-degree angle. Cross your arms on your chest, lift your head and shoulders forward, and take in 3 breaths before lying back down. Repeat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Planks are another popular core exercise. Get in a push-up position with your hands under your shoulders. Keep your legs straight behind you and your feet together. Instead of lowering down for a push-up, hold this pose as long as you can. Challenge yourself each time to hold the pose longer.

[13] X Research source Swapping refined grains for whole grains may help you get a flatter stomach. Whole grains contain all the naturally-occurring nutrients of a food's entire grain seed in its original proportion.

Whole wheat foods include: whole wheat bread, brown rice, barley, buckwheat, oats, and quinoa. [14] X Research source Eating refined grains triggers your blood sugar and insulin levels to rise.
