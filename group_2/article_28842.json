      "content": "Line the outside of a lidded cardboard or plastic box with foil. Glue the aluminum foil to the outside of the box and lid. Go with a box that’s large enough to hold the items you’d like to keep cold. A shoe box or small plastic tote, for instance, would work well if you just need to store your lunch. [1] X Research source Attach the foil to the box so the shiny side faces out. The more light the foil reflects, the less heat the box will absorb. Smooth the foil after you apply it, so that it wouldn't be wrinkling too much. If you’re using a cardboard box, glue foil onto the inside, too. Use a single sheet of foil large enough to cover the entire interior. Carefully mold the foil into the corners, and try not to tear it. Lining the inside with foil can help keep the cardboard from getting soggy."

      "content": "Glue bubble packaging, thick fabric, or packing peanuts inside the box. Glue your insulating material to the lid’s underside and to the bottom and sides of the box’s interior. Recycled packaging materials, thick nylon, or cotton are all good choices. [2] X Research source Avoid covering the lip of the lid with insulating material, and make sure it can still fit over the box."

      "content": "Seal the box with foil if the lid doesn’t tightly close. Place an ice pack and the items you’re storing into the box, then cover it with the lid. If you used a plastic container, it should seal tightly. To seal a cardboard box, place a sheet of foil over the lid, fold it over the sides, then crumple it tightly around the box. [3] X Research source The box should keep your items cold for about 4 hours. If possible, keep the box away from direct light and sources of heat."

      "title": "Remove the top flaps from a cardboard box.",
      "content": "Remove the top flaps from a cardboard box. Use a pair of scissors or utility knife to cut off the top flaps. Keep in mind you’ll be building layers of foam about 6 in (15 cm) thick inside the box. Choose a box large enough to hold all of that insulation and still have room to store foods and drinks. [4] X Research source For example, if you use a 24 by 24 in (61 by 61 cm) box, the space available for storage will be 18 by 18 in (46 by 46 cm). A cardboard box is the easiest choice, but a large plastic tote would work. You could also make your own box out of wood. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Line the box with a trash bag, shower curtain, or plastic tablecloth.",
      "content": "Line the box with a trash bag, shower curtain, or plastic tablecloth. Place a trash bag, or another type of waterproof material, into the box as if you were lining a trash can. Press the bag into the box’s corners, and take care not to tear the bag. Keep the bag flat against the sides of the box, then trim the bag so it’s flush with the top of the box. [6] X Research source Duct tape the bag to the top of the box; add strips of tape along the box’s entire top edge. Give the bag some slack so there’s extra material at the bottom corners. It’ll tear easily if it’s too tight. The waterproof layer will help keep melted ice or condensation from getting the cardboard soggy. A trash bag is inexpensive and readily available, but a shower curtain or plastic tablecloth would be sturdier."

      "content": "Cut 5 panels of 1 in (2.5 cm) foam to line the inside of the box. Use craft foam boards or sheets of foam board insulation. Measure the box’s bottom and sides, cut a panel that matches the box’s bottom, and make the side panels 2 in (5.1 cm) shorter than the box. [7] X Research source Cut 2 of the side foam panels 2 in (5.1 cm) shorter to account for the thickness of the other 2 panels. Suppose you have a 24 by 24 by 24 in (61 by 61 by 61 cm) box; make 2 of the panels 24 in (61 cm) long. Since the panels are each 1 in (2.5 cm) thick, make the other 2 panels 22 in (56 cm). Cut with the grain of the foam to keep the edges straighter."

      "title": "Glue the foam panels inside the box.",
      "content": "Glue the foam panels inside the box. Start by gluing the bottom board to the base of the box. Take care not to tear the waterproof layer. Then glue a foam panel to each side of the box's interior. [8] X Research source Once they’re glued into place, the tops of the side panels should be 1 in (2.5 cm) below the box’s top edge. Each side is 2 in (5.1 cm) shorter than the box, but the bottom foam panel adds an extra 1 in (2.5 cm) to their height. To make the glue dry faster, don't use it in excess and make sure to apply it onto the dry surface."

Cut the other 2 panels 6 in (15 cm) smaller than the box’s sides. All 4 sides should be 1 in (2.5 cm) shorter than the height of the box. [9] X Research source Glue the 4 panels together to make an inner box. This smaller inner box is actually the storage space. You'll fill the gap between the inner foam box and the panels that line the cardboard box with insulation. All of these layers of insulating material will help keep the cooler nice and cold."

If you use spray foam, pause between applications to allow the foam to expand. If it expands beyond the tops of the panels, give it an hour to dry, then trim the excess foam with a utility knife. [11] X Research source In a pinch, fill the gap with packing peanuts, bubble wrap, or Styrofoam. Fiberglass insulation would also work."

If each gap is 4 in (10 cm) wide and each foam panel is 1 in (2.5 cm) thick, the cover strips should be 6 in (15 cm) wide. [12] X Research source Cut 2 of the strips, then set them over the gaps on parallel sides of the box. Measure the length between the 2 covers, then cut 2 more strips to match that length. Be sure to use 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick foam board for the strips to leave room for the box’s lid."

Since the strips that cover the insulation-filled gaps are 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick, there should be a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) lip formed by the sides of the cardboard box. This lip should hug the sides of the lid. [14] X Research source If you’d like, glue handles or knobs to the top of the lid so it’s easier to remove. If you made a wooden box, you could make a wooden, foam-lined lid and join it to the box with a hinge. [15] X Research source"

Use waterproof material for the innermost layer, insulating material for the middle layer, and a fabric you find attractive for the outer layer. [16] X Research source Laminated cotton, PUL lining, and vinyl are your best options for waterproof materials. If you want to stick with recycled materials, you could use a plastic tablecloth or a plastic shower curtain. Thermal batting, which you can find at a craft or fabric store, is the best insulating material. If you're on a budget, you can recycle thin flexible foam or bubble wrap. Thin craft foam or packing foam might work, but the lunch bag will be stiffer. Pick a durable, easy-to-clean material for the outer layer, like canvas or denim."
