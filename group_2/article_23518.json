      "content": "Keep a friend sitting down with your pointer finger. Have a friend sit down in a chair. Make them cross their arms in front of their chest so their hands are on their shoulders. Place your pointer finger on the middle of their forehead and tell them to stand up without moving their arms. Watch as your friend tries to stand!

      "title": "Levitate your arms by holding them in a doorway first.",
      "content": "Levitate your arms by holding them in a doorway first. Stand in the middle of an open doorway. Press the back of your hands against either side of the doorframe and push against it with all of your strength for 30 seconds. Walk away from the doorframe and let your arms raise up on their own. [2] X Research source Your arms will raise up without you consciously moving them because your muscles are still locked from pushing against the door frame."

      "title": "Place your hands on your head and challenge a friend to move them.",
      "content": "Place your hands on your head and challenge a friend to move them. Put both of your hands on top of your head with the palms down and elbows out to the side and bent. Keep your fingers locked together and hold your head firmly. No one will be able to dislodge your hands from your head no matter how strong they are. You must remain still for this trick to work. [3] X Research source This trick works because of the position of your hands as well as your interlocked fingers."

      "title": "Get your friends to pull your hands apart from your chest.",
      "content": "Get your friends to pull your hands apart from your chest. Bend both elbows and place both palms on your chest with your fingertips touching and forearms parallel to the ground. Challenge anyone to pull your hands apart by holding your wrist. Ask them to pull steadily and not to give a sudden jerk. It will be impossible to pull your arms apart.

      "title": "Get a group of friends to levitate you by working together.",
      "content": "Get a group of friends to levitate you by working together. Sit down in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Get 4 of your friends to put their hands together, interlocking their fingers, keeping their index fingers together but pointed outwards in the shape of a gun. Have 2 of your friends put their pointed fingers under your arms and the other 2 volunteers under your knees. Tell your friends to lift up at the same time. [5] X Research source This trick works because your weight is spread out between the 4 of your friends. Even if they couldn’t lift you on their own, they can lift you together."

      "title": "Keep your arms locked and have people lift you up by your elbows.",
      "content": "Keep your arms locked and have people lift you up by your elbows. Ask 2 people to lift you by your elbows. At first, keep your arms loose from your shoulders down. Your friends will find it extremely difficult to budge you. Next, keep your elbows pressed tightly to your side and your arms rigid against your body. Lifting you is much easier with your elbows in and arms rigid. [6] X Research source You can ask more people to try to lift you with your arms lose to prove how difficult it is to lift you up. Your friends will be impressed with how easy it is to lift you once you have your elbows in and arms rigid."

      "content": "Make it look like you’ve bitten an apple and then restore it. Buy 2 apples from your lunchroom or the store. Cut a bite-sized piece out of 1 of the apples, but leave the other apple intact. Place the fleshy part of the bite-sized piece onto the whole apple to make it look like there is a bite taken out of it. Pretend like you’ve bitten the apple and show off your “bite mark.” Then, move your hand and quickly remove the bite-sized piece of apple. This makes it look like you restored the apple back to its original shape! [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Make sure your friends don’t see you setting up this trick."

      "content": "Convince your friends you’ve made crayons disappear by cutting them in half. Buy a small box of crayons that has a hole in the front to display the colors. Take all of the crayons out and tape them together side by side. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut all of the crayons in half. Place the crayons back in the box and hold them up so they peak through the display hole. Wave your hand in front of the box and let the crayons drop below the display hole. This makes it look like the crayons have disappeared. [9] X Research source The crayons will be harder to use once they are cut in half, so don’t use a box of crayons that you need later."
