      "content": "Understand the difference between bookkeeping and accounting. Bookkeeping and accounting are terms often used interchangeably. However, the skills and responsibilities required of each are somewhat different. Bookkeepers generally keep records of sales and record them in the books directly. They do the day-to-day work of making sure every dollar the business makes and spends gets recorded. An accountant, on the other hand, creates and analyzes financial statements, and can also audit the business's books to ensure accuracy and proper reporting. Bookkeepers and Accountants may works in tandem to provide a full level of service to a business. In many cases, the distinction between the two is formalized by a professional degree, state certification, or industry organization. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand dual-entry bookkeeping. Accountants make two or more entries for each transaction recorded by the business. These can be thought of as an increase in one or more accounts and an identical decrease in one or more other accounts. For example, a payment made for a sale previously made on credit would result in an increase in the cash account and a decrease in Accounts Receivable (money owed to the business by customers who have purchased items on credit but not yet paid). These entries would be made for the same amount (the amount of the sale). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice recording debits and credits. When dual-entry records are made, they are done in the form of debits and credits. These represent whether or not certain accounts are increased or decreased by a transaction. Using them is relatively if you remember two things: Debit means the record goes in the left side of the t-account and credit means you should use the right side. This refers to a standard t-account journal in which records are made on either side of the vertical portion of the \"T\". Assets=Liabilities+Owner's Equity. This is the accounting equation. Memorize this above all else. It works as a sort of guide to debits and credits. For the portion left of the \"=,\" debits increase the account and credits decrease it. For the right side, the opposite is true. This means that when asset accounts, like cash, are debited, they are increased. However, when liability accounts, like accounts payable, are debited, they decrease.

The financial statements are created from the information contained within the general ledger. At the end of the accounting period, each account is totaled up to create a trial balance. The total debits and credits in all accounts should be equal. If they are not, the accountant must re-check the balances of each account and make adjustments or corrections where necessary. When the accounts are adjusted and correct, the accountant can enter summaries of the information contained in them into the financial statements.

      "title": "Learn how to create an income statement.",
      "content": "Learn how to create an income statement. An income statement is the most basic principle of accounting. It records a company's profit margins over a specified duration of time, ranging anywhere from one week to one year. The income statement is determined by two factors: the business's revenues and its expenses. [9] X Research source Revenue is the inflow of cash in exchange for goods and services earned over time â€”though not necessarily the money actually paid to the company over that period of time. Revenue may include cash transactions as well as accruals. If accruals are included in the income statement, then the revenue of a given week or month takes into account the invoices and bills that were sent out during that time, even if the money will not be collected until the next income statement's period. Income statements are therefore intended to show how profitable a business was during that recorded period of time, not necessarily how much money a business took in during that time. [10] X Research source Expenses are any use of money to the company, whether due to the cost of materials and supplies or labor/wages. Much like revenues, expenses are reported during the period of time in which those expenses were incurred, not necessarily when the company paid for those expenses. [11] X Research source The matching principle of accounting requires a company to match related expenses and revenues together whenever possible in order to ascertain a company's actual profitability over the course of a given time period. In a successful business this should more or less result in a cause-and-effect relationship, where, for example, increased sales will increase the company's revenue while also resulting in business-related expenses: an increased need to buy more supplies for the store and an increase in expenses for sales commissions, if applicable.

      "title": "Create a balance sheet.",
      "content": "Create a balance sheet. Unlike an income statement, which deals with a period of time, a balance sheet can be thought of as essentially a snapshot of your business at one particular point in time. [13] X Research source A balance sheet has three important components: the business's assets, liabilities, and the stockholder's or owner's equity at a given point in time. [14] X Research source It may be helpful to think of the balance equation in terms of a company's assets being equal to the company's liabilities plus the owner's/shareholder's equity. In other words, what you have is always determined by what you owe plus what is currently yours to keep. Assets are what a company owns. It may be helpful to think of assets as all of the resources a company has at its disposal: namely, the vehicles, cash, supplies, and equipment a company owns at that given point in time. [15] X Research source Assets can be tangible (a plant, equipment) and intangible (patents, trademarks, goodwill). Liabilities are any amount that is owed to others at the time of the balance sheet's creation. Liabilities can include loans that must be paid back, any money that is owed for supplies given on credit, and any wages owed to employees that have not yet been paid. [16] X Research source Equity is the difference between the assets and the liabilities. Equity is sometimes thought of as the \"book value\" of a company or business. [17] X Research source If the company is a large corporation, the equity may belong to stockholders; if the business is owned by one single person, then the equity is an Owner's Equity.

Essentially, a cash flows statement specifies how cash has been generated and used by a business, as well as that business' investing and financing activities, over a specified period of time.

      "content": "Follow the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The basic principles that guide accounting practices rely on a set of principles and assumptions designed to guarantee transparency and integrity in all business transactions. The Economic Entity Assumption is the requirement that an accountant working for a sole proprietorship (a business where a single person owns the company) must maintain a separate ledger for business transactions that does not include the business owner's personal expenses or transactions. [20] X Research source The Monetary Unit Assumption is the agreement that economic activity, at least in the United States, will be measured in US currency, and therefore only activity that can be translated into US currency will be recorded. [21] X Research source The Time Period Assumption is the agreement that all business transactions will be represented in distinct time intervals, and that those intervals will be recorded accurately. These intervals are typically relatively short: at the very least an annual report is made, though reports are often made at weekly intervals in many companies. The report must also specify when that time interval began and ended. In other words, it's not enough to include the date of the report; an accountant must clarify in that report whether the report corresponds to one week, one month, one financial quarter, or one year. [22] X Research source The Cost Principle refers to the amount of money spent at the time of a given transaction, without taking inflation into account. [23] X Research source The Full Disclosure Principle requires accountants to disclose relevant financial information to any interested parties, particularly investors and lenders. This information must be disclosed either in the body of a financial statement, or in the notes at the end of that statement. [24] X Research source The Going Concern Principle assumes that the company will remain in operation for the foreseeable future, and requires the accountant to disclose any information regarding the compromised future or certain failure of a company. In other words, if an accountant believes the company will go bankrupt in the foreseeable future, he is obligated to disclose that information to investors and any other interested parties. [25] X Research source The Matching Principle mandates that expenses be paired with revenues in all financial reports. [26] X Research source The Revenue Recognition Principle is an agreement that revenue will be recorded as having occurred at the time the transaction is completed, not when the money is actually paid to the business. [27] X Research source Materiality is a guideline which grants accountants some degree of professional judgment in determining whether or not a given amount is insignificant to the report. This does not mean an accountant may report inaccurately; rather, it addresses an accountant's decision to round to the nearest dollar, for example, in reporting on a business's financial transactions. [28] X Research source Conservatism is a principle that advises that an accountant may report potential losses for a business (in fact, he has an obligation to report such losses), but he may not report potential gains as actual gains. This is to prevent investors from having an inaccurate picture of the company's financial situation. [29] X Research source"

This is both for the professional dignity of the accountant and to ensure that any future transactions are fair and honest. [30] X Research source Consistency requires an account to be consistent in how he applies various practices and procedures to a financial report. If, for example, a business changes its cost flow assumption, the accountant for that business has an obligation to report on that change. [31] X Research source Comparability requires accountants to conform to certain standards, such as the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), to ensure that one company's financial reports can be easily compared to another company's financial reports.
