Both signs are known for their incredible intellect, so they'll be able to keep up with each other and inspire one another to explore new ways of thinking. [4] X Research source Their one difference lies in Aquarius's outspoken nature, which may turn off a Gemini (even if they agree with everything an Aquarius has to say).

      "content": "In a relationship, these signs may struggle with emotional vulnerability. Aquarius is more focused on the big picture (like advocating for change in society). In their personal relationships, they may neglect to share their feelings with their partner (or even think about their emotions at all). A Gemini frequently changes their mind and gets bored easily. Rather than sharing how they feel, they might be tempted to move on to the next thing without trying to make their relationship work. [6] X Research source Both signs will need to stick around and get vulnerable if they want to establish a deeper connection. If the two decide to make a commitment to each other and actually share what's on their mind, they'll be an outstanding duo."

Gemini shares a similar need for freedom since they're a social sign who likes to spend lots of time with their friends. Together, they'll do a remarkable job maintaining full lives outside of their relationship, and it's unlikely that they will ever feel jealous or threatened. [8] X Research source Always breaking the rules, an Aquarius might struggle to be in a relationship with a lot of restrictions. It's important that these two talk about their expectations (especially regarding monogamy) so neither sign gets hurt."
