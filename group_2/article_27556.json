      "content": "Spoon 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of petroleum jelly into a microwave-safe bowl. If you want, use 2 bowls to make 2 different shades of gloss, or use 1 bowl to make multiple tubes of the same shade. Because the bowl doesn’t need to hold much, you can use a really small one instead of dirtying a larger one. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Add 1 tsp of lipstick to the bowl with the vaseline.",
      "content": "Add 1 tsp of lipstick to the bowl with the vaseline . Use less lipstick to give your gloss just a tint of color, or use more lipstick to create a deeper shade of gloss. Simply cut away a small piece from a tube of lipstick and add it to the mixing bowl. [2] X Research source If you don’t have lipstick, you could also use eyeshadow or blush to add color to your lip gloss. You could also add 1 to 2 drops of your favorite essential oil or a small pinch of glitter to the mix at this time, too."

      "content": "Microwave the mixture for 10 to 30 seconds. Put the bowl into the microwave and set the timer for 10 seconds to start. Check it after that time to see if the ingredients have begun to melt. If not, put it back for an additional 10 to 20 seconds. [3] X Research source Be careful when using the microwave . The bowl may be hot to the touch once it’s done."

      "content": "Use a disposable spoon to stir the petroleum jelly and lipstick together. Simply stir the ingredients for 10 seconds or so to make sure they are thoroughly mixed together. You don’t want gloss that has blotchy sections! [4] X Research source If you don’t have disposable spoons, that is okay. They just make the cleanup a little easier, but you can use a regular spoon and wash it off later."

      "content": "Transfer the gloss into clean lip gloss containers. You can use squeezable lip gloss tubes, tubes with wands, chapstick tubes, tins, or any other container you’d like. Just make sure that whatever container you use has a lid. [5] X Research source Move the gloss into the containers soon after it has been melted and mixed. The warmer it is, the easier it’ll be to work with."

      "content": "Let the lip gloss cool for about 20 minutes before you use it. Leave the lip gloss on the counter, or put it into the fridge so it cools a little faster. Once it is cool, it won’t be runny and will be the perfect consistency to wear! [6] X Research source These glosses are great to keep in a purse or desk, and they make great gifts, too."

Measure out 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cocoa butter into a small microwave-safe bowl.

Stir everything for about 10 seconds, making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl so that it all gets mixed together.

      "content": "Transfer the lip gloss into tins and let it cool for 20 minutes. Coconut oil has a really low melting point, so don’t put this kind of gloss into an actual lip balm tube, as it is more likely to melt out of that kind of container. You can buy small, lidded tins online for less than a dollar a piece, or you may even be able to find them at your local dollar store or beauty store.

If you buy the squares, grate them over a small bowl so that they’ll combine more easily with the rest of the ingredients. Grate enough for 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cosmetic-grade beeswax.

Measure out 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of grape-seed oil or olive oil, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cocoa butter or shea butter, and the grated beeswax. Cut open 3 vitamin E capsules and squeeze the oil from the capsules into the cup. A glass measuring cup with a spout will make it easier to pour the gloss later on, but if you don’t have one, a plain glass bowl will work perfectly fine. Don’t include the actual capsules from the vitamin E in the cup."

Put it on the stove and turn the burner on to medium heat, and then set the measuring cup with all your ingredients inside of the pot. Be careful to not get any water inside of the measuring cup, as it won’t mix in with the ingredients and could ruin your lip gloss. If you don’t have access to a stove, you can also melt the ingredients in the microwave. Just be careful to not burn the ingredients and microwave it in 10- to 15-second increments, stirring it every time you take it out to check it."

      "content": "Pour the mixture into lip gloss containers while it’s still warm. The gloss will be much easier to pour while it’s still hot or warm. Once it has cooled down, it won’t flow as easily. Use actual lip gloss containers rather than tins or chapstick tubes. This recipe makes gloss rather than balm, and its consistency will naturally be a bit runnier than balm would be. If you’re having trouble getting the gloss into the tubes, use a funnel."
