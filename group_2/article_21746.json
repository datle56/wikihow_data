      "content": "Choose 8–10 lb (3.6–4.5 kg) test fishing line. Go with a heavy-test fishing line to hang your model plane without any visible lines, making it look like it’s suspended in the air. Use a heavy-test line so it’s strong enough to support the weight of your plane. Fishing line that’s rated to hold at least 8–10 pounds (3.6–4.5 kg) should do the trick. Braided fishing line will be more visible and isn’t necessary to support the weight of your plane."

      "content": "Find a stud in your ceiling to hang your plane from. Use a stud finder and move it over the surface of your ceiling until it identifies a stud. You could also slide a magnet over the surface until it sticks to a nail in a stud, or try knocking against the ceiling with your knuckle to listen for the solid sound of a stud behind it. Mark the location of the stud where you want to hang your plane so you can screw your hook into it. [1] X Research source It’s super important that you hang your plane form a stud because your ceiling may not be able to support its weight."

      "content": "Insert a screw hook into a stud in your ceiling. A screw hook is basically exactly what it sounds like: it’s a small hook with a screw at the end! Place the pointed end of the screw hook against the ceiling and start twisting it clockwise to drive it into your ceiling. Continue twisting until all of the threads are driven into the ceiling and stud. [2] X Research source You can find screw hooks at your local hardware or home improvement store. You can also order them online. If you’re having trouble driving the screw hook into the stud, try clamping a pair of pliers over it and using them to rotate it."

Take the right-hand end of the line, wrap it under the left-hand end, and then bring the right-hand line back over the left-hand. Then, take the original right-hand line, pull it under the other line, and pull on both ends to tighten the knot. [3] X Research source You’ll end up with 1 large loop of line. Depending on the size of your plane and how far you want it to hang from your ceiling, you may want to use a length of fishing line between 20–52 inches (51–132 cm)."
