      "title": "Wash your hair, then blow dry it towards the back of your crown.",
      "content": "Wash your hair, then blow dry it towards the back of your crown. The goal here is to dry your hair so that it goes towards a certain point: the back of your crown. This means that you'll have to dry the hair on the back and sides of your head upwards, and the hair at your front hairline straight back. [1] X Research source Use a paddle brush or a denman brush to brush your hair while blow drying it. This will help position it better as well as make it smoother. Lean forward when blow drying the hair on the back and sides of your head; it'll make things easier. While not completely mandatory, this will help \"train\" your hair to lay in a certain direction and reduce bumps."

    {
      "title": "Flat iron",
      "content": "Flat iron your hair if you want a sleek ponytail. Make sure that your hair is perfectly dry first, then apply a heat protectant to it. Next, straighten your hair using a flat iron. If you \"trained\" your hair while blow drying it, make sure that you flat iron it in the same direction. [2] X Research source For example, if you blow-dried the hair on the back and sides of your hair, then pull the flat iron upwards rather than down. If your hair is naturally straight or thin, you can skip this step. If your hair is thick, curly, or textured, straightening it will make it flatter, sleeker, and more manageable."

      "title": "Mist your hair with hairspray or dry shampoo if you need texture.",
      "content": "Mist your hair with hairspray or dry shampoo if you need texture. Sleek hair is great and all, but it can be difficult to work with. Luckily, dry shampoo and hairspray will both add texture to your hair, which will help your ponytail last throughout the day. [3] X Research source This is completely optional."

      "title": "Part your hair in half horizontally where you want the ponytail to sit.",
      "content": "Part your hair in half horizontally where you want the ponytail to sit. This is just like creating a half-up ponytail, except that you're making it high on the back of your crown. Twist and secure the top part into a temporary bun, then do the same thing with the bottom part of your hair. [4] X Research source This may seem a like a lot of extra work, but working in 2 parts is key to getting a sleek, bump-free ponytail."

    {
      "title": "Pull your hair into a half-up ponytail at the back of your crown.",
      "content": "Pull your hair into a half-up ponytail at the back of your crown. Undo the temporary bun at the top of your head. Gather the hair into a half-up ponytail at the back of your crown. Don't tie your ponytail yet. [5] X Research source This is where your high ponytail will end up, so play around with the position until you are happy with it. Creating a double ponytail is ideal if you have very thick hair."

      "title": "Smooth the hair gathered into the ponytail with a comb.",
      "content": "Smooth the hair gathered into the ponytail with a comb. Hold your half-up ponytail in one hand; keep your thumb under the ponytail. Using your other hand, run a comb from your hairline and towards your ponytail-holding hand. Grab and gather the hairs into the ponytail. [6] X Research source Keep going until you get the smoothness you desire. Do the top and sides. Make sure that the teeth of the comb reach your scalp. If you need extra smoothness, apply a light-weight gel to your hairline, and slick it back towards the ponytail. This will reduce frizz and flyaways, helping your ponytail become smoother and sleeker. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure the half-up ponytail with a hair tie.",
      "content": "Secure the half-up ponytail with a hair tie. If you can, use a small hair tie; this will reduce any bulk. If your hair is thin or fine enough, then you may be able to use a clear hair elastic instead. [8] X Research source Be sure to smooth your hair down as you pull it into the hair tie. This completes the first stage of your bump-free ponytail!"

Run a comb through the sides and back of your head, just like you did with the first ponytail. [9] X Research source Try to get the hairs as smooth as possible for this. You shouldn't have to use any gel for this."

      "content": "Secure both ponytails with another hair tie. Don't undo the first ponytail. Just add the bottom hair to the first ponytail, hold everything together, and wrap a hair tie around it. Be sure to smooth your hair into the ponytail as you do so. [10] X Research source Make sure that the elastic is new; older ones that have lost their stretch and elasticity won't hold your style for very long. [11] X Research source Consider using a bungee ponytail holder instead. It's a piece of looped elastic with hooks on each end. [12] X Research source At this stage, your ponytail is complete.

      "content": "Straighten the ponytail more with a flat iron if you want a sleeker look. Don't undo the ponytail. Just grab strands from the tail, and run them through your flat iron. Your ponytail should already be relatively straight, so don't worry about being too perfect here. [13] X Research source Focus on the ends of your ponytail, especially if you have layered hair. You don't need to use more heat protectant, since the initial coating you did when you first straightened your hair should be enough."

      "content": "Tease your ponytail if you want more volume. If sleek and straight isn't your game, then tease your ponytail instead! Grab a chunk from your ponytail, then backcomb it at the base with a comb. Keep doing this until you get the fullness you want. [14] X Research source Always do the underside of each section, not the top. If you do the top, it'll be visible in the finished look."

      "content": "Use a toothbrush sprayed with hairspray to smooth down flyaways. Those small baby hairs around your temples can ruin a sleek look, but luckily, they are easy to take care of! Take an old, but clean toothbrush, and mist it with hairspray. Then, before the hairspray dries, gently comb those wispy hairs down. [15] X Research source If you don't have a toothbrush to spare, you could try a boar bristle brush or a smoothing brush instead."

      "content": "Wrap a strand of hair around the base of the ponytail to hide the elastic. Whether or not you do this is entirely up to you! Simply take a 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 in (1.3 cm) wide strand of hair from your ponytail, then wrap it around the elastic. Push a bobby pin through the end of the strand and into the base of the ponytail to hold it in place. [16] X Research source For a nicer finish, smooth the end of the strand down with gel before you bobby pin it. This is a great way to hide a bungee-style hair tie."

Shine spray is also great for naturally curly or coarse-textured hair. [17] X Research source If you're just looking for extra hold, focus on the hair that's going into the ponytail. If you're looking for extra shine, focus on the tail itself."

Choose something that you think will go great with your outfit, then add it in. [18] X Research source It's best that you do this after you've finished spraying your hair, as hairspray can damage or dull a nice hair accessory."
