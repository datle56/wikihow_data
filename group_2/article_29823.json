      "content": "Pour all of your ingredients into a tall shaker. For a single serving, you will need 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of peach schnapps, 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of vodka, 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of cranberry juice, and 1.5 ounces of (45 mL) of orange juice. [1] X Research source A shaker is a metal tumbler or glass meant for mixing drinks in. Do not use an actual glass for this. The order you add the ingredients in is not important."

      "title": "Fill the shaker three quarters of the way full with ice.",
      "content": "Fill the shaker three quarters of the way full with ice. If you can, try to use larger ice cubes rather than smaller ones. This is because smaller cubes break down quicker, which can dilute the cocktail and make it taste watery. [2] X Research source The ice cubes that come from a standard-sized ice cube stray should be just fine. They are typically around 1 by 2 inches (2.5 by 5.1 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Shake your cocktail for 15 seconds.",
      "content": "Shake your cocktail for 15 seconds. Cover the shaker with its lid first. Hold the shaker between your hands, with 1 hand on the lid and the other on the bottom. Shake it for 15 seconds to combine the ingredients thoroughly. [3] X Research source Shake the cocktail shaker hard enough that you can hear the ice rattling around inside."

    {
      "title": "Strain the mixture into a highball glass.",
      "content": "Strain the mixture into a highball glass. Use a cocktail strainer to hold the ice back as you pour the drink into the glass. Alternatively, hold a strainer over the glass, then pour the drink through it. [4] X Research source If you don't have a highball glass, any tall glass will do. Adding a few ice cubes to the glass will help the drink stay cool."

      "title": "Garnish the drink.",
      "content": "Garnish the drink. Garnish the drink by placing an orange slice on the rim. [5] X Research source If you prefer, however, you can add a maraschino cherry instead. You can also garnish with a cocktail umbrella to give the drink a nice touch."

      "title": "Pour the vodka and liqueurs into a tall glass.",
      "content": "Pour the vodka and liqueurs into a tall glass. You will need 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of vodka, 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of melon liqueur, and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of raspberry liqueur . Traditionally, Sex on the Beach drinks are served in highball glasses, but any big glass will do. Hold off on the pineapple juice for now; don't add it in just yet."

      "title": "Mix your ingredients with a spoon.",
      "content": "Mix your ingredients with a spoon. Keep stirring them until the color is consistent. This will create the base for your cocktail; you'll be adding the pineapple juice on top. If your ingredients aren't already chilled, add a few cubes of ice to the glass to cool them."

    {
      "title": "Add the pineapple juice on top.",
      "content": "Add the pineapple juice on top. Use just enough juice to enough to fill the glass to the brim. This should come out to around 8 tablespoons (115 mL), but the exact amount may vary depending on the size of your glass. You may not end up using all 8 tablespoons (115 mL) of pineapple juice. In some cases, you might end up having to use more! Pour the pineapple juice in slowly and close to the surface of the vodka solution. This will help create a layered look."

You will also need a dash of grapefruit juice, a dash of lime juice, and a splash of grenadine syrup. A cocktail shaker looks like a glass or tumbler made out of metal. Don't use an actual glass for this, as it might break. The order in which you add the ingredients doesn't matter."

      "content": "Fill the shaker three quarters of the way with large ice cubes. Use the larger cubes that come from a standard ice cube tray. Avoid the smaller ones, as they will melt faster and dilute the drink. [6] X Research source Add bigger chunks of ice that are around 1 by 2 inches (2.5 by 5.1 cm) work better than smaller chunks because they won't dilute the drink's flavor."

Make sure you can hear the ice rattling inside the shaker, as this is an indication you're shaking it hard enough. [7] X Research source Hold the lid tightly against the top of the shaker with 1 hand while you use your other hand to support the bottom. This will help prevent leaks."
