Trying to get a girlfriend just to look cool in front of you friends isn't fair to yourself, and it's certainly not fair to her. If there's a girl you have your eye on, make sure you want to be with her because you like her for who she really is. In the end, nothing else should matter as much."

      "content": "Be mature for your age. [1] X Research source As a general rule, girls mature faster than boys, and things tend to stay that way until the end of being a teenager. With that in mind, throwing spitballs and acting like a clown isn't going to impress girls very much. You're going to have to act like a grown-up to prove to any girl that you're worth taking seriously as a boyfriend. You can still goof off with your friends, but try to make a point of acting grown-up in most other areas in life. This includes getting good grades and being punctual for school. If you're having trouble figuring out how to act like an adult, pick a couple of male role models in your life and try to take after them. They could be a father, uncle, teacher, anyone, so long as they're responsible and show a lot of maturity."

Once you think you've got the maturity down pat, make your existence known to her. While you might be wondering how you should go about it, usually the simplest approach is the best one. Here's a few examples: Go up and say \"Hi!\" casually. this is the simplest thing you can do, and it's usually the best. Most girls are bound to feel pretty flattered by the fact you're giving them the attention. Ask an ice-breaking question. Asking a casual question is a good way to start conversation with someone.

Following up your introduction with a quick compliment is good, because it immediately shows you're interested in her.

      "content": "Find opportunities to spend time together. [4] X Research source Once you're on speaking terms with the girl, you should find opportunities to get to know her better. This can be very easy if you go to the same school as her. If you're in the same classes, make a point of sitting next to her-- that way, you two can collaborate on class projects. Sitting down together at lunch is good too, as it's a casual way to get to know each other."

All of these things will help you understand who she is. In turn, telling her about yourself will give her a better idea of what a unique and amazing person you are. Be patient with this process. You shouldn't be going into this purely to get a girlfriend. Instead, you should be focusing in on getting to know her. Enjoy spending time with her! She'll be able to sense if you're just talking to her because you want a girlfriend. In this time, you may well find that you're not as interested in her anymore as you thought you were. If this happens, don't try to force it to go any further; some girls you meet are going to be best kept as just friends."

If you're not part of the same social circles, find an opportunity to spend time with them. That could mean asking to go with them to the mall, or even just sitting with their group at lunch if you go to the same school. While you want to get to know her friends, make sure not to pay more attention to them than her. This is especially important if her friends are girls. If you give them too much attention, she might get the wrong impression you've got a crush on one of them!"

      "content": "Ask her out when the time is right. [5] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019. This is a pretty crucial moment. Most of the time, if asking out a girl goes wrong, it's because it was rushed, or happened too soon. By the time you tell the girl how you feel, it should already be obvious to the two of you that you like each other. With that in mind, you shouldn't try asking unless you already have a pretty good idea she'll say yes. Keep in mind that someone saying they like you would put you on the spot, too. Even if she does like you, she might get scared or feel awkward with that. Don't be too alarmed if she says something like that; keep hanging out with her and being her friend. If she sees that sincerity in you, she'll probably become a lot more comfortable and say yes in time. Of course, there are other situations where it will be plainly obvious she isn't interested. This isn't always to do with you; there are lots of reasons a girl might not want to date someone. If that happens, you should shrug it off, think about your best qualities, and keep your eyes peeled for a new girl to connect with."

      "content": "Show your new girlfriend care and respect. The most important thing in a new relationship is to prove that the way you were acting before wasn't just an act. You have to be just as mature and respectful. While some of the stress should be gone now that you both know you have feelings for each other, it's not time to start slacking off. Be courteous and patient with her. Never try to get her to do something she isn't comfortable with; it's much better to take it slow and easy. If you show the same maturity throughout, her feelings for you will grow."

You should be even more interested in what she has to say, now that she's become a significant part of your life. If she's earned your trust, you shouldn't be afraid to tell her secrets. A crucial part of a good relationship is the mutual emotional support, and that can't happen if you're just trying to look cool in front of her."

A girlfriend's family is bound to be very judgmental of a new boyfriend at first, so it's important you prove them wrong. Look them in the eye, smile lots, and let them know they don't have to worry that she'll be spending a lot of time with you. Don't be afraid to introduce her to your family as well! Even if it's coming over for dinner, showing her a different side of your life is important."
