      "content": "Make your initial fingerboard template. You can do this by tracing the outline of a band-aid on index cards or other thick paper. Using a pencil can help if you have an unsteady hand as you want the tracing to be as close to the original shape of the band-aid as possible."

      "title": "Shape your fingerboard.",
      "content": "Shape your fingerboard. The easiest and most reliable way to do this is by using two fingerboards as a mold. Otherwise, you can shape it using your hands. If you already have two fingerboards, you can sandwich your fingerboards between them and apply pressure for ten minutes. Alternatively, you can tie a rubber band tightly around the three stacked fingerboards and leave it to set. If you do not have any fingerboards, turn up the ends of your paper fingerboard using your hands to create the skateboard-like shape desired. Continue applying pressure with your fingers to make sure the ends stay curved up as the glue sets."

      "title": "Wait for the glue to set.",
      "content": "Wait for the glue to set. Allow your fingerboard to dry for at least twenty minutes or until it feels stiff."

      "title": "Punch holes into the fingerboard.",
      "content": "Punch holes into the fingerboard. You will use these holes to thread through the screws to attach the trucks onto your fingerboard. Use a nail, thumbtack, or other pointed object to punch four holes in two rows on either end of the fingerboard, totaling eight holes. Begin by aligning the trucks with each other on the bottom end of your fingerboard and marking where the four screw holes are located on each truck with a pen. Then punch through the markings with your sharp object of choice."

      "title": "Apply griptape.",
      "content": "Apply griptape. You can buy griptape or make your own by cutting a small strip of sandpaper. Griptape is the friction tape on top of the deck that allows you to control and do neat tricks with your fingerboard. It’s not essential but will help upgrade your fingerboard to a functional object. You can estimate what size sandpaper to cut out by comparing it to your board. You want a rectangular strip that covers most of the board but doesn’t stick over the sides."

      "content": "Attach the screws and trucks. This final step will make your fingerboard fully functional. Because these parts are very small, it is best to invest in some tech deck tools, which are easily found online or in skate shops and toy stores [1] X Research source . Using a tech deck screwdriver or your fingers, push the screws into the holes through the top of the fingerboard. Repeat the process until you have eight screws in your board, then flip your fingerboard over and place the trucks on top of the screws. Keeping the trucks placed over the screws, flip the fingerboard on its side and continue tightening the screws until the trucks are firmly attached."
