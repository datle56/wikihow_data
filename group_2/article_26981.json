      "content": "Choose your chocolate. The fact of the matter is that chocolate is not the same. Melting chocolate is your best bet and will yield the most consistent results, but any chocolate will probably be delicious, even if it doesn't cooperate like you want it to. Cocoa mass pistols and tempered chocolate buttons are good choices, too. Milk chocolate and white chocolate don't handle as easily, but clearly taste is more important than anything. [1] X Research source However, do know that chocolate for eating should have around 70-75% cocoa content—more and it'll taste bitter. Bittersweet chocolate comes in at around 65% and is great for most recipes. Chocolate that's 85% and over is good for baking. [2] X Research source But in white chocolate's defense? You can add oil-based food coloring to it for pretty colors!"

      "content": "Break the chocolate bar into pieces and put them into the bowl. If the chocolate is just one giant mass, it will not melt evenly. It'll start scorching on the sides and be cold as day in the center. So break your bar into bite-size chunks unless you want a goopy, chocolatey mess on your hands."

      "title": "Melt the chocolate in the microwave.",
      "content": "Melt the chocolate in the microwave. Put it on half power for 1 minute, stirring right after. It won't be melted, so don't expect it to be. Keep repeating this process until it's melted. You'll know when it's done when it drips from your spoon in a stream, like a syrup. This cannot be overstressed: do not overcook your chocolate . This 1 minute on half power thing is for a reason. If you check it at periodic intervals, stirring each time, never going overboard, you'll never go beyond the point of no return. So be patient! Though this shouldn't be an issue, make sure you don't get any water into the chocolate—not a single drop. If it gets into contact with water, it'll become grainy and gross. Using white chocolate and food coloring? Add a few drops in now!"

      "content": "Choose your tools. You now have the chocolate world at your fingertips. What's in your kitchen? You can use cookie cutters, chocolate molds, or even make your own stencils with poster board and a sharp knife. When it comes to cookie cutters, try to stick to ones that are more rounded. The more points they have, the more likely the chocolate will break off. Whatever you're using, make sure it'll stand up to the heat—or switch up your methodology. No one way is better than the other."

      "title": "Choose your methodology.",
      "content": "Choose your methodology. This will largely depend on your tools, but here's the breakdown: Using molds? Simply pour your melted chocolate directly into clean, ungreased molds. Tap the molds on a hard surface to remove the air bubbles and pop 'em into the freezer. When the molds become misty, take them out and remove the chocolates by tapping. Using plastic cookie cutters? You'll want to let the chocolate cool ever so slightly (so, so slightly) before pouring it into the cutters. Place them on a baking sheet lined with wax paper, pour, and then pop them into the freezer or fridge until hard. Using metal cookie cutters? You have two options: Option 1 : Pour the chocolate directly into the cutters on a lined baking sheet. Tap to remove bubbles, freeze, and tap to remove from cutters. Option 2 : Pour the chocolate onto a baking pan lined with wax paper, shaking a bit to even out the layer of chocolate. Chill or leave on the counter to harden. Then heat up your cutters over your stove and start making shapes! Using your own stencil? Follow option two above, substituting the cutter for your stencil (but don't heat the stencil up). Just place the stencil over your pan of chocolate, cutting around it with a sharp knife."

      "content": "Choose your chocolate. With the variety of chocolates available, it's safe to assume that all kinds bake slightly differently. Here's a few basics: Melting chocolate is clearly best (hence why they call it melting chocolate). White chocolate and milk chocolate sometimes don't handle well. If you're new to the melting game, start with something easier. A good percentage of cocoa is around 70-75%. Much more and it gets bitter and is better for baking."

      "content": "Get out your double boiler . The best part about this method is that it prevents scorching. Wahoo! The microwave is much quicker but it's rather precarious; with the double boiler, unless you're cursed, your chocolate should be fine. In the bottom of your double boiler, place enough water until it hits about an 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) below the upper pan. Put the double boiler over low heat, heating the water."

      "title": "Shave or cut your chocolate into chunks and place 2/3 of it into the double boiler.",
      "content": "Shave or cut your chocolate into chunks and place 2/3 of it into the double boiler. The smaller your bits of chocolate, the faster it'll melt (and with the double boiler method, you're already looking at 15-20 minutes). Fill the top of the double boiler (the level not touching the water) with as much chocolate as you need. And keep stirring! This is perhaps the most important note of all: do not let the chocolate come into contact with even a single drop of water . If you do, it'll get grainy and, quite frankly, disgusting. So watch out! Don't be tempted to up the heat. Keeping it on low will result in a smooth chocolate that has a glossy sheen when it's cooled."

      "title": "Bust out the thermometer.",
      "content": "Bust out the thermometer. You want to bring the chocolate to around 100-105°F (38°C), but not higher. Once it hits that point, remove the bowl from the heat and add in the rest of your chocolate, which should knock down the overall temperature to about 90°F (32°C). Keep stirring. When it's all melted, you're ready to start molding! If you don't have a candy thermometer, you'll probably be just fine. Just take the chocolate off the heat when it's thoroughly melted and all stirred up. Give it a second to cool before you place it into your molds. If you're using white chocolate and would like to color it, add a few drops of oil-based food coloring at this stage."

If it doesn't look right, just cool it and temper it again. That's the great thing about chocolate—it can take just about anything!"

Silicone or metal will be fine, but be careful with plastic—it can warp if it gets exposed to extreme temperatures for too long. Be sure to tap the molds once full to even out the chocolate and get rid of any air pockets. Alternatively, you can spread the chocolate onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Shake it a bit and tap it to remove any bubbles and allow it to chill in the fridge or on the counter. Then you simply heat up your metal cookie cutters over your gas stove or carve out your shapes however you like. You can take your pan of chocolate and use posterboard as a stencil! Then just cut around it. What are your fine motor skills like?"

Are you eating this chocolate? You'll want to keep it around 70-75% cocoa. Any more and it'll be rather bitter (but if you like bitter, go for it). At around 85%, it's best for baking."

This method is outlined in detail in method 1 above, but the long and short of it is this: put your chocolate in small chunks in the microwave on half power in one minute intervals, stirring periodically to prevent scorching. In a double boiler . This method is outlined in detail in method 2 above, but the long and short of it is this: put your chocolate in small chunks in the double boiler over low heat, stirring frequently. This method takes longer, but the chances of scorching are minimal at worst. Over the stovetop. Over low heat, place your chocolate into a saucepan, stirring regularly. Keep an eye on it as this method is particularly dangerous. Too long or too hot and your chocolate can burn."

If you like the side of a plate idea, draw the shape directly onto the plate and then chill it in the fridge. These make great \"nametags\" too! Get creative."
