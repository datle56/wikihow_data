      "content": "Add 40 fluid ounces (1,200 mL) of olive oil to your slow cooker on high heat. First, use a measuring cup to measure out and pour 40 fluid ounces (1,200 mL) of olive oil into your slow cooker. Then, turn the slow cooker on high to heat the oil. [2] X Research source While traditional castile soap only uses olive oil, you can use additional vegetable oils in place of some of the olive oil as well. For example, you can replace 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) of the olive oil with 16 ounces (450 g) of coconut oil for an extra hydrating and cleaning liquid soap. You can also replace some of the olive oil with hemp oil or jojoba oil to help fight skin inflammation and redness. Just make sure that the amount of oil used still adds up to 40 fluid ounces (1,200 mL)."

[3] X Research source Then, ventilate your space by turning on the vent hood and opening 1 or 2 windows. Direct contact to potassium hydroxide lye flakes, and even exposure due to lack of ventilation, can burn your skin and even cause blindness if it gets in your eyes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix the potassium hydroxide lye flakes with distilled water. Use a measuring cup to pour 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) of distilled water into a large glass mixing bowl. Then, measure out 9 ounces (260 g) of potassium hydroxide lye flakes and add them carefully to the distilled water. Use a silicone spatula to mix the lye solution, stirring slowly and carefully until the flakes are completely dissolved. You can buy potassium hydroxide lye flakes online and at some apothecary stores. Using distilled water is necessary because the pH and mineral content of tap water varies from one place to another. This can greatly impact the chemical reactions during the soap-making process, as well as its purity and cleaning ability. [5] X Research source If you want the castile soap to be even more moisturizing, you can add 8 ounces (230 g) of glycerin to the lye solution. [6] X Research source"

First, use your spatula to stir the oil that’s been heating up in the slow cooker to make sure it’s warm and mixed, if you used more than 1 type of oil. Then, carefully pour the lye solution into the slow cooker, adding it slowly so the solution doesn’t splash. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an immersion blender to blend the oil and lye together. Place the end of your immersion blender into the slow cooker. Then, turn it on the medium setting and blend the liquids for about 5 minutes, moving the blender around in the slow cooker to make sure all the oils and lye solution are mixed. [8] X Research source After 5 minutes, the mixture will turn more opaque and begin to thicken into a pudding-like consistency."

      "content": "Cover the soap and cook it for 3 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Once the soap mixture thickens, set the timer on your slow cooker for 3 hours. Cover the slow cooker with the lid, returning to stir the mixture every 30 minutes with a silicone spatula. [9] X Research source This will ensure that the soap ingredients don’t separate as they cook in the slow cooker. As the soap cooks, it will become increasingly more translucent. If your slow cooker’s high heat setting doesn’t get very hot, you may need to cook the mixture for up to 5 hours."

      "content": "Add 1 ⁄ 2 ounce (14 g) of the soap mixture to hot water to test the clarity. After about 3 hours, check to see if the soap looks translucent with a gel-like consistency. If it does, use a measuring spoon to transfer 1 ⁄ 2 ounce (14 g) of the soap mixture into 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of hot water. If the soap melts and remains translucent, it’s ready to be diluted. If it’s still cloudy, cook the soap mixture in the slow cooker for another 30 minutes before performing the clarity test again."

Then, heat the water on the stove until it just starts to boil. Since the soap mixture and slow cooker will be hot, using hot water will keep your slow cooker pot from cracking as the result of an instant temperature change."

Leave the soap to liquefy for about 8 hours or overnight.
