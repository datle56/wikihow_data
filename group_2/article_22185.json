      "title": "Open your devotion with prayer.",
      "content": "Open your devotion with prayer. Your devotion is a time that you should spend listening for God’s guidance in your life, so it’s important to approach it with a humble, open attitude. Before you even begin your devotion, start with a prayer asking God to share His wisdom with you. [1] X Research source The Bible says in James 4:8, “Come near to God and He will come near to you.” By reaching out to God at the beginning of your devotion, you’ll be more likely to feel His presence. For example, you might pray something like, “Dear God, please help me understand Your message today. Send me the Scriptures I need to help me make the best decisions throughout my day.\""

      "title": "Read a passage from the Bible during your devotion.",
      "content": "Read a passage from the Bible during your devotion. The best way to hear God’s message for you is through His Word. There’s no right or wrong way to read your Bible, although it can be helpful to read an entire passage or chapter to ensure you read each verse in its intended context. However, it’s fine if you want to read the Bible straight through, you can skip around to different books of the Bible, or you can follow a guided reading plan, if you prefer. [2] X Research source Try highlighting or underlining verses that seem significant to you when you read them. Then, when you re-read that passage, it will be a reminder of a time that God spoke to you in a special way. If you’d like some extra guidance during your devotions, try looking for a book of devotionals that you find relevant. For instance, you might purchase a book of devotionals that are geared toward students, mothers, or husbands. You can also find daily devotionals online."

      "title": "Reflect on what you read and how it applies to your life.",
      "content": "Reflect on what you read and how it applies to your life. Once you finish reading your Bible passage, take a few moments to really absorb the meaning of the words. Try to find a way to connect them to your life personally, and think about how that relates to your relationship with God. For instance, if you’re reading the story of Jonah, don’t just picture a man inside the belly of a whale. Imagine how it feels to be facing a situation that seems completely hopeless, and reflect on a time you might have felt that way. Think about how God brought you out of that situation, the same way He brought Jonah to dry land. You don't have to stop meditating on God's word just because your devotion is over! Allow His wisdom to guide you all throughout your day."

      "title": "Try keeping a journal so you can look back on your spiritual journey.",
      "content": "Try keeping a journal so you can look back on your spiritual journey. While you don’t have to keep a journal to have a personal devotion, it can be a good way to help you organize your thoughts, and it can provide a touching way for you to track your spiritual growth over time. You might jot down your thoughts about what you’re reading, prayers for yourself and others, or some of your favorite Bible verses. Just as with any other journal, the way you keep a devotion journal will be extremely personal, so don’t feel like it has to fit any particular format."

      "title": "Sing a hymn if you enjoy worshipping that way.",
      "content": "Sing a hymn if you enjoy worshipping that way. If you find that singing hymns help you feel closer to God, try incorporating them into your devotion routine. The Bible encourages God’s followers to praise Him with song, such as in Psalm 105:2, “Sing to Him, sing praises to Him, tell of all His wondrous works!” Singing can help quiet your spirit while expressing your love for God. [3] X Research source It’s okay if you feel a little self-conscious at first. Just remember that you’re singing as a form of worship, and not to impress anyone else."

      "title": "Close your devotion with prayer.",
      "content": "Close your devotion with prayer. Ending your devotion with prayer is a good way to ensure that you’ll feel close to God throughout your day. You can pray about whatever you like—you might want to praise God, ask Him to help you with a problem you’re having, or even pray for other people. [4] X Research source In 1 Thessalonians 5:17, the Bible tells us to “Pray without ceasing.” This means you should always keep God in your thoughts, and you can talk to Him whenever you want. However, it’s still helpful to set aside certain times for more specific, intentional prayers."

      "title": "Set aside the same time every day.",
      "content": "Set aside the same time every day. In order for your devotions to really impact your day-to-day life, it’s important to be consistent. If you want to have a devotion every day, it’s helpful to do it at the same time each day. Pick a time, and treat it like an important appointment—try your best not to schedule anything else during that time. Many people prefer to have their devotions early in the morning so they can start the day focused on their relationship with God. However, others prefer having their devotion in the evening before bed so they can reflect on everything that happened during the day. Find the time that works best for you. Your devotion doesn’t have to be very long—start by setting aside 10-15 minutes a day. It’s okay to be flexible. If you have something important you have to do when you’d normally do your devotion, try to find another time during the day to do it instead. However, even if you miss a day, you can just pick up where you left off the next day."

      "title": "Find a place that's quiet and free of distractions.",
      "content": "Find a place that's quiet and free of distractions. In order to be really focused on God’s word, it’s important that you don’t have a lot of noise or chaos going on around you. Pick a quiet spot where you’ll feel comfortable, and make sure to turn off the TV, radio, or anything else that might distract you. In Psalm 46:10, the Bible says, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" If you’re quiet and relaxed, you’ll be more likely to feel His presence around you."

      "title": "Ask your family members to respect your quiet time.",
      "content": "Ask your family members to respect your quiet time. If you live with other people, they might unintentionally interrupt you when you’re trying to have your devotion. Try letting them know that you’d like a little time each day to read your Bible and pray, and tell them when you plan to do it. That way, they’ll at least be aware of what you’re doing, and they might be more likely to wait until you’re finished before they come talk to you. For instance, you might say something like, “Hey Mom, I’d really like to start doing a devotion every day when I wake up. Do you think you could help keep my little brother from coming in the room until after about 7:15?”"

      "title": "Don't feel like you have to follow a set guideline for your devotion.",
      "content": "Don't feel like you have to follow a set guideline for your devotion. A devotion isn't a set of rules and routines, but a chance to have a closer relationship with God. Your devotion might not look exactly like anyone else's, and that's okay—God created you to be unique, and He loves you for who you are. [5] X Research source Try not to think of it as a chore, but a chance to deepen your relationship with Him."
