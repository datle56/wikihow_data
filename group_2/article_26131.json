The skills needed to stay in subzero Alaska versus the woods of mainland Europe versus the Sahara Desert are all incredibly different. [2] X Research source Think of these vary basic things first: What time of year would make it easiest to get started? How many supplies would you need to start off with? Would you have access to civilization? How far away would it be? How does this change your situation? Try to buy a map of where you are going (if you can) before you leave. Do you have the skills to survive in the terrain/climate you're considered? Do you need time to adapt your body? (to extreme weather, for example)"

It all depends on where you're going, but odds are you'll need to be in shape (so start exercising now) and will need some basic backpacking techniques mastered, too. Get the skills down you think you'll need, and don't forget first aid! Consider doing crazier things, like learning to eat insects and grubs. Then, if you're in a sticky spot, you'll be more likely to succeed."

      "content": "Bring the right clothes. Three rules: cotton kills, friends don't let friends wear cotton, and cotton is rotten. You want to have clothes that retain their warmth even after they're wet. You want clothes that can survive wear and tear. Cotton, though it's light and comfortable, is not the way to go. Pack your bags with clothing made for loggers, surveyors and commercial fisherman. It's going to be heavy, but it's going to last. Remember: you can always take layers off if you get hot. It's better to have too many clothes than to not have enough, after all. If something happens to one, you'll have something else equally as warm. Marino wool is very insulating and cannot easily get wet. Some jackets are made of Marino, so try to get your hands on one of them. Get a shell jacket and pants for rain and snow. Most cases of hypothermia happen in temperatures under 40 °F (4 °C). [3] X Research source"

You're best off if you have some type of training before you venture into the fight of you versus Mother Nature. Contact local wilderness groups or adventure-based organizations to rack up some useful experiences to your name. The more you know what to experience, the easier it'll be. Learn to identify poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, death caps, and yellow stainers, in addition to other poisonous plants and mushrooms (and avoid them). What's more, there are some plants (cow parsnip) whose sap makes your skin hyper photosensitive. That is, the sun will cause your skin to painfully blister. It's best to know your terrain to the best of your ability. And the calmer you'll be able to stay, which is of utmost importance. If you've seen a situation before, you'll know what to do and you'll be able to relax. If you're nervous and unsure, it's possible you could make a grave mistake. Getting trained is a way to avoid future mishaps."

You'll need plenty of supplies for your home-base, but you'll also need to figure out what you can pack with you on the go. Get a sturdy, legitimate camping pack that you can depend on for when you need to venture outside. Pack your backpack before you leave to see how much it can carry. Get familiar with how you can pack it to the brim and still be able to carry it. Even packing skills come in handy in the wilderness."

Here are a few details: Build a fire away from your valuables and away from your food supply, should anything go wrong (animals included). When you cook with fire, do not use a flame right away, but instead build a fire and let it sit. You should build a fire long before you eat. In the process of building a fire, you create a hot bed of coals which will create an open flame. This open flame will allow you to burn your food to a black crisp. Look for birch bark to start a fire. Birch bark, wet or dry, is highly flammable and is great for starting fires in wet or cold locations. Burning hemlock bows keeps away flies and mosquitoes."

For the first week or so, have a basic structure you can sleep in. Spend that time building something more permanent. The longer you plan on being out there, the better built it should be. It is highly recommended to never sleep on bare ground, and to always make the floor of your shelter something like hemlock bows, leaves or hay; if you do not make the floor of the shelter with hemlock bows, leaves or hay, you will freeze when you sleep on the dirt."

If you can, get your water in massive quantities so you don't have to keep going back day in and day out. Also, you can collect morning dew from grasses and leaves with a clean cloth (rag) and squeeze it out into a container. It may not be the cleanest, but it will help to keep you hydrated."

Tap into all your resources: rivers full of fish, animals in the sky and on the ground, and the plants and mushrooms that surround you. The more skills you have, the better off you'll be when the climate changes or when certain resources run dry. Do not eat any plants or mushrooms unless you know that they are edible. If you can, bring a book discussing the flora and fauna of your local. Or start your own garden. As a general rule - if you kill an animal when it is acting normally, then it should be safe for you to eat it. Ensure that you have the knowledge and resources to preserve meat and fish so that it does not spoil. Do not attempt to eat an animal that appears visibly sick or is dead when you find it. Have a good storage system, too. There may be scavengers in your area that pose a threat to your food stock."

You never know if a freshwater system is actually clean (for instance, there could be a dead animal upstream from you), so purify all your water. [10] X Research source The easiest method is to boil your water. It should take about 10 minutes. Another is to use iodine tablets ( not liquid iodine from the drug store). Use the iodine tablets according to directions that are provided on the label. A third method is to use a water filter. Pre-filter the water with a bandana or other piece of material. Then use the filter on that dirty water. The minimum size filter you need is 1 or 2 micron. This allows particles of 1 or 2 micron in size to pass through the filter. The smaller the micron size, the better the filter, and the slower the water will come out. A gravity filter is easiest, if you can bring one with you. You pour the water in, do more chores, and an hour or two later return to find fresh water."

This can be in the form of a hole in the ground or something less temporary, like an outhouse. If you've constructed an outhouse or similar structure, know that in winter, your butt will freeze to wood. Use styrofoam over your toilet seat to avoid a rather unfortunate event from happening."

Surprisingly, even just walking in a straight line is nearly impossible (humans tend to walk in circles inadvertently). The most basic way to avoid this is to line up landmarks, which is called \"marking\" and \"backmarking\" (turning around and making sure your backmark is directly behind you). You can use trees, the moon, and the sun to navigate, too. If you're the type that has an internal compass, this will come easy to you."

Pemmican requires no cooking (just drying) and if you have enough fat in the mix, will sustain you longer than any other \"survival food\".

Animals will be harder to find, walking around will be harder to do, and just staying warm will be difficult to maintain. When fall comes around, make sure you're stocked up. Keep a few months' supply of food on hand, if at all possible. If you have access to a meat freezer, then try to shoot a deer or large game animal in the late fall. The same goes firewood.

If you don't have your own source (like dried Tang powder), rose hips work. They're not the tastiest, but they work. Pine needles are awesome too. They actually have more vitamin C than citrus fruits. Just cut some up and boil them to a tea, but watch out not to use needles from yew (taxus) trees, because they are poisonous. [14] X Research source Your diet is essential to your survival. The more balanced it is, the better. Try to get all your major food groups so you can stay strong and healthy.

If you don't know how to predict the weather, you'll venture off whenever you see fit. But if you do, you may be able to predict that a storm is coming and wait it out – or do it as quickly as possible. This means detecting changes in air pressure, recognizing cloud systems, and even noticing smaller things, like how the smoke is rising from your fire (swirling smoke is not good). Animals can give you signals, too."

Once you've abandoned the life of money, status, and 9-5 jobs, going back may seem like more of a feat than leaving. For some, it is mentally compromising. Carefully weigh your options as logically as possible if you're considering a transition. You may want to take small steps. Moving to a farm or a rural area may be better than trying to go back to city life, at least immediately. Don't give a shock to your system if you don't have to. Baby steps will make it easier."
