      "title": "Put butter, oil, corn syrup, salt and food coloring in a bowl.",
      "content": "Put butter, oil, corn syrup, salt and food coloring in a bowl. Microwave just until the butter is melted, or about 40-50 seconds. Stir to combine well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour popcorn kernels into a bowl.",
      "content": "Pour popcorn kernels into a bowl. Stir to coat each kernel with mixture. This results in every piece of popcorn having the color and flavor cooked on it as it pops. Even out the kernels in the bottom of bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the bowl with the vented lid and microwave on high for 3-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the bowl with the vented lid and microwave on high for 3-5 minutes. This should equate to about 1-2 seconds between pops. The time will vary depending on your microwave and bowl, so you may need some trial-and-error on the first batch or two to figure out how long it takes the popcorn to cook. If you cook it too long, it will burn, smoke and stink, so keep a close watch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Immediately spoon the popcorn onto a waxed or parchment paper lined baking sheet.",
      "content": "Immediately spoon the popcorn onto a waxed or parchment paper lined baking sheet. Leave the unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl. This will keep it from sticking to the bottom of the bowl as it cools. There will be some of the cooked syrup mixture in the bottom of the bowl, along with some unpopped kernels. If you turn the bowl upside down and dump the popcorn onto the baking sheet, those unpopped kernels will end up stuck to the popcorn. Nobody wants that."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store in airtight container.",
      "content": "Store in airtight container. A resealable plastic bag works, too. However, it's best eaten within a couple of days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.",
      "content": "Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Then add the sugar, corn syrup, cream of tartar and salt. Then, kick it up a notch to medium-high and bring it all to a boil. Dissolve the sugar by stirring constantly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add in the food coloring and stop stirring (once at a boil).",
      "content": "Add in the food coloring and stop stirring (once at a boil). Set the timer for 5 minutes and walk away -- don't cave to the temptation to stir it. The mixture should be at about 250-260째F (121째C). Or, during this five minutes, pop your popcorn. Put into a bowl and remove any unpopped kernels from the bowl afterward -- you won't be needing them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take it off the stove and stir in the vanilla and baking soda.",
      "content": "Take it off the stove and stir in the vanilla and baking soda. While it's still foaming, quickly pour the mixture over the popcorn (which should be in a bowl by now) and gently stir thoroughly to coat it as evenly as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the coated popcorn onto a cookie sheet.",
      "content": "Place the coated popcorn onto a cookie sheet. Use parchment paper or cooking spray to ensure it'll come off easily (and make for easier clean up). If using a roaster would be easier, that's also a viable option. Bake it at 200째 F (93째C) for 1 hour, keeping an eye on it and stirring every 15 minutes."
