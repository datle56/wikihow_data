      "content": "Sun water is water that’s charged in the sun for spiritual healing and spells. The sun’s cosmic energy is infused in the water, making it the perfect channel for spells, cleansing, and healing rituals. Once charged, sun water holds positive, encouraging, and uplifting properties that can be used to douse negative energy and strengthen self-confidence. The sun’s spirit is thought to be a physical force in witchcraft. Sun water can aid in physical well-being, rebirth, and anything ego-related. Moon water is the polar opposite of sun water, as it’s charged under the moon and represents emotional well-being."

      "content": "Fill a clear glass jar with water. Opt for a container with a resealable lid, such as a mason jar. This will help keep outside elements out of your freshwater. [1] X Research source The container must be glass and clear for the water to take in all the sun’s energy. The sun’s rays are full-spectrum, and a colored container or glass would block the light from charging the water. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the jar of water in your hands and set an intention.",
      "content": "Hold the jar of water in your hands and set an intention. Ask yourself what you want from the universe and turn that want into a mantra. Take the jar of water in your hands and close your eyes, visualizing what you want as you speak your mantra into existence. For example, your intention might be “I am courageous,” “I make peace with change,” or “I have a happy and healthy life.” Stay away from “I want,” “I need,” and “I hope” statements. Although you want something from the universe, you have to imagine it like it’s already happened. Setting an intention on sun water is very similar to the practice of charging crystals with intentions."

      "content": "Set the jar of water in a sunny area. This could be on a sun-filled windowsill or outside on the ground. All in all, the perfect spot is one in direct sunlight. [3] X Research source If you choose to place your water outside, consider resting it on sand, gravel, dirt, or rock. These materials conduct the Earth’s natural energy, so your water will be charged with sun and earth elements! [4] X Research source Sun water will take on the properties of the astrological sun it’s under. For example, if you charge water under a Capricorn sun, it’ll have driven and ambitious characteristics on top of its sun characteristics."

      "content": "Leave the water to charge for at least 3 hours. You’ve filled your glass, set your intention, and know all that’s left to do is wait for it to charge. The water will be charged in 3 hours, but it’s recommended to leave it out for longer. Try leaving it out from dawn till dusk on one or multiple days. [5] X Research source If you want to leave your water outside in the sun for more than one day, remember to bring it inside when the sun starts to set. You don’t want the moon’s energy affecting your sun water. [6] X Research source"

Try taking a few sips of sun water when you’re feeling low or need a quick pick me up. Its positive energy will help balance any negative energies. [7] X Research source Remember, sun water takes on characteristics of the astrological season. If you take a sip of sun water charged under a Virgo sun, you may feel more productive and organized. If you’re planning to drink your sun water, make sure the water you originally filled your glass container with is clean and safe to drink."

When a crystal is put in sun-charged water, the energy within the crystal is released, cleansing it . Consider dropping a crystal in a jar of sun water to cleanse it before its next charge. [8] X Research source The energy that’s released from the crystal will be transferred to your sun water, changing the energetic properties of the water."

The positive, warm energy of sun water is a great base for spells or charms that need water, such as a protection spell or enchanted protection charm. [10] X Research source Infused sun water that was used to cleanse crystals can also work when casting spells or performing rituals. Just remember that the water’s energy is now whatever the crystal’s energy was before it was cleansed."
