But if she’s distracted by her phone, watch, or other people around the room, she may not be romantically interested . [2] X Research source"

If she makes an effort to get close enough to you to make some kind of innocent physical contact, she’s most likely trying to tell you that she’s interested in you as more than just a friend. Think about whether she’s ever brushed up against your arm, or lightly touched your knee, chest, or shoulder. [3] X Research source The rest of her body language can give you clues to her level of interest, too. If she leans into you while you’re talking, or if she mirrors your body language, it’s a sign that she’s probably into you. Consider how her body language and gestures differ when she’s around you versus when she’s around other people. If she tends to be physically expressive around everyone, look for some other signs of her interest, like if she teases you playfully or pays you extra attention."

Look for detailed replies and new messages at least every other day or so. If you’re also excited to respond right away with a similarly detailed response and you’ve been having long, in-depth conversations over text or social media, it’s a good sign that she’d want to spend more time with you in the real world. If she remembers the little details you’ve told her and brings them up in later conversations, or says something reminded her of you, it’s a good sign that she likes you.

If she says something about a future date idea, like, “you and I should go see that movie when it comes out next summer,” it means she wants to spend time with you and wants you to stick around for a while. Or test the waters by talking about hypothetical hangouts to gauge her level of interest. If she’s bummed out about her busy weekend, say something like, “That’s too bad. If you were free you could come to the game with me instead.” While this date idea is impossible, her response can reveal a lot about how interested she would be in going out with you another time. Notice whether she talks about you both as a unit with words like “us” or “we,” or whether she refers to a larger friend group. For instance, “You and I should go!” means she’d like to go with you; “We should all go!” suggests that she likes you as a friend."
