Ask him for his number , tell him he's cute, point out the things you like about him—it's all part of the give-and-take that will keep him thinking about you. [1] X Research source Gemini is an air sign, and air signs are all about talking. That's why you'll make the biggest impact if you tell him you're into him , rather than just trying to show him through wordless flirting. Try saying something like, \"You're funny, I like you. We should hang out some time.\" Or, you might say, \"You've got a great vibe—I think we'd get along with each other.\""

Every once in a while, wait a bit before you respond to his text, or let the call go to voicemail. Not only will it show him you're out enjoying your life, but it will give him a chance to miss you ! [2] X Research source Don't give him every detail about what you're doing when he's not around. Give him a chance to be intrigued. Be careful not to go too far with being aloof.

      "content": "Keep some details to yourself to make him curious. Geminis are naturally really inquisitive, so be strategic in what you share with your crush. If you leave out a few key pieces of information, he's naturally going to try to fill in the blanks. Eventually, he's going to wonder why he can't stop thinking about you! If you're telling him about the new restaurant you tried, don't mention who you went with, for instance. Another way to seem mysterious is to let him do most of the talking. With a Gemini guy, that should be no problem!"

If you know you're going to be seeing your Gemini guy, try coming up with a couple of thought-provoking questions to chat about. Once he realizes that he never gets bored talking to you, he's sure to be hooked. Ask questions like: \"Would you rather be a cat or a dog?\" (This-or-that questions will appeal to his dual nature.) \"Did you know snails can sleep for up to 3 years at a time?\" \"What's your favorite memory from high school?\" (He definitely won't mind talking about himself.)

      "content": "Geminis are known for being fickle. Your guy may cancel plans at the last minute or invite you out at a moment's notice. He might even seem really into you one day and a little bored the next. Chances are, he's not playing games—that's his dual-sided Gemini nature rearing its indecisive head. Not many people can keep up with that, so if you can roll with the changes, he's going to be seriously impressed. If he calls to cancel a dinner date, for instance, you might say, \"Cool, my friend Krista wanted me to go to a comedy club tonight. I'll just do that instead.\" If he seems a little distant, just give him some space . When he sees you're not chasing him, he'll probably be that much more interested in reaching back out to you."

      "content": "Make sure he feels good when he's with you. The two faces of a Gemini mean your guy might seem a little moody sometimes. Don't let that ruffle you, though. Try to stay pleasant with a quick smile, and avoid lingering too long on serious or heavy topics. If you can be a consistently positive presence in his life, he's definitely going to crave time around you. For instance, if he's surly about a bad day at work, you might bring up a funny story to take his mind off of it. It's okay to open up to him sometimes about tough things, like sharing if you had a bad day at work. Just try to balance that by changing the subject to something positive afterward."

      "content": "Geminis hate to feel restricted. A Gemini guy wants to feel like he's able to do his own thing, when and where he wants, and come back to you when he's ready. If you can give him the space to do this (within reason), he'll be impressed by your self-confidence, and he'll feel like he can be himself when he's with you. That kind of security is sure to keep a Gemini man coming back for more. If he's planning a night out with his buddies, don't act jealous or try to make him stay home. Instead, smile and encourage him to have a great time. Make your own plans when you know he's going to be busy. That way, the two of you will have plenty to talk about when you meet back up—and you know Geminis love to talk!"
