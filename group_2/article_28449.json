      "content": "Wipe down the hooks with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and squeeze it around the back of the earrings. Rinse with clean water and dry with a lint-free cloth. You'll need to take this precaution before you begin to wear the earrings."

      "title": "Use the foil to create a small shape for your earrings.",
      "content": "Use the foil to create a small shape for your earrings. The ball shape works best and is the easiest to make. Use only a small square of foil about the size of your palm to make these balls. If they're too big, the earrings may be too heavy and can hurt your ears."

      "content": "Get creative with glitter, jewels, fuzzy balls, or colorful paint. You can decorate the earrings any way you like! Roll them in glue and then roll them in glitter. Put tiny stickers or sticky jewels on them. Use glue to stick other small decorations on them, such as tiny fuzzy balls. You can also cover the earrings with paint and then add decorations, or just leave them painted a nice, appealing color. If you're using glue to decorate the earrings, give them time to dry before moving on to the next step."

      "content": "Use a toothpick or pin to pierce through the center of each earring. Just position it at the top center of the earring and gently push it down until it goes all the way through."

      "title": "Use pliers or wire cutters to cut two pieces of wire for your earrings.",
      "content": "Use pliers or wire cutters to cut two pieces of wire for your earrings. This wire will hang off the earring hooks and will attach to your earrings, so you can make each piece as long as you want. For dangly earrings, you can cut the wire even longer. If you want the earrings to hang close to your earlobes, then cut the pieces a bit shorter. Gently curl up one end of each piece of wire until it curves back into itself. You'll need this shape to hold up the earring."

    {
      "title": "Hold the curled part of the wire and push the straight part through the hole.",
      "content": "Hold the curled part of the wire and push the straight part through the hole. Once you've pushed it all the way through, curl it around the small hole at the base of the earring hook so that it attaches to the earring hook while firmly holding the earring in place. Repeat this step with the other piece of wire. Simply repeat the steps you took to connect the earring, wire, and hook in the previous step until you have two perfect earrings."

      "content": "Store them in a box if you’re not wearing your earrings right away. To take care of your earrings, store them in a covered jewelry box or cotton bag to prevent scratches. You can even make your own hand-made box to continue the home-made theme."
