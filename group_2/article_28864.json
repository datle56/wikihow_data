      "content": "Measure wood for the stock. You need to have the stock a comfortable length for your arms. [2] X Research source Start with pine board that measures around 38 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. Hold it in your hands similar to a rifle with one end pressed against your shoulder and your hands gripping the wood. Find a comfortable length and mark the wood where you want it cut. The longer your stock is, the more power you will achieve. However, it is not wise to go over 1 meter (3.2 feet) so the PVC bow won't shatter."

      "title": "Mark the area for a trigger.",
      "content": "Mark the area for a trigger. Hold up the wood again as you would a crossbow stock, with one end pressed against your shoulder and your hands gripping the wood. Make a small mark where it feels comfortable to have the trigger and the handle. Draw a rounded rectangle shape in the center of where you marked the trigger. This needs to be drawn on the top of the pine wood, not the side. The rectangle should be around 4 inches long, and 1 inch wide. Make sure the rectangle is drawn in the center of the wood where you have marked it."

      "title": "Cut the rectangle out of the wood.",
      "content": "Cut the rectangle out of the wood. Using a chisel, drill and wood rasp, gouge out the wood within the rectangular area while being very careful not to split the wood. Use a combination of all three tools to slowly remove the wood inside the rectangle until you have a rectangle shaped hole. Use sandpaper to smooth the area around the hole after you have finished."

      "title": "Make the groove to hold the string.",
      "content": "Make the groove to hold the string. The groove will create a place for the string to rest horizontally across the rectangle hole. Use a chisel or wood rasp to create a 1/8 inch groove near the front of the trigger hole. Sand the groove after it is cut."

Find and mark the center of the end of the wood, farthest from the string groove. Find and mark the center of the end of the rectangle hole, farthest from the string groove. Draw a straight line between the two marks. Use a drill, chisel, and hammer to carve a ¼ inch deep channel along the marked line. Sand the groove until completely smooth."

Securely tie one end of the nylon string to the wood screw on the left side of the PVC pipe. Bring the string across to the pulley on the right end of the PVC pipe, and loop it in and around the pulley. Bring the sting back to the left side and loop the string in and around the pulley on the left. Finally, bring the string back to the right and tie it securely to the right wood screw. Do not pull the string tightly when you wrap around the pulleys or you will not be able to pull it back to fire the crossbow."

If the pipe does not bend slightly like a bow would, pull the thread out and start again."

Use a wood rasp or chisel to carve out a rounded groove wide enough to fit the pipe on the end of the wood stock. The groove needs to be deep enough to fit the PVC pipe securely. Carve slowly while repetitively checking how the pipe fits. This will ensure you end up with the perfect fit. The pipe shouldn't have room to move around."

Use duct tape to secure the PVC pipe to the stock by wrapping it around the pipe and the end of the wood stock. Only the firing string coming out of the pulleys should be on top of the wood. The other two strings should be on the bottom so they don't interfere with the firing process."
