      "content": "Soak the cracked wheat. Measure the cracked wheat into a small bowl and cover it with water. Set the wheat aside to soak for about 30 minutes. [1] X Research source After soaking, transfer the cracked wheat to a fine-mesh sieve and rinse it with fresh water. Set the wheat aside to continue draining. Soaking the wheat will help to soften it, and reduce the cooking time."

      "title": "Fry the cumin.",
      "content": "Fry the cumin. Transfer the ghee to a pressure cooker and heat it over medium heat. When the ghee is liquid and hot, add the cumin seeds. Cook the cumin in the ghee for one to two minutes, until it’s fragrant and crackling. Other aromatics you can toast with the cumin include chili powder, mustard, and curry leaves.

      "title": "Add the ginger, onion, and chili.",
      "content": "Add the ginger, onion, and chili. Continue cooking the mixture over medium heat until the onions are slightly soft and the ginger is fragrant.

      "title": "Cook the dalia in the water.",
      "content": "Cook the dalia in the water. Add the salt and water to the pressure cooker and stir the mixture. Secure the pressure cooker lid. Bring the pot to pressure over medium heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the dalia until soft, about 12 minutes, or 7 to 9 whistles on the pressure cooker. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a pressure cooker, you can use a regular saucepan and cook the dalia on the stove. Cook the dalia for about 25 minutes, covered, until the water is absorbed and the wheat is soft."

      "title": "Let the pressure cooker rest.",
      "content": "Let the pressure cooker rest. When the dalia is ready, remove the pressure cooker from the heat and let the pressure drop to zero. When the pressure drops, open the pressure cooker, stir the mixture, and serve the dalia immediately. [7] X Research source Garnish with freshly ground pepper and additional salt, to taste."

      "title": "Roast the cracked wheat in the ghee.",
      "content": "Roast the cracked wheat in the ghee. Combine the wheat and ghee in a medium saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring regularly.

    {
      "title": "Add the water.",
      "content": "Add the water. Stir the wheat and water together and cover the pan. Stay close to the pan, because the mixture could froth up and boil over very quickly. Cook the wheat for 10 to 12 minutes, until it’s absorbed the water and taken on a soft and tender consistency. If the pan does boil over, remove the lid and stir the mixture. Place the lid on halfway to prevent it from boiling over again."

      "title": "Add the milk and cardamom.",
      "content": "Add the milk and cardamom. Stir to incorporate the milk and spice into the wheat mixture. Leave the saucepan uncovered and continue cooking the dalia over medium-low heat. Stir regularly until the dalia reaches the consistency you like. [9] X Research source For runnier dalia, cook the mixture just long enough to heat the milk, about 1 to 2 minutes. For a thicker and more porridge-like consistency, cook the mixture for about 5 minutes so the wheat absorbs more of the milk."

      "title": "Add the sugar, nuts, and raisins.",
      "content": "Add the sugar, nuts, and raisins. Stir to mix all the ingredients evenly throughout the dalia.

      "content": "Eat it hot. Dalia is best eaten hot, regardless of whether you're enjoying the plain, vegetable, or sweet variety. Even if you're eating leftovers, be sure to reheat them in a saucepan before serving. When making sweet dalia, it’s important to heat the dalia through after adding milk, because the milk will lower the temperature of the dish. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Garnish it with fresh herbs. You can garnish dalia with any spices or aromatics you like, and chopped fresh herbs are one of the most popular ways to finish a dish before serving.
