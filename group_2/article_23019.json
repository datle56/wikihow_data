      "content": "That way, you won't leave them hanging or forget to respond. It can be easy to forget about a message until later on if it gets lost in your notifications. If someone asks you a question that needs an immediate answer, show your respect and reply to them right away. That way, you won‚Äôt keep them guessing and they can keep doing what they need to. [1] X Research source For example, you should try to reply right away when someone asks you if they need to buy a ticket for an event later that night."

      "title": "Why keep the person waiting if you‚Äôre excited to chat?",
      "content": "Why keep the person waiting if you‚Äôre excited to chat? If you‚Äôre just relaxing and you get a text from someone, just take the time to read it and respond right away. The person you‚Äôre talking to will really appreciate the speedy reply and know that you‚Äôre eager to continue your conversation. [2] X Research source Some people can see when you open a message even if you didn‚Äôt respond, which could make them feel anxious. Wait to open your texts until you can respond to them. You can still usually read your messages in your notifications without opening the app."

      "content": "That way, you can keep the convo flowing without seeming needy. Even though you might be really excited to message them, you might seem a little needy or clingy with an immediate response. If you want to play it cool, wait for up to an hour so it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre always on your phone checking for their reply. [3] X Research source While it‚Äôs okay to reply later if you‚Äôre actually busy, purposefully waiting to text somebody might feel disrespectful if you‚Äôre available. If you had to make the person wait for more than an hour, offer them an apology and explain what kept you from messaging them. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "If you want to talk but can't right now, shoot them a quick text to let them know. It‚Äôs completely normal if you can‚Äôt send a full response to someone right when you receive it. If you‚Äôre caught up doing something else and can't really chat right now, try to chime in to let the person know you‚Äôre not ignoring them. Then, you can give them a time that works better for you. For example, you could say something like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm caught up right now, but I can chat tonight!"

      "title": "If someone takes a few hours to text you, you can wait that long to reply.",
      "content": "If someone takes a few hours to text you, you can wait that long to reply. If the person responds to you within a few minutes, they‚Äôre probably pretty eager to keep up the conversation so say something back to them quickly. If the person took about a day, then you‚Äôre fine leaving the text until tomorrow before you have to reply back. [5] X Research source On top of taking the same amount of time, try to make your messages a similar length as the other person. That way, the conversation still feels balanced.

      "content": "Apologize for the delay and continue your conversation. There may be days where you‚Äôre absolutely slammed and can‚Äôt find a chance to check your phone, and that‚Äôs okay! Even if it‚Äôs later in the same day, let the person know that you‚Äôre sorry for being so busy and offer a kind and thoughtful response to their message. [7] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 28 September 2021. For example, you could say something like, ‚ÄúI am SO sorry work was such a mess today, but other than that I‚Äôve been pretty good! I hope your day wasn‚Äôt as stressful as mine üòä‚Äù"

      "title": "Texting someone too late could wake them up.",
      "content": "Texting someone too late could wake them up. Make sure the person is awake and available when you reply to them so they see your message as soon as possible. If you think the person is asleep, you can wait until morning to message them back. That way, you‚Äôre less likely to wait around for their message back. [8] X Research source If you know the person keeps their phone on silent or vibrate, then it might be okay to reply late at night so they see your message right when they wake up."

      "content": "Waiting longer without explanation shows that you have no interest. Even if you‚Äôre taking things slow as you get to know the person, too long in between texts can give someone the wrong impression. Say sorry about taking so long to get back to them. [9] X Research source For example, you might say, ‚ÄúOMG I‚Äôm so sorry I missed this! I‚Äôve just been really slammed the past few days.‚Äù"

      "title": "A deep question might need a thought-out answer.",
      "content": "A deep question might need a thought-out answer. If someone asks you a tough question and you aren‚Äôt sure how to respond, see if they can give you any extra thinking time. That way, the person will expect a response eventually, but it‚Äôs not something that you need to worry about immediately. You can always respond to an insightful question asking for time. For example, you could say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really going to have to think on that one! Can I get back to you in a few days?‚Äù"

      "content": "You may need to send a second message to remind the other person. Studies have shown that after 4 hours, you‚Äôre more likely to get a response if you text again. That gives you enough time to restart the conversation and makes you sound less clingy. [10] X Research source While more people aren‚Äôt bothered by a double text, constant messages or a wall of text could get intimidating to reply to. If the other person sends a lot of messages, set some texting boundaries ."

      "content": "Cut off contact completely so you can move on. This works best if you‚Äôre texting someone on a dating app that you just connected with. If you‚Äôve only been texting but haven‚Äôt gotten together with someone in person, then you haven‚Äôt really had the time to form a good bond with them, so it‚Äôs okay to leave their messages on read. [11] X Research source It‚Äôs also okay to ghost someone if you feel unsafe when you‚Äôre talking to them. If you‚Äôve met the person you‚Äôre talking to but you still aren‚Äôt interested in the conversation, be honest and tell the person directly. Waiting to reply or ghosting the person will only hurt their feelings more. [12] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Matchmaker & Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 3 March 2021."
