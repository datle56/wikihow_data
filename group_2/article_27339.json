Then, turn off the heat and remove the lid so the water cools faster. Let the water cool for about 5 minutes or until it reaches 175 °F (79 °C). [1] X Research source Dina Garcia, RD, LDN, CLT. Nutritionist. [2] X Research source Using boiling hot water can burn the green tea, which will make it taste bitter and unpleasant."

      "content": "Place 1 tea bag in your teacup. It's important that you keep the ratio of 1 tea bag for every 1 cup (240 ml) of water, so if you want to make more than 1 cup of green tea, consider placing 2 or 3 bags in a teapot. This will give you room to add more water. [3] X Research source If you have time, warm the teacup before you make the green tea. Just fill the teacup with hot water and let it sit for about 30 seconds. Then, pour out the water."

      "content": "Steep the tea for 2 to 3 minutes. If you prefer a light, delicate flavor, leave the tea to brew for only 2 minutes. For a slightly stronger, earthy flavor, brew it for a total of 3 minutes. [6] X Research source Don't brew the green tea for more than 3-4 minutes or the flavor will become bitter.

Now you can drink your hot green tea or flavor it with a little honey or lemon. [8] X Research source Avoid squeezing the tea bag because this will release bitter components into the tea."

Let the water cool for about 5 minutes so the temperature is between 170 and 176 °F (77 and 80 °C). [9] X Research source Always start with water that you haven't boiled before.

Put the leaves directly into the teapot or into the infuser basket if your teapot has one. [10] X Research source If you have time, you can pour hot water into the teapot to warm it up.

If your teapot has a lid, place it on top of the pot to trap the steam. [11] X Research source You could also place a small saucer over the top of the teapot to prevent the steam from escaping."

If you like the flavor, you can stop the infusion or continue to steep the tea until it's strong enough for your taste.

If your teapot doesn't have an infuser basket, set a tea strainer over a small teacup and slowly pour the green tea into your cup. Sip the tea while it's hot. [13] X Research source Squeeze a little lemon or stir some honey into the tea if you'd like to add a bright flavor. You can save the tea leaves and brew 1 to 2 more pots of tea with them. Keep in mind that each additional brew will need less steeping time since the leaves are already opened."

Ensure that the bowl is heat proof. [14] X Research source If you like, you can warm the tea bowl so it doesn't cool down your hot matcha tea. To warm the tea bowl, fill it with boiling hot water and leave it for 30 seconds before carefully dumping out the water."

Since matcha green tea doesn't use a lot of water, you can bring about 1 cup (240 ml) to a boil using a stovetop or electric kettle. Once the water boils, remove it from the heat and let it cool about 1 minute so the temperature drops.

Try to keep your wrist loose and whisk in a circle if you'd like thin tea. If you want thicker, foamy tea, whisk quickly in a back and forth motion. [18] X Research source To create the thin, smooth tea, whisk for closer to 20 seconds. You'll need to whisk for around 1 minute if you want foam on the top of your tea."

Try to enjoy the tea as soon as you've finished whisking it because the powder will settle if the tea sits for long. [19] X Research source In order to fully enjoy the experience of drinking matcha green tea, cup the tea bowl with both hands and bring it to your face. Breathe in the smell of the tea and relax before you begin drinking."
