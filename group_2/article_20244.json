      "content": "Hang out in social places. In order to find a boyfriend, you’re going to have to look beyond school. Instead of hanging out at home, try going to your local pool, library, ice cream store, or mall, where there will be plenty of boys around! Take advantage for the summer and enjoy the outdoors, say hello to people, and try to make new friends."

      "title": "Prioritize joining activities in your local community instead of at school.",
      "content": "Prioritize joining activities in your local community instead of at school. If you love theater or volunteering, consider joining your local theater group or club team, instead of playing and practicing at school. If there’s nothing you really want to join, try something new, like a new sport or joining a young politicians club. Look for activities that are coed, and avoid all-girls things like all-girls sports teams or dance groups. Finding someone who shares the same passion as you also gives you a lot to talk about! If you’re scared of joining alone, ask your friends to join with you. Feel free to try different activities if you don’t like the first one you pick up."

      "content": "Be available. You never know when the opportunity to get to know someone is going to strike. If a boy asks if you want to do something, say yes! If you’re not free, ask if you can reschedule. Practice saying yes to things, even if they’re new or seem scary. Keep an open mind ."

If you have any friends who are dating a boy at a different school, their boyfriend’s friends or acquaintances might be the perfect guy for you! Ask your friend or their male friends to reach out and set you up on a blind date, or to plan a party where you’re all invited. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take initiative. If you like someone and they haven’t made a move, don’t be afraid to make one first . You don’t have to wait around until he asks you -- go up to him and ask for his number. Even if he says no, at least you’re not spending your time playing guessing games! Go in with a plan, and ask your friends if you can practice with them. Going over the conversation a few times can help settle your nerves."

      "content": "Exchange numbers and social media accounts. After meeting someone you think has potential, get to know them better by communicating via messaging, phone calls, and video chats. Don’t be afraid to send the first message, but also be careful that you’re not messaging too often. While it might be tempting to message during school, make sure you stay focused. You’ll have plenty of chances to talk when you’re free. Be careful handing out more personal information, like your address, to strangers."

You can meet at the mall or the movies. Or, for more a more laid-back atmosphere, you can meet at your nearby ice cream store, park, or favorite brunch place. The important thing is finding a place where you can sit down and talk to each other! [2] X Research source"

While it’s important to ask him how he’s feeling and how his day has been, if you want to get to know him better you should also ask questions about his childhood, his favorite things to do, and his family and friends.

Take this time to do homework together and just casually talk and get to know each other. Pick a place that you can both easily get to and schedule meeting times that work for both of you. One easy way to see each other is to find a cafe or other location halfway between your schools, and walk to meet each other."

[7] X Research source Give it time, and try to be open with them, even if they aren’t open with you. If it’s still not working, or his friends make you uncomfortable, back away and find someone else.
