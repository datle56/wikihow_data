Visit the shops along Main Street and the stores in your favorite section of Disneyland to find a gift that’s perfect for you. [15] X Research source If you want mouse ears, buy them in the morning so you can wear them all day while getting your picture taken. For larger souvenirs, shop around during the day and visit the store before you leave the park to make a purchase. This will save you from carrying around a big bag all day. If you’re buying something fragile or valuable, ask the store associate if they can ship it home for you. Most stores in Disneyland offer free or inexpensive shipping for items bought in store, and if the souvenir breaks, they’ll replace it."
