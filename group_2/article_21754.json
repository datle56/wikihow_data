      "content": "Wipe down the wall with a clean cloth to remove any dirt. Use a dry cloth to remove surface dust, or dampen the cloth with clean water to wipe off any dirt or residue. Let the wall dry for a few minutes so the Velcro will stick to it securely. [2] X Research source Cleaning the wall before adding the Velcro will make sure the adhesive sticks much better. You can also wipe down the wall with rubbing alcohol so it's clean. These strips will attach to drywall, wood, glass, laminates, and other smooth surfaces."
