      "content": "The slang term, “jawn,” was popularized in Philadelphia. Although it’s Philly slang , the term actually came from New York. African Americans in the region shortened the word “joint” to “jawn,” and this meaning moved south to Philadelphia, where it became a staple of the city. Use of the word “joint” to refer to something goes all the way back to the Old French and English, where it specifically referred to a connection or association. [3] X Research source The term has gained popularity on TikTok thanks to streamers like Raud and Kai Cenat ."

      "content": "Yes, “jawn” is a Black term. Black New Yorkers originally used the term “joint,” but pronounced it as “jawn.” This is because of an African American Vernacular English (AAVE) tendency to remove the consonant at the end of a word and replace it with ‘aw’ or ‘uh’ sounds. [4] X Research source Since its popularity on TikTok, “jawn” has been used by all types of people, both in and out of Philly."
