      "title": "Pour the water into a pot, then add the anchovies and kelp.",
      "content": "Pour the water into a pot, then add the anchovies and kelp. Measure 4 cups (0.95 L) of water into a large, shallow pot. Add 7 large, dried anchovies and a 6 by 8 in (15 by 20 cm) piece of dried kelp. [1] X Research source Use dried anchovies that already have their heads and guts removed. It's difficult to remove these things from already-dried anchovies. Make sure that you are using actual kelp. Don’t use a nori sheet, like what you'd use to make sushi."

      "title": "Bring the water to a boil and let it cook over high heat for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil and let it cook over high heat for 15 minutes. Do not cover the pot with a lid; you want the water to evaporate as it cooks. This will give you a rich-tasting, concentrated broth. If you leave the lid on, the condensation will just drip back into the pot and water the broth down. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the anchovies and kelp out of the pot and discard them.",
      "content": "Pull the anchovies and kelp out of the pot and discard them. It's not recommended that you save them for another recipe because all of their flavors would have gone into the broth. You will have about 2 1 ⁄ 2 cups (590 mL) of broth left. [3] X Research source Use a fork, metal tongs, or chopsticks to lift the anchovies and kelp out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl.",
      "content": "Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl. Choose a brand of hot pepper paste with your desired level of spiciness. Measure out 3 tablespoons (51 g) and place it into a small bowl. Add 1 to 3 teaspoons of hot pepper flakes and 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 g) of white, granulated sugar. Stir everything together with a fork or mini whisk until the texture is consistent. [4] X Research source For extra flavor, stir in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. Most of the heat comes from the pepper flakes. The more pepper flakes you use, the spicier the sauce will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the pepper mixture to the pot and cook it until it dissolves.",
      "content": "Add the pepper mixture to the pot and cook it until it dissolves. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the small bowl clean so that you don't waste any of the paste. Stir the broth with a whisk to combine the ingredients, then bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir it occasionally until the paste dissolves and mixes in with the broth. [5] X Research source This should only take 2 to 3 minutes. The sauce is ready once the color and texture are consistent. Don't worry about it thickening just yet."

      "title": "Soak 1 pound (450 g) of rice cakes in cold water for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak 1 pound (450 g) of rice cakes in cold water for 20 minutes. This is only necessary for refrigerated rice cakes. If you are using freshly-made rice cakes, you don't need to soak them at all. If you're using frozen rice cakes, however, allow them to thaw to room temperature first, then soak them in cold water for 20 minutes. [6] X Research source 1 pound (450 g) of rice cakes is equal to about 24 pieces. The rice cakes should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. If they are longer than that, cut them into shorter pieces with a knife."

      "title": "Add the rice cakes to the broth and cook them for 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Add the rice cakes to the broth and cook them for 8 to 10 minutes. Gently slip the rice cakes into the broth. Allow them to cook over medium-high heat for 8 to 10 minutes. Stir them often with a wooden spoon so that they don't stick to the bottom of the pot. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Add cabbage, scallions, eggs, and fishcakes, if desired. You can include all of these ingredients, or you can pick and choose the ones that you like. Other tasty things you can add to the pot include dumplings, ramen, and seafood. [8] X Research source Slice the fish cakes, cabbage, and green onions into 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long pieces before you add them to the pot. Do not cut the eggs, though."

      "title": "Cook the broth over high-heat for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring often.",
      "content": "Cook the broth over high-heat for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring often. Turn the stove to high heat first. Let the broth return to a boil, then stir it with a wooden spoon. Keep cooking and stirring the broth for about 4 to 6 minutes. It's ready when the rice cakes are soft and the sauce is thick. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Add the sesame oil and sesame seeds before serving the tteokbokki. As soon as the tteokbokki is done cooking, stir in 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds. Turn the burner off and take the pot off the stove. Serve the tteokbokki immediately while they are still hot. [10] X Research source Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container. Eat them within 1 or 2 days."
