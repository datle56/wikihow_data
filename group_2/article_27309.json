      "content": "Mix ½ cup (63 g) of flour and ⅓ cup (159 mL) of water in a bowl with a spoon. Blend the mixture until it is about as thick as pancake batter. The paste should not be too thick or too drippy. If it’s too runny, add more flour 1 teaspoon (3.3 g) at a time until it’s the right consistency. If it’s too thick, add more water. [1] X Research source Ingredients: ½ cup (63 g) of flour, ⅓ cup (159 mL) of water If you need less glue, start with the amount of flour you will use, then add water, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) at a time, until it reaches the right consistency. What this glue works for: This simple flour glue is great if you’re making crafts for a party or something short-term. It will not usually last on long-term projects because it will dry out."

      "content": "Use the glue shortly after making it. You can use a brush or your fingers to apply the glue to your crafts. The glue paste can be used to stick paper together for a variety of craft projects and decorations such as making greeting cards and kids’ projects. This glue can become moldy over time. To prevent mold, dry your craft project completely over a heater or let it air dry fully."

      "content": "Mix 1 cup (125 g) of flour with ⅓ cup (200 g) of sugar in a small saucepan. Combine the flour and sugar with a spoon or whisk until well-blended. [3] X Research source Ingredients: 1 cup (125 g) of flour, ⅓ cup (200 g) of sugar, 1 to 1.5 cups (237 to 355 mL) of water, 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of vinegar If you want a smoother paste, you can sift the flour before you make your paste. To make papier mâché glue , the basic proportions are 3:1 for the flour-sugar mixture. Use 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of vinegar for every cup of flour you use. What this glue works for: You can use this glue to make papier mâché and light craft projects. It's totally non-toxic, too!"

      "content": "Add ¾ cup (177 mL) of water and 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of vinegar to the pan. Blend the mix until it is very smooth and lump-free. It will have the consistency of a thick paste. When smooth, whisk in the rest of the water (¼ to ¾ cup (59 to 177 mL) depending on how runny you want your paste) and mix thoroughly. Blend your ingredients until your glue is smooth and a little runny but not watery."

      "content": "Let your glue cool before using it. When the mixture has cooled, use it for any craft projects including papier mâché. Once you have finished, keep any unused glue in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. This glue will keep for 2 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator. Make sure to thoroughly dry any of the crafts you make with this glue. If the project stays damp, it may grow moldy over time. Pat your products dry or heat them over an oven to keep mold away."

According to DIYers, this cornstarch glue recipe is the closest to mimicking Elmer’s Glue. Real Elmer’s Glue requires an emulsion of expensive and hard-to-find ingredients and isn’t practical to make yourself."

The chemical reaction will turn the protein of the milk into lumps or curds (you’ll see the milk form small white clumps). The liquid that remains is called whey. [9] X Research source Ingredients: ½ cup (118 mL) of skim milk, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar, 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of water, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda What this glue works for: This environmentally-friendly recipe can work for paper, cardboard, fabric, and potentially wood gluing.

You will be able to hear the sound of bubbles popping if you listen closely because the reaction of the baking soda with the curds creates carbon dioxide. [12] X Research source If the mixture does not have the consistency of glue, add more water to the mixture (one teaspoon at a time) until it is the correct consistency. Store any remaining glue in an airtight container in the fridge. Since it’s milk-based, it will last for about a week or so."

[13] X Research source Ingredients: 2 packets of unflavored gelatin (about ½ ounce (14 g) total), 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cold water, 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of skim milk, and 3 drops of clove oil (optional) What this glue works for: This recipe works well on porous materials like paper, cardboard, some fabrics, and potentially wood.

[15] X Research source Optional: If you’re keeping the glue for more than 1 day, mix in 3 drops of clove oil to act as a natural preservative.

As it cools, the glue will become more gel-like (this doesn’t impact its adhesiveness, though). [17] X Research source To reuse the glue, place the jar in a pot of hot water to warm the gel. Store the glue in a cool, dry place (like a cabinet or pantry) for up to a week if clove oil was added."
