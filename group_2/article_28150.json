Cover the pan with a lid and wait for the oil to heat up. [1] X Research source Toss a corn kernel or two into the pan to see if the oil’s hot enough. If they pop, the oil is ready. If you don’t have vegetable oil, try canola oil or anything with a medium or high smoking point."

Cover the pan, wait 30 seconds, and then put the stove back on medium-high heat. Shake the pan every 10 seconds or so to help the kernels pop. [2] X Research source Delaying when you turn the stove back on lets the kernels reach an even temperature, so they’ll pop around the same time."
