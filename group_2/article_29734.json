      "title": "Cut the mat down to the desired size.",
      "content": "Cut the mat down to the desired size. Non-slip rubber mats for rugs come in rolls, so you will need to cut yours down to the right size. You can make your rug a square or a rectangle. You can even cut it into a shape, such as a crescent moon or heart. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut your fabric into thin strips.",
      "content": "Cut your fabric into thin strips. Stack several pieces of cotton fabric together, then cut it into 1 by 5-inch (2.54 by 12.7-centimeter) strips. You can use all one color, but using two or three will make your rug look more interesting. [2] X Research source Consider using one solid color and one coordinating pattern. Using a rotary cutter will make cutting the fabric strips faster and easier."

      "content": "Pull a fabric strip through two of the holes in the mat. Use a pair of tweezers to pull the fabric strip down through one hole and out the other. Make sure that the strip crosses under the corner between two squares; don't cross it under the actual square itself."

    {
      "title": "Tie the two ends of the strip together, if desired.",
      "content": "Tie the two ends of the strip together, if desired. You don't have to do this, but it will make your rug more durable and prevent the strips from falling out."

      "content": "Repeat the process for the rest of the holes and strips until the rug is filled. Start at one end of the rug and work your way to the other in rows. If you are making a shape, such as a heart, start at the center of the rug and work your way outward. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose fabric to use as your base and as your scraps. Your base fabric should be sturdy and already cut to the size and shape you want your rug to be. A towel will work great for this, but you can also use canvas. For your scrap fabric, choose something that doesn't fray much, such as jersey or cotton. If your base fabric isn't hemmed, take a moment to do so now. Your scrap fabric doesn't have to match. Try using coordinating patterns and colors!"

      "title": "Draw parallel guidelines on your base fabric, then set it aside.",
      "content": "Draw parallel guidelines on your base fabric, then set it aside. The lines should run across the width of your fabric. The closer together you make these lines, the denser your rug will be; keep in mind that you'll also need to use more fabric as well. About 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart would be a good place to start. Use a dressmaker's pen and a ruler for this. The lines will disappear when you wash the fabric. If you are making a round or oval rug, draw rings inside the rug, like ripples, instead. Do not draw guidelines on your scrap fabric."

The rectangles can be whatever size you want them to be, but 4 by 1 inches (10.16 to 2.54 centimeters) is a good place to start. Cut your fabric a few pieces at a time. They way, the rectangles will all come out the same size."
