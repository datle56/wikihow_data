      "title": "Trade out your regular shampoo for a volumizing shampoo.",
      "content": "Trade out your regular shampoo for a volumizing shampoo. These shampoos add thickness to your hair, making it easier to get volume at your roots. Look for one that has \"volumizing\" on the label, and use it as often as you shampoo your hair. [1] X Research source Pay special attention to your roots when shampooing your hair. Rub it into your roots by massaging your scalp with your fingertips."

      "title": "Try a clarifying shampoo every week or so.",
      "content": "Try a clarifying shampoo every week or so. Replace your regular shampoo with this shampoo, washing your hair as you normally would. The idea is it will rinse out any excess product in your roots that may be weighing them down. [2] X Research source While products like conditioner, mousse, gel, and even volumizing shampoo can give your hair an extra boost of volume, these products can start to build up in your hair and weigh it down with repeated use. It's a good idea to take an occasional break from using these and opt for clarifying shampoo instead. You can also try organic shampoos or conditioners, which tend to cause less buildup than traditional hair products."

      "title": "Avoid applying conditioner at the roots.",
      "content": "Avoid applying conditioner at the roots. Conditioner is great for making your hair healthier. However, when you apply it to your roots, it weighs them down and reduces their volume. Itâ€™s also not necessary since the hair at your roots is newer and unlikely to be as dry as the older hair at your ends. Apply conditioner only to the tips of your hair, instead. [3] X Research source The only time you should use conditioner on your roots is if you have a lot of knots to get out. Use a clarifying shampoo afterward to prevent the product from building up."

      "content": "Massage in a quarter-sized dollop of mousse into thin hair at the roots. Spray it into your hand and then use your fingertips to work it into your roots. Lift the hair and blow dry the roots to dry them slightly. [4] X Research source You can use this method on wet or dry hair. If you use it on wet hair, flip your hair over to dry it. To use this technique on curly hair, use a diffuser attachment with your hair dryer. You can also use a styling gel in the same way. Add a nickel-sized dollop to your hand and put it on in the same way. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a volumizing spray for easy lift at your roots. After blow-drying or air-drying your hair, flip your head over. Spritz on one of these sprays until your roots feel damp, then blow dry your roots a bit more to finish the process. [6] X Research source If you want, you can skip the blow dryer at the end. You won't get quite as much lift, but it will still work if you're in a hurry."

      "title": "Apply a hair texturizing powder with silica silylate for all-day lift.",
      "content": "Apply a hair texturizing powder with silica silylate for all-day lift. Start with dry hair and sprinkle a small amount on your head at the roots. Use your fingers to blend it into your roots so that it's not visible. The product will provide an instant lift. Silica silylate is a powder that adds bulk and texture to your hair, which makes it easy to fluff it up with more volume. You can also flip your hair over to apply a bit underneath. If your hair falls flat during the day, try scrunching it near the roots to provide lift again."

      "content": "Spray or sprinkle in some dry shampoo along the roots. Use the shampoo on freshly cleaned and dried hair or even hair you haven't washed in a day or two. Once you spray it in, use your fingers to distribute it into your roots evenly. [7] X Research source Dry shampoo will absorb oil and add a little texture, creating lift."

Sprinkle a bit near your part and then use your fingers to work it into your roots. If you see any extra powder, comb it in.

      "content": "Dry your wet hair with your head flipped over. With your hair dangling towards the floor, blow dry your hair in sections. Once the hair is dry, flip your head back up. Drying your hair this way creates volume at the roots since your hair will go in this direction. [10] X Research source If you get tired during this process, dry it this way until it's about 60% done. Then flip your head back up. Lift the hair up at the roots with your fingers while using your blow dryer on it until it's fully dry. [11] X Research source For extra lift, spritz on a little hairspray at the roots with your hair flipped down again."

      "title": "Tease your roots",
      "content": "Tease your roots by combing towards the scalp. Pull part of your hair together at the top of your head near the crown. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb down towards your scalp near the roots while still holding onto the hair at the tips; you're going against the way you'd normally comb your hair. Do it a small section at a time. [12] X Research source To make it look a little less tangled, use your fingers to gently comb through your hair. For more extreme volume, try a clean toothbrush at the roots."

      "content": "Part your hair in a different place each day. If you always part it on the right side, try parting it on the left. If you put it in the middle, go off to one side instead. Rearranging it a little bit every day can increase volume at your roots. [13] X Research source If you always part your hair in the place, your hair naturally flattens there. By moving it to a new place, you give your hair a natural lift as it resists this new part."

      "content": "Leave in hot rollers for 15-30 minutes. Opt for larger rollers, which will create volume without too much curl. Roll up your hair from underside, moving from the tips to the roots with the curlers horizontal near the roots. Try to direct the rollers at a 45 degree angle from your head. Use the pin or clip to hold the curler in place. Leave it in for at least 15 minutes; go for 30 minutes if you have longer hair, as the heat will need time to reach the inner layers. [14] X Research source When time is up, unroll the curlers and use your fingers to comb your hair into a soft look."

Let your stylist know that you're wanting more volume. [16] X Research source"
