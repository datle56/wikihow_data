      "content": "Shop for school-appropriate outfits. Even more importantly, shop for school-appropriate outfits that you love. You don’t need a walk-in closet stocked with dozens of outfits to dress cutely for school. Just find some staple, go-to pieces that fit into your school’s dress code and make you feel confident. [1] X Research source If you’re short on cash, you can find deals at discount clothing stores like TJ Maxx, Plato’s Closet, Ross, and Marshall’s. You don’t need to spend a fortune to get cute clothing."

      "content": "Pick out your outfit the night before. When you're rubbing sleep from your eyes and dashing to catch the bus, you won’t have time to play around with outfit ideas. Instead, lay out your clothes the night before. You can spend the time before bed trying on different combinations, checking out your angles in the mirror, and finding the perfect accessories. This will help you have a stress-free morning. This also will help you avoid any unexpected wardrobe malfunctions. If you have to dress up for a class presentation, you don’t want to discover a stain on your favorite dress that morning. By finding an issue that night before, you can at least find a great back up!"

      "content": "Accessorize. This is especially helpful for anyone with a very strict school dress code or uniform. If you can’t do much with your clothing, work with accessories. A fun pair of shoes, a new bracelet, or a great pair of glasses can transform your whole look, and self-esteem, for the day. The same outfit can look completely different simply by pairing it with a scarf, statement necklace, or fun belt. [2] X Research source You can find great accessories for low prices at places like Target or Walmart. If you shop at cheaper places, you can get more pieces to add a ton of variety to your wardrobe."

      "content": "Create an easy hair routine. Unless you’re superwoman, you probably don’t have the time or patience to curl, tease, or blow out your hair every morning. That’s OK! Find a routine that works with your schedule. If you prefer showering at night, figure out a way to tame the bedhead easily in the morning. If you like showering in the morning, you could play around with wet hairstyles to save time blow-drying. And if you are a morning person, you can style your hair however you want in the morning! [4] X Research source It’s helpful to have a quick “go-to” hairstyle that you like. You can watch easy and fast hair tutorials on YouTube to get some ideas. Buns, braided pigtails, and ponytails are all easy, quick, and can look super cute."

      "content": "Remember that less is more. School isn’t a fashion show, so there’s no need to whip out the fake lashes and bright red lipstick. Some schools might not even allow this. Instead, focus on simply enhancing your natural beauty. [5] X Research source Most importantly, find a makeup routine that makes you feel the best and most comfortable in your skin. Confidence is the cutest thing you can wear. It is completely your choice to wear makeup to school or not. If makeup is not something you want to add to your morning routine, that’s understandable! Whatever makes you feel most confident will make you look the most beautiful."

      "content": "Apply a coat of mascara to make your eyes pop. The sleepiest of mornings can be disguised with a little bit of mascara. By lengthening, thickening, and darkening your lashes, you will make your eyes appear bigger and more open. It only takes a couple of seconds and voila! It looks like you woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Dip your mascara wand into the product, and make sure that the wand is evenly coated. Start at the base of your lashes and apply the mascara to the tips, wiggling the wand slightly as you go to avoid clumping. If you want, you can apply multiple coats for extra volume."

      "content": "Add a little bit of blush or bronzer to brighten your face. By adding just a stroke of product to the apples of your cheeks, you can make a huge difference. These products will make your complexion glow. They can also give definition to your face by creating the illusion of cheekbones. Adding a bit of sun-kissed color to your face can take you from drab to fab in an instant."

      "content": "Get enough sleep. Between homework, studying, extracurriculars, social lives, and family obligations, it’s often hard to do this. Whenever you are able, try hard to get enough sleep. Not only will you feel better, but you’ll look better as well. A lack of sleep can cause bags under the eyes and dull-looking skin. Aside from that, who wants to get dolled up when they only slept for a few hours? Sleep is an important beauty secret that people often forget. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Maintain good hygiene. The cutest outfit won’t be able to cover-up body odor or greasy hair. Though it seems like obvious, make time to shower regularly and always wear deodorant. Don’t skip brushing your teeth to save time, and never underestimate a good face washing in the morning. It’s much easier to look cute at school if you’re clean and polished. Don’t try to cover up a couple days of missed showers by going crazy with the body spray or perfume. It won’t fool anyone, and it can actually be distracting and gross in the close quarters of a classroom. Bring a toothbrush to brush your teeth after lunch. It won’t take long to run to the bathroom and do this, and fresh breath is always cute."

      "title": "Eat healthy and drink water.",
      "content": "Eat healthy and drink water. Just like with sleep deprivation, a poor diet and dehydration can make your skin look pale and dull. Additionally, a poor diet can make you lethargic and unmotivated. Make sure you’re eating a balanced diet and getting enough water. Not only will this work to your advantage physically, but it’ll make you feel better as well. [7] X Research source Try to “eat the rainbow.” Fill your plates with colorful fruits and veggies, and you’ll be more likely to get the nutrients and vitamins that your body craves. Don’t deprive yourself of special treats. Eating healthy is good for the body, but the occasional treat is good for the soul."

      "content": "Smile. Remember you’re beautiful, and try your best to exude that confidence. If you head to class in athletic clothes without a stitch of makeup, you can look glamorous if you feel glamorous. Although it’s a cliché, happiness is truly an attractive quality. Love yourself and what you have to offer, and you already look cute! [8] X Research source"
