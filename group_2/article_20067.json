      "content": "Ask about their goals (and how moving out can help them meet them). You can demand that they move out, but it'd be more effective to convince them to want to move out. Miller says, “the first way would be to ask the child what their goals are. Because as humans, we really only do things if we want them ourselves.” If you can frame moving out as being what's most helpful for your child to achieve their goals, they may be more likely to take that step. Choose a relaxed time to have the convo when everyone is in a good mood. Show a united front if you have a partner or co-parent. It's very common for one parent to want a child to move out and the other parent to be resistant to the idea, but it's important to be on the same page. What if my child says they’re happy staying home? In this case, reframe the question around their goals in life. You might say, “Do you really want to be living at home? Or do you want to pursue your dreams and goals?” or, “How does staying here get you closer to completing your degree? I know you needed a break year, but isn’t it time to move back to campus?”"

      "content": "Talk to your child about their timeline based on their goals. Miller goes on, “Once they admit they want to move, talk about their goals. What do they want to do? Where do they see themselves in a year? Five years? Then, help them make those plans.” This could take the form of a concrete timeline for them to save up enough to move, or a set date where they have to be ready, or have a job. What if my child doesn’t know what they want in life? Then now is the time to start figuring it out. Maybe they need to start therapy, talk to their school’s career center, or meet with a temp agency to figure out some intermediate steps."

      "title": "Set a concrete date for them to move out.",
      "content": "Set a concrete date for them to move out. Miller says it’s best to be flexible on a concrete date, but that it’s essential everyone agrees on one. “You must establish a deadline. So, your child knows they have these goals and now they have an agreed-upon plan for when to move out. It could be three months, six months, something like that. Whatever you and your child both feel comfortable with.” It’s totally up to you if you want to set a “soft” deadline (like “move out in April”) versus a hard date (like “move out April 20th”). Go with whatever option seems most appropriate based on your kid’s personality."

      "content": "Get excited with your child for their new journey. Avoid blaming your child or making them feel like this is a punishment—because it’s not. This is the next big step on the exciting journey of their life! You might ask them questions like: “Do you want help apartment hunting? I know you’ve always wanted a spare room for recording music, we can totally find that!” “You always wanted to live with Ron, right? You two have always been best friends and I know you mentioned Ron was looking for a new place.” “We can go shopping once you find a place! We can pick out some fun furniture, new sheets, clothes, all of it!”"

If you can, and want to, provide any kind of material help, let your child know now so that you can end the conversation on a high note that still reinforces your plan. You might offer to throw them some cash to help with the deposit on an apartment, or let them pick some furniture from the home that they can take with them."

      "content": "Are you trying to move them out because staying isn’t “normal”? We no longer live in a world where children finish school and immediately leave home forever. It has become increasingly more common for young adult children to stay with their parents for a while as they start (or prepare to start) their careers. So, if you want your child to move because you’re self-conscious about living at home being unhealthy or abnormal, don’t fret. This is the new norm, and it can even be beneficial in some cases. Roughly 60% of young adults under 25 live at home. It is no longer a given that young adults are expected to move out, and your child (and their peers) know that. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Census Bureau The United State's leading and trusted source of quality data about its people and economy. Go to source Children who stay at home a little bit longer are better off financially. The vast majority of adult children who live at home are doing so because they’re saving some serious money. This can radically improve their future life if they aren’t forced to live paycheck to paycheck.

Kids today realize how hard it can be to start out, so they don’t judge their peers for staying home. [3] X Research source"

It’s possible that your child is struggling to move out because they’re dealing with something else that’s dampening their motivation. Do they seem depressed ?

If it’s clear that your kid is yearning to get moving, it may be best to give them some time to sort things out—in these cases, kids often move on their own because they want to. Perhaps they just need time to save up enough for a deposit, or maybe they really want a job in their career field before they move out. [5] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with casually asking your child what their plan is if they seem like enough of a self-starter to want to move on their own."

      "content": "Are you enabling your child to stay at your home? Svetchnikov says, “Sometimes the only way to really get an adult child to be independent is to stop feeding into their learned helplessness. An adult kid at home may have this learned helplessness where it feels like an all-inclusive vacation. And who wants to leave the all-inclusive vacation? So, you need to bring something, some consequences, some real life struggles to teach them.” If this applies to you, it may be time to stop doing your child’s laundry, cooking for them, or cleaning up after them. That alone can be enough of a motivator to move out. Is your child staying at home really about your anxiety? If you’re scared to let your child leave the nest, that’s 100% normal. It is, however, something you may want to work on ."

      "content": "Charge rent if your child doesn’t take any important steps to move out. If you’re still on the fence about pushing your child to leave but you aren’t comfortable letting them lounge around all day, you could consider charging them rent. That is, charge them rent unless they take the big steps they need to make to get ready to move out and start their life. In other words, tell them it’s time to get a job, go back to school, or move out. [6] X Research source Can I just charge them rent regardless of what they do? Sure, but the question then is what the point of charging rent is. If they’re already able to move out or you want them out period, charging rent is much more passive-aggressive than just asking them to move. You don’t have to charge a “competitive” rent. If your child isn’t working all that much (or at all), feel free to set an abnormally low rent. They may still be motivated to get their own place even if you just charge them a symbolic amount."

      "content": "Move their room if you just want them out of your hair. If this is really more about your child bugging you by getting all up in your business all the time, you might consider just moving where their room is (permitted you have the space). If you have a spare room in the basement, a carriage house, or a garage you aren’t using, maybe move their room there? This can also be a great way to gently nudge an adult child out of the door. Nothing will motivate someone to move faster than being sent to live in the basement."

      "content": "Provide some financial help if they just can’t save up to move. If this is really just about your child not being able to afford to move out (which is super common), the solution here may be very straightforward. If you can afford it, you might offer to help your child pay the deposit on a new apartment, cover the cost of moving and furniture, or provide some other material help. [7] X Research source Avoid giving your child money directly. If you keep paying your kid to buy things they need, there’s no way to confirm that’s how they’re spending the money. Even co-signing on an apartment can be huge. In some housing markets, the requirements are pretty high for renters. If they need it, you could offer to co-sign for them."

      "content": "Let them stay if they follow your guidelines. If this is more about your child’s behavior, it’s time to set some concrete boundaries . Sit your child down and lay out your ground rules. Be extremely clear about the fact that this is your home and they’re a guest who only gets to stay if you allow it. [8] X Research source You might set boundaries around not allowing more than one guest over, when they’re allowed to play music, what they’re allowed to take from the fridge, and so on."

[9] X Research source You might say: “We’ve tried to be supportive but you still haven’t enrolled in school or found a job. You have 60 days to find a place to stay, but it can’t be here.” “We’re not punishing you. We just want the best for you, and what’s best for you is growing up and moving out. It’s time to start looking for an apartment.” “I love you and I want you to be happy. I can tell you’re not happy here, and I get it. I wouldn’t want to be 28 at home, either. So, let’s get moving. By May 15th, I expect you to be living somewhere else.”"

It isn’t odd for an adult child to live with their parents after they’ve surpassed 18, and it hasn’t been strange for a long time now. This is simply a consequence of how society (and our economy) has evolved; it’s just harder for young people to start out now. They work harder, earn less money, and have a harder time finding fulfilling work than any generation in modern history.
