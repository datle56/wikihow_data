Your doctor will then fill the eye with air, gas, or liquid to replace the vitreous, allowing the retina to reattach and heal. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This procedure is the most commonly-performed type of retinal surgery. Over time, the substance (air, gas, or liquid) your doctor injected is absorbed by the eye, and your body will produce fluid that will fill the vitreous cavity. If your doctor used silicone oil, however, he will need to surgically remove the oil after several months have passed and the eye has healed."
