      "content": "Mix together equal amounts of cornstarch and shampoo. Place 3/4 cups (95 g) of cornstarch and 3/4 cups (180 mL) of shampoo into a bowl, then stir everything together with a rubber spatula. The mixture will be dry and crumbly at first, but as you continue to mix it, it will start to form a thick paste. [1] X Research source If you can't find cornstarch, look for cornflour instead. For best results, use an opaque shampoo rather than a clear one."

      "content": "Add 2 to 3 drops of yellow food coloring, if desired. You don't have to do this, but it will really help your slime come together. Keep stirring the slime until the food coloring gets mixed in completely and no streaks remain. If you don't care about your slime looking like butter, use a different color, such as blue or purple."

      "title": "Stir some baby oil into the slime to make it soft.",
      "content": "Stir some baby oil into the slime to make it soft. Add a splash of baby oil into the slime, then stir it in with your rubber spatula. If you used too much baby oil and the slime starts to get sticky, sprinkle some cornstarch onto it, and stir again. [2] X Research source If you can't find baby oil, you could try some hand lotion instead."

      "title": "Knead the slime for a few minutes, adding more cornstarch as needed.",
      "content": "Knead the slime for a few minutes, adding more cornstarch as needed. Pick the slime up with your hands. Stretch it out, then smoosh it back together again. Do this for a few minutes until the slime turns soft and less sticky. If you need to, knead some more cornstarch into the slime to make it less sticky. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the slime in an airtight container when you are not playing with it. Keep in mind that this slime will not last forever. Enjoy it while it is still soft—typically 2 to 3 days—then discard it when it turns hard."

      "title": "Combine equal amounts of cornstarch and shampoo.",
      "content": "Combine equal amounts of cornstarch and shampoo. Pour 1 cup (125 g) of cornstarch and 1 cup (240 mL) of shampoo into a bowl. Stir the 2 together with a rubber spatula until they combine and form a dough. [4] X Research source If you can't find cornstarch, used cornflour instead; it's the same thing. Use an opaque shampoo rather than a clear one for best results. This slime recipe is similar to the more traditional, simple slime recipe, except that it feels more firm."

Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of hand lotion, then stir everything together. [5] X Research source Use only white school glue. Do not use clear school glue. The ingredients are not the same and the slime won't turn out right. Choose an unscented lotion, or use a scent that works with the shampoo."
