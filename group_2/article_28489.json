Coming home with their favorite candy bar from a trip to the store is still meaningful and will make them feel special. If you are out and see something your parent might like, buy it for them if you can afford it. If your mother likes clothes and you see a blouse that would flatter her, surprise her with the shirt even if there is no occasion. Make them a gift. Hand-crafted presents are always nice. If you can knit, try making your dad a scarf that matches his winter coat or if you are great cook, make them a cake and take it over their house. Put in that extra effort to make sure they know they are loved."

If you dad likes golf, buy him a free day at the course. Get your mother a gift card to a nice restaurant if she likes to eat out. Tailor the gifts to show that you really know your parents and want to make them happy. Make it more than one day of celebrating. An entire birthday weekend of fun activities and attention is a great way to let your parents know you truly care and want to make them feel special. Be creative. Nobody likes to get the same gift every year. Pay attention to your parents current interests. If your mom is starting to drink coffee in the morning, get her a coffee maker one year. Always getting her a sweater would be boring, and the variety would show that you pay attention to her."

If you are an older child, talk to your parents about some problems they may be experiencing. Offering emotional support should not be a one-way street. If your mother is worried about a health issue or your father has stress at work, hear them out and offer them encouragement and any advice you think is helpful. Be appreciative of them. Chances are, your parents do a lot for you and you should be grateful of that. Let them know that appreciate all that they do. Tell them regularly and show it in how you treat them. Do not take advantage of them. It is easy to have a bad attitude with your parents, but it does not make them feel happy when you do so. Do not take advantage of their kindness, patience, and generosity with you. That will cause tension in your relationship."
