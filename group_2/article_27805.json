      "title": "Walk away from the argument before it goes too far.",
      "content": "Walk away from the argument before it goes too far. When emotions run high, it’s easy to say something you don’t mean. If you start feeling like you’re not in control of your temper — or your friend isn’t in control of theirs — tell your friend you’ll talk to them later and walk away. [1] X Research source Even if your friend says something mean that hurts your feelings, try not to get pulled into the argument again. Tell yourself they're just lashing out, and let it go. If you feel like it’s appropriate after the fight, text your friend to reassure them. Try something like, “I want you to know that you’re still my best friend and I love you, even when we argue.”"

      "title": "Take several deep breaths to calm down.",
      "content": "Take several deep breaths to calm down. The first thing you should do after an argument is to calm down. It can be hard to calm down when you're angry , but staying angry isn’t good for you and it will keep you from reconciling with your friend. [2] X Research source Slowly inhale through your nose, then exhale through your mouth. Repeat this several times, focusing on calming yourself more with each breath. Other things to help you calm down might include a peaceful walk outside, quiet meditation, or eating ice cream right out of the container. Whatever it is, take a little time to clear your head."

    {
      "title": "Accept the role you played in the argument.",
      "content": "Accept the role you played in the argument. Arguments are rarely one-sided, so don’t blame everything on your friend. Think about what you did that played into your fight. [3] X Research source Have you been feeling stressed out or irritable lately? Your emotional state may have played a role in your behavior. Did you brush off your friend when they were trying to communicate with you? You may have hurt their feelings, leading to the argument."

      "title": "Try to see the argument from your friend's perspective.",
      "content": "Try to see the argument from your friend's perspective. It can be difficult to step back and see things from someone else's point of view, but being able to empathize will show your friend that you really care about them, and not just about your own feelings.

    {
      "title": "Remember all the positives about your friendship.",
      "content": "Remember all the positives about your friendship. Best friends are hard to let go of and harder to replace. Reflect on the great memories you have with your friend and why you wanted to have them in your life in the first place. Think about times that they’ve supported you and made your life better. [5] X Research source You could even write a list of these positive memories and share it with your friend when it’s time to make up. Every relationship is bound to have a few rough patches, but the happy times should still outweigh the difficult ones."

    {
      "title": "Keep the details of the fight between you and your friend.",
      "content": "Keep the details of the fight between you and your friend. Avoid gossiping about your friend or what caused the argument to others. Don't post about the fight on social media. Involving others will add more drama to the situation, and it could make things much worse than the original fight. [6] X Research source Even if you share your feelings with a close friend, word could get back to the friend you’re fighting with."

      "title": "Make up within a few days of the argument if you can.",
      "content": "Make up within a few days of the argument if you can. Leaving an argument hanging in the air could cause resentment to grow. You want to give your friend enough time to cool off, but try to resolve the fight as soon as possible. [7] X Research source The amount of time this will take is different for everyone. Some friends will make up 5 minutes after an argument, while others may need months to recover from hurtful words."

      "title": "Wait until you're ready before you apologize.",
      "content": "Wait until you're ready before you apologize. If you rush your apology just because you're tired of fighting, your friend will probably be able to tell that you aren't being sincere . [8] X Research source You'll know you're ready to apologize when you don't feel angry anymore. Or, you'll realize you care more about getting your friend back than you do about what they said or did that might have hurt your feelings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give a genuine apology.",
      "content": "Give a genuine apology. Apologize because you feel regret for hurting your friend, not because you want an apology from them. Your friend may not be ready to apologize. Go into the conversation and issue your apology without expecting anything from your friend in return. [9] X Research source Even if your friend isn't ready to apologize in return, you should apologize when you're ready. Just ask them to listen and explain what you're sorry for."

    {
      "title": "Plan a time to talk to your friend.",
      "content": "Plan a time to talk to your friend. A face-to-face meeting will help you and your friend reconnect, and it will be easier for your friend to see that your apology is sincere. Call or text your friend to let them know you want to meet and talk in person. [10] X Research source Text your friend something like, “I don’t think we should resolve this over text. Can we meet up and talk? Love you.” or “I feel really bad about the things I said, and I'd like to apologize in person.” Ask your friend if the time and place you have in mind will work for them. If it doesn't, see if you can find something that fits both of your schedules. Choose a neutral place like a coffee shop or park where both of you will feel calm and comfortable. If your friend isn't ready to talk, give them more time. You could also send a handwritten apology note with an invitation to get together when they're ready."

      "title": "Offer a sincere and specific apology.",
      "content": "Offer a sincere and specific apology. Don’t just offer a blanket: “I’m sorry.” Think carefully about what you are really apologizing for, and be specific when you say you’re sorry. [11] X Research source If the argument came from something you specifically did, like betraying your friend’s trust somehow, commit to solving the problem. Say something like, “I’m sorry I told Emma about the secret you told me. I know it was wrong, and there’s no excuse. It won’t happen again, and I’ll work hard to regain your trust.” If you know you hurt your friend’s feelings, apologize for what you said. Say something like, “I’m really sorry I called you stupid. I respect you more than that, and my words were careless and rude.” You might say, “I’m sorry that I waited so long to call you after the fight,” if you honestly don’t think the argument was your fault."

Respect your friend’s emotions, but don’t let them pull you back into the fight. [16] X Research source If your friend is still mad, ask what you can do to make it better. If they give you an answer, try to do that. If they say nothing, your friend may need more time, or they may want to end the friendship. [17] X Research source Try to be patient with your friend as they take the time to heal after your argument. They may need more time than you do, and that's okay."
