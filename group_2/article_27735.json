      "title": "Locate a lava pool or lake.",
      "content": "Locate a lava pool or lake. Explore the map until you find lava. Look for stationary lava source blocks—don’t use lava that’s flowing. Flowing lava will turn into cobblestone, not obsidian. [1] X Research source Lava is most commonly found by digging underground or by exploring caves and ravines. If you’re digging, travel diagonally so you don’t accidentally fall into the lava. You can sometimes find lava on the surface—try scanning the landscape as you fly. Also, some villages have a smithy with two blocks of lava outside. If you’re not sure if a lava block is a source, try picking it up in your bucket. If you can’t pick it up, it’s not a source block."

    {
      "title": "Pour water over the lava.",
      "content": "Pour water over the lava. Equip a water bucket, then place the water one block higher than the lava. The water should flow down and turn the surface of the lake into obsidian. To craft a bucket , arrange 3 iron ingots in a V shape in your crafting table. Then, with the bucket equipped, find water and pick it up—now you have a water bucket. [2] X Research source Some players like to build a small wall on one side of the lava pool before pouring the water. This can reduce the chances of water pushing you into the lava."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour more water over the obsidian blocks.",
      "content": "Pour more water over the obsidian blocks. If you’re mining obsidian in a lava pool, there’s a chance that the blocks underneath the obsidian will be lava. Adding more water will ensure that any lava you uncover will be turned into obsidian or cobblestone. If there is lava underneath the obsidian, stand next to the water and mine the obsidian at its edge. The water should rush in as you mine, turning the next layer into obsidian before the lava can cause any damage. If you don’t add the water, your obsidian could burn up in the lava after you mine it, or you might accidentally fall into the lava and die."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a diamond pickaxe to mine the obsidian.",
      "content": "Use a diamond pickaxe to mine the obsidian. Obsidian is the one of the only blocks in Minecraft that has to be mined with diamond or stronger. Churchill recommends using diamond tools to mine obsidian, as diamonds make durable and efficient tools. You can also use a netherite pickaxe. It can take a few tries to mine obsidian, so keep hitting the block with your pickaxe until it breaks and a smaller piece of obsidian appears. Pick up the obsidian to add it to your inventory. Don’t use anything weaker, like iron, or the obsidian will be destroyed when you try to mine it. The lava blocks won’t regenerate after you mine them, but if there are lava source blocks underneath the obsidian, you can turn them into obsidian blocks as well."

      "content": "Gather dripstone from caves. Go underground and look for a cave filled with pointed stalactites and stalagmites—this is a dripstone cave. Gather a solid dripstone block and a pointed dripstone. [3] X Research source You’ll need a dripstone block and a pointed dripstone for each generator you want to build, so gather several of each if you plan to make multiple lava generators. To make a lava generator, you’ll need to be using Minecraft Java Edition 1.17 or later. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a cauldron where you want the generator to be. Since your lava will be going into a cauldron, you can put your generator anywhere. But since you’ll need to check it regularly, it’s a good idea to put it near your respawn point or a spot where you normally spend a lot of time. [5] X Research source If you don’t already have a cauldron, craft one in your crafting table: 3 ingots on the left side, 3 on the right, and 1 in the bottom center."

Start by placing your dripstone block (you can substitute another fireproof block if you prefer). Then, place the pointed dripstone beneath the dripstone block, turned so it’s pointed down at the cauldron. [6] X Research source You can go a little higher above the cauldron if you want, but don’t place the dripstone any higher than 7 blocks above the cauldron."

Place a lava source block into the opening directly on top of the dripstone block. [7] X Research source To get a lava source block, place non-flowing lava into a bucket. Flowing lava can’t be harvested, so if it goes into the bucket, it’s a lava source block. Lava will slowly drip down and fill the cauldron."

Once the cauldron is full, put the lava block in a bucket—be careful not to fall into the cauldron when you’re harvesting the lava. Then, place the lava on the ground and pour water over it to turn it into obsidian. [8] X Research source Or, if you prefer, you can use that lava source block to build a new generator, allowing you to create twice as many blocks in the same amount of time."

[9] X Research source Place 2 obsidian blocks on the top and bottom of the frame and 3 obsidian blocks on each side for a total of 10 blocks. The corners of the portal do not have to be obsidian."

You'll need to travel a certain minimum distance away from your original Nether portal: PC, Pocket Edition, and Console Edition “large” worlds: Travel 19 blocks away from the portal. Console Edition “medium” worlds: Travel 25 blocks away from the portal. Console Edition “classic” worlds (including all PS3 and Xbox 360 worlds): Travel 45 blocks away from the portal.

Try this only when you're ready to face the fearsome Ender Dragon. If you are on Pocket Edition, the End Portal will only work on infinite (not “Old”) worlds running on version 1.0 or later (released December 2016).
