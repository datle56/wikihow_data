      "content": "Measure out 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of raw or cane sugar. Look for large grained sugar, usually labeled as “raw” or “cane.” Granulated sugar has much finer grains and will yield less sparkly results. [2] X Research source If your goal is to add color rather than shine, granulated sugar will work fine."

      "title": "Mix sugar with a few drops of food coloring in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Mix sugar with a few drops of food coloring in a small bowl. You can use either gel paste or liquid food coloring. You can also make your own food dyes out of natural ingredients like vegetables, fruit juices, and spices. Continue to mix until the color is fully and evenly incorporated into the sugar. [3] X Research source To create new hues, try mixing different food colorings . Green glitter, for example, can be made with 1 drop of blue and 2 drop of yellow food coloring."

Gum arabic picks up color well, so add your color in slowly: a little will go a long way. Whisk until the color and water are fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.
