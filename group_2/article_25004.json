      "content": "Coat your ring with clear nail polish. Use clear nail polish to paint the inside of the ring and any other areas of the piece that come into contact with your finger. Let the ring rest on a clean plate for 20 minutes until it is completely dry before wearing. [1] X Research source Note that for matte rings, applying clear polish will add shine to the piece. The nail polish will naturally wear off over time. To preserve your protective barrier, inspect your ring each time you wear it and reapply the polish as needed."

      "content": "Avoid applying lotions, perfumes, and soaps with your ring on. Take off your rings when you get ready in the morning and every time you wash your hands.

      "title": "Try waterproof eye makeup remover.",
      "content": "Try waterproof eye makeup remover. Dampen a cotton ball with waterproof eye makeup remover, which you can buy at your local beauty supply store. Rub the cotton ball back and forth over the stained area of your finger, paying particular attention to the areas of webbing between your fingers where staining can concentrate. This method is very gentle and best for small areas of staining. You can leave the makeup remover on your skin, there is no need to wash your hands unless desired."

      "title": "Use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Dampen a cotton ball with everyday rubbing alcohol from your local drug store. Rub the cotton ball around the area of staining, taking care to avoid any broken skin. While a little redness is normal in reaction to alcohol, stop if you feel any irritation developing. Wash your hands with tap water and soap after using the rubbing alcohol. Alcohol can dry out your skin, so apply hand lotion when you're finished to moisturize."

      "title": "Use non-acetone nail polish remover.",
      "content": "Use non-acetone nail polish remover. If your staining is extreme, dampen a cotton ball with non-acetone nail polish remover. Wipe the area of staining with the cotton ball, applying gentle pressure. When the stain is removed, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and moisturize. Do not apply nail polish remover on broken or irritated skin. As nail polish remover is very abrasive, don't this method more than once a week."

      "content": "Avoid copper, sterling silver, and other alloyed metals. Ask what a ring is made of before you buy it. Rings made from an alloy—multiple metals combined—rather than a pure metal are more prone to staining your finger. [5] X Research source Copper and copper-alloys are the metals most likely to oxidize and turn green."

      "title": "Choose stainless steel, rhodium, yellow gold, or white gold rings.",
      "content": "Choose stainless steel, rhodium, yellow gold, or white gold rings. Seek out rings of these metals, which are less prone to oxidation and deterioration.

      "title": "Wear necklaces and earrings instead of rings.",
      "content": "Wear necklaces and earrings instead of rings. Opt for jewelry that encounters less everyday wear than a ring. You use your hands a lot, which means your rings are exposed to lots of abrasive hand washing, lotion, and sanitizers. Earrings and necklaces are less likely to stain because they encounter less."

      "title": "Avoid metals in favor of leather or beaded jewelry.",
      "content": "Avoid metals in favor of leather or beaded jewelry. Forego metals altogether in favor of jewelry that wears tougher. Leather, beaded silk, and even plastic can all endure a lot more abuse than some alloyed metals. [7] X Research source"
