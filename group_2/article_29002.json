You want a container with a large surface area and short sides. [1] X Research source A shallow dish helps you catch as many fleas as possible because the short sides won’t act as a barrier for jumping fleas that might land in the trap."

      "content": "Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of dish soap. Squirt 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of liquid dish soap into the water. Swish the water around with a spoon or your finger to distribute the soap throughout the water. Fleas don’t drown in plain water because they aren't heavy enough to break the water’s surface tension. Adding liquid dish soap to the water reduces the surface tension. When the fleas jump into the trap, they sink and drown. [2] X Research source McCombe also recommends adding some Alka Seltzer to the water to make the trap more effective.

      "title": "Place the trap where fleas have been.",
      "content": "Place the trap where fleas have been. A homemade flea trap doesn’t have the power to attract fleas, so it’s best to put it somewhere that fleas have already been in your house. Place a towel on the floor to catch spills, and lay the trap on top of the towel on the floor. Make multiple flea traps for different rooms if necessary. McCombe recommends placing the traps: [4] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. On carpets and rugs. Near pet bedding. Near windows, doors, and food. Around pillows and furniture. Around pet bowls. Near drapes and curtains."

      "title": "Leave the trap overnight.",
      "content": "Leave the trap overnight. Fleas become active a couple of hours before sunset and stay active all night long, so the best time to catch them is overnight. [5] X Research source Once you lay the trap, try to leave it undisturbed for the rest of the night. When possible, close the door to the room to keep pets and kids out."

      "content": "Empty and refill the trap each morning. In the morning, check the trap for dead fleas. If you catch any, dump the soapy water and rinse the dish. Fill the dish with fresh water, add more dish soap, and lay the trap out again on the towel for the next night.

      "content": "Use a lamp to attract fleas. McCombe recommends placing a directional or table lamp beside the trap. Before bed, turn on the lamp and position the bulb above the trap so the light shines into it. As McCombe explains, the fleas will be attracted to the light and warmth, and when they jump toward the light, they’ll land in the trap below. [7] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. Use an incandescent or other heat-producing bulb for your trap to attract the most fleas possible. Make sure the lamp is sturdy and not at risk of being knocked over into the water. Use this attractant only in rooms where you can shut the door and keep people and pets out while the lamp is on."

Place a tea light or votive candle at the center of the trap, and light the candle before bed. As the fleas try to get close to the source, they’ll fall into the trap and drown. [9] X Research source Place the trap away from walls, drapery, and other flammable objects. Always exercise great care and proper fire safety measures when burning candles.

      "content": "Place an indoor plant beside the trap. Fleas are attracted to carbon dioxide, which is part of the mechanism they use to find a host. Because plants release carbon dioxide at night, placing one beside the trap may help to attract more fleas. [10] X Research source Dormant flea pupae are particularly sensitive to carbon dioxide, so this may be a great way to catch young fleas before they have a chance to lay eggs. [11] X Research source"

For stubborn infestations, use a pyrethrin-based pesticide with an insect growth regulator, such as Ultracide or Onslaught . Apply the insecticide inside and outside. Get everybody out of the house. Put on gloves, goggles, long sleeves, and a respirator to apply the insecticide. Use a dust or aerosol product and apply a light mist on floors, walls, furniture, and all other surfaces inside the house. Allow the dust or spray to settle before letting people back in. Vacuum after 48 hours. Outside, apply a layer of dust or spray to the garden, on bushes and shrubs, around tall grass, in wooded areas, and around windows and doors."
