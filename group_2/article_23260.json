      "content": "Watch out for thinning leaves and dead branches. Citrus greening can cause the shoots and foliage of your lemon tree to die off, giving it a sparse and bedraggled look. Keep an eye out for trees that are missing a lot of leaves or have multiple branches that appear dead. [1] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. Your tree might also become stunted (meaning it doesn’t grow as much as it should) or bloom at the wrong time of the year (e.g., in summer or fall instead of spring)."

One of the most distinctive characteristics of citrus greening is an asymmetrical, mottled yellowing of the leaves. In some cases, the veins of the leaves might also turn yellow or bulge out of the leaves (vein corking). The yellowing of leaves with citrus greening can look similar to other conditions, such as root rot or a nutrient deficiency. However, the yellowing caused by citrus greening tends to look more random and less symmetrical than other types of yellowing."

[4] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. They might be asymmetrical or unusually elongated. [5] X Research source If you cut the lemon open, you may notice that the central core is curved or misshapen or that the seeds look shriveled or discolored. The fruit might also have an unpleasant taste. Small or lopsided fruits can also be a sign of stubborn disease, a less common infection that is spread by leafhoppers. [6] X Research source"

Watch your lemons as they ripen. If they turn yellow at the stem end, but the rest of the fruit remains green, it’s possible that they have citrus greening. [8] X Research source Lemons can also remain partially green for other reasons, such as unusually warm weather in the spring. [9] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. If your lemons are still green but your tree seems otherwise healthy, then their color isn’t necessarily a cause for concern."

      "title": "Check the leaves for lesions with concentric rings.",
      "content": "Check the leaves for lesions with concentric rings. Citrus canker infections start out as small, circular lesions on the undersides of the leaves, which quickly spread to the top surface as well. These lesions are typically raised at first, but will eventually develop a raised edge and sunken center, often with concentric rings around the center of the lesion. Look for lesions that are about 2–10 millimetres (0.079–0.394 in) across. The borders of the lesions sometimes develop a yellow halo or have a waterlogged appearance. The lesions are typically brown, but they may develop a grey or white center as the disease progresses."

A lemon with citrus canker will develop brown, circular lesions on the rind. In some cases, these lesions will cluster together and become connected. They’ll typically have a raised center, like a pimple, and may also develop concentric rings around the middle. Check for lesions about 1–10 millimetres (0.039–0.394 in) across. While the inside of the fruit isn’t usually affected by these lesions, some of them can cause the rind to crack and make it easier for other infections to move in. [12] X Research source You might also notice lesions on the stems."

      "title": "Make note of excessive fruit drop.",
      "content": "Make note of excessive fruit drop. Citrus canker normally only affects the appearance of the fruit, leaves, and stems, but in severe cases it can cause the lemons to start dropping off before they’re ripe. [13] X Research source If you notice fruit drop along with other characteristic symptoms, like the lesions on the leaves and fruit, this may be a sign of citrus canker. Severe infections are most common in very warm and wet conditions, e.g., if your lemon trees have been exposed to tropical storms."

      "title": "Watch for dead shoots and thinning leaves.",
      "content": "Watch for dead shoots and thinning leaves. A severe citrus canker infection can cause leaf drop, as well. You might notice that your lemon tree has bald patches, sparse leaves, or shoots that appear entirely dead. [14] X Research source Since there are many conditions that can cause these symptoms, don’t assume your tree has citrus canker based on sparse leaves alone. Look for the more characteristic lesions on the fruit and leaves as well."

      "content": "Ask your local extension office about how to destroy infected trees. If you think your lemon tree has citrus canker, it’s important to eliminate the tree so the infection doesn’t spread. Contact the closest agricultural extension office so they can examine your tree and help you determine what to do next. [15] X Research source The laws regarding the management of citrus canker vary from one place to another. Depending on where you live, you may be required to remove all citrus trees within a certain radius of the affected tree(s)."

      "content": "Look for dark brown or reddish spots or lesions on the fruit. Citrus black spot is a fungal infection that affects the fruit, leaves, and stems of citrus trees. The most recognizable symptom is the development of small spots or lesions on the rind of the fruit. These lesions can have a wide variety of appearances and may range in size from less than 1 millimetre (0.039 in) to 10 millimetres (0.39 in). Look out for lesions on your lemons, which may look like: Brown or brick-red spots with grey or black centers. These lesions may have green halos around them. Lots of tiny, slightly raised bumps that are tan or dark brown, without grey or black centers. These are more likely to appear on lemons that are still green. Large, flat, dark-brown spots with raised cracks on them. These may eventually turn into the more typical lesions with grey or black centers as the fruit matures. Small, reddish, freckle-like spots that are irregular in shape. These most often appear on mature fruits."

      "title": "Check for fruit dropping before it’s ripe.",
      "content": "Check for fruit dropping before it’s ripe. If your lemon is severely infected, the fruit may begin to fall before it has a chance to mature. This is most likely to happen to lemons with “virulent spot” lesions, which are lesions that grow together and expand. In addition to causing fruit drop, virulent spots can grow through the rind and affect the quality of the fruit itself."

      "content": "Watch for reddish-brown lesions on the leaves. Lemons are more likely than other types of citrus to develop lesions on the leaves. Look for lesions that begin as small, raised, reddish areas on the leaves. They will eventually develop a sunken grey center with a brown border. Some lesions may have a yellow halo around them. You might also notice similar lesions on the stems and twigs."

      "content": "Look for warty pink or brown scabs on the fruit. Citrus scab is a fungal infection that causes pustule-like lesions on the rinds of affected fruit. Your lemons may develop raised pinkish or brown spots that become more elevated and well-defined as they mature. In the early stages, it’s easy to confuse these lesions with the ones caused by black spot. However, citrus scab lesions are typically lighter in color and more raised than black spot lesions."

      "content": "Check for raised bumps on leaves with a depression on the underside. In addition to lesions on the fruit, citrus scab causes distinctive lesions on the leaves. On the upper side of the leaf, these lesions may be elevated and scabby looking, typically with a yellowish-brown or grey color. They can cause deep, cone-shaped depressions to form on the underside of the leaf. Leaves that are severely infested might appear deformed, twisted, or crumpled. You might also notice scabby lesions on the twigs and stems."
