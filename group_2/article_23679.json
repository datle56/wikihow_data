      "content": "Include eggs and animal products to get choline in your diet. Egg yolks are one of the most concentrated sources of choline, so cook up an omelet or scrambled eggs to increase your acetylcholine levels. Milk, yogurt, lean meats, and these foods are also high in choline: [1] X Research source Beef or chicken liver Lean ground beef Lean cuts of pork Chicken breast"

      "content": "Eat choline-rich seafood at least once a week. Lots of supplements contain choline from seafood sources, but you can easily eat seafood to get the same benefits. Add cod, salmon, and tilapia to increase your choline levels. [2] X Research source You can also get choline from canned shrimp and tuna."

      "content": "Snack on nuts or add legumes to your meals. Get more choline the next time you reach for a healthy snack or vegetarian meal. Try to eat more nuts, such as peanuts, almonds, and pistachios. These legumes and common beans are high in choline and acetylcholine: [3] X Research source Soy products: soybeans, tofu, soy milk Kidney beans Green beans Peas Mung beans"

      "content": "Try to eat a variety of vegetables every day. Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and radishes, along with nettles, squash, and eggplant are great sources of choline and acetylcholine. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aim for 1/2 cup (60 g) of cooked vegetables or 1 cup (225 g) of raw, leafy veggies."

      "content": "Get choline by eating wild strawberries, orange juice, and figs. Although fruits don't contain as much choline as vegetables or dairy products, some fruits have choline. In addition to wild strawberries, orange juice, and dried figs, you can eat clementines and apricots. [5] X Research source Citrus fruits, such as limes, grapefruits, and naval oranges, all contain low levels of choline."

      "content": "Mix wheat germ or brewer's yeast into smoothies or yogurt. Purchase wheat germ or brewer's yeast from your grocery store's bulk bins or a local health food store. Stir a spoonful of wheat germ or brewer's yeast into yogurt, smoothies, or fruit sauces to increase your choline and acetylcholine levels. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also add wheat germ or brewer's yeast to baked goods. Try stirring it into bran muffins or fruit bread, for instance."

      "content": "Take a choline supplement to help your brain create more acetylcholine. In order to make more acetylcholine, your body needs choline. If you're concerned that you're not getting enough choline in your diet, talk with your doctor about taking a phosphatidylcholine (PC) supplement every day. [7] X Research source Most choline supplements contain around 10 to 250 mg of choline and assorted B-complex vitamins."

Studies show that lactobacillus species can increase acetylcholine production in your brain.

      "content": "Include an acetyl-L-carnitine supplement. Research shows that an acetyl-L-carnitine supplement can help your brain release acetylcholine so buy a high-quality supplement after you talk with your doctor. It's important to take acetyl-L-carnitine because your body absorbs this better than L-carnitine and it's more likely to make it into your brain. [10] X Research source Although studies show this is a safe supplement to take for increasing acetylcholine, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't set daily intake recommendations because it doesn't feel that acetyl-L-carnitine is an essential nutrient."

      "content": "Avoid taking dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) supplement. If you've been looking for supplements that claim to raise your choline levels, you might have seen DMAE supplements mentioned. Unfortunately, more research is needed to determine how DMAE interacts with acetylcholine. Most studies on DMAE were done almost 50 years ago and give conflicting evidence about whether or not it increases choline levels."

      "content": "Talk with your doctor about medications that inhibit acetylcholine. Some medications can inhibit or block the brain from activating acetylcholine. These include medications for depression, urinary incontinence, and insomnia. Ask your doctor if any of the medications you're taking are anticholinergic.

[12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Ask your doctor if new research has been done on the effects of antihistamines on acetylcholine levels. Not much is known about acetylcholine, so there are a lot of ongoing scientific studies."
