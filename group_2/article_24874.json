While there haven't been many scientific studies about vinegar being effective for spiders, it doesn't hurt to try spraying it around your patio's perimeter. Citrus and peppermint oils are poisonous to cats, so avoid using them if you have any pets nearby. If you’re concerned about using other essential oils, ask a vet if they’re safe around your pets.
