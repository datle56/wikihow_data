Working out 5 days per week is typical for models, although some days will be harder than others, depending on what exercises and muscle groups you’ll be working. It’s important to take those 2 off-days to rest your muscles and prevent injury. It's not unusual for some models to take things up a notch a few weeks before a big show and work out 6-7 times a week. Lingerie/swimsuit models might even work out twice a day in the weeks leading up to a show.

Getting into great shape is a must no matter what kind of model you want to be, but you should tweak your exercise plan to reflect the specific kind of work you want to do. For example, fashion models that walk the runway have lean bodies with toned but not overly large muscles. Swimsuit and lingerie models, like Victoria’s Secret models, need to be lean , toned, and curvy to show off the merchandise. [11] X Research source If you want to be a swimsuit or lingerie model, you will need to incorporate more strength training into your routine. Workouts should include specific exercises to work key areas like the bust, waist, and hips. For runway models, cardio is the most important aspect, with light strength training. You want to be lean without gaining a lot of visible muscle. For male models, muscle building and strength training are important, but you still want to maintain a lean body without a huge amount of muscle mass."

However, before embarking on a strict diet, it's a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor. Get a routine check-up and discuss healthy diet goals in an open and honest way. If your doctor feels that your weight goals are extreme or unhealthy, don't ignore their advice. [12] X Research source Tell your doctor that you want to pursue a career in modeling. That way, they can work with you to create goals that don't jeopardize your overall health. If you don't explain that you want to be a model and only discuss getting as thin as possible, your doctor may express concern about your self-image. Keep in mind that having a \"model body\" may not be healthy for your height and body frame. Your health is much more important than conforming to unrealistic beauty standards."
