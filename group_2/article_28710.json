      "content": "Decide how long you want your skirt to be. If you want a full length cage skirt, use your waist to ankle measurement; if you want a knee length cage skirt, use your waist to knee measurement; etc. Note this number for when you go to purchase your fabric."

      "content": "Decide how full you want your skirt to be. To do this, lay the boning in a circle on the floor around you and keep widening or narrowing the circle until the hoop is the size that you want the largest part of your skirt to be. You can also use a simple math equation to figure out how long to make your boning strip. For example, if you want your skirt to be 30\" across at the widest part, multiply 30 by Pi (3.14) and use the rounded result (94inches) as your boning length. [2] X Research source"

Add one inch to the width for the hem and add two inches to the length for the hem and waistband. Have your desired fabric cut to this length and width or do it yourself. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase your fabric.",
      "content": "Purchase your fabric. Unless you plan to wear the skirt on its own, you can use any color or type of fabric that you want. The skirt or dress that you wear over your hoop skirt will cover it. However, you will want to consider a couple of things as you choose a fabric. Consider the transparency of the dress you will wear the cage skirt underneath. If the dress or skirt that you will wear the cage skirt underneath is light or slightly transparent, you will want to choose a light color fabric for the cage skirt. Consider the ease of sewing with the fabric. You may have a hard time completing this project if you choose a slippery fabric like satin. To make this project easier, opt for a light cotton or some other easy to sew fabric. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine how many hoops you will need. The hoops should be spaced about 4-5 inches apart to make sure that your skirt has a nice shape. Therefore, the number of hoops that you will need will depend on the length of your skirt. Divide the length of your skirt by 4 or 5 to find this number. For example, a skirt that will be 35\" long should have 7 hoops because 35 divided by 5 equals 7. You may end up using one less hoop than you calculate since you will need to leave 2 inches below your bottom hoop and a couple of extra inches above your top hoop."

Therefore, if the length of boning for your bottom hoop is going to be 94\", the next hoop might be 87 inches, then the next one might be 80\", and so on. Add up the lengths to determine how much boning material you will need to purchase."

Some materials you can use include: [5] X Research source 1/4\" plastic strapping material used for wood shipments.

You will need 1” wide ribbon to secure the hoops to the skirt.The amount of ribbon you will need will depend on your number of hoops and the width of your largest piece of boning. So for a skirt with seven hoops and a 94\" piece of boning, you would need 658\" of ribbon (94 times 7 equals 658). You will probably need to convert this number into feet or yards to make purchasing the ribbon easier. [6] X Research source"

Cut a small hole in the tube you have created. Attach a safety pin to a piece of ribbon and close it. Use the safety pin to help you work the ribbon through the tubing. When the safety pin comes out the other side, remove the safety pin and gently tug the ends of the ribbon to cinch the waist.
