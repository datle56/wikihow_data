      "title": "Stretch the arms, wrists, and fingers to loosen them up.",
      "content": "Stretch the arms, wrists, and fingers to loosen them up. Have the person you're massaging extend one arm out in front of them with their palm facing the floor. Lift the fingers up toward the ceiling, keeping the arm straight. Then, have them reach over with their other hand to gently pull their fingers back and stretch their wrist. Hold for a count of 3, then release. Repeat with the other arm. [3] X Research source Do the same stretch pointing the fingers down toward the floor. This stretches the other side of the arm and wrist. Stretch each finger as well, using the same motions as you did with the wrist. This helps loosen up your joints and get your fingers ready for massage. Some fingers might be able to bend easier than others, and that's okay! Don't try to force the fingers into an uncomfortable position."

      "content": "Wrap the hand in a warm towel. Get a hand towel damp with warm water and wrap it around the hand you're going to massage. Then, wrap a dry towel around the outside. It helps to lay the dry towel down under the hand before you wrap it in the warm towel so it's ready to go. [4] X Research source Press the towel into the hand gently to help absorb the warmth, then unwrap it and dry off the hand with the dry towel. Don't leave the warm towel wrapped around the hand for more than a minute or so. You could also try a hot wax dip if you have a paraffin unit. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub your thumbs over the top of the hand in a circular motion. Hold the hand with your fingers under the palm and your thumbs on top and make large circles with both thumbs, spreading the skin along the top of the hand for relaxation. Do this for about 2 minutes. This helps warm up and loosen the hand. [6] X Research source It also helps to pull and massage each of the fingers individually, rubbing your thumb in a circular motion moving upward from the base to the tip of each finger. [7] X Research source You can use a little lotion, cream, or massage oil if you like, but keep it minimal. You don't want your fingers to slip as you work. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Massage the thumb to ease spinal tension. The spinal line of the hand runs from the tip of the thumb down the side of the hand and all the way to the base at the center of the wrist. Use your thumb to press into the skin as you massage down this line. [9] X Research source Focus on just the outer edge, the outline of the hand from the tip of the thumb to the center of the wrist."

      "title": "Turn the hand over to work on the sinuses, head, and neck.",
      "content": "Turn the hand over to work on the sinuses, head, and neck. The tips of each finger correspond to the reflex points for the sinuses. Press your thumb into the tips of each finger, starting with the pinkie and moving through each finger to the thumb. Spend about 5 seconds massaging each finger before moving on to the next. [10] X Research source Once you've finished the tips of the fingers, move down to the part of the finger under the second joint and repeat the same process to massage the reflex points associated with the neck."

      "title": "Work across the \"diaphragm line\" with your thumbs.",
      "content": "Work across the \"diaphragm line\" with your thumbs. While holding and supporting the hand with one of your hands, press your thumb into the line just under the knuckles and work your way all the way across the palm. You can also press both thumbs into the center of the palm and work outward along the line. [11] X Research source Curl your thumb at the center of the palm to \"hook\" your thumb under the diaphragm line and press into the palm in pulses for 5-10 seconds. Massaging the diaphragm line, according to reflexologists, helps reduce tension in the diaphragm muscle. This muscle can become tense when someone is under a lot of stress and their breaths are quick and shallow."

      "title": "Use the thumb-walking technique to massage the full palm.",
      "content": "Use the thumb-walking technique to massage the full palm. Using your fingers on the other side of the hand for balance and stability, slowly walk your thumb across the palm, pressing gently but firmly into the hand. If you're giving someone else a massage, you can start with both thumbs in the center of the palm and gradually walk them out toward the edge of the hand. [12] X Research source Search online for a hand reflexology chart, which will show you the specific zones for each hand. These charts often have minor differences, which is why it's best to massage the entire hand rather than trying to focus on a specific zone. Each area or \"zone\" of the palm corresponds to a reflex point for a different part of the body. The reflex points on each palm correspond to organs and muscles on that side of the body.

      "title": "Repeat the entire massage on the other hand.",
      "content": "Repeat the entire massage on the other hand. Massaging the other hand allows you to hit the reflex points that correspond to the other side of the body. As with the first hand, go slowly and pay more attention to areas with more tension. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It's a good idea to close your eyes as you work so you can completely focus on the feeling. Stay in the same spot until you feel a subtle shift in the sensation, then move to the next area. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Stroke the hands lightly to end the session. Use fluid movements, massaging lightly from the base of the hand to the tips of the fingers. You might also gently shake or wiggle the fingers to help loosen them up a bit. [16] X Research source If you have a paraffin unit, you might also end the session with a hot wax dip. [17] X Research source Another option might be a brief soak in some warm water with a few drops of a relaxing essential oil."

      "content": "Wash the feet or soak them in warm water for 10-20 minutes. Washing the feet ensures they're clean and also helps relax the feet so your massage will be more beneficial. A relaxing foot soak also helps calm the body and mind. [18] X Research source To combine aromatherapy, you might include a few drops of a relaxing essential oil, such as lavender, in the foot soak water. Epsom salts are also beneficial for relaxation."

      "content": "Rub the feet with lotion to warm them up. Use a small amount of your favorite lotion or massage oil and rub all over the tops and soles of your feet. Make sure you get the toes as well, moving them around a little to loosen them up and warm up the joints. [19] X Research source Grab the top of each foot with your fingers between the toes and move the foot slowly in a circle, 3 times in one direction and then 3 times in the other, to loosen up the ankle. Make a fist and glide it down the sole of each foot from the toes to the heel. This helps warm up the soles of the feet."

      "content": "Walk your thumbs down the center of the foot. With your fingers around the top of the foot for support and stability, press your thumb gently but firmly into the top center of the foot. Press 2-3 times in the same spot, then move just below that spot and repeat the process. Keep going until you've reached the heel. [20] X Research source If you have long fingernails or if your thumbs become tired or sore, try using the first knuckle of your index finger instead."

      "content": "Massage the big toe to activate the head and brain reflex points. Press into the middle of the top of the big toe with your thumb to activate the reflex point for the pituitary gland. Then, move down to the base of the big toe to activate the reflex points for the neck, throat, and thyroid gland. [21] X Research source The other 4 toes correspond to the sinuses. Massage them just as you did the big toe. The base of the second and third toes correspond to the eyes, while the third and fourth toes correspond to the ears."

      "title": "Use the thumb-walking technique to massage the middle of the foot.",
      "content": "Use the thumb-walking technique to massage the middle of the foot. The reflex points in this part of the foot correspond to abdominal organs on either side of the body. Search for a reflexology foot chart online so you can identify the specific zones that correspond to the organs and tissues in the body. [23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep in mind that different reflexology charts might label the zones a little differently. That's why it's generally better to massage the whole foot rather than trying to focus on a specific area."

      "title": "Activate spinal reflex points along the inside edge and heel.",
      "content": "Activate spinal reflex points along the inside edge and heel. The spinal reflex points follow the inside edge of each foot. Since your spine runs down the center of your body, the reflex points on each foot work together. The heel corresponds to the tailbone and lower back. These reflex points relieve spinal tension and can help ease back pain. [24] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The reflex point that corresponds to the sciatic nerve runs across the top of the heel on both feet. The tailbone is the inside edge of the heel, while the heel itself corresponds to the lower back generally."

The reflex points on each foot correspond to the muscles and organs on that side of the body so a full reflexology foot massage always includes both feet. As with the first foot, give extra attention to areas that feel particularly tight or tense. [25] X Research source"
