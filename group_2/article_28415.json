      "title": "Look for skirts and dresses that end either mid-thigh or mid-calf.",
      "content": "Look for skirts and dresses that end either mid-thigh or mid-calf. These lengths are going to hit your leg at its shapeliest points (the widest part of your calf muscle and the widest part of your thigh). When your hem is at the widest part of your leg, it gives the impression that the rest of your leg will continue to fill out underneath the skirt. Consider pairing shorter skirts with tall boots. This way, you only reveal the wider section of your leg. The straight lines of an A-line skirt can accentuate any curves in your legs. Just try not to choose one that flares out too much, or your legs can look lost in the middle of all that fabric. A maxi dress or skirt will cover your legs entirely, but make sure they are fitted at the waist and above so you don't like you're being overwhelmed by a dress that is too large."

      "title": "Wear straight-legged or boot-cut pants.",
      "content": "Wear straight-legged or boot-cut pants. The flare adds a little weight and structure to your leg and disguises a slim calf. Make sure the pants are fitted at the thigh--if they're loose all over, they'll overwhelm your figure and can actually emphasize your thinness. A straight-legged or cigarette pant that isn't skin-tight around your calf can create the illusion of a shapelier leg. Avoid leggings, jeggings, and super-skinny pants, as they are meant to make the leg appear slimmer. If you just can't resist leggings, try layering with leg warmers or tall, thick socks. These will add a little bulk to your calf."

      "title": "Play with bold patterns and bright or light colors.",
      "content": "Play with bold patterns and bright or light colors. Tights or pants in lighter shades like off-white, pale blue or gray or bright colors like red or yellow will add dimension to your legs. Big, bold prints can make your leg appear wider--try florals, Fair Isle, plaids, or horizontal or diagonal stripes. Dark colors like black and navy, or denim in dark washes, have a slimming effect and should be avoided. Vertical or pinstripes will only make your leg look slimmer, so stick to the patterns that make your legs look shapely."

      "title": "Choose shorts with narrow leg openings and end mid-thigh.",
      "content": "Choose shorts with narrow leg openings and end mid-thigh. Shorts with wide legs or legs that billow out can make your legs look tiny--all the negative space can highlight how your legs are not filling out your shorts. The middle of your thigh is probably the thickest part of your leg, and you can create the illusion that your thighs are just as thick all the way up. Shorter shorts will usually hit your leg right where you want, at the widest part of the thigh."

      "title": "Wear boots that are fitted in the calf.",
      "content": "Wear boots that are fitted in the calf. There shouldn't be a lot of empty space at the top of your boot, as this will emphasize the narrowness of your leg. If you can't find knee-length boots that don't make your legs look like matchsticks, opt for a mid-calf boot instead. It's easier to find a snug-fitting boot for this thicker part of your leg. A slouchy boot, like a Peter Pan style, is meant to fit a little loose, so it may not look unusual if they are a little baggy around your legs. Try padding out your boots with leg warmers or thick, tall socks."

      "title": "Watch out for heavy, chunky shoes.",
      "content": "Watch out for heavy, chunky shoes. If you are clomping around in a heavy shoe, your ankles are going to look even more delicate. Lightweight flats and sandals with cuffs around the ankles will balance or even camouflage narrow ankles. A high-heel will cause your calves to flex and emphasize the muscle."

      "title": "Draw the eye elsewhere.",
      "content": "Draw the eye elsewhere. If you're self-conscious about your legs, force people to look at something other than your skinny stems. Wear an embellished top, attention-grabbing lipstick, a gorgeous necklace or chandelier earrings."

      "title": "Wear straight-legged pants with a flat front.",
      "content": "Wear straight-legged pants with a flat front. Pants that are slightly fitted in the thigh and follow--but don't cling to--the line of the calf will look clean and sharp without calling attention to narrow calves. Pleated pants may add some volume, but can puff up and look strange when you sit. Skinny jeans or tapered pants will make your legs look like toothpicks and should be avoided. Flared or boot-cut pants may disguise a skinny calf, but they tend to look sloppy on men. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose clothes that are tailored or fitted, but not tight or super baggy. Though you may think that baggy or big clothes are disguising your thin legs, it's actually calling attention to them. If it looks like you can't fill out your pants or they're two sizes too big, it just makes your legs appear smaller. This goes for accessories, too. A huge belt or belt buckle may overwhelm your lower half. Instead, try an eye-catching pattern on your shirt or tie to draw attention away from your legs."

      "content": "Wear light colors and horizontal stripes. Pinstripes are a no-no since they'll only make your legs look longer and skinnier. Dark colors have a slimming effect, so choose jeans in a lighter wash and try light gray, beige, or khaki trousers instead of black."
