If hearing loss is interfering with your everyday life, then it’s time to see your doctor. Make an appointment and let the doctor examine your ears to determine what’s causing it and find the right solutions. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The exam will probably include an inspection of your ears and a simple hearing test. Some doctors have specialized equipment that can do a more thorough test of your eardrums. The doctor may refer you to an ear specialist (otolaryngologist) or audiologist for further testing. This can pin down exactly what’s causing your hear loss and how to fix it. While you need an exam for any hearing loss, a sudden loss of hearing, particularly in one ear, could be a serious medical problem. Don’t hesitate to see your doctor in this case."

Over 200 medications could fall into this category, and there’s no reliable way to determine who will experience this side effect. The best thing to do is monitor your hearing and tell your doctor immediately if you notice any problems after taking medication. [12] X Research source Some medications that can cause temporary hearing loss include salicylate pain relievers like aspirin, quinine, and some diuretics. Other medications could cause permanent damage if you take them long enough. These include some antibiotics like gentamicin and chemotherapy drugs. Hearing loss is much more common if you take high doses or multiple types of ototoxic medicines at the same time. Always take your medication as directed to reduce the chance. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Try sound location exercises to sharpen your hearing. You might be able to maintain or improve your hearing with practice. Have someone hide an item that makes a repetitive sound, like an alarm. Then make the environment noisy, like by turning on the TV. Try to lock on to the sound and follow it to find the object. Doing this repeatedly can improve your ability to focus on specific sounds. For a similar hearing exercise, try listening to someone read out loud in a noisy environment. Block out the distracting noise and try to focus solely on the reading. If you already have hearing loss, then sound location exercises probably won’t help. You need a medical exam and possibly hearing aids to fix this."
