      "content": "A low taper fade transitions from long to short at the nape of the neck. This style typically features longer hair on top and a very short, to-the-skin cut at the neckline, with the length gradually shortening between them. It’s called a “low” taper fade since the actual fade portion—where the hair shortens dramatically to the skin—sits low on the head, around the nape of the neck. [1] X Research source It also preserves some of the sideburns. It’s a popular style that results in a neat look with plenty of precision and edge. Low taper fades might grow out relatively quickly and won’t have the same sharp definition a couple weeks after the cut, but they tend to retain their overall shape for a few months, making them a good long-term cut. A high taper fade, on the other hand, shortens to the skin much higher on the head, and may take some extra effort to maintain."

      "content": "Request a low fade with a gradual taper and volume on top. When you sit in the barber’s seat, ask for a low fade at the nape of your neck, and specify that you want plenty of volume on top. Usually, the shortest hair in a low taper fade is only about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) long—ask for the #2 clippers to get this length. [2] X Research source How you treat the hair on top will depend on your personal style and your barber’s recommendation. Often, low taper fades are accompanied by a “fringe” or “textured” cut on top, which provides volume and easy styling. Wash, comb , and thoroughly dry your hair before your appointment to give your barber a clean and tangle-free canvas to work with."

When you show your barber photos of the cut you want, they’ll know exactly the look you’re going for without having to translate hairstyle lingo. Browse TikTok or Instagram for the perfect low taper fade, save some photos, and have them ready when you walk in. Also, feel free to pick and choose elements from reference photos. Maybe you want the texture from one photo on top, with the sideburns from another photo, plus another Instagram user’s fade at the back."

Remember that your barber is a professional—they’ve got plenty of training and experience, and generally know which cuts look best on which face shapes and with which types of hair. Even if you go in with the perfect reference photo, your barber might suggest ways to tweak the style to suit you, personally. Don’t be afraid to discuss your preferred style and listen to their advice. [3] X Research source Of course, at the end of the day, it’s your hair and your money, so you make the final call. If you’re dead set on a particular cut, go for it! Worst case is you grow it out and cut it again."

Your barber uses special scissors to give you a medium-length, semi-ragged cut on top that provides a fair amount of texture and volume. The best part is that a fringe works with most lengths of hair. It’s chic, youthful, and a great blend of careful grooming and just-got-out-of-bed styling. [4] X Research source"

A taper is a general term for a uniform, gradual shortening in length, from longer hair on top to shorter hair lower on the neck.

      "content": "A fade is when your hair shortens down to the skin. When considering a taper vs. a fade , think of a fade as a more extreme taper, where the hair shortens and blends down to the skin, often in a much shorter space (including on the sides of your head). [17] X Research source So a fade is a sort of taper, but a taper isn’t necessarily a fade. Fades come in 3 main varieties: High fades shorten to the skin high on the head, above your ears and natural hair line. Medium fades shorten a bit further down, near the center of the back of your head. Low fades shorten more toward the nape of the neck."

      "content": "A taper fade is an unofficial combination of a taper and a fade. We’ll let you in on a little insider secret—there isn’t really any such thing as a “taper fade.” The term most likely came about because customers tend to confuse tapers and fades, and so used them interchangeably, and the name just stuck. [18] X Research source Now, though, a taper fade is often a style that tapers from long to short as it moves down the head, then abruptly fades to skin, combining the 2 styles. If you ask for just a “taper fade” without giving any more details, a barber will most likely give you a simple, low taper."
