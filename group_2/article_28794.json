When the police arrive, you will have to provide \"probable cause\" for making the arrest. This means you'll have to show that you had a reasonable belief that the person you arrested committed a crime. For example, if you see a person use a knife to stab another person, you've seen a crime and can detain the perpetrator."

In these states the citizen's arrest statute doesn't allow a citizen's arrest based upon \"probable cause\".

The person you're arresting must fully understand what's happening. Explain to the potential criminal why you are making a citizen's arrest. If you can’t provide them with this information, then you shouldn't be making the arrest. In some states, you must communicate to the individual the specific criminal offense for which the individual is being arrested for. Leave it to the police to read the person their rights.
