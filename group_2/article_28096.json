You'll then see the volume level under the header \"Volume Level\" and can tap Loud to change it. For Android, scroll down to \"Volume Level\" and tap Normal to change it to Loud . Loud will reduce dynamic levels, but the songs will playback louder. It's useful if you're listening to your phone in the gym or somewhere else that's noisy. Normal is the default setting and what most people use. Quiet provides the cleanest playback when you're listening to music and is best utilized if you're chilling at home or in a quiet environment. Those using a free account only see the option to normalize the music. This setting balances the music so soft and loud songs are more uniform. [1] X Research source"
