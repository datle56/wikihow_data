She asks her victims if she’s pretty, and if they say yes, she takes off her mask to reveal her bloody face. She repeats the question and then slashes her victim ear-to-ear regardless of their answer. [2] X Research source To survive an encounter with Kuchisake-onna, give an ambiguous answer like “You’re all right.” This will confuse the spirit and give you time to escape."
