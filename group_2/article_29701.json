      "title": "Check when the next city council meeting is being held.",
      "content": "Check when the next city council meeting is being held. Check your city government’s website to see when city council meetings are scheduled in your area. Many city council meetings are held twice a month on a set day of the week. Write the meeting times in a planner or calendar so you don’t forget to attend them. [1] X Research source If you cannot find meeting times online, you may need to call your city’s government center to find out when meetings take place."

      "title": "Look at the issues on the agenda for the meeting to see what’s being discussed.",
      "content": "Look at the issues on the agenda for the meeting to see what’s being discussed. Your city council will release the topics they’re covering 5-7 days in advance online or at City Hall. Look over the information being covered during the meeting to see if there are any issues you have concerns about. Research any topics you’re unfamiliar with so you know what to expect from the discussion. [2] X Research source Some cities only let you speak about the topics and issues covered during that meeting while others let you speak about any city-related issue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a topic you have concerns about for your public comment.",
      "content": "Pick a topic you have concerns about for your public comment. Many public comment portions of city council meetings are open to talk about any issue you’re having in the city. Think about issues you or members of your community have experienced that you can address at the meeting. You can comment on things happening currently or future legislation that’s being discussed. [3] X Research source For example, you may bring up issues about speeding vehicles on your street or improvements that could be made to a public space. Public comments have a time limit so the council can hear multiple people during the meeting. Only choose 1 topic to cover per meeting so you have time to talk about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sign up to speak before the meeting begins if you need to.",
      "content": "Sign up to speak before the meeting begins if you need to. Most city councils require you to sign up at least 15 minutes before the start of the meeting. First, check the website for your city’s government to see what the rules are for signing up to speak. If you can’t sign up early, arrive at the meeting about 30 minutes early so you can sign up. [4] X Research source City councils may not accept sign-ups after the cut-off time. You must sign yourself up. You cannot have another person sign up for you. Usually, you must be a city resident or a state taxpayer to participate in a city council meeting."

    {
      "title": "Step up to one of the microphones at the meeting when it’s time to speak.",
      "content": "Step up to one of the microphones at the meeting when it’s time to speak. If you didn’t have to sign up ahead of time, stand up during the public comment portion of the meeting and form a line by the microphone. If you did sign up, wait until your name or number is called before approaching the microphone. Make sure it’s turned on and adjust the height of the stand if you need to. [5] X Research source If there wasn’t a sign-up and the line is long, the council may cut off the public comment section even if you didn’t get a chance to speak. Wear a business casual outfit so you can look professional so people take you seriously."
    },
    {
      "title": "State your name and where you live if it’s required.",
      "content": "State your name and where you live if it’s required. Once you reach the microphone, say your full name out loud so the council knows how to address you if they need to. Some city council meetings require you to state where you live so the council can reference your concerns to a zone of the city. Give your address if they need it; otherwise, mention the area of the city you want to address if any. [6] X Research source Check your city government’s regulations to see what information you need to provide while you’re presenting."

    {
      "title": "Voice your opinion clearly to the council and community.",
      "content": "Voice your opinion clearly to the council and community. Talk to the council as a whole rather than addressing an individual council member. Try to summarize the main point of your comment in 1 sentence so the council members know what to expect while you’re speaking. Do your best to avoid using filler words, such as “ah” or “um,” and talk about the concerns you have. Use the rest of your time to give evidence to the concern you’re making so the council members understand why you’re bringing it up. [7] X Research source For example, you may say something like, “I believe the city should put a 4-way stop at the intersection of 1st and Park Street because there are many families with small children living the neighborhood.” Don’t be disorderly or verbally attack any of the council members since they can cut you off and prevent you from speaking. Don’t use your time to promote any products, services, or other candidates for public positions."

      "title": "End your comment when you’ve reached about 3 minutes.",
      "content": "End your comment when you’ve reached about 3 minutes. City council public comments usually have a time limit between 2-3 minutes so the members can hear from multiple people. Watch the time so you can address all of the concerns you need to in the time frame. When your time is up, thank the council and return to your seat. [8] X Research source Many city councils will give you a 30-second warning so you have time to wrap up your comment. Council members might not answer or talk back to you while you’re presenting."
