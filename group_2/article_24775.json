      "content": "Drink a lot of water . The human body is made of about 50-65% of water, and you need to keep replenishing it. Your body sweats a lot of that water so you need to put it back in. The amount of water you should drink relies on how much you weigh. To calculate how much water you should be drinking, take your weight and multiply it by 67% (2/3). So, for instance, if you weigh 130 pounds (59 kg) you should be drinking about 87 oz (2.6 L) of water per day. [6] X Research source If you are exercising you will need to increase your amount of water intake to replenish what you are sweating out."
