      "content": "Snapchat has some risks but is mostly safe for kids 16 and older. Common Sense Media, a leading nonprofit organization that rates media for teens, has rated Snapchat as appropriate for teens that are 16 or older since it’s expected that they have the maturity to understand and navigate the risks of the app. [1] X Research source While Snapchat has lots of fun features that make it an appealing creative and social outlet for kids, there are potential risks to keep in mind before deciding if you should let your child use Snapchat: Time wasting and app addiction caused by the “countdown” element of Snap Streaks and stories that make kids feel like they have to check in on the app constantly. Misleading disappearing messages that make kids and teens feel like the app is safe when, in reality, any online content can be saved, shared, and potentially stay online forever. [2] X Research source Social media pressure to maintain a certain image or persona online that can cause insecurity and anxiety about personal appearance and social status. Cyberbullying between other kids on the app, which is unfortunately common on every social media app. [3] X Research source Exposure to inappropriate content in the Discover section or messaging, as well as advertising and marketing data collection. Privacy and safety issues with Snap Map location sharing, third-party data collection, the ability to screenshot Snaps, and features like Spotlight and Memories that allow kids to save Snaps. Online predators who may use the app to connect with or engage in inappropriate behavior with minors. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Filters and lenses",
      "content": "Filters and lenses One of the defining features of Snapchat is the filters and lenses that add color gradients, texts, images, and even AI designs on top of the user's face. These filters can alter the user’s facial structure, skin tone, body shape, and more. Augmented Reality (AR) filters can also add fake backgrounds to photos or transform the user into a different age or species. [5] X Research source Potential Risks: Snapchat filters can be silly and fun, but they can also exacerbate body image or dysmorphia issues. The filters that change a person’s body shape or facial features are sometimes used to appear more conventionally attractive on the app, which can warp young users’ idea of what they “should” look like.

      "title": "Snapstreaks",
      "content": "Snapstreaks Snapstreaks keeps track of how many days in a row that two users have sent direct messages to each other. From the app’s perspective, Snapstreaks encourage engagement and competition, driving young users to use the app at least once a day. [7] X Research source Potential Risks: Snapstreaks aren’t particularly harmful, but they are designed to keep users engaged and even addicted to the app. Some users take their “streaks” very seriously, even going so far as to give their friends their login information if they can’t keep up their streaks for whatever reason."

      "title": "Snap Map",
      "content": "Snap Map The Snap Map allows users to share their physical location with friends on a virtual map. Essentially, your child’s Snapchat friends can know the location of their phone at all times. The location can also be shared as a public Snapchat story if set as such by the user, which can send the location to Snapchat users outside their contact list. [8] X Research source Potential Risks: The location sharing is sometimes precise enough that users can see the street or building that the sharer is in. This information could expose them to stalking or otherwise malicious and inappropriate behavior. Snapchat offers a feature called “Ghost Mode,” which prohibits location sharing and disallows the Snap Map feature."

      "title": "Snapcode",
      "content": "Snapcode A Snapcode is a unique QR code that each user has. To add friends on the app, one user can simply take a picture of the other person’s code and automatically be added to their friends list. [9] X Research source Potential Risks: Snapcode makes it really easy for users to add anyone as a friend, meaning that some kids and teens may have virtual strangers on their friends list. When they share their location or content online, their personal information may be shared with people they hardly know or trust."

      "title": "Snapchat Stories",
      "content": "Snapchat Stories A Snapchat story is a photo, text, or video post that’s shared with all of a user’s contacts for up to 24 hours. Snapchat users who have signed up for an account with a birth date that claims they’re 18 or older can post public stories, meaning any Snapchat user around the globe can use it. [10] X Research source Snapchat also offers “After Dark Stories,” which can only be posted between 8:00 pm and 5:00 am, which may encourage the posting of mature or suggestive content. [11] X Research source Potential Risks: Posting stories may increase the chance that a user’s content gets screenshotted. Posting a public story may allow strangers to see where the poster lives or initiate potentially inappropriate communication with them. The After Dark Stories can also expose kids to age-inappropriate content."

These stories may target impressionable young demographics and promote product launches directly to teens. [12] X Research source Potential Risks: While these advertisements can be harmful in encouraging teens to buy certain products or foster certain insecurities, they can also help companies build profiles for future ad tracking."

Similar to TikTok, the media on this page comes in the form of short videos or pictures of custom content. [13] X Research source Potential Risks: Snapchat Discover could expose your child to pieces of media that you might not want them to be seeing. Snapchat does have moderation rules and has made attempts to tighten content guidelines on the Discover page, but inappropriate or harmful content may still surface."

      "content": "Spotlight The Spotlight feature allows users who claim to be 18 or older to post vertical video content that lasts 24 hours and is shared with other users. Similar to TikTok, Spotlight users can earn more money and attention to their profile for more interactions and views on their videos. [14] X Research source Potential Risks: Due to the financial incentive of Spotlight, younger users could lie about their age and potentially post inappropriate videos for the sake of attention or a desire to go viral."

      "content": "Snap Tokens Snap Tokens are a type of monetary currency used within the app to purchase digital goods or play Snapchat games. These tokens are purchased with real money and can be given as gifts to content creators, who can then convert their tokens into real cash. [16] X Research source Potential Risks: Snap Tokens could lead to reckless spending of money for kids with access to a credit or debit card. This system can also lead to teens forging parasocial bonds with creators or feeling addicted to the app because they want to play more games and unlock more tokens."

Have a conversation about what type of messages, photos, and other content is appropriate to send and receive on Snapchat. Be as specific as possible as you tell them how to stay safe on Snapchat —for example, you might tell them that nudity and cyberbullying are inappropriate types of content to share and engage in. [21] X Research source Along with placing parental controls and disabling features on your child’s phone, it’s crucial to educate them on how they can responsibly (and safely use) their apps.

      "content": "Discuss digital literacy issues like digital footprint and stranger danger. With children growing up in an age of rampant digital technology, it’s vital that they understand the risks of using the internet. [22] X Research source Remind your child to think before they post and that it’s nearly impossible to permanently delete something from the internet—even celebrities struggle to completely scrub the internet of unwanted photos! Also, make sure your child understands that they should not add or accept friend requests from people they do not know. Be clear that meeting up with someone they’ve only met online can be extremely dangerous, no matter how trustworthy they believe this person to be. Along with stranger danger, educate them on how risky it can be to share their location online. If they still choose to share their location at all, it should only be with very close and trusted friends."

Educate yourself on the risks and dangers of Snapchat, and consider whether your child is responsible about online privacy and safety. Keep in mind that Snapchat can be beneficial for kids who have the emotional maturity to handle social media apps. For example, letting your child have Snapchat can help them learn social media responsibility and not feel excluded from their social group. If you’re on the fence, talk to your child about your concerns about the app and see how they handle a discussion about internet safety and digital literacy."

Users can also send snaps in one-on-one or group chats and set them to delete after 24 hours instead of immediately. [24] X Research source However, there may be workarounds to the disappearing messages.

Both Snapchat and TikTok have safety features to protect underage users, but they also come with risks, so it’s difficult to say which one is objectively safer. Some people believe Snapchat is safer because of the disappearing messages and the absence of “likes” to encourage social media addiction. However, the app has also faced issues like data breaches and frequent sharing of inappropriate content. TikTok is considered safe in some regards because it doesn’t contain malware or steal personal information, but it does still run into scamming issues and user data handling practices.
