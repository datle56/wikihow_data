If you are adopting a kitten from a rescue or shelter, they will usually spay her before she goes home with you, especially since kittens shouldn’t be taken away from their mothers until they are at least 8 weeks old. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source In addition to your cat being at least 8 weeks old, she should also be at least 2 pounds in weight, before she’s spayed. In order to avoid your cat going into heat, you should get her spayed before she’s 5 months old (unless there are medical reasons why she can’t go for surgery)."

      "content": "Make an appointment for your cat’s surgery. Whether you decide to take your cat to your veterinarian or a spay/neuter clinic, you’ll have to book the appointment in advance. Some clinics or veterinarians may want to examine your cat before they perform surgery, especially if you cat has never been to that vet/clinic before. In many cases the surgeon will conduct the exam immediately before the spay surgery. If the surgeon finds any issues, the surgery won’t be perform that day. If the surgeon doesn’t find any issues, the surgery will continue as planned. If the surgeon discovers any issues that prevent the surgery from being conducted, they will contact you to discuss. Most of the reasons for denying surgery are relatively minor (e.g. your cat has a fever or hasn’t overcome a previous illness or infection yet) and will simply require waiting a little while before performing the surgery. Many spay/neuter clinics will require proof of vaccination prior to performing the spay surgery. If the clinic doesn’t have this information already on file, make sure you bring a paper copy with you to the spay appointment."

      "title": "Take food away from your cat the night before surgery.",
      "content": "Take food away from your cat the night before surgery. A cat’s spay surgery does require your cat to go under anaesthetic. Because of this, you should take your cat’s food away starting the night before her surgery, or, if the surgery is in the afternoon, approximately 3-4 hours before surgery. She can, however, continue to drink water. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you’re getting a kitten spayed, ask the veterinarian if she needs to stop eating before surgery. Depending on her age, she may need to continue eating right up until her surgery. If you have more than one cat or kitten, you may want to isolate the one being spayed so the other cats can continue to eat. Anesthetic can cause nausea and vomiting, which can actually kill a sedated cat, so it’s best if your cat’s stomach is empty during surgery."

Depending on her age and experience at a vet’s office, she may be nervous and stressed — having her inside a carrier gives her a safe and comfortable spot to wait for her surgery. [6] X Research source You may need to leave the carrier at the clinic while your cat is having her surgery. Or you will be asked to bring it back with you when you come to pick her up."

If a medication is provided, follow the instructions as to when and how to give them to your cat. Do not, under any circumstances, give your cat human pain medications. Many of these can be toxic to your cat and will do more harm than good. Most cats receive pain medication during surgery, which can take up to 24 hours to wear off."

      "content": "Give your cat a small amount of food and water. When you bring your cat home immediately after her surgery, she probably won’t be too hungry. You can give her about ⅛ cup of food and a ¼ cup of water right away. If she eats and drinks it, and she’s able to keep it down, you can provide her with more food and water. Do not provide your cat with unlimited food and water immediately after her surgery. Even if she’s hungry, too much food and water may cause stomach upset. If you cat doesn’t eat or drink the night after her surgery, there’s nothing to be concerned about. Contact your veterinarian if you cat doesn’t start eating again the day after her surgery."

[7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you have more the one animal, you’ll want to make sure this location is blocked off so the other animals cannot disturb your recovering cat.

      "content": "Check the site of the incision. Part of your daily routine, after your cat’s been spayed, is to check her incision to make sure it’s healing properly. You’ll want to make sure the incision itself is binding and healing, and that it doesn’t look red or inflamed (and therefore infected) or has any discharge. If the incision isn’t healing, or looks infected, contact your veterinarian. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Look at your cat’s incision the day you take her home, this is what a normal, healing incision should look like. You can use this as a basis for watching her incision for the next few weeks. If it never changes, gets red in colour, becomes inflamed, or something starts to leak out, you’ll need to contact your veterinarian. The incision should heal substantially within 7 to 10 days. After this time the incision should be able to hold up against stretching and pulling. Note — incisions heal from side-to-side, not end-to-end, therefore a longer incision doesn’t take longer to heal than a short incision."

An adult cat may not feel like doing this right after surgery anyway, so it may be easy to restrain her. A kitten, however, may be difficult to restrain, but will also likely bounce back from surgery faster. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you do need to keep your cat from running and jumping, she’ll need to be placed somewhere in your home where there aren’t a lot of places to jump up on, and not a lot of room for running. A bathroom or bedroom might work well. If your cat has a tall scratching post, window seat, or cat condo, you may need to put them away until your cat is fully healed."

An occasional cleaning shouldn’t be a problem, as long as she doesn’t spend a lot of time cleaning the area.
