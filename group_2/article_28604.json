      "title": "Determine where you will place the arch.",
      "content": "Determine where you will place the arch. Locate an area at your party that will make a good space for the arch. This will allow you to determine how big the arch will be, and how many beach balls and inner tubes will be needed. You can create the arch as a backdrop piece for photo ops, or as something your guests will walk through. If you plan for people to walk through the arch, consider the height of your guests. If you don't know the height of your guests, 6–7 feet (180–210 cm) is a good size. You may want to look for an area that offers some support for the arch, such as an existing doorway. The arch should be self-standing, but any additional support can be helpful."

      "title": "Determine the size of your arch.",
      "content": "Determine the size of your arch. Place one end of a piece of rope on the ground where the arch will begin, and place a rock on top of it. Then run the rope along the area where you imagine the arch (use a friend and/or a step-stool to help you). Make a mark on the rope where it reaches the ground on the other side. Then lay your rope out straight and use your tape measure to determine the length. To determine the size of your arch, you will need a long piece of rope or twine, a tape measure, a marker, and a rock. You may also need the help of a friend and a ladder or step-stool."

      "title": "Determine the sizes of your beach balls and inner tubes.",
      "content": "Determine the sizes of your beach balls and inner tubes. You are going to use 1 larger inner tube as the base for each side of the arch (so you'll need 2 altogether). Then you will alternate between beach balls and small inner tubes, making your way across the arch. In order to know how many of each you'll need, you need to select your materials and measure them. The most common size of beach ball is 11.2 inches (28 cm), but they are also available in 16 inches (41 cm), 24 inches (61 cm), and other sizes. Inner tubes are available in a wide variety of sizes and thicknesses. You may need to purchase a few inner tube options and then measure them blown up. (The measurements on the package generally refer to the diameter of the inner tube, whereas you need to know the thickness.)"

      "title": "Figure out approximately how many beach balls and inner tubes you’ll need.",
      "content": "Figure out approximately how many beach balls and inner tubes you’ll need. You will want an even number of small inner tubes, plus 2 larger ones for each base. You will want an odd number of beach balls. Let’s say your arch is going to be 20 feet (6.1 m) long, from end to end. Your beach balls are 16 inches (41 cm), your large inner tubes are about 10 inches (25 cm) thick, and your small inner tubes are about 6 inches (15 cm) thick. In this example, your math would look like this: So 20 feet (6.1 m) is 240 inches (610 cm). This is the total size of your arch. Your bases subtract 20 inches (51 cm), which leaves 220 inches (560 cm). The center beach ball (the one that makes the total number odd) subtracts 16 inches (41 cm), which leaves 204 inches (520 cm). Each beach ball-inner tube pair equals 22 inches (56 cm), and 204 inches (520 cm) divided by 22 inches (56 cm) equals 9.27, which we can round up to 10. (If you round down, you won't have an even number.) For a 20 foot (6.1 m) arch with these beach balls and inner tubes, you will need about 11 balls, 10 small inner tubes, and 2 larger inner tubes."

      "content": "Purchase your materials. Once you know approximately how many beach balls and inner tubes you need, you can purchase your materials and get to work. You may want to purchase a couple of extra balls/tubes, because it may take some trial and error to get your arch just right. For this project, you’re going to need: Arch 2 larger inner tubes An even number of smaller inner tubes An odd number of beach balls Latex glue (available at craft stores or online) An air pump to blow up balls and inner tubes"

      "content": "Blow up all inflatables. Use an electric pump or hand pump to inflate all of your beach balls and inner tubes. Fill each item until it is firm to the touch. Full, firm inflatables will make a sturdy arch, but be careful not to overfill them. Otherwise, they might pop."

      "content": "Practice stacking the inner tubes and beach balls without glue. Practice constructing the arch without glue, to make sure you like the design. You may need to enlist the assistance of a friend to hold the beach ball arch in place. Remember, the order goes: a large inner tube at the base (on each side), followed by pairs of beach balls and small inter tubes."

      "title": "Add adhesive to the beach balls to create your arch.",
      "content": "Add adhesive to the beach balls to create your arch. For the construction of the arch, you will definitely need help from 1-2 friends. It is important to glue the pieces together with the arch standing up (as opposed to lying on the ground), in order for you to get the curvature just right. Apply a thin layer of latex glue to the bottom base inner tube, and press 1 of your beach balls against it. Apply pressure for 20-30 seconds. Apply a thin layer of latex glue to the beach ball, and press 1 of your small inner tubes against it. Again, apply pressure for 20-30 seconds. Alternate between sides: do a few layers on the left, then a few layers on the right. Be sure to gentle curve the balls and inner tubes in the shape of an arch. Have your friends hold the arch in place as you connect the 2 sides. The top/center of the arch will need the most support. Be sure to glue the balls/tubes with the inflation tabs sticking out. This will allow you to add air as needed, and help with take down."

      "title": "Hold the arch in place for as long as you can.",
      "content": "Hold the arch in place for as long as you can. Take turns holding the top/center of the arch for a minimum of 10-15 minutes (although longer is better), until the adhesive starts to set. Finally, leave the arch alone for several hours, to allow the adhesive to cure."

    {
      "title": "Add additional support.",
      "content": "Add additional support. If you have constructed your arch near a solid structure (like an existing doorway), you can use rope or twine to help secure the arch. Loop a length or rope or twine around the arch in the top middle, and find a place to attach it. Add another length of rope/twine on each side of the arch. This step is optional, but advisable, especially if your arch will be outdoors."

      "title": "Take down your arch.",
      "content": "Take down your arch. Open the nozzles on all of the inflatables. Untie any rope or twine you used to secure it. Give the arch some time (an hour or 2) to deflate naturally. Squeeze the remaining air out, fold up the arch, and store it for future use. Next time you use the arch, you may need to use latex glue to re-secure any connection that may have come loose."
