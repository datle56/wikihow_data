      "content": "Purchase 1 or more garlic cloves that have begun to sprout. When garlic sprouts, the clove—still covered in its protective white wrapping—will produce a small green sprout out of its top. [1] X Research source Inspect a few different cloves until you find some that have sprouted. While you can try growing un-sprouted garlic in water, you’re more likely to be successful if you use cloves that have sprouted. You can find suitable garlic cloves at your local grocery store. However, for higher-quality garlic that will produce larger and more flavorful sprouts, visit your local farmer’s market. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the sprouted clove in an 8 oz (230 g) glass jar. Orient the garlic so that the sprouting end of the clove points upward. [3] X Research source It’s best to grow the garlic sprouts in a container made of clear glass, so that you can watch as the garlic puts out roots and begins to grow. If you don’t have a glass jar, you can use a drinking glass or a shot glass instead, if that’s more convenient."

      "content": "Pour water into the jar until the bottom of the garlic clove is covered. You can use lukewarm tap water. Depending on the size of your garlic clove, you’ll need to put about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of water into the jar. [4] X Research source Avoid using extremely hot water, or you will damage and maybe kill the clove. If you completely submerge the garlic under water, it will die and rot."

      "content": "Leave the jar on your windowsill for 4-7 days. Make sure that the sprouting garlic clove gets plenty of sunlight. [5] X Research source If the tops of the growing garlic sprouts start to turn brown or wilt, move the glass out of the sun for 1-2 days."

      "title": "Change the water if it turns murky brown.",
      "content": "Change the water if it turns murky brown. Brown, clouded water will be unhealthy for the garlic and may stunt the sprouts’ growth. To change the water, take the garlic out of the jar with 1 hand and use your other hand to dump out the water from the jar. Then, place the clove back into the jar and refill it with water. Make sure not to over-fill the jar with water. [6] X Research source You should only need to change the water 1 or 2 times before the sprouts are ready to harvest."

      "content": "Let the garlic sprouts grow until they’re at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall. Keep an eye on the garlic as the green sprouts start to emerge from the top of the clove. The thin sprouts will emerge and grow quickly. When the sprouts are between 3–7 inches (7.6–17.8 cm), they’re ready to harvest. [7] X Research source If you harvest the garlic sprouts prematurely, they’ll be bitter and have an unpleasant taste."

      "content": "Cut off the top 1/3 of the garlic sprout with a pair of kitchen scissors. So, if your sprout is 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall, snip off the top 1 inch (2.5 cm). This will be the tastiest and least bitter part of the garlic sprout. [8] X Research source In most cases, you’ll only be able to harvest garlic sprouts once. It’s unlikely that the garlic clove will grow new sprouts after the harvest. Only cut off the amount you’re planning to use for a specific meal. If you try to store already-cut garlic in your fridge, it will dry out and lose its taste."

Then, add the sprouts to any savory dish you’d like, including baked potato, soup, or scrambled eggs. [9] X Research source Also try adding raw cut-up garlic sprouts to salads, salsas, or dips.
