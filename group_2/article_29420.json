Since mob spawners are unobtainable to crafting and can only be found naturally spawned, you might want to build your mob spawner in Creative Mode and then switch the game over to Survival in order to enjoy its benefits. [1] X Research source Creating a game in Creative and then switching to Survival will disable achievements for the game."

      "title": "Understand how the spawner works.",
      "content": "Understand how the spawner works. By building a platform high up, you can create a surface on which mobs will gradually begin to spawn. These mobs will eventually find their way into the chute in the middle of the platform; once they end up in the chute, they will fall to their deaths, landing on a set of hoppers at the bottom of the chute. The hoppers will funnel the mobs' drops into connected chests that you can check for loot when necessary."
