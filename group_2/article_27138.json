      "content": "Create 2 shoe templates out of cardstock. Make 1 sole template by tracing the bottom of your foot along a piece of cardstock. To create the side shoe template, measure the length of your foot and the height of your leg up to the ankle. Once you do this, you can transfer these measurements to create patterns for the sides of your curved elf shoes. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a fringe pattern for the edge of your shoes.",
      "content": "Make a fringe pattern for the edge of your shoes. Measure the circumference of your ankle to figure out the length of your fringe. Next, draw a series of connected triangles along this length. Make the length of each triangle at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). The width of the fringe strip depends on your design preference—if you want a larger fringe, make it 2 inches (5.1 cm). If you want a shorter fringe, make it smaller. [2] X Research source The fringe pattern will look like a miniature mountain range."

      "title": "Trace and cut out the fabric pieces from the shoe templates.",
      "content": "Trace and cut out the fabric pieces from the shoe templates. Sketch around your sole, fringe, and side shoe templates on different colored pieces of fabric with a permanent marker before cutting them out with a pair of fabric scissors. To create a fun color scheme, consider cutting 2 sole pieces out of white material, 2 side shoe pieces out of green, and 1 fringe piece out of red. In total, you’ll need 2 sole pieces, 4 side shoe pieces, and 1 longer fringe. Cut out 2 soles at once by pinning 2 pieces of fabric together to save time later on. To cut out the fringe more efficiently, trace the pattern onto a folded, paper-sized piece of red fabric before cutting it out. Set this piece of fabric aside, as you’ll be needing it momentarily."

      "title": "Sew",
      "content": "Sew the heel ends of the felt pieces together. Thread your sewing needle and stitch the heels of the side shoe fabric portions together. When placed on a flat surface, the sewn pieces will look like mirror images of one another. [3] X Research source Make sure that there’s 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) of seam allowance between your stitches and the edge of the fabric."

      "content": "Sew the fringe onto the top portion of the shoe. Align and stitch the red fringe along the ankles of the side shoe pieces. Keep in mind that the shoe is currently facing inside out, so make sure that the fringe stitches are also facing outward. Don’t worry—you’ll be turning your shoes right side out once everything is stitched together. [4] X Research source"

Double-check to ensure that the shoe is turned inside out when you’re attaching the sole.

This is the last part of the shoe that needs to be sewn, but make sure that you don’t stitch these edges all the way up to the ankle. The shoe should be wide enough for an entire foot to fit into!"

Use a hot glue gun to attach 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces of hook-and-loop fastener to the flaps of the shoe, and also to stick small jingle bells on top of the pointed toe. Be certain that the glue is dry before you try on the shoes. [6] X Research source"

If the patterns are too small for your own shoe size, use the images as a reference when making your own templates. Double check your foot length and ankle height with a tape measure before cutting out any pattern pieces. [7] X Research source Use this template to get started: https://www.activityvillage.co.uk/elf-shoes . If you want a firmer shoe template, use cardstock instead of regular paper."

Once you have a clear sketch, cut out the shapes with a pair of fabric scissors. Durable, sturdy fabrics like felt work best for this design, and can be found inexpensively at most craft stores."

Sew a stitch that’s around 1 centimetre (0.39 in) in length—it can be longer or shorter, depending on how wide you want the stitching to be. Keep looping each new stitch through the previous one until the 2 side shoe pieces and sole piece are connected. Knot off the thread and tuck it into a random stitch to finish sewing.

Roll the tape tightly to make sure that it’s completely covering the sock. The plain duct tape will serve as the base layer, with black duct tape being added later. [12] X Research source While you want the tape to be snug around the sock, you don’t want to constrict the other person’s legs and feet."

Keep cutting downward until you reach ankle level. Measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) above your ankle, and trim horizontally around that point to remove any of the excess taped sock. Feel free to have the person remove the socks after this. [13] X Research source The portion of taped sock above the ankle serves as a shoe cuff. Once you’re finished cutting off the excess sock, there should be a V-shaped gap along the front of the shoe."

It doesn’t matter how large the foil piece is, as long as it’s big enough to serve as the curved toe point of the shoe. Once you’ve formed two curved toe pieces out of foil, position them on the ends of the elf shoes. [14] X Research source As you work with the foil, keep pressing your fingers along the inner walls of the taped sock to keep it from shrinking. Don’t roll any plain duct tape around the foil pieces, because you’ll be covering them with black duct tape later."
