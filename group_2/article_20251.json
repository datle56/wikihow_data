      "content": "Increase your exercise intensity with weights and exercise bands. Simply doing a few exercise for a week or 2 will not give you a bubble butt. You will need to do these exercises over the course of months and increase your intensity over time. Adding resistance to these exercises using weights and bands is a great way to add intensity. [9] X Research source For example, you could hold a dumbbell in each hand while doing squats or lunges. Try starting with a 5 lb (2.3 kg) dumbbell in each hand and increase the weight as your strength grows. Loop 1 end of an exercise band around 1 foot and the other end around your thigh before you begin doing glute kickbacks to add resistance. Try other weighted glute exercises, such as deadlifts or rear leg lifts using cables or resistance bands Keep in mind that building muscle requires fatiguing your glutes, which might require 2 to 5 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions for each exercise."

Look for jeans with rounded rather than straight heart-shaped seams above your butt. The pockets should be much smaller than your butt and located on the fullest part. Pockets that angle inward slightly create a fuller illusion. Loose or saggy jeans won’t accentuate your figure."
