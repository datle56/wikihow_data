Your sneaky moves closer to your man won't be so obvious."

      "content": "Avoid a few terrible cuddling moves. You may think that cuddling will bring you closer to your boyfriend no matter what. While this is true most of the time, there are a few cuddling poses that can be so uncomfortable that they bring your cute intimacy session to a halt. Don't worry -- these common mistakes are made by cuddling amateurs and professionals alike. But if you know what to avoid, you'll be one step ahead of the game. Here they are: The dead arm. The dead arm is the #1 most objectionable cuddling move. This occurs when you're snuggling either when you're sitting up or lying down, with your boyfriend's arm trapped behind your back. This will quickly cut off his circulation -- and his need for romance. The human knot. This cuddling no-no happens when you and your boyfriend are so entwined that it would take an hour just to find out where you've put your left leg or right hand. If you can't separate your body parts from your boyfriend's, then you have a problem. The notorious face-to-face cuddle. [3] X Research source Unless you're ready to kiss right away, you should avoid cuddling while you're facing your boyfriend head on. The tight squeeze. Unless you want your boyfriend to literally take your breath away, you should avoid having him hold you so tightly that you're struggling to inhale. If this happens, just gently tell him to let go a little bit."
