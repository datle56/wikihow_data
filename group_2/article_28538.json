To duplicate the image, right-click the layer in the Layers panel and click Duplicate Layer… . You can also select the layer and click the Layers menu at the top of the window, then Duplicate Layer… . The reason behind working on a duplicate layer is so you can always go back to your original image to see how much you've changed the image."

Use the \"Brush Size\" and \"Brush Pressure\" settings in the right pane of the window to adjust the size and sensitivity of the brush. Smaller brushes will make for better details. Use \"+\" and \"-\" signs in the bottom-left of the dialog box to increase or reduce the size of the image."

For example, if you are trying to make your calf look thinner, draw along the parts of the calf that you want to stay in the image. Be careful not to over-exaggerate the lines, or the image will not appear realistic."

For example, gently drag the parts of the calf you want to eliminate toward the mask lines you drew. It may take a couple of times before you get the feel of the Forward Warp tool. Because the tool alters the shape of the pixels over which you drag it, the image can become overly distorted very easily. Click Restore All in the right pane to undo the changes you've made and start over."
