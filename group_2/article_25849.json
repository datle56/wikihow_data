Due to their generosity, Garbis also describes Leo as showering their romantic interest with compliments and buying them whatever they want. Other signs of a Leo being romantically interested in someone is by sending poetry, a life-changing TED talk, or a truck’s worth of flowers. [2] X Research source"

Leos love the idea of being in love, so they will stand by their romantic partner and do almost anything to keep the relationship together. However, this sometimes means they tolerate toxic or abusive behavior and often drag out relationships until they have no other choice but to end them. [6] X Research source When a relationship does end, however, Leo takes it very hard and will likely be extremely emotional and upset for weeks on end—often drawing the concern of their loved ones. To move on and heal their heart after a breakup, Leos should stay far away from social media and any tendency to broadcast their breakup drama outside their inner circle. Leos should also give themselves some time before jumping back into the dating pool—it’s a good idea to take time to unpack the baggage from their past relationships with a therapist or qualified counselor. Creative projects are also a good outlet for heartbroken Leos—they can try writing song lyrics , painting , or writing short stories ."

[7] X Research source Leos are thrill-seekers in their daily life, and this quality also applies to the bedroom. They may ask partners to experiment with exhibitionism or video-recording intimate acts. However, some Leos are hesitant to bring toys into the bedroom as they may see it as a challenge to their own perceived sexual prowess. A Leo’s biggest challenge in the bedroom is being so focused on their own needs that their partners may feel like props in their performance. Leos should focus on being as attentive to their partner’s needs and desires as they are to their own and using intimacy to connect with their partner emotionally .

However, these similar signs also innately understand each other’s needs. While communication is still key to this relationship, Leo and Sag don’t have to do too much explaining to understand where the other is coming from.

However, Leo falls hard in love, while Aquarius tends to be more commitment-phobic. Since both signs have a flair for the dramatic, this may result in some pretty explosive emotional outbursts early on in the relationship. [18] X Research source Despite their many similarities, the mismatched communication styles between Aquarius and Leo are the reason for their low compatibility. When one is on, the other may be off. As soon as Aquarius commits, Leo may decide they’re not worth the trouble. To make this romantic coupling work, both partners must surrender their egos and be direct about their feelings. When emotional situations do arise, they should give each other a 10-15 minute break to walk away, calm down, and come back to the conversation after regulating their individual emotions ."

[19] X Research source However, it’s important that both Pisces and Leo value what their partner brings to the table. They need to see each other as equals with individual strengths and weaknesses. This pairing also requires a commitment to spiritual and personal growth.
