      "content": "Identify the spider and egg sacs to rule out a poisonous species. Almost all spiders are harmless, but there are a few species with bites that require medical attention. If possible, check the egg sacs and any nearby spiders for characteristics of venomous species. Consider calling in a professional to deal with poisonous spiders. The various black widow species are distinguished by the red markings, usually in the shape of an hourglass, on their abdomen’s underside. They spin funnel-shaped cobwebs, and their egg sacs are beige to yellow, smooth, round, and 1 to 1.25 centimetres (0.39 to 0.49 in) in diameter. [1] X Research source Brown widows are venomous, but not as aggressive as black widows. The hourglass-shaped markings under their abdomen can be yellow or orange, and they have dark bands on their legs. Their egg sacs are also beige to yellow, but are covered with little silk spikes. [2] X Research source Brown recluse spiders have long bodies and slender legs. They are distinguished by a dark, violin-shaped mark on their back, and unlike most spiders, they only have 6 eyes. [3] X Research source Their webs are flat, patternless, and sheet-like, and their egg sacs are silky, somewhat rough and irregularly shaped, and average 1.5 centimetres (0.59 in) in diameter.

      "content": "Have a professional deal with an infestation. It’s wise to call in a professional if you have a major infestation on your hands, such as a cellar with spiders and egg sacs at every turn. Among the poisonous species, brown recluse spiders are particularly difficult to control. [5] X Research source Brown recluse spiders can go months without food or water. Since they’re hunting spiders, they wander, hide, and are fast. Spiders that wait in their webs for prey are easier to control."

      "content": "Vacuum up spiders, webs, and egg sacs with a long attachment. In most cases, your vacuum cleaner is your best line of defense against spiders and their egg sacs. If the egg sac is in a vacuum-accessible spot, use an attachment to suck it up along with any nearby spiders. [6] X Research source You can also use a duster to remove any webbing and eggs.

      "content": "Empty the vacuum bag outdoors. Take your vacuum outside to remove the bag. If it’s disposable, just seal it and throw it in a lidded outdoor trash container. If the chamber’s non-disposable, carefully empty it into a trash bag, seal the bag, and toss it an outdoor garbage bin. Spiders are fragile, so vacuuming one up will easily kill it. However, the egg sac offers a little more protection, so eggs or spiderlings might survive."

      "content": "Freeze the bag if you’re dealing with a venomous species. You might want to take extra precautions if you’re dealing with poisonous spiders. If possible, stick the vacuum bag in a freezer chest or cooler for several hours before you throw it in the garbage. Give your freezer chest or cooler a good cleaning when you’re finished."

      "content": "Purchase an oil-based aerosol pesticide instead of a water-based product. Pesticide might be the way to go if the egg sac isn’t in a vacuum-accessible spot, if you don’t have a vacuum, or if you just don’t want to deal with lugging around the vacuum. Look online or at your home improvement store for a oil or petroleum-based product. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Since egg sacs are water repellent, water-based pesticides are ineffective. Go for a direct aerosol, or spray, product. Foggers are also ineffective against spiders."

[10] X Research source Oil-based products are highly effective egg killers, but you don’t want to take any chances. In addition, if you just leave a web intact, it might trap insects and attract other spiders."

      "title": "Put down sticky traps if you’re dealing with hunting spiders.",
      "content": "Put down sticky traps if you’re dealing with hunting spiders. Sticky traps are basically pieces of cardboard covered with adhesive. If you’ve seen hunting spiders that run around on the floor, such as wolf or brown recluse spiders, place sticky traps along walls, behind furniture, and at potential entry points, like near cellar or garage doors. [11] X Research source Pesticides are more effective against web-weavers than hunting spiders, which can just run away from chemical spray. If you’ve sprayed an egg sac but the mother spider scurried away, you might have another egg sac on your hands sooner rather than later. Most spiders only need to mate once in their life, but can produce up to 5 egg sacs."
