      "title": "Put on makeup.",
      "content": "Put on makeup. Keep it natural and light. Maybe some mascara, highlighter, lip gloss, and blush. Make sure your makeup matches your outfit and your skin tone/type. Nothing looks worse then flaky, orange foundation. Be sure to invest in good quality makeup, you don't want clumped mascara or eye-liner. Add an element of eyeshadow or liner. If you really want to play things up a bit, apply a thin line of black eyeliner on your upper lash line with a tiny flick at the end. Don't overdo it though. Apply some lip balm and then a pretty lip tint. Lip tint is a great option for school as it lasts a long time. Be sure to apply lip balm when you use lip tint because lip tint can really dry out your lips making them look chapped, which is not so attractive. If you need extra coverage, apply a tinted moisturizer or B.B cream. Curl lashes and apply a couple thin coats of brown mascara. If your school says no then don't put makeup."

      "title": "Do your hair.",
      "content": "Do your hair. Comb it until soft, and style it accordingly. Have your hair in a different style everyday for school. This is glamorous. Wear cute headbands or hair accessories! You could curl it, put it in a ponytail, a bun, a side ponytail, french braids, Dutch braids, one braid, two braids, a messy bun, ballet bun, neat bun, low ponytail, high ponytail, the list is endless! You could just put it down either, or ringlets if you can. When you wash your hair, use a good quality shampoo and conditioner that smells nice. When rinsing your hair, use slightly cool water. This will maintain the shine in your hair. Brush your hair daily. This will bring the oil from the roots of the hair to the tips, making it look super shiny and healthy. If you don't brush your hair daily, the oil at the roots will collect, making your hair look oily. Consider going to a hairdresser. Get your hair cut stylishly (layers are cute) and if you're allowed to, highlight or dip-dye your hair a natural colour. If you want to look really cool, and if your school allows it, highlight or dip-dye your hair a cool colour like red if you have dark brown or black hair, blonde for light brown hair and pink for blonde hair."

      "content": "Consider perfume or body spray. A hint of scent is nice. Apply a sweet smelling perfume to your neck, wrists and elbows and spritz some over your clothes."

      "title": "Pick an outfit the night before.",
      "content": "Pick an outfit the night before. Check the weather. If it's warm a skirt and a cute top could look good, but even better if you add accessories like a ring, necklace, earrings or some bracelets! If the weather is a little chilly, this is an excellent excuse to bring out the scarf! Scarves are super cute and convenient during winter. Wear clothes that accentuate the best parts of your body and hide the problem areas. Don't forget about nice shoes! Kitten heels, flats and boots are super cute. Some schools only allow black or brown shoes. Accessorize. Wear earrings. Some schools only allow studs. Change your earrings everyday. If you're allowed to, wear necklaces and bracelets. Choose clothes that you like that fit your school's dress code. Try to be unique and creative. This will help you stand out from others."

      "content": "Keep your nails looking good. Clean, trim, file and buff your nails weekly. If you're allowed to, paint them a pretty colour. If you're not allowed any bright colors or would like to go for a more natural look, apply clear polish."

      "title": "Focus on confidence and the right attitude!",
      "content": "Focus on confidence and the right attitude! Walk in the hallway with your head up, shoulders back and your back straight. It shows you are confident, and hopefully you are! Confidence is attractive, but be sure to not be overconfident, this can come off as cocky and people generally will not like you for it. No one will approach you if you're mean. Be kind and remember to smile. Practice smiling in front of the mirror to get that perfect smile. Have a good start of the school day; wake up fresh and happy. Smile and try not to act grumpy or drowsy. Try to think of all the things you are looking forward to at school. Waking up happier can make you look kinder and more approachable."

      "title": "Start from the inside out.",
      "content": "Start from the inside out. If you want to look good for school, or just simply look good in general, you have to be healthy and maintain a good image! Make sure you drink lots of water each day. Drink at least six to eight cups. This will give you beautiful, glowing skin and clear up any acne or blemishes you have. Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Make sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables and eat fat or sugary foods sparingly, especially at breakfast. A healthy breakfast will put you in a good mood for the day, therefore lightening your expression and preparing you for a long day of learning. Exercise daily for about thirty minutes a day. If you're a busy person, simply go for a quick walk or jog. You can exercise at home too like jogging on the spot. If you are overweight, consider losing a few pounds. Don't diet obsessively though, just exercise. Get enough sleep each night. At least nine or ten hours. A pale face with dark under eye circles isn't exactly pretty."

      "title": "Be hygienic.",
      "content": "Be hygienic. Shower daily. To save time in the morning, you might want to shower at night, but showering in the morning can help you wake up - it's your choice! Wash your hair on a regular basis and clean your face and body. To have beautiful hair use hair products that are designed for your hair type. Use skin products that will work well with your skin type and use scented soap to achieve a subtle scent. Wear an antiperspirant-deodorant. Apply it every morning to the underarms to help stay fresh. Get rid of any unwanted body hair. Shave or wax your legs, trim your bikini line and do your eyebrows. Wear panty-liners/pads/tampons and always carry spare in your purse just in case. Brush your teeth. If you are unhappy with your teeth, consider investing in braces or whitening toothpaste. Never get a dark color of braces like orange, black, green, or anything like that. Go with a cuter color or clear. If you don't need braces, just brush your teeth, whiten them once a month (Use this sparingly, teeth whitening can weaken your teeth), use mouthwash and floss.

      "title": "Try to keep clear skin.",
      "content": "Try to keep clear skin. Cleanse your face every morning and night. When cleansing, don't scrub. Instead, gently glide your fingers over your skin with a feather-light touch. Cleansing should be quick. It shouldn't take over ten seconds. If you take over ten seconds, you're stripping your skin of it's natural oils which leads to more pimples! Every morning apply a moisturizer. Make sure you don't use too much though or your skin will look oily. Use a spot treatment every night, regardless to whether you have acne or not. Using a spot treatment when you don't have acne will prevent you from getting any spots."
