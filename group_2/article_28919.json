      "title": "Sew a large pillowcase using a pattern.",
      "content": "Sew a large pillowcase using a pattern. When Dobby is first introduced in the Harry Potter series, he wears a dirty pillowcase because house elves cannot wear real clothes. Purchase a sackcloth fabric (like burlap) and a large pillowcase pattern at your local craft store. Sew the pillowcase by hand or with a sewing machine. [1] X Research source You may need to double or triple the pattern size, depending on your needs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an already-existing large pillowcase, alternatively.",
      "content": "Use an already-existing large pillowcase, alternatively. If you have a large enough pillowcase, you may be able to use it instead of sewing a new one. Check your house for body pillows, which usually have pillowcases large enough to wear. Make sure you check in with other housemates before using it for your costume."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut out holes for your head and arms.",
      "content": "Cut out holes for your head and arms. You won't be able to put on the pillowcase as it is. Take arm and head circumference measurements, and cut out holes on the pillowcase based on those measurements. Outline the intended holes with a marker beforehand for more precise cuts. [2] X Research source Measure around the widest parts of your head and arms for a comfortable fit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add rips or holes to the pillowcase.",
      "content": "Add rips or holes to the pillowcase. Dobby is described as wearing a \"tattered\" pillowcase in the Chamber of Secrets. Using scissors, cut small tears into your costume for a worn look. Distress the ends of the pillowcase to make it look shabbier. Try the pillowcase on beforehand to avoid putting holes in any awkward areas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Carry around a sock as a prop.",
      "content": "Carry around a sock as a prop. Because Harry Potter set Dobby free from lifelong servitude using a sock, this is Dobby's favorite item of clothing. Make sure you have at least one sock in your hand at all times. Without it, people might not know who you are or even mistake you as Gollum from Lord of the Rings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear mismatched clothes as an alternative.",
      "content": "Wear mismatched clothes as an alternative. After becoming a freed house elf, Dobby is allowed to wear whatever he wants. He often wears anything that catches his eye or that his friends give him, usually all at once. Raid your closet for the loudest, most clashing clothes and layer them into one Dobby-approved outfit. In the series, Dobby has worn: a tea cosy hat, a tie patterned with horseshoes, soccer shorts, a maroon sweater, many hats stacked on top of each other, and scarves. [3] X Research source Don't forget a pair of brightly patterned, mismatched socks!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Go barefoot or wear flesh-colored sandals.",
      "content": "Go barefoot or wear flesh-colored sandals. Usually, Dobby is depicted as barefoot. For an accurate portrayal, don't wear any shoes. But if you care about getting your feet dirty or will be walking long distances, wear a pair of flesh-colored open-toed shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint your skin grayish-beige.",
      "content": "Paint your skin grayish-beige. If you're making a Dobby costume around Halloween, you should be able to find face paint at most stores. You may have to check craft, party, or theater supply stores during other times of the year. Make sure you choose an \"FDA-approved\" and \"non-toxic\" face paint to stay safe. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut ears out of craft felt and glue them to a headband.",
      "content": "Cut ears out of craft felt and glue them to a headband. Purchase gray or beige craft felt and draw long, pointy ears. Use fabric glue to attach them on a headband. Let the fabric glue dry, then try on your new Dobby ears. [5] X Research source House elves have particularly large ears. The ear length depends on your own head size but will generally be about 6 inches (15 cm) long. Purchase elf ears online or at a costume shop as an alternative."

    {
      "title": "Wear a long prosthetic nose.",
      "content": "Wear a long prosthetic nose. Like other house elves, Dobby has a pointy nose. Buy a fake witch's nose and spray paint it to match your ears and face paint. The nose should be long but not exceed around 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm). Keep the nose on while trick-or-treating or at Halloween parties so others know who you are. Some Dobby costumes skip the nose and use makeup to make their nose look longer. Use this option instead if you dislike the feel of prosthetics. Spray paint the nose several days to a week in advance so the paint fumes have time to dissipate. Coat the nose in face paint instead if you are sensitive to spray paint fumes."

    {
      "title": "Buy a Dobby mask for simplicity.",
      "content": "Buy a Dobby mask for simplicity. If you don't have the time or energy to apply makeup and prosthetics, look into buying a Dobby mask. Not only is this method simpler, but others will be much more likely to know who you are."

    {
      "title": "Shout \"Dobby is a free elf!\"",
      "content": "Shout \"Dobby is a free elf!\" whenever someone asks who you are. Dobby is grateful for his freedom and, unlike some house elves, is not ashamed that he doesn’t have a master. If someone doesn't recognize your costume, this iconic Dobby quote is the best way to let them know. You might also shout: [6] X Research source \"Master gave Dobby a sock!\" \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\" \"Bad Dobby! BAD DOBBY!\""

      "title": "Scream if someone mentions the Malfoys.",
      "content": "Scream if someone mentions the Malfoys. Dobby loves most witches and wizards, but if there's one family he hates, it's his abusive former masters. Avoid anyone dressed as Draco or Lucius Malfoy. If you're feeling brave (and if nobody is actually dressed as a Malfoy), trash talk that pureblood family at every opportunity. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang closely around anyone dressed as Harry Potter.",
      "content": "Hang closely around anyone dressed as Harry Potter. Because Harry has been so kind to Dobby and given him respect when nobody else did, Dobby is Harry's loyal friend. He even gives up his own life to save Harry and his friends. Have a close friend wear a Harry Potter costume or compliment others cosplaying The Boy Who Lived. Don't creep out the person dressed as Harry Potter. Give them space, especially if you don't actually know them."

    {
      "title": "Maintain an impressive collection of socks.",
      "content": "Maintain an impressive collection of socks. Bring a few socks with you to the party or special event. Wear two on your feet and carry the rest in your hands. Show off your socks to anyone who asks and compliment other people's socks loudly. Do not steal anyone else's socks. Firstly, Dobby would never steal and secondly, you don't want to cross the line between an accurate costume and a creepy one."
