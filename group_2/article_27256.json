Go to source Talking with people is the next step to forming friendships. There are lots of ways to start conversations and small talk with other people, even if you don’t know of anything specific to talk about at first. Once things get started, just try to keep the conversation going naturally. Offer a compliment, like “Hey, I really like that shirt!” Ask lots of questions. This gives you and the other person something to say, and keeps the conversation moving. For instance, if you like a person’s shirt, you could follow up by asking “Where’d you get it?” Listen carefully and respond to what the person says, so that you form connections. For instance, if someone tells you “I got this shirt at the mall—I shop there all the time” you could respond with something like “Me too! What are your favorite stores?” It’s ok to keep initial conversations short so you don’t ramble, but if you seem to be hitting it off with a new person, let things flow."

Your friend relies on you, too. Make sure to listen and respond to your friend, to show that you’re caring and supportive. Provide a safe space for your friends to come and seek advice. Their problems might be different from your own, but learning from other people is part of building friendships! If a friend wants to or needs to talk and you can’t, say that you will get in touch later—and follow up. If you ever have to bail on a friend, apologize sincerely and take the initiative to set something else up."
