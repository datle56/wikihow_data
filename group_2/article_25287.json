      "content": "Use your birthday to determine your main Zodiac sign (or sun sign). There are 12 main Zodiac signs (more specifically referred to as Sun signs) that are categorized according to certain date ranges throughout the year. Your Sun sign influences the personality traits that best describe your pride, ego, drive, and who you are at your core—as expert astrologer Angel Eyedealism puts it, “your sun sign speaks to your physical body, ego, and identity.” To find your Sun sign , look for which date range your birthday falls into: Aries: March 21st through April 19th. Taurus: April 20th through May 20th. Gemini: May 21st through June 20th. Cancer: June 21st through July 22nd. Leo: July 23rd through August 22nd. Virgo: August 23rd through September 22nd. Libra: September 23rd through October 22nd. Scorpio: October 23rd through November 21st. Sagittarius: November 22nd through December 21st. Capricorn: December 22nd through January 19th. Aquarius: January 20th through February 18th. Pisces: February 19th through March 20th. Does your birthday fall right between two signs? According to psychic astrologer Stina Garbis, “the starting date of a sign can change from year to year. If you were born around the 20th of the month or between the 18th to the 23rd…[consider] having your chart done to verify your sign.”"

They love to compete and, more specifically, they love to come out on top as a winner. An Aries can also be “very ‘me first,’” says Vedic astrologer Tara Divina. “They’re very go-go-go, direct, and straightforward.” Unsurprisingly, they usually want to be around people “that can keep up with them mentally,” comments Divina.

Also, being ruled by Venus brings out a highly sensual and physically affectionate side that’s very tactile. They enjoy luxury, the best of everything, and having luxurious houses filled with velvet and satin and lots of pillows and fine art.” “Tauruses love money and food,” affirms Eyedealism. “They’re very thick-skinned…and very practical.” Symbol: The Bull ♉ Element: Earth 🌱 (Key Traits: Practical, Stable, and Persistent) .

Depending on what minute of the day, “they could have changed their mind on something,” adds Eyedealism. “They need a sense of freedom and constant amusement, or they become disinterested very quickly.” Symbol: The Twins ♊ Element: Air 🌬️ (Key Traits: Social, Communicative, and Open-Minded) .

So they have a strong selfishness in that way…Leo feels that Leo is right and important.” This sign is also very “strong-willed about your loyalty to them,” adds Eyedealism.
