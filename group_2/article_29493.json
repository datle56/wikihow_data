      "title": "Buy tulle on a spool and cut it twice the length you want the tutu to be.",
      "content": "Buy tulle on a spool and cut it twice the length you want the tutu to be. Measure from your waist down to wear you want the tutu to end. Anywhere from mid-thigh to knee-length would look great. Double that measurement, then cut the tulle accordingly. Use up the entire spool of tulle and keep the cut of tulle pieces in a small pile. [1] X Research source You will need at least one spool of tulle. Longer and/or fuller tutus may need up to three. It should be wide enough to help create the fullness of the skirt. Tulle on a spool is about 6 inches (15 cm) wide, perfect for making tutus. You can find it in craft stores."

      "title": "Cut a piece of ribbon long enough to tie around your waist in a bow.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of ribbon long enough to tie around your waist in a bow. Measure your waist first, then add 48 inches (120 cm) to your measurement. Cut a piece of 1/2-inch (1.3-cm) ribbon to this new measurement. Be sure to match the color of the ribbon to the tulle that you are using. Satin or grosgrain ribbon will work the best. [2] X Research source Cut the ribbon at an angle, then heat-seal the ends with a flame for a nicer finish. You can use wider ribbon, if you prefer. Anything up to 1-inch (2.5-cm) will work just fine."

      "title": "Tie a knot in the ribbon, 24 inches (61 cm) from each end.",
      "content": "Tie a knot in the ribbon, 24 inches (61 cm) from each end. Measure 24 inches (61 cm) from the left end of the ribbon, and tie a knot. Next, measure 24 inches (61 cm) from the right end of the ribbon, and tie a knot as well. These knots will prevent the tulle from sliding off when you put on and take off the tutu.

      "content": "Tie the ribbon around a cylindrical base. Roll some poster paper into a tube that matches your waist measurement. Secure it with tape, then wrap and tie the ribbon around it. You don't have to do this, but many people find it easier to tie the tulle strips to the ribbon if it's on a cylindrical base. [4] X Research source You can also use a larger cylinder and use the two knots as a guide for placement."

Slip the folded part behind the ribbon so that it is sticking out of the bottom edge by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). [5] X Research source For a fluffier tutu, you can stack 2 to 3 strips of tulle."

Make sure that the knot is tight enough so that it scrunches together and folds the ribbon. When you are done, the tulle should be sticking out from the bottom edge of the ribbon.

Once you have the first strip of tulle secure, slide it along the ribbon until it bumps up against the knot on the left side. Fold a second strip of tulle in half, slip it behind the ribbon, and pull the ends through the loop. Slide it over until it bumps up against the first piece of tulle. [7] X Research source"

Take the tutu off of the cylinder and spread it out on a flat surface. Smooth out the tulle strips, then trim down any pieces that are too long. [9] X Research source You can also leave the bottom of the tutu untrimmed for an uneven look. This would be perfect for a forest or pirate fairy! Don't worry about pieces that are too short. They won't be visible thanks to the fullness of the tutu."

      "content": "Wrap it around your waist and tie the ends into a big bow. You can position the bow on the front or on the back. If the bow is too big, trim down the ends to make it shorter. Make sure that you cut off the same amount on both ends, and that you heat seal them."

[10] X Research source Tulle on a spool is about 6 inches (15 cm) wide, which is perfect for tutus. You can find it in arts and crafts stores. You will need to use the entire spool.

Wrap it around your waist, tie it in a knot, then slip it off. The elastic needs to be tight enough so that it doesn't slip off of your waist, but loose enough so that it feels comfortable. [11] X Research source If you are making a tutu for a child, a thin, elastic headband may work as long as it is not too tight. [12] X Research source For a neater finish, overlap the ends by 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm), then sew them by hand or by machine."

Scrunch them together so that you can see the elastic. The more you scrunch them together, the fuller the tutu will be. Be careful not the stretch the elastic, however, or the tutu will be too loose.

Cut the tulle down to that measurement, making sure to use up the entire spool. Keep all your pieces of tulle in an organized stack. You may need up to three spools if your tutu is going to be very long and/or full. Your tutu can be any length you want it to be. Something between mid-thigh and knee-length would be ideal, however. You can buy tulle on a spool in an arts and crafts store. It is about 6 inches (15 cm) wide and perfect for making tutus."

      "content": "Get a crochet headband that looks nice with your tulle. These headbands look like a wide band that is crocheted out of thin, colorful elastic. They are usually a few inches/centimeters wide. The holes will allow you to make additional rows of knotted tulle for a thicker tutu. [14] X Research source This method will work the best for a child's tutu. The elastic headband may not fit an older child's or adult's waist. If you really want to use this method for an adult's tutu, buy some crocheted ribbon from a fabric store, then cut and sew it into a waistband that fits you. If you only have a skinny elastic headband that is not crocheted, this method will not work for you. Refer to the elastic method instead ."

[15] X Research source Make sure that you are pushing the tulle down through the hole and not up. You want the loop to be sticking out of the bottom of the headband by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
