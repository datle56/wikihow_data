Some also require passwords to include at least one capital letter, a number, and a symbol or special character. Once you know which types of passwords that service will accept, you'll know how complicated to make your guesses. To find out the site or app's password requirements, try setting up your own account. When it's time to create your password , you'll see the requirements."

      "content": "If the password has a \"hint\" option for forgotten passwords, request a hint. Depending on the service, you may be prompted to answer security questions or see a hint once you enter the password incorrectly too many times. For other services, you may be able to see security questions to reset the password up front. The hint may be in the form of statement, like \"Last 4 digits of your phone number,\" or a question like \"What was the name of your first pet?\" Finding the answers can help you get into the account without having to know the password at all! Some sites allow people to type their own password hints, which might make guessing the password obvious. For example, \"dog + digit\" might be the hint, which certainly narrows down the options. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that asking for a hint or security questions might not display the hint right on the screen—instead, it might send the hint to the email address on file for the account. It may also send your IP address to the account owner, which they might be able to trace back to you. Be careful!"

      "content": "If you're trying to guess someone's Android or iPhone lock screen PIN, it might be easier than you'd think. This is because most phone unlock passwords are just short strings of numbers that are easy to guess. Depending on the person's phone, they'll usually have a 4 to 6 digit PIN set, which may correspond with a number that's significant to them. [4] X Research source If you know the person's phone number, social security number, birthdate, or even the birthdate of somebody close to them, you might be able to get into their phone without much trouble. People often choose a simple sequential number, such as 123456, or a repeating number, like 333333. Sometimes people choose numbers based on a pattern on the dial pad. For example, 1379—the top-left corner, the top-right corner, the bottom-left corner, and the bottom-right corner. In most cases, entering the wrong passcode too many times will typically lock you (and the phone's owner) out of the phone."

      "content": "Do you know the names of the person's family members, significant other, or pets? According to a survey from the National Cyber Security Centre in the UK, a whopping 15% of respondents used their pet's names in their passwords, while 14% used family members names. Some tips for guessing name-based passwords: If the person uses a name in their password, they'll likely also include a number and/or symbol, as most sites and apps require more complex passwords. Try the name of the person's significant other or spouse in conjunction with the date of their anniversary, birth year, or year they met. If the person has multiple children, their password might be a combo of all their kids' names. If they only have one kid, try that child's first name followed by their year of birth. The name of the person's current, favorite, or first pet is extremely common in passwords. If the person has a nickname, they may be using it as their password. Try their nickname followed by their year or birth or some other important number."

      "content": "If you know anything about the person's hobbies or interests, you may be able to guess their password. Because people have to come up with so many passwords for different apps, they often default to something that can be easy to remember , such as their favorite TV show, sports team, movie, hobby, character, or food. Because many apps and sites require longer passwords, you can try combining some of these details to come up with a password. For example, \"Tigergolf,\" \"Golfpro,\" or \"Kobebball.\""

      "content": "Most people use numbers in their password, indicating a date or a lucky number. Because most apps and services require adding at least one number to passwords, people often stick to numbers that are easier to remember. You can try these numbers on their own or add them to the ends of the words you've already guessed. Here are some ways to guess a person's password based on numbers: To satisfy basic password requirements, many people simply tack a \"1\" or \"2\" to the end of their otherwise simple passwords. Try the person's birthday . For example, if their birthday is 12/18/75, try \"121875\" or add 1975 to the end of one of the names or interests you've already guessed. The person's current or former street address, such as 955, could be a part of the password. If the person has been vocal about what their lucky number is, try it. If the person plays a sport, try their jersey number. Try all or part of a person's phone number, or maybe even just the area code at the end of another word. If the person has graduated college or high school, add their graduation year to the password."

      "content": "People may think they're fooling hackers by reversing the order of letters in easy-to-guess passwords. Once you learn the names of their important people, pets, and hobbies, try typing it backwards. You may also try an alternate spelling, or even replacing certain letters with numbers that look like them. For example, if their dog's name is Brunhilda, their password might be Adlihnurb. People often replace letters with numbers to make their passwords more secure. For example, w1k1H0w instead of wikiHow , or g00gl3 instead of google . [5] X Research source"

This software uses long lists of words (both words from the dictionary and common variations with numbers and symbols) to crack passwords. [6] X Research source Malware such as keyloggers and screen capturers can record everything a user types in real time, including their usernames and passwords. But because installing malware to spy on people is illegal (even if you're using it with a family member or spouse), you should avoid using it without permission."
