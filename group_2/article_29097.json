      "content": "Cut a 9 by 12 inches (23 cm × 30 cm) piece of felt into a 5 by 12 inches (13 cm × 30 cm) cone. Fold your felt in half widthwise. Start at the bottom felt’s folded crease and measure across 5 inches (13 cm)—this will be the bottom of the hat. Now, measure 2 inches (5.1 cm) across from the fold at the top of the piece of felt—this will be the point of the hat. Use a pair of scissors to cut the felt on the opposite side of the fold, starting at the 5 inches (13 cm) mark and working your way up to the 2 inches (5.1 cm) mark at a diagonal. [1] X Research source Mark your measurements with a pen or marker or create a template of your measurements to follow as you cut. Add or subtract length to the gnome hat to make a taller or shorter hat. For example, if you want a shorter hat, try cutting your felt into a 5 by 7 inches (13 cm × 18 cm) cone. If your gnome’s body is larger than 5 inches (13 cm), add 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) to the body measurement. If you’re making a felt gnome hat for yourself, wrap a fabric tape measure around your own head and add 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) to the result to get the bottom measurement of your hat."

Try hot gluing white garland around the brim and point for a Santa-like gnome hat. [5] X Research source Pinch and glue sections of the hat together for a rustic, folded look. [6] X Research source Bend and drape the hat to the side of the gnome to make the hat look like a sleeping cap. [7] X Research source Slip the hat over a styrofoam cone to help it stay upright.

If it’s not, use a craft knife , pair of scissors, or box cutter to carefully trim the cone to the size you want. Lay the cone on its side, and shave off bits of the flat bottom until it's the right height. [9] X Research source Avoid trimming the top of the cone so it keeps its perfect point.

[13] X Research source Pick a larger, fuzzy tube sock for an aged hat. Play around with the sock folds to get the exact aesthetic you’re looking for. Fold the sock hem up and over to create a brim.
