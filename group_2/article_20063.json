      "content": "Complete 20-30 Elite Hunter or Player Hunter quests. You have a better chance to get the sword if you complete 30 quests, but a minimum of 20 will work. While doing 30 Elite Hunter or Player Hunter quests means that the drop chance is 100%, the fewer quests that you do means that your chances decrease, which also means that there is a probability that you will die when you attempt to get Yama. You can have 30 overall done between the two types of quests. For example, you can do 20 Elite Hunter quests and 10 Player Hunter quests. You can find the Elite Hunter quest-giver NPC in Castle on the Sea [1] X Research source in Third Sea, which means the players need to be at or above level 1500. [2] X Research source If he doesn't offer you a quest, simply wait 10 minutes and talk to him again. The enemies for his bounties have a 9-minute respawn timer. You can find the Player Hunter quest NPC in front of the palace at Castle on the Sea in Third Sea. You will get a quest to defeat a random player who has PVP enabled. [3] X Research source"
