When you’re constantly seeing your favorite celebrity all over your social media feed or on TV, it can be really hard to force yourself to think about anything else. Gradually begin to put some distance between yourself and your celebrity. For example, take a break from social media for a couple of days or avoid reading the tabloids about celebrity gossip. [1] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021. Another idea is to unfollow that celebrity on social media and get rid of any posters or other objects that may remind you of them. You certainly don’t have to quit cold turkey right from the start, but make an effort to create specific limitations for yourself. For example, limit yourself to only 1 hour of social media use a day."

      "content": "Focus on areas of your life you may have neglected. Obsessing over something or someone can make it really easy to ignore other important parts of your life, such as your work, relationships, or even personal health. Look to these other areas of your life and start investing the time you might’ve put towards your favorite celebrity to improve them. [3] X Research source For example, recconect with old friends or reach out to your family if you haven’t spoken to them in a while. If you’ve been neglecting your work or haven’t been putting in as much effort as you once did, sit down and make a schedule for yourself to plan out exactly when you’ll work and what tasks you’ll do. Make sure you’re taking care of yourself by eating right , getting enough sleep, and staying hydrated."

      "content": "Write down the celebrity’s positive and negative traits. No matter how famous or influential they may be, it’s important to remember that celebrities are people just like you. While they may seem perfect in the public eye, every single person has their share of flaws. [5] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021. Sit down and compile a pros and cons list about this particular celebrity to help put them in a more realistic light. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to go out looking for dirt on them that paints them in a very unflattering way. Rather, think about the little things that make them more human and less like a perfect superhuman. For example, what are some of their personality traits that you personally don’t find attractive? Do they have any habits that you don’t like? How different are their worldviews from your own?"

[7] X Research source Another idea is to have your friends introduce you to new people. Next time your friends invite you to a big gathering or party, respond with a definite “Yes.” Avoid comparing other people to your celebrity. Instead, focus on other people’s unique qualities and appreciate them for who they are. [8] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019."

Setting goals and accomplishing them can make you feel extremely accomplished and happy. And the best part is, you were the one to bring this happiness into your life, not your favorite celebrity. [9] X Research source Set goals that are specific, realistic, and actionable. Break your goal down into small, actionable steps that you can easily measure in order to track your progress. For example, if you have the goal of writing a short story, make it a goal to write 1,000 words a day for 3 weeks."

Sit down and write out all of the things you find appealing about this particular celebrity, whether it’s their looks, personality, or any works they’ve created. Then, ask yourself why these particular qualities appeal to you. One thing to remember is that people often obsess over celebrities because they think they’re “perfect.” [10] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021.

When your obsession is at a healthy level, you’re often still open to change and will be willing to listen to other people’s thoughts on your behavior. [11] X Research source However, an unhealthy obsession may cause you to push others away or completely ignore them in favor of paying attention to your favorite celebrity. Ask yourself these questions: Are you isolating yourself instead of participating in events? Are you quick-tempered with family or friends when you hear that your obsession has done something that upsets you? Do you feel depressed or anxious around others and spend time by yourself to reconnect with the object of your obsession? These are common experiences for some people with a celebrity obsession.

      "content": "Ask yourself what purpose your obsession serves you. Research suggests that celebrity obsessions can often serve two functions: companionship and personal identity. [13] X Research source Do you feel lonely and in need of someone who understands you? Or, perhaps you like the way the celebrity handles themselves and you want to be like them. If you can identify why this obsession may have formed, you’ll be able to more easily identify areas in your personal life that you can change to fill the gap where this celebrity might’ve once stood. For example, if you mostly look to this celebrity for companionship, it might be a sign to go out and try to expand your social circle and nurture positive relationships. On the other hand, if you personally identify with this celebrity, make an effort to embody their positive qualities but with your own unique style.

It’s certainly not a bad thing to engage in fantasizing every now and then, but it’s important to remember that that’s all they are; fantasies. [15] X Research source Ask yourself how likely these fantasies are to come true. For example, imagining seeing your favorite singer in concert is something that could realistically happen. But telling yourself that you’re going to marry your favorite celebrity is likely on the unrealistic side."

Knowing which category you might fall under and being aware of your behaviors can make it much easier to introduce changes to your thoughts and actions. Researchers have identified three categories of obsession under a syndrome known as celebrity worship syndrome: [16] X Research source Entertainment-social: This occurs when you’re attracted to a celebrity due to their ability to entertain and become a central topic of discussion with others. For example, you might keep up with news about a certain celebrity because you like to talk about them with your friends. Or, you like this celebrity because of the movies or music they produce. Intense-personal: This type of worship occurs when you have intense and compulsive feelings about a certain celebrity. If you have an intense-personal obsession, you might claim that this celebrity is your “soulmate.” Borderline pathological: This is the most severe level of obsession and refers to individuals who display uncontrollable behaviors and fantasies relating to a celebrity. For example, you would fall under this category if you were willing to commit a crime for your favorite celebrity."
