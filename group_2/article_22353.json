      "content": "Feel your emotions. It might be easier to push your emotions away or pretend they don’t exist. You may even think of yourself as strong for not engaging with your emotions. However, it’s important to feel what you need to feel regarding your trauma. Your feelings are valid, so let yourself express them. [1] X Research source For example, if something makes you feel angry, express that anger. If you become overwhelmed with sadness, don’t be afraid to cry. You might wish to talk about your feelings with a friend or therapist or write them down in a journal. Do what helps you express your emotions. Negative feelings won't just disappear immediately and may come and go for some time, but this is normal and healthy. You may alternate between periods of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, guilt or others. Embracing the negative emotions can help you understand and work through them sooner. Likewise, whenever you are feeling good, enjoy it! You earned it!"

      "title": "Tell your story.",
      "content": "Tell your story. Many survivors of trauma find it therapeutic to tell their stories and repeat them. Talking about the trauma can help express the pain and help to restore power back to you. It can also help you remove the awful feelings attached to the event. This might mean talking about it in a support group or therapist’s office, or with friends and family. [2] X Research source If talking about your story gives you extreme anxiety, see a mental health professional who specializes in trauma for advice so you avoid further traumatizing yourself in the process. [3] X Expert Source Rebecca Tenzer, MAT, MA, LCSW, CCTP, CGCS, CCATP, CCFP Clinical Therapist & Adjunct Professor Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. If you aren't sure but feel like trying, start with brief disclosures and then gauge how you feel. If you don’t want to tell your story, sometimes it can help to provide support for someone else who needs it. While many people find it helpful to talk, you might want to express your feelings through singing, dancing, or journaling.

Reader Poll: We asked 875 wikiHow readers what coping mechanism best helps with heartbreak and emotional pain, and only 6% of them said engaging in a creative activity like painting, drawing, or writing. [Take Poll] These activities may not always be the first thing to come to mind, but they can be relaxing and help take your mind off things. They might be worth trying during your healing journey."

      "content": "Embrace your spirituality. Some people turn toward religion or spirituality as a way to heal and work through trauma. Your beliefs may help you navigate the meaning and purpose of your negative experiences or help you connect with something outside of yourself. You may take refuge and comfort in your beliefs of a greater plan or higher power. Being a part of a spiritual community may help you gather with other like-minded individuals ready to help you and support you. Join a spiritual community or participate in spiritual practices on your own. Start by meditating or by reading sacred texts."

      "content": "Get involved in activities. Don’t let your entire life revolve around your trauma. Constantly thinking about the trauma can be draining and remove you from the rest of life. Part of healing is having things and experiences in your life that don’t involve the trauma. Enjoy some social activities like getting together with friends, going bowling, or attending concerts. Try to experience some “normal” time. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If you’re invited to spend time with friends, do your best to go, even if you don’t feel like it. Spending time doing “normal” things can help you feel like you’re moving toward a more normal life once again. On the other hand, you don't need to try to do so many things you have no time at all to think about your trauma. You might try designating a specific time to think about it, process emotions and grieve. You may eventually learn how to 'save' emotions or thought that pop up throughout your day for you to go over during your designated time. Even as you get involved with activities, take measures to feel safe. For example, go with other people you trust, stay in well-lit public areas, and allow yourself to leave if you ever feel unsafe."

      "content": "Avoid turning to drugs and alcohol. Self-medicating with drugs and alcohol may feel good in the moment, but it won’t make the trauma go away or help you on your healing process. Using drugs and alcohol tends to mask your problems momentarily, but can lead to addiction and other mental or emotional problems. Cope with your feelings in a healthy way and don’t turn to addictive substances for a quick fix. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Remember that addictive behaviors are not limited to drugs, but could include excessive eating, spending, gambling or technology use. Practice moderation to avoid these extremes. If you think you might have an addiction, get treatment and do activities that don’t revolve around addictive substances."

      "title": "Use relaxation.",
      "content": "Use relaxation. Because trauma often results in hyper vigilance and alertness, you may want to practice relaxation every day for 30 minutes to cope with daily stressors. This can help you deal with stressors as they occur without letting them accumulate. Relaxation can also help you with anxiety, depression, and stabilizing your moods. [7] X Research source Schedule a consistent daily time for these activities instead of trying to do them just when you think you need them. By forming these good habits you will be more likely to practice them even when you don't really feel like it or on a bad day, which is when you need to relax the most. If you don’t know where to start, try yoga , qi gong , or meditation. You can also listen to calming music, write in a journal, or take a daily walk with your dog. Have “mini-relaxation” activities on hand that you can do when you feel anxious and are not at home. For example, carry around essential oils, a stress ball, a book that you enjoy, or a fidget spinner that you can use anywhere."

      "content": "Practice mindfulness. Connect to the present moment through your senses, especially if you’re feeling threatened. Mindfulness involves bringing focused and non-judgmental awareness to your experience. It can help a threatened mind or body come into a calm, non-reactive state. If you feel triggered by something, engage in some mindful practices to bring you back to the present moment. [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source There are lots of ways to practice mindfulness. You can focus on one sense at a time (like listening intently or visually scanning the room in detail) or focus on your breathing. Mindfulness can be challenging at first, but will become much easier with practice. Nobody is adept at this technique when they are just starting out, so don't get discouraged and give up! Consider trying guided meditations to familiarize yourself with it, either in a class or from various online resources."

Though trauma is largely psychological, some physical interventions can help you get “unstuck.” Do something that requires full-body movements such as walking, running, swimming, or dancing. Notice the sensations in your body as you move and put your focus and awareness fully onto your body.

      "content": "Find a safe place. When recovering from trauma, it’s imperative to have a place that feels safe. Your body may be on high alert when you’re out and about, so have a place you feel entirely safe. This might be your bedroom, a restaurant, or a parent’s or friend’s house. The important thing is that you feel safe and not threatened. You may also want to have activities that make you feel safe at your safe place. This might be singing, dancing, talking to someone, or writing in a journal."

      "content": "Spend time with friends and family. You don’t have to talk about the trauma, but surround yourself with people who love and support you. If you feel like talking, share your feelings with someone, preferably face-to-face. If you don’t feel like talking, be around people who make you feel supported and you can talk to if you want to. [11] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Lean on people who will listen and care about you. If there are friends who often drain you, take some time away and focus on being with the people who add to your life positively. Some people may try to tell you to \"get over it\" or otherwise push you to move on before you are ready. While these people usually mean well, or may be trying to deal with their own discomfort over the situation, being around them too much can be detrimental to your recovery."
