      "content": "A TikTok Galaxy costs 1,000 coins. Without any first-time coin purchase bonuses, this will cost you around $16 USD if you buy the 660 coin package, 330 coin package, and 20 coin package. Alternatively, if you just want to make one purchase, you can buy the 1,321 coin package for about $20. If you still have a first-time coin purchase bonus available, you can just buy the 660 coin package and the 330 coin package to get enough to buy a TikTok Galaxy."

      "content": "Convert coins to diamonds to see how much the creator is getting. If you're curious how much money the creator is getting from your Galaxy, you can figure this out with some simple math or by using a TikTok diamonds calculator . One TikTok coin is worth half a diamond. This means that a TikTok Galaxy will net a creator 500 Diamonds. Multiply 500 by 0.005 (because one diamond is worth half a US cent). This means a TikTok Galaxy will give a creator $2.50 USD."

      "content": "TikTok gifts are like giving your favorite creator a tip. A TikTok Galaxy isn't the most expensive gift available, but it's much more than something like a Rose (which costs less than a dollar). A TikTok Galaxy shows that you appreciate the creator's content and want to support them by giving them a slightly larger tip."

      "content": "As a viewer, it's sometimes worth sending a TikTok Galaxy. Sending a Galaxy to your favorite creator on TikTok is a good way to show your support for them, and if you're sending it during a LIVE, it's an interactive experience with the TikToker and everyone else watching. However, TikTok creators don't get the majority of your donation when you send a Galaxy. If this concerns you, check if your favorite creator has a Patreon or Ko-Fi where you can either subscribe monthly to support their work or send them a monetary tip to show your appreciation for their work. If you can't afford a TikTok gift or you're under 18 and you're trying to skirt around TikTok's age restriction for gifting, then TikTok gifts aren't worth it . Learn how to spend responsibly and identify the signs of a parasocial relationship (especially if you're only buying a creator gifts because you want them to notice you)."
