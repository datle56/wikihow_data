      "content": "Create invitations! Designing your own invitations is a lot of fun! It shows your creativity & you can make it special for the theme of your party! If you choose not to make them on your own, store-bought invites will work too, especially for young ones. Or you can e-mail the invites. You could also hand out invitations and send reminders via e-mail to those who have not yet responded. And make sure to add the hotel name, and number of the room your staying in, and everything they should bring, including CD's they may want to listen too, and bathing suits if you have a hotel with a pool.Make sure to have the pick-up time at least a half-hour before check-out time, so you can take off the decorations. Also make sure to tell them that the pick-up time is sharp! You don't want your guests to be waiting in the hallway until their parents get there! [3] X Research source"

Send the party invitations early. Try to get RSVPs back one month before an event so you can make changes based on the guest count. If you do not have all the details ready by the time you want to send the invitations, you can always have an event website. You can mention the website address on the invitation and say they can refer to it for more details. You can post updates on that website. It will give you some extra time. It will not be necessary to have everything ready by the time you print the invite."
