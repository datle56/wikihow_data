Your genetic profile is the primary factor in how quickly (and how fully) your beard grows, and there’s not much you can do about that. On average, though, most people will see their facial hair fully grow in after 4 weeks of not shaving. While you can take measures to support the process and increase the growth, accept that your beard will grow in its own way and at its own pace.

Exfoliate your entire face and beard 1-3 times a week to open your pores and reduce ingrown hairs. Use a leave-in conditioner for beards to keep the hair soft and moisturized and to eliminate beard dandruff. Experiment with different beard oils , creams, and lotions to see what works best for your beard and skin type. Wash your face twice a day by wetting your face with warm water and then massaging in a gentle face cleanser. Use a mild shampoo on your facial hair, then rinse everything away with cool water and pat your face dry with a soft towel. Avoid beard oil if you have acne, as it may worsen your breakouts.
