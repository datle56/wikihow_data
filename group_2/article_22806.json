      "title": "Cross your legs to hold in your urine.",
      "content": "Cross your legs to hold in your urine. This can help hold in your pee and relieve the unpleasant sensation. [1] X Research source Simply put one leg over the other and, using your hands, push hard on your inner thighs. Do not press hard on your lower stomach, which puts more pressure on your bladder area. Also don’t lean forward onto your bladder. In the meantime, tell the driver that you need to use the restroom. Even if you’re on a bus or another public vehicle, your driver might be able to help."

      "title": "Sit as still as possible and relax every muscle that isn’t your bladder.",
      "content": "Sit as still as possible and relax every muscle that isn’t your bladder. Squirming or fidgeting only makes the urge to pee feel even worse. Take deep breaths and sit as still as you can. Also, focus on relaxing your other muscles, which helps alleviate pressure.

      "title": "Distract yourself with games or other thoughts.",
      "content": "Distract yourself with games or other thoughts. Often, the need to pee is mostly mental, and if you distract yourself, the urge will lessen. [3] X Research source Play games or scroll on your phone, read a book, or play a car game, like looking for the letters of the alphabet in order on other car’s license plates. Also try thinking about your plans later today, or just paying extra attention to the road."

      "title": "Turn down the AC and turn on the heat.",
      "content": "Turn down the AC and turn on the heat. Cold temperatures make you feel the need to pee more. [4] X Research source If possible, turn down the AC, and even consider turning up the heat a little bit. If that’s not possible, put on a sweater or a coat to raise your body heat."

      "title": "Use positive self-talk to convince yourself you can hold it.",
      "content": "Use positive self-talk to convince yourself you can hold it. Reassuring yourself that you can manage your bladder is a powerful and effective tool. [5] X Research source Think, \"I can hold it\" or \"I can make it.\" Repeat this in your head until you can use a toilet. Avoid any thoughts of water, urination, moistness, or even sex. If you can’t stop thinking about needing to pee, redirect those thoughts with “dry thoughts.” Imagine a dry desert, a cloudless sky, a roaring fire—anything but water."

      "content": "Loosen your lower body clothing. Avoid anything that puts pressure on your bladder. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Loosen up your pants or jeans if you are wearing them by unbuttoning or unzipping them. Also loosen your belt, and shift tight waistbands if at all possible."

      "title": "Perform a pelvic floor exercise to hold it in.",
      "content": "Perform a pelvic floor exercise to hold it in. Pelvic floor exercises, or Kegels, tighten your pelvic floor, which helps block your urinary tract. To do a kegel , squeeze the muscles you’d use to hold in gas, hold the squeeze for 3 seconds, then relax for 5-10 seconds and repeat. [7] X Research source Repeat this 5-10 times, or until the urge to pee lessens. This works for both men and women."

      "title": "If you can, pull over and pee at the side of the road.",
      "content": "If you can, pull over and pee at the side of the road. If you can't get to a bathroom in time, peeing on the side of the road might be your next best option. Once you have pulled over, try to find the most discreet place to pee, for example behind some bushes. However, you shouldn't feel too embarrassed even if people driving by see you pee. Use the car door as a privacy shield, or angle your car so that other traffic can’t see you. You might also wrap a sweater or blanket around your waist while you pee. As a woman, pee in a place where the ground slopes away from your shoes. Squat or sit against a tree or a rock. You might even lean your back against the car to pee more discreetly."

      "title": "Pee into a waterproof container.",
      "content": "Pee into a waterproof container. If there's no way you can pull over and pee, your next best option is to pee into a cup, a bag or other container. A container with a lid is preferable to prevent the pee from spilling while driving. Pee in a plastic bag only as a last resort since they can easily leak. Consider keeping a pee funnel in the car if you’re a woman to make urinating on the go (outdoors or into a container) easier. Even if the container is less than ideal, it’s still better than wetting your pants."

      "title": "Cover yourself and protect your seat if you do pee in your pants.",
      "content": "Cover yourself and protect your seat if you do pee in your pants. If wetting your pants is inevitable, be as discreet as possible. Wrap your waist with a washable coat or blanket, and cover the seat with something like a plastic bag or a towel, if available. Change your pants as soon as possible to avoid rashes or odors. Open a window, if possible, to disperse the odor. If you end up peeing in your pants, remain calm. Accidents happen, and it happens to everyone now and then. There's no need to panic."

Especially avoid drinks which have diuretic effects, like coffee, tea, soda, and alcohol.

      "content": "Visit the bathroom right before the car trip. Even if you don't feel an urgent need to go, it's a good idea to pee before the trip. That said, don’t go if you don’t have to! Forcing yourself to urinate more than needed is counterproductive, and “teaches” your bladder that it doesn’t ever need to hold it, making you need to pee more. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice bladder training exercises to pee less often.",
      "content": "Practice bladder training exercises to pee less often. Bladder training involves holding your pee for set amounts of time to increase your bladder capacity. To do this, empty your bladder first thing in the morning, then, next time you need to pee, purposefully hold it in for 2-5 minutes. Or, set intervals throughout the day when you’ll pee, and at these times, try to pee even if you don’t need to, then hold it in until the next interval. [10] X Research source Increase the interval by several minutes every few days, until you can comfortably hold your pee for longer. Successful bladder training often takes several weeks to see results. Don’t push yourself too hard! Holding in your pee for too long can lead to urinary tract infections or other complications."

If you know there isn’t a stop for a good while, go pee at the current stop. Or, change your route to include more rest stops. If you know you’ll have trouble, consider wearing an absorbent pad to catch leaks, or a portable urinal to use while on the go."
