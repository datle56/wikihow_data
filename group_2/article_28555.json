      "content": "Use a ruler to draw a cross shape on your paper. The cross should be composed of a square in the center with four squares adjacent on all sides. These squares will fold up to form the sides of the box."

      "title": "Add an extra square to the bottom of the cross.",
      "content": "Add an extra square to the bottom of the cross. Make sure you have enough space on the paper to put it there. This will be the top of the box."

      "title": "Add flaps.",
      "content": "Add flaps. These should be on the sides of the top, left and right of the cross, leaving the joint two squares at the bottom as they are. These flaps will be used as joints to secure each side of the cube, and you can choose if you want to glue them inside or outside of the box to determine whether you will see them on the final product. If you can make them neat and even, the final product will look better."

      "title": "Cut out the cross shape with a pair of scissors.",
      "content": "Cut out the cross shape with a pair of scissors. Be sure to cut outside the lines of the flaps and do not cut any of the lines connecting the squares. Once the whole thing is cut out, you will be able to fold and then secure the right places to form a cube."

      "content": "Fold the left and right sides of the cross upwards. This should make a right angle. Be sure to make nice, crisp folds. You can use your fingernail to ensure that the folds are crisp."

      "content": "Fold the top square of the longest part of the cross over. This forms the top of the cube. Hold these in place while you fold the other sides to meet it."

      "title": "Tape or glue all six sides of the cube together.",
      "content": "Tape or glue all six sides of the cube together. If you use clear tape or glue on the inside of the box it will look more seamless, but you can also quickly tape the outside with clear tape or even washi tape. Be sure that you secure the seams from one end to the other with glue or tape, and not just a small dab of tape in the center, especially if you plan to fill the box with candy or other small objects. Save the seam on the top of the box for last and only seal it up if you are not planning to place anything inside the box. Otherwise be sure you fill it before you seal it!"

      "content": "Make boxes for gift giving. This is the most common use for handmade 3D boxes, and adds a personal and unique touch to any gift. It works best for small and lightweight gifts, as the boxes can become unwieldy as they get too big. You can use decorative paper for more ornamental boxes. Use printed paper, such as cardstock made for scrapbooking, or create your own unique paper by water-coloring designs on cardstock, allowing it to dry flat, and then using it to create boxes. Hang them from a Christmas tree as decorations with a surprise inside. Glue or tape a loop of string inside the box as you are sealing it, and use the loop to hang it from the tree. Make boxes of progressively smaller sizes and nest them together like nesting dolls, with the \"real\" gift inside the smallest box. This would be a cute way to present someone with a piece of jewelry-- maybe even an engagement ring!"

      "content": "Try 3D boxes for a unique Advent calendar. If you celebrate Christmas (or if you want to adapt the Advent calendar tradition for your own holiday or birthday month for a loved one), you can make one box for each day leading up to Christmas in the month of December. Traditionally, there are 24 small spaces on an Advent calendar and each one is either filled with a scripture reference to look up or with a small candy, or both. Make 24 3D boxes of the same size. You can make them of decorative holiday cardstock or you can paint them yourself. Donâ€™t close the tops yet! On the tops of the boxes, write the numbers 1 to 24 in a calligraphy or other fancy print to suit your style. Glue the 3D boxes together with the tops unsealed and facing up. You can glue them in any configuration that looks nice to you or fits your space. You might try 8 boxes long by 3 boxes wide, or 6 boxes long by 4 boxes wide, or 12 boxes long by 2 boxes wide: whatever you prefer! You can even glue them together in one long line and then place the whole thing atop your mantle or down the runner on your table for a decoration. Place a small trinket, toy, gift, candy, or scripture reference inside each box and then close carefully with a small amount of clear tape. On each day of the month leading up to Christmas, you or your loved ones can open the box with the corresponding number."

      "content": "Use them as light boxes for photography. If you blog or sell items online, you know how frustrating it can be to try to take a simple yet attractive photo of a small object, from a plate of food to a tube of lipstick. Using an open 3D box as a lightbox for your items can be a great way to get good shots. Make a solid white 3D box but instead of sealing it, cut off one side so that it is open. Place it on its side so that the open side is facing you. Place a small object inside the box toward the back. Since you can make 3D boxes in any size, you can make a bigger box for a bigger object. You will need to be able to light the whole box to get a good picture. For a very small object in a small box, the flash from your camera should be enough to fill the box with light. For bigger objects, set up a small lamp near the light box to shine inside as you take the pictures."
