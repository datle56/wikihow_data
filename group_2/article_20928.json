      "title": "Use white craft glue for paper, cardboard, wood, and small-scale projects.",
      "content": "Use white craft glue for paper, cardboard, wood, and small-scale projects. For casual arts and crafts projects, the easiest way to glue Styrofoam is usually to use ordinary white glue (also called PVA glue). This basic glue works reasonably well, especially for gluing Styrofoam to construction paper, cardboard, and wood. It's also usually the cheapest and most accessible option, making it a great choice for simple projects. Popular options for craft glue: White school glue like Elmer’s Liquid School Glue , white tacky glue like Aleene’s Tacky Glue or Elmer’s Craft Glue , and wood glue like Tite-Bond II . White school glue is inexpensive and non-toxic, so it’s great for kid-friendly projects. However, it tends to be runny, so it can be messy—and it may not be as strong or long-lasting as other options. White tacky glue tends to be thicker and less messy."

      "title": "Try an all-purpose adhesive for a stronger hold on fabric or wood.",
      "content": "Try an all-purpose adhesive for a stronger hold on fabric or wood. All-purpose adhesives are similar to craft glue, but they usually have a better hold, so they can be used on larger surfaces. They’re also good for gluing Styrofoam to a wider variety of materials, including fabric or wood. You can also opt for a gel-based super glue—just make sure it doesn’t contain cyanoacrylate or other solvents. Popular all-purpose adhesives for Styrofoam: Weldbond Multi-Surface Glue , Elmer’s Glue-All , and original Gorilla Glue ."

      "title": "Use Styrofoam adhesive to glue Styrofoam pieces to each other.",
      "content": "Use Styrofoam adhesive to glue Styrofoam pieces to each other. Styrofoam adhesive, sometimes marketed as \"Styroglue\", is usually fairly affordable. It can be a little more difficult to find than ordinary school glue, but you can purchase it online or at many home improvement or arts and crafts stores. Popular Styrofoam glues include: Loctite PL300 Foamboard Adhesive , Hold the Foam , and DAP Foamboard Construction Adhesive . Some Styrofoam glues are formulated only to glue Styrofoam pieces together, while others may be suitable for gluing Styrofoam to other surfaces. Check the label to make sure the adhesive fits your project."

      "title": "Use spray adhesive for larger projects and most materials.",
      "content": "Use spray adhesive for larger projects and most materials. Most aerosol adhesives offer a quick, convenient way to glue Styrofoam. Because these sprays are usually intended for multipurpose home use, they generally work on a variety of surfaces, including metal, plastic, paper, cardboard, and wood. Popular spray adhesives for Styrofoam include: 3M Super 77 Spray Adhesive , Elmer’s Multi-Purpose Spray Adhesive , Gorilla Spray Adhesive If you’re not sure whether your spray adhesive is safe to use on Styrofoam, test it on a small scrap piece first to make sure it won’t dissolve your project. Spray adhesives tend to be low-tack—they’re best for attaching large pieces of Styrofoam together, but not as good at connecting pieces that need a strong hold over a small surface area, like Styrofoam balls."

      "title": "Use a low-temperature hot glue gun for precise applications.",
      "content": "Use a low-temperature hot glue gun for precise applications. Hot glue is great for binding Styrofoam to a variety of different craft surfaces, including paper, cardboard, and wood. And the nozzle on the gun makes it easy to put glue only where you need it. But it’s important to use a low-temp glue gun —if the glue is too hot, it will melt your Styrofoam. If you don’t have access to a hot glue gun, vinyl adhesive caulk can also be a good option when you need something you can apply with precision. Use caution when working with heat and Styrofoam. The fumes from melting styrofoam contain a variety of toxic chemicals, including styrene and benzene, suspected carcinogens (cancer-causing agents).

      "content": "Use two-part epoxy if you want to harden the Styrofoam. Epoxy is a great way to attach Styrofoam to slick surfaces like metal or glass. [2] X Research source A two-part epoxy kit includes a bottle of resin and a bottle of hardener. When you mix them according to the package instructions, you’ll get a thin, clear glue that you can brush onto the Styrofoam. When it sets, the resin will harden, giving structure to the Styrofoam. [3] X Research source Popular two-part epoxy resins for Styrofoam include: Any fast-curing 2-part epoxy"

      "title": "Avoid glues that include solvent.",
      "content": "Avoid glues that include solvent. Because Styrofoam is plastic-based, you'll want to avoid using any glues that contain a solvent that can dissolve plastic. Using one of these may erode your Styrofoam, creating a liquid mess and ruining your project. This might include fabric glue, rubber cement, and superglues that contain cyanoacrylate."

      "title": "Wipe down the Styrofoam with a dry cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe down the Styrofoam with a dry cloth. Before gluing, it's always a good idea to clear each surface of dirt and debris by wiping with a clean, dry rag. Gluing over a dirty or dusty surface can interfere with the bonding action of the glue, resulting in a weaker hold. Smooth out your surfaces if needed. If you're gluing to an especially \"gappy\" surface (like a rough piece of wood with lots of surface imperfections), consider sanding the surface with 200-grit sandpaper to make it smoother for a better hold.

      "title": "Apply a thin, even layer of adhesive to both pieces you’re gluing.",
      "content": "Apply a thin, even layer of adhesive to both pieces you’re gluing. When you're ready to start, apply your glue to the Styrofoam surface. If you’re using a weaker adhesive, like craft glue, use a thin, even layer that covers the entire surface. If you're using a stronger glue or one that expands, like Gorilla Glue, use beads or lines of glue. Be sure to carefully follow the label instructions on the adhesive you chose. For instance, you’ll need to prepare two-part epoxy ahead of time. If you are working with a very large piece of Styrofoam, consider pouring the glue into a tray, and applying the glue with a paintbrush. Work in a well-ventilated area, especially if you’re using spray adhesive or glue with strong fumes. Consider reinforcing Styrofoam balls with toothpicks. If you’re gluing two Styrofoam balls together, stick a toothpick into one, then press the other ball onto the end of the toothpick that’s sticking out. This will help hold the two balls together."

      "title": "Press the Styrofoam onto the other surface for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Press the Styrofoam onto the other surface for 1 minute. After you apply the glue, press the two pieces together. Press down gently to ensure that both surfaces are making contact. Hold the pieces together until the glue sets—this will usually take about 1 minute. Depending on the type of glue you use, you'll usually have around a minute or so to make minor adjustments—but work quickly, because once the glue sets, you won’t be able to move the pieces. For extra hold, apply a little extra glue around the edges of your Styrofoam where it meets your other surface. This will help seal the edges—just don’t use too much, or it will look messy and take longer to dry."

      "title": "Let the Styrofoam cure for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Let the Styrofoam cure for 24 hours. Once you’ve glued the project together, all that’s left to do is wait! Depending on the size of your pieces, the type of glue you used, and the amount of glue you used, your drying time may vary from just a few minutes to many hours. To be safe, let the glue cure for at least 24 hours before you try to move the foam. If necessary, use sturdy objects like books or boxes to prop up your project while it dries. Some glues will need more time to set, especially if it is very cold or humid. Remember to handle styrofoam with care even after drying is complete—it's easy to accidentally chip or break Styrofoam projects by bumping or dropping them, even if they’re glued securely."
