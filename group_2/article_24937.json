      "content": "Make your bed every morning when you wake up. One of the most effective ways to keep your room clean is by making your bed every day. Make sure the corners on your fitted sheet align with the corners of the bed and tuck the top sheet under the edges of your mattress. Spread your blanket or comforter evenly across the entire bed, then fluff and position your pillows. [1] X Research source To make hospital corners on your top sheet, tuck one end in at the end of the bed. Pick up the corner of the sheet and put the edge on the top of the bed, forming a triangle. Tuck the bottom edge of the sheet into the mattress, then pull the triangle down and tuck it into the mattress to form a clean line along the corner of the bed."

If you like to change into comfy clothes after a long day at school or work, throw your dirty clothes straight into the hamper. Fold and put away any clean clothes that you're going to wear again. After a long day, it can be tempting to throw your coat and clothes on the floor or bed. However, putting away your clothes as soon as you take them off can help you maintain a clean room. Try to avoid leaving dirty clothes on the floor, on the bed, or lying around in the bathroom or laundry room. Consider placing laundry hampers in areas where you regularly change, like in the bathroom, in your closet, or near your dresser. [2] X Research source"

[11] X Research source Daily chores might include making the bed, putting away dirty clothes, or tidying up toys, papers, and other items. If you miss a day of cleaning, try to do those chores as soon as you can the next day to prevent messes from building up. Try turning cleaning into a game to make the job more fun.

To keep your closet organized: [18] X Research source Make it a routine: Go through your closet once or twice per year, and clear out the items you no longer use. Use wasted wall space: Make blank wall space functional by installing shelves or hooks to hang accessories. Raise your clothes rod: Open up some space by hanging your clothing rod higher on the wall. This can allow you to put a dresser or shoe rack underneath your hanging clothes. Place items you use frequently in front: Put the items that you reach for first in the most accessible parts of your closet. This can help you get ready faster. Get slimmer hangers: To save space, professional organizer Christel Ferguson recommends using thin hangers instead of wooden hangers, which can “take up a lot of space.” [19] X Expert Source Christel Ferguson Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 17 December 2018."
