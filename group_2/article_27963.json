      "content": "Gather your materials. Making a saline solution is simple because all you need is salt and water! [1] X Research source Sea salt or table salt are both acceptable for a saline solution, but use a non-iodized salt (pickling or kosher) if you have an iodine allergy. To administer the solution nasally, you'll also need a small spray bottle. One that holds one to two ounces is ideal. Infants and small children aren't able to blow their noses effectively. Get a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to remove nasal secretions gently and efficiently."

      "title": "Make the saline solution.",
      "content": "Make the saline solution. There's more to making saline that just mixing salt and water. For the salt to effectively dissolve into the water, you must raise the water temperature. Boiling the water will also kill off any potentially dangerous microbes living in the tap water. Boil 8 oz. of water, then allow it to cool until just \"very warm.\" Add ¼ teaspoon of salt and mix well until the salt dissolves. The ¼ teaspoon of salt will make a saline solution that matches the amount of salt in your body (isotonic). You may want to try a salt spray that has a greater concentration of salt than your body (hypertonic). This is useful for significant congestion with a lot of discharge. If you're having trouble breathing or clearing your nose, consider a hypertonic solution. [2] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source To do this, simply add 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1/4 teaspoon. Don’t use a hypertonic solution for infants or small children younger than five years old."

      "content": "Consider adding baking soda (optional). A half teaspoon of baking soda will adjust the pH of the solution. This makes it less likely to sting a sore nose, especially with hypertonic solutions with a higher salt content. Add it while the water is still warm, and mix well to dissolve the baking soda. [3] X Research source You can add the salt and the baking soda all at once, but adding the salt first usually results in easier mixing."

Spray one or two squirts into each nostril. Use your left hand for your right nostril, and your right hand for your left nostril. Sniff gently to keep the saline solution from dripping right out of your nose. Make sure not to snort it back into your throat, though, as this may cause irritation in your septum."

Tilt the child's head back slightly and hover the tip of the bulb over one nostril. Drop three to four drops of the solution into each nostril, avoiding touching the inside of the nostril with the tip as best you can (it can be hard to do this with a wiggling baby!).

After that, you can use the rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove secretions from the child's nose. Use a soft tissue to gently wipe away any secretions that remain around the nostrils. Remember to use a new tissue on each nostril, and make sure to wash your hands before and after each treatment. [7] X Research source Tilt the child's head back slightly. Press on the bulb to remove about 1/4 of the air from it, then gently insert the tip into the nostril. Release the bulb to suction nasal secretions into the rubber-bulb syringe. Do not insert the tip deep into the child's nose. You're only removing the material in the front part of the nostril.

[9] X Research source The best times to do this is before feeding or bed, to help your child breathe better while eating and sleeping. If the child squirms too much, just relax and try again later.
