[1] X Research source All of these sources are external. So, try not to compare and contrast yourself with others, as that’s a sure way to downplay your own attractiveness. Instead, focus on your own definition of beauty and the characteristics that make you beautiful.

      "content": "Practice feeling comfortable naked. If no one is around to see you, develop your confidence by walking around the house naked for a little while. If there are other people in the house, get in a little naked time by doing some of your post-shower hygiene routine before putting your clothes on. If you have someone you are romantically intimate with, ask him or her to spend some time being naked with you. Over time, you'll grow an appreciation for your natural body. Give your naked body a hug all while aiming to notice the good things your body does for you, like its ability to heal, to play sport, to make things, to carry objects and other people, to let you travel, and more. It may seem simple but we are often too ready to critique our bodies instead of acknowledge all the amazing, good things they do for us each and every day; the hug helps to remind you to look on the good side."

      "content": "Smile and make eye contact. Even when you’re naked, most people will notice your face first. Your expression there will set the context for everything else they see, so give them a winning smile and show off your confidence. Add good eye contact, and you'll look irresistible. To ensure a good smile and good breath, floss and brush your pearly whites. You might look for toothpaste approved by the American Dental Association. Rinsing with mouthwash will help as well. Make sure your eyes look great by getting plenty of rest at least a few nights before. Also consider trying out brightening eye drops, but consult an eye doctor first. Certain eye drops can actually constrict blood vessels."

      "content": "Worry less about what the other person’s thinking. Chances are, people who see you naked aren’t thinking what you think they’re thinking, regardless of gender. Research suggests that men, as much as women, want to feel attractive during intimate moments. [3] X Research source Fake it ’til you make it. No one is 100% satisfied with how they look. So, everyone who’s confident in their naked selves is faking it to a certain extent and in a healthy way. Why not you too? Don’t apologize. Avoid drawing attention to anything negative or anything you might perceive as negative—verbally or even mentally, as much as you can avoid it. And never apologize for the way you look!"

      "content": "Straighten your posture. Standing or sitting with good posture will make you look taller, slimmer, and more confident. Imagine there’s a string running all the way through your body, from the base of your spine to the top of your head, and alter your posture as if the string is being pulled taut. Just don't stand so stiff you look strained and tense. Notice your chin lift from your neck, making it appear more elongated. Your shoulders should also move down and backward. Your stomach should pull inward and upward (smoothing out any rolls), and your back will settle into a natural arch that pushes out both the butt and the chest."

      "content": "Walk, stand, or sit at an angle. Try this old modeling trick, meant to make people look better on a two-dimensional plane. Aim to stand or sit on the diagonal, with a slight twist at the waist instead of facing someone head-on. This will naturally cinch in your waist. Further, walk with one foot directly in front of the other, forcing your waist to again twist back and forth. This sort of fluid motion will make you seem more trim overall."

      "content": "Show off your best features. Everyone has parts of their body they are particularly happy with. How you position your body will “direct traffic” to or away from certain body parts. Here are some suggestions: Put a hand on your hip. If you like your waist, draw the eye there by putting a hand on one hip. Twist your torso slightly to accentuate the narrowness of your waist even more. Arch your back. Arching your back will play up your chest and butt, making them appear more prominent. Women can also lift their rears a bit by putting on a pair of high heels. Point your toes and cross your legs slightly. If you want to direct attention to your legs, keep your toes pointed and your legs slightly crossed, so that they overlap a bit. This will make them appear longer and smoother. Push your chest forward. To make your chest appear bigger, drop your shoulders and fold your arms around your waist, so that each hand lands on the opposite waist curve. Raise your arms over your head and flex a bit. Even less muscular men and women can show off the muscles in their arms and shoulders by lifting their arms and flexing their triceps and biceps a bit."

Put on deodorant, and wear a body spray, perfume, or cologne—but only enough of the latter that only someone close enough to embrace you would smell.

If the lamp is still too bright, throw a sheer scarf or sheet over it, or if you can, point it to shine on the wall instead of into the room. Position yourself so that the lighting is behind you, showing off your confident silhouette instead of any flaws you might be worried about."

If you have time, take a shower or bath to wash and condition your hair and gently clean and exfoliate your whole body. You'll come out looking great and glowing!

      "content": "Simplify your hair. Nudity usually comes with (or at least gives the appearance of) a degree of intimacy. For this reason a hairstyle that looks relaxed and casually confident is often better than something tightly gelled or elaborately coiffed. The fewer pins and ties in your hair, the more natural you will look. Create appealing bed-head. Before you strip down, run your fingers through the roots of your hair making a scrubbing motion. You can also apply a root-lifting product in horizontal sections where the hair meets the scalp, and blow dry. Alternatively, you can hang dry hair upside down, and point a blow dryer on a cool air setting up at it. For last-minute lift, spray dry shampoo on your roots. Let it dry for a few minutes before mussing your hair with your fingers."

      "content": "Apply a bit of makeup and moisturizer. Wear a full face of product if that's your preference, or go natural. Play up your cheeks with a light pink or coral blush that will make them look naturally flushed, and add a lip color that's one shade darker than your natural tone. At the very least, try to apply lip balm for smoother lips. Don't overdo the makeup. When you are nude, bold makeup colors don’t have clothes to compete with for attention. If you put on too much makeup, it will be more obvious when you are naked. On the other hand, you can keep attention on your face by applying an eye-catching shade of lipstick. Use moisturizer. Lotion, body oil, or other moisturizers will prevent your skin from drying out, give it a healthy sheen, and make your skin particularly soft to the touch. Avoid products with parabens and other toxic ingredients."

Although the cold will make ladies’ breasts stand at attention, guys don't get the same benefits—and shivering with hunched shoulders isn’t a sexy look for anybody. Don’t crank up the heat too far, either: a glow is good, but sweating profusely is not. Aim for a little above room temperature, which is approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius)."

Immediately before you plan to be naked, avoid foods that cause gas and bloating, such as beans, carbonated beverages, dairy products, and foods with high levels of fructose and unrefined sugars. If your stomach expands anyway, try to go for a walk or make a trip to the bathroom—both will help move things along, so to speak. Over the longer term, try to incorporate healthy, slimming foods into your diet, such as fresh produce and items that contain omega-3 fatty acids."

It might seem obvious, but a healthy diet and exercise will improve your skin and body in a variety of ways—and make you feel better and more confident in general. Here are some mostly-painless ways to start. Incorporate 10 or 20 minutes of light stretching or weight training into your day, and try to walk when possible. You'll notice a difference over the course of a few weeks. Tailor your exercise plan to your goals. If you want to lose weight, calorie restriction and cardio exercises are going to be your ticket. If you want to gain muscle, progressive weight training and getting enough protein is what you need. Consider getting a personal trainer. They can help you identify your goals and guide you toward them with expert knowledge and experience. If you're new to getting fit, a personal trainer will be the best way for you to ensure success."

      "content": "Get a sunless tan . If you want your skin to look glowing, try applying a tinted moisturizer or bronze tanning lotion on your body. Exfoliate first, and be careful that you do this far in advance of having anything else touch your skin; you could stain something before the product dries fully. After your first coat has set, apply additional tanner to areas you would like to look leaner, like your thighs or waist. This gives a slimming shadow look. [5] X Research source Remember that tanning is best in moderation—too much will look more alien than attractive. And when in the presence of the real sun, wear sunscreen and avoid harsh UV rays."

      "content": "Groom your body hair. You might find that you feel and look better naked with a little body hair management. Many women choose to de-fuzz their armpits , legs , back , bikini line , or pubic area . Many men also trim or shave their private region and keep an eye on the rest of their body hair, at the very least trimming down lone hairs that grow too long. Here are some methods to do so, from least time-consuming upward. Shaving . Use a safety or straight razor to remove excess hair. Shaving is best done in the shower, while your skin is surrounded by plenty of moisture, and with some sort of shaving cream or hair conditioner applied to your skin first. Watch out for razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and make sure to shave shortly before you plan to be naked to avoid the appearance of stubble. Waxing . Waxing will remove unwanted body hair for 4 to 6 weeks. However, the process is a lot more painful than shaving, and it can be harmful to people with certain skin sensitivities. Book an appointment at a salon for a consultation to figure out if waxing is the right choice for you. Never wax yourself at home, unless you're an experienced esthetician, or you have one helping you. You could seriously damage your skin if you do it wrong. Threading . Threading is similar to plucking, and pulls individual hairs out with tiny knots on a string of thread. Book an appointment at a local threading salon to find out more. This also works to remove unwanted eyebrow hair. Electrolysis or laser hair removal. These procedures are administered by a licensed professional over a long period of time, and usually result in dramatically reduced hair growth. Pluck any strays. After you've used the hair removal method of your choice (or not), clean up stray hairs on the shoulders, back, chest, abdomen, legs, or feet with a pair of tweezers."

Try to make it look soft, healthy, and touchable, and consider dying it a color that best suits your skin tone. Apply color touchups to your hair, if needed. A root touchup or quick professional or self-coloring job can help reduce or eliminate gray hairs, if you’re going for a more youthful appearance. You might also consider a few sporadic highlights to draw attention to your hair. Choose a haircut that flatters the shape of your face and is in proportion to the size of your body. Finding a great stylist and visiting often will keep your hair fresh and fashionable."

Whitening your teeth will help make your smile pop. Consider whitening toothpaste, trays, strips, or pens. You can also have your teeth bleached or laser whitened by a dentist."
