      "content": "Find several pie or cake pans in different sizes. Most diaper cakes will have about three layers, but you can do as few as one or two. If you can't find any pie pans, you can use other round, shallow containers—just make sure that the container is no more than half the diaper's height. This will make it easier to tie the diapers together later on. You can use any sized pans you want, but for a standard cake, consider getting the following three sizes: 10 inch, 8 inch, and 6 inch (25.4 centimeters, 20.32 centimeters, 15.24 centimeters)."

As you continue to fill the pan, you'll notice the diapers begin to swirl and curl within the pan. You may notice a gap or hole towards the center of the pan. Don't worry about the hole yet. If your largest pan is 10 inches (25.4 centimeters), plan on using about 20 diapers."

This does not mean that you have to use light blue for baby boys and pink for baby girls. There are other colors you can use too. Here are some ideas to get you started: Match the colors to the baby shower's theme. Use pastel primary colors, such as pink, pastel yellow, and light blue. Try warm colors for a baby girl, or cool colors for a baby boy, but in pastel hues (so pink instead of red, and mint green instead of green). Use yellow or purple if the baby's gender and the shower's theme are not yet known."

Here are some ideas to get you started: [3] X Research source Find some baby barrettes or hair clips with rosettes or flowers on them, and clip them to the ribbons around your cake. Wrap some rickrack around the ribbon bands to resemble frosting. Secure it with a drop of glue. Cut shapes out of felt (or use baby-themed iron-on patches) to resemble fondant designs."

Avoid gluing or pinning the decorations directly to the cake. Instead, consider any of the following: [4] X Research source Slip thin items, such as baby wipes, behind the ribbons. Stick pointy items, such as rattles, in between the diapers, so that they stick out like candles. Pin soft items, such as bibs and teddy bears, to the ribbons. Be careful not to pierce the diapers themselves. If the dowel was too long and sticks out of the top of the cake, consider tying some soft toys around it.
