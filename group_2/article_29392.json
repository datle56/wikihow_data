      "title": "Choose a fabric to make your microwaveable wrap from.",
      "content": "Choose a fabric to make your microwaveable wrap from. You can go to the fabric store to find a comfortable flannel, fleece, muslin, denim or cotton print; however, you can also use socks, old shirts, washcloth or towels. Whatever you choose to use, be sure that it contains no sparkly or metallic threads, wires, bead, etc, as these will catch fire when microwaved later on. [1] X Research source A large, thick sock is the easiest cloth to use, since it is already round and you do not need to sew all the sides. You can also use an old hand towel and fold it in half lengthwise, for another easy option. [2] X Research source If you choose a loose weave on your fabric, also find or buy a flannel or muslin cloth to use as your inner lining, so your filling does not leak out."

      "content": "Measure your neck with a fabric tape measure, and add 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) to account for seams. If you do not want to measure, a length of about 20 inches (51 cm) width of 5 inches (13 cm) will work for most necks. If you want to use the wrap for other parts of your body, like your back, be sure to extend the wrap a few extra inches or cm to make the wrap more versatile."

      "title": "Choose your filling.",
      "content": "Choose your filling. People use long grained white rice, flax seed, buckwheat, barley, oatmeal, feed corn, cherry pits, beans or millet seed. If you are making a rice neck wrap, make sure you do not use instant rice, which may cook when heated."

      "title": "Add an aromatherapy scent.",
      "content": "Add an aromatherapy scent. Although this is not necessary, a relaxing scent can help to relax and remove tension from your body. Choose an essential oil or spice and mix it with your filling of choice in a large bowl. Let the filling sit with the scent for a day or so and stir often to make sure the scent is distributed throughout the grain. For example, you can use approximately 5 drops of an essential oil like lavender, peppermint or rose. You can also use 5 pinches of spices like cinnamon, cloves or rosemary. You can also mix with rose or other flower petals."

      "content": "Cut the fabric to the measurements you just took, making sure to leave room for seams. If you are using a towel or a sock, this will not be necessary. If you plan to have an inner and outer fabric, cut rectangles out of both the lining and cover material, making the lining slightly smaller - about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm)."

      "content": "Fold the fabric lengthwise with the inside fabric facing out. Pin it in place across the open length and both ends so the seams stay together while you sew. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sew the length and 1 end with either a sewing machine or needle and thread. Make sure your stitches are very close together so small grains of rice do not poke out of the seams. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sew the remaining end, leaving approximately a 1 inch (2.54 cm) opening at the end of this remaining side. If you are sewing an inner and outer bag, leave 1 end all the way open on the outer bag. You will need to open the outer bag regularly while you heat the inner bag."

      "content": "Pour the aromatic grain or beans into the sack or inner sack with a funnel or a measuring cup with a spout. Experiment with the amount. Most neck wraps are 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not fill it all the way, as the less full it is, the more it will conform to your body."

      "title": "Sew up the remaining seam tightly with a needle and thread or a zipper foot on your sewing machine.",
      "content": "Sew up the remaining seam tightly with a needle and thread or a zipper foot on your sewing machine. Although this 1 inch (2.54 cm) of the seam will face out, it is important to be able to rip this seam out and replace the grain if the bag loses its scent or gets wet. If you are making an outer bag, hem the 2 sides of the outer bag in and adhere Velcro to each side so that you can open and close it easily."

      "content": "Heat your bag, or inner bag, in the microwave for 90 seconds. If you do not feel it is warm enough, heat in 30 second intervals. Place around your neck and over your shoulders until the neck wrap cools, approximately 20 minutes."

      "content": "Wash the fabric and replace the filler on your neck warmer every 3 to 6 months, depending upon the heaviness of use. If you really want to get fancy, make the pillow, and then make a cover for it that can be easily washed, yet removed during the microwaving process. Just remember to make the cover measurements slightly larger in order to accommodate the inner pillow. This makes an excellent gift. Good Luck!"

      "content": "Use a woolen baby's blanket. Alternatively, cut down a wool blanket to a smaller size; this is a useful repurposing for blankets that are nearing the end of their days. It must be one hundred percent wool, as this won't catch fire easily. Spray the wool blanket with water, so it is a little bit misty. Pop it in the microwave or dryer for a little bit to heat it up. Wrap it around your neck or anywhere that is sore."
