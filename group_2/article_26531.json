      "content": "Let go of your inhibitions incrementally. All inhibitions are based on some fear. Think of the word \"fear\" as an acronym meaning \"face everything and rise\" or \"face everything and recover.\" Look back at the fears you've identified and make plans to face those fears in a controlled environment. For example, if you're afraid to talk to people of a different gender because of a fear of rejection, you might walk up to someone in the grocery store and compliment their shoes. Everyone loves compliments, so you know they won't reject you.

Recognize that when other people criticize you, it's often based on their own insecurities— don't take it personally ! People will respect you if you stand your ground and hold true to your own values and beliefs. Think about and look at yourself the same way you look at your best friend. Everyone has flaws, but when you're thinking about someone you love, you don't focus on those flaws. Treat yourself the same way. Remind yourself that other people typically aren't thinking about you (at least, not as much as you think). They're probably also thinking about themselves and their own issues.
