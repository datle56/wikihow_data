      "content": "Clear out a convenient location. Once the den is built, it might end up as the favorite hangout spot for days or weeks afterward. The kids' bedroom or playroom is an ideal spot, but one corner of a large living room or other spare room could work. Move all valuable and breakable items out of the chosen area, to protect it from the wild den denizens. [1] X Research source Some houses have secret, kid-sized areas underneath the staircase, which are perfect for dens."

    {
      "title": "Arrange the structure.",
      "content": "Arrange the structure. You can build the den over a bunk bed, a table, the back of a couch, or several chairs. Two or three pieces of heavy furniture are ideal, since you can create space between them. Lightweight objects like lamps or plastic chairs will just fall over when the blanket is added, so leave those out of it. To make the structure friendly for adults or tall children, tie a broom to the back of the furniture. Turn chairs so they face outward, to make the den roomier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape a sheet over the structure.",
      "content": "Drape a sheet over the structure. Move the furniture apart so the sheet is almost taut, and you'll have more room and a more sturdy structure. Some fitted sheets will stay up on their own, but you'll often need to fasten them with clothespins or tape at each corner and halfway along each side. [2] X Research source Rough play almost always pulls the sheet down, but dens are so quick and easy to repair that this doesn't matter much. A stack of heavy books or a few thumbtacks are sometimes necessary, but avoid them if the den is for younger kids. They will get pulled down eventually, and you don't want anyone getting hurt. For a more permanent den, have a crafty adult mount ceiling hooks and hang the sheet from that."

      "title": "Expand the den (optional).",
      "content": "Expand the den (optional). If the den feels a little small, add extra chairs and sheets, or set up a tent for an easy extension. Overlapping the sheets can form a more sturdy ceiling, but you may need alligator clips or similar tools to keep it stable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create an entrance.",
      "content": "Create an entrance. Lift the sheet on one side so people can climb in. Drape two small blankets over that entrance instead, so people can push them aside and crawl in."

      "title": "Fill the inside.",
      "content": "Fill the inside. Add pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, and toys! To create a real palace, add a chest of games and snacks, a small television, or a miniature fridge. Then climb in and relax for thirty seconds before the first pillow fight starts. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Visit a flat, dry forest or garden. If you don't have a garden or forest nearby, ask your parents to take you on a day trip to a national park. [4] X Research source If the forest is near a motorway, shoreline, or other potential danger, make sure everyone knows how to stay safe. If you've had rain or fog, bring along a couple tarpaulins to use as a dry floor and rainproof cover. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a knobbly structure.",
      "content": "Find a knobbly structure. A living tree with a Y-shaped split near the ground is ideal for building a den, since you can use the Y branch as a ceiling. Boulders and other natural structures can also work, but avoid caves or hollows that look like they may be used by an animal. [6] X Research source Don't use a dead tree, as the branches could break and collapse your den. Bushes and thick plant growth can be home to ticks, which can cause nasty diseases. Check the local wildlife warnings from the park service to see whether bracken is safe to use in your area."

      "title": "Gather materials.",
      "content": "Gather materials. Look for fallen, unbroken branches that feel solid, but not heavy enough to cause injury if they drop on someone. If there aren't many of these around, tie smaller branches into bundles, or bring bamboo poles, broom handles, lightweight chairs, or other materials from home. [7] X Research source Never break off a living branch. Interact with the forest respectfully, without harming the environment."

      "title": "Create the den structure.",
      "content": "Create the den structure. A sturdy tree branch or leaning tree makes a strong frame for your den all by itself, but there are several other techniques you can use: [8] X Research source A sturdy branch can be wedged into a rock pile at a slant, but must be firmly in place before you continue. Three branches can be wedged against each other to form a triangle, with a little trial-and-error. Add more branches one by one to form a circular den. If you have rope or strong string, lean branches against each other in a tent shape, lay out a branch across the top, and tie them all together along its length. This may take several people. If you have a tarpaulin, tie each corner to a tree to make a ceiling. To prevent sagging in the rain, place a small rock in the center of the tarp from underneath, tie it in place, then attach a long rope and hoist the center by tossing the rope over a tall branch."

      "title": "Finish the den.",
      "content": "Finish the den. Den-building is a great open-ended activity for kids to explore on their own. Some kids may just want to lean a few sticks on to the frame to hide underneath, while others will interlace branches in new and creative shape. Rope is handy to have around in case a structure needs more support, but with experience the builders can make dens using nothing but the natural materials around them."

You can even make a garden outside the den by \"planting\" pine cones or colorful leaves, and surrounding them with a fence of twigs or stacked rocks. [9] X Research source"

As you arrange the other furniture, keep it oriented toward this focal point. This will make the den feel cozy and aesthetically pleasing. For smaller dens without space for large furniture items, arrange around a large window, a fireplace, a tapestry, or a painting."
