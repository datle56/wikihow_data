      "content": "The Apple Watch is somewhat accurate at measuring calories burned. Studies have found that no wearable fitness tracker is 100% accurate when measuring calories burned (also called energy expenditure). [1] X Research source A 2017 study by researchers at Stanford University found that the Apple Watch was one of the more accurate trackers available to consumers [2] X Research source , but that doesn't mean it's 100% accurate with no room for error. Anecdotally, some Apple Watch users have found the watch to be incredibly accurate (with almost no deviation from actual calories burned) or less accurate (with a deviation of 100 to 200 calories compared to actual calories burned).

      "content": "The accuracy of the Apple Watch varies depending on a few factors: Your physical statistics: You must enter your height, weight, age, and a number of other body stats into your Apple Watch when setting it up. If these values are off, it can make the Apple Watch less accurate at calculating calories burned. How you wear your watch: If your watch is too loose, it won't be able to accurately measure your vitals, which means the calculations your watch does to figure out calories burned won't be accurate either. Your skin color: Some studies have found that Apple Watch is less accurate at reading vital statistics on darker skin tones. This is because the Apple Watch uses an LED light to measure your vitals, which are then used to calculate calories burned, and melanin affects how the skin absorbs light. However, the studies were not conclusive, and some studies found that skin color didn't have any effect on the Apple Watch's accuracy. [4] X Research source"

Your Apple Watch takes this information along with what type of workout you're doing (specified in the Workout app) and uses algorithms to calculate your approximate calories burned.

To calibrate your watch, follow these steps: Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Go to Privacy & Security > Location Services . Ensure Location Services is toggled on. Tap on System Services . Ensure Motion Calibration & Distance is toggled on. Put on your Apple Watch, and go to a flat outdoor space that gets good reception and has clear skies. If you have an Apple Watch Series 1 , you'll need your iPhone with you for GPS capabilities. If you have the Apple Watch Series 2 or later, you just need the watch. Open the Workout app on your watch and tap Outdoor Walk or Outdoor Run . You can set a goal before starting by tapping the three-dot icon, but this is optional. Walk or run (depending on the workout you chose) at your normal pace for 20 minutes. Whenever you do a 20-minute Outdoor Walk or Outdoor Run through the Workout app, your Apple Watch will continue to calibrate to learn your stride length at various speeds. This continual calibration will make the watch's calorie calculations more accurate, according to Apple. [8] X Research source"

This is a great option if you're in the market for a fitness tracker and you're not too concerned about how accurate the calorie data is. There are tons of fitness trackers on the market, with new devices being released every year. Some of the most reputable brands, however, include Fitbit , Garmin , Samsung , and WHOOP ."

      "content": "Math You can also do the math yourself with a pencil and paper (or a calculator, of course!) if you prefer. However, note that this will also only be an estimate, as the equation used to calculate calories burned uses MET (metabolic equivalent), which is standardized and generic so that it can be used by many groups of people. First, get your body weight in kilograms. If you only have a scale that weighs in pounds, convert it to kg first. You can do this with Google, or by multiplying your weight in pounds by 0.45. Example: If you weigh 200 lbs., you weigh about 90 kg. Next, find the MET value of your exercise. To do this, go to https://pacompendium.com and choose Adult Compendium , Older Adult Compendium , or Wheelchair Compendium depending on which fits you best. Then, choose a category and find your activity in the chart. Go with the option that fits your activity best. Example: If you went for a hike that was mostly level and you weren't carrying heavy equipment with you, you'd use the MET value of \"Hiking or walking at a normal pace through fields and hillsides, no load\" for 5.3 METs. [9] X Research source Then, calculate calories burned per minute. The formula is METs x 3.5 x [body weight in kg] / 200 . [10] X Research source Example: If you weigh 90 kg and do an activity that has a MET value of 5.3, the formula would be 5.3 x 3.5 x 90 / 200 , which comes out to about 3.35 calories burned per minute. Finally, multiply the result of the MET formula by how many minutes you did the activity. This will give you a good estimate of how many calories you burned doing the activity or workout. Example: If you hiked for 1 hour (60 minutes), you would multiply 8.35 x 60 to get a total of 501 calories burned during the entire hike."
