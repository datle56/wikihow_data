      "content": "Use this mnemonic. This poem is accurate from Pokémon X/Y onwards, and will help you remember all of the matchups if you memorize it. If you get assigned to memorize a poem in school, you can even use this one! Normal attacks as normal, except against Rock and Steel types, where it is not very effective, and Ghost types, where it has no effect. Grass , Ice , Bug , and Steel will burn in Fire's blazing light. Water drowns out Fire , Rock and even solid Ground . Those who fly and those who swim , weak to Electric's sound. Flying pecks at Grass and Bug , and brings Fighting to yield, While Grass , Psychic and Dark are quite sure to be Bug's field! Grass soaks up the Water type and breaks up Ground and Rock . Fire , Ice , Flying , and Bug are weak to Rock's hard knock. Ice freezes the earth and air , and snaps shut Dragon's fangs, While Dragon takes on Dragon , with a fiery, loud bang. Fighting takes out Normal , Ice , smashes Rock , Dark and Steel . Poison comes and causes Fairy , Grass and Bugs to keel. The Ghost will spook the Psychic , sometimes even himself . Steel brings Fairy , Ice and Rock to go up on the shelf. Ground shakes up Electric , Rock , Poison , Fire and Steel . Psychic shall cause Fighting and Poison to always kneel. Dark will scare the Psychic and bring terror to Ghost's grin. Against Fighting , Dragon , and Dark , Fairy's sure to win. You've memorized weaknesses for all Pokémon types. So now you can do battle without having to gripe!"

Fighting - Like in real life, drugs or other things can bring fighters or sports players down after the full effect. Grass - Weedicide kills weeds, preventing them from invading gardens. Poison - Toxic plants and animals (by necessity) have a natural resistance to their own species' poison/venom (some can resist those from other species aswell) to avoid getting hurt by their own toxins.

Flying - Birds and other flying creatures can have a hard time flying due to buildings in their way. Grass - Scythes and clippers that can cut through the majority of the attacks. Ice & Rock - Both are usually much \"softer\" than steel Normal - The average person would likely not be able to break through a material like steel without specific tools. Psychic - Tin foil hats?

Plates perform the same role with Arceus and its Judgement move, with the added benefit of working like type-enhancers for all other Pokémon. Type-enhancers - Boosts attacks of the same type by 20% (10% prior to Gen IV). Gems - These work similarly to type-enhancers, providing a one-time 30% boost (50% in Gen V) before being consumed.
