      "content": "Know the difference between being bisexual and pansexual. Bisexual people can be attracted to people of at least two, not all, genders. Pansexual people can be attracted to any gender, or all genders. Bisexual : Bisexuality is a term used to describe people who are attracted to more than one gender, or two genders, usually men and women. Because bisexual people may not be attracted to certain genders, the terms differ. Bisexuality does not always imply attraction to men and women, but it can. Nonbinary and other gender non-conforming people have always been and continue to be included in bisexuality. [1] X Research source Bisexuals are attracted to two or more genders. Pansexual: Pansexuality is a term used to describe people who are attracted to people of all genders, including nonbinary and genderqueer identities. [2] X Research source Pansexuals are attracted to all genders, and people who fall anywhere within the continuums of gender identities and sexual orientations. Omnisexual: The terms pansexual and omnisexual are frequently used interchangeably. There are differences between the two, despite their close resemblance. Those who identify as pansexual are attracted to people regardless of their gender, whereas omnisexuals are aware of potential partners' gender and possibly have a preference while still being omnisexual. [3] X Research source Panromantic: Individuals who are romantically, but not necessarily sexually, attracted to others regardless of their gender identity or biological sex. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Other labels, such as \"bisexual\", don't feel right. If you know you are queer but certain terms don't feel like they define your sexuality, this is another sign you may be pansexual. Bisexuality, in reality, is defined as attraction to two or more genders, and as a result, it can include attraction to just as diverse a group of people as pansexuality. [6] X Research source It's possible that the term \"bisexual\" simply does not resonate with you. That might indicate that you're actually pansexual."

Does your ideal partner have a gender preference? Could you see yourself dating anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or sex? Would you date someone who is the same gender as you, the opposite gender (if you identify with a binary gender), or a nonbinary gender? Would you be interested in dating someone with a different sexual orientation than you?"

[10] X Research source Practice positive self-talk. Replace negative phrases with positive mantras that you've created yourself. Take a deep breath, smile, and tell yourself that you are \"valuable, loved, and entitled to live an authentic life that makes you happy!\" whenever you catch yourself saying \"I am not worthy\" or \"I don't deserve happiness.\""
