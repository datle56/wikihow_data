      "content": "Keep your distance. He doesn’t get to decide when and if you talk again . Of course you need to respect any boundaries or requests of his, but if he’s left it open, you choose when you’ll talk again and how, be it via phone, text, or email. This may be difficult initially, but with practice, keeping your distance will be easier. [1] X Research source Your control over the initial communications shows him that he no longer has unrestricted access to you. Go at least one month after your breakup before you speak again. For example, if you used to send him a message the day of a doctor’s appointment to remind him to go, don’t do that now. He will need to rely on his calendar, not you. Or, don’t call to tell him that your favorite movie has come on television. Instead, make some popcorn and enjoy your show."

      "content": "Embrace positive changes. After the breakup, it’s time to reinvent yourself a little. Not for your ex or anyone else, but for you. You deserve a fresh beginning. Maybe you’ve been interested in joining a club or taking up a hobby – now’s the perfect time. Or perhaps you’d like to connect with someone who you’ve lost touch with – now’s the perfect time. Whatever you choose, give yourself permission to change, to be even better than you were yesterday, and do it for you and nobody else. Your ex will see positive changes in you and notice that you’re moving on and growing without him. He will hopefully be happy for you and definitely regret that he’s not a part of it."

There is no on and off option and you won’t be sticking around for him to come back to when he chooses. [2] X Research source This is about you asserting control over yourself and your emotional health. You can tell him, “Now that we’ve broken up, we need to figure out what our relationship is and how we’ll interact with one another, if at all. There cannot be ambiguity here and I need closure.”"

More than that, by practicing positive thinking, you’ll learn to quiet all those negative, self-doubt thoughts that tend to creep up when you least expect them. Positive thinking is a habit that takes work, but is well worth the effort. [5] X Research source Start small. Think about a negative thought that you tend to have and how you could make it positive. Then, the next time you have that negative thought, push it away and replace it with the positive thought instead. For example, you might have a recurring thought that you’re just not as talented as everyone else and that you’ll never be successful. Counter that negative talk. You are merely expressing fear and anxiety, not a true fact. Instead of letting your fears and worries run rampant, correct your fearful thinking. For instance, you could say, “Everyone has a talent. I just have to discover mine.” And, “There are many ways to be successful. I have succeeded in many aspects of my life already. I will find ways to be successful every day, and I will continue to find ways to improve.\""

Consider starting a blog in which you highlight your baking skills and recipes. Or perhaps you’re great at organizing and juggling complex tasks. You’re the person that people go to at work to fix problems, especially when they seem too big to handle. You can use these skills and start your own business on the side as a personal assistant or even a life coach. Maybe you absolutely love animals and would love to spend more time with them.
