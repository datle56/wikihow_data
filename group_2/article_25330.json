      "title": "They give you backhanded compliments.",
      "content": "They give you backhanded compliments. Someone who talks about you behind your back is often angry or upset with you. These emotions can come through in how they interact with you, such as thinly veiled jabs or backhanded compliments . [1] X Research source An example of a backhanded compliment might be, “Congrats on getting in. I hear that’s great…for a state school.”"

      "title": "They avoid answering your questions.",
      "content": "They avoid answering your questions. Someone who talks about you behind your back may not want to be honest with you about their feelings. Asking the person a question or two can help you determine if they’re hiding something from you. If the person is reluctant to answer or seems as though they are lying, that may mean they have been gossiping about you when you're not around. [2] X Research source If you suspect someone is unhappy with your performance on a group project, for example, you might ask, “Are you mad about the project?” If they avoid you or say they don’t want to talk, it’s possible they’ve been talking to others about their feelings."

      "title": "They act differently around you.",
      "content": "They act differently around you. One of the first signs that someone may be speaking badly about you is a change in their behavior. They way they greet you may be awkward or forced, their laugh could be fake, or they might start to avoid you instead of being friendly. The better you know the person in question, the easier it’ll be for you to tell if something is different in the way they treat you. [3] X Research source If you pick up any of these changes in energy, it could point to disloyal behavior."

      "title": "Their body language seems closed off.",
      "content": "Their body language seems closed off. Body language can reveal a lot, including whether or not someone is really your friend. If the potential traitor in question has a hard time maintaining eye contact and constantly shifts their gaze away from you, that’s a possible indicator that they’re hiding something. [4] X Research source Closed-off body language, like having crossed arms and legs, is another sign of nervousness or defensiveness. If their feet are pointing toward the door when they’re around you, that likely means that they don’t want to be around you and are looking for the fastest way out. These body language clues don’t always mean that someone is speaking ill of you, but it does hint that they’re uncomfortable around you. Fidgeting is yet another nervous response as it may help them to self-soothe around you when they know they’ve done something wrong."

    {
      "title": "They seem to be avoiding you altogether.",
      "content": "They seem to be avoiding you altogether. Watch for signs that the person is dodging contact with you, such as avoiding eye contact, leaving a room or group when you enter, or pretending to ignore you. Also, pay attention to any electronic snubbing. Someone who usually texts or calls often and stops contact abruptly may have a bone to pick. [5] X Research source They may be avoiding you because they feel guilty about talking behind your back, or they may be trying to telegraph that they are angry. If you’re feeling bold, test the avoidance theory: if you think you see someone talking about you behind your back in a group, stroll right up and sit down. If the offending person gets up and walks away, your suspicions may be confirmed. Doing this also sends the message that you will not be intimidated."

      "title": "They hang out with people you don’t like.",
      "content": "They hang out with people you don’t like. Someone who hangs out with people who don’t like you may not like you right now either. If a former friend is cozying up to someone who they know has been mean to you, that’s a signal they may be talking behind your back. It may also be an effort to hurt you.

Kim says, “If you feel that your friend regularly disregards your boundaries, or makes you engage in activities or situations that you don’t feel comfortable in, it may be time to evaluate that friendship.” [7] X Expert Source Jin S.

      "title": "They go out of their way to hide their phone from you.",
      "content": "They go out of their way to hide their phone from you. Take note of any friend who hides their phone when you come around or gets uncomfortable if you look to see who’s texting them. People who are bad-mouthing you by talking behind your back may fear being found out. Hiding their cell phone around you may indicate that your friend has been chatting with others about you. Be mindful of the fact that many people don’t like it when others look at what they are texting others, whether they are talking bad about you or not. So don’t always assume they’re gossiping about you based on just this sign."

    {
      "title": "They get quiet when you approach their group.",
      "content": "They get quiet when you approach their group. Notice if a group of people make uncomfortable eye contact with each other and immediately get quiet when you approach. The group may also avoid your gaze. Many people who talk behind the backs of others are too cowardly to confront the person directly about their feelings. They may feel awkward when you accidentally interrupt them talking about you. Freezing is another common response someone might have when getting caught while gossiping about you."

      "title": "They overcompensate by being super friendly.",
      "content": "They overcompensate by being super friendly. If someone is being way more friendly than they normally are, they could be overcompensating for talking behind your back. This is typically in an effort to cover up all the awful things they may have said about you out of guilt or fear that you’ll find out, although that’s not always the case. [8] X Research source They may be speaking about you behind your back to express a concern, which is still not ideal as they should be expressing all concerns about you to you."

      "title": "They gossip about other people.",
      "content": "They gossip about other people. Someone who gossips to you about other people behind their backs also likely talks about you behind your back. If you have any friends like this, it may help to distance yourself from them if you don’t want them talking about you. The next time they try to talk behind someone else’s back to you, gently stop them from gossiping . You could say, “You know, I really don’t like to gossip about other people like this. I think it’s unkind. Plus, we wouldn’t want someone doing that to us, right?”"

      "content": "People begin treating you differently. People who talk about you behind your back may find it hard to hide their negative feelings. They may want important figures, such as your teachers or boss, to think negative things about you, too. If people with a lot of influence in your life are suddenly treating you differently, it may be that someone is talking about you behind your back to them.

      "title": "Approach a trusted friend and ask if they’ve heard any rumors.",
      "content": "Approach a trusted friend and ask if they’ve heard any rumors. Go to a friend you know you can trust and ask them if someone has been talking about you behind your back. Assure them that you will not implicate them if you confront the person who has been doing it. Let them know that you simply want to understand what you may have done to deserve this treatment because it’s hurting your feelings. You might say, “I think Lisa is talking about me behind my back. Have you heard any rumors? I wouldn’t ever tell her you told me, but I’m confused about why she’s mad at me.” It’s vital not to violate the trust of your friend who sheds any light on the talking behind your back. They are potentially exposing themselves to rumors and the anger of others by confiding in you."

      "content": "Ignore the problem behavior. People who engage in unsavory behavior, such as talking behind a friend’s back, usually feel insecure in some way. If someone you know is talking about you behind your back, know that it usually means more about that person’s character than it does about yours. Try to take the high road and ignore the person doing this. You don’t have to dignify their behavior with your attention. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine your behavior.",
      "content": "Examine your behavior. If you’re feeling guilty, it may be helpful to reflect on your behavior to examine what’s not sitting right with you. Whether you’ve accidentally hurt a friend or knowingly done something unkind, your actions may encourage people to talk about you if they feel wronged. Reflect on what you could have done differently, if you’ve done anything wrong at all. Remember, sometimes people talk about you behind your back even when you haven’t done anything to deserve it. Remember that your thoughts don't always reflect reality. If you feel bad about something you’ve done or don’t know a new acquaintance well, it can be easy to imagine things that aren’t actually happening. Don’t let yourself get carried away imagining someone is talking behind your back if there is no evidence to support that idea. If you’re feeling paranoid , a few deep breaths or a calming walk can help clear your head. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all.

      "content": "Confront the person and ask to be treated with respect. If you’ve done nothing to bring on the person talking about you behind your back, you may want to stop the behavior by talking directly to them . Be honest without being cruel, even if you feel the other person is out of line. Ask that they treat you with the respect you deserve in your friendship or working relationship. [12] X Research source You might say, “I think you’re talking about me behind my back, and I really don’t appreciate it. If you have a problem with me, let’s sort it out directly. We need to work together, and we both deserve respect. Let’s find a way to put this behind us.” Remember—the goal is to have a reasonable and open discussion with them.
