Chamomile, for example, has a calming, relaxing effect. [2] X Research source Echinacea is also a good, time-honored choice—some research shows it can reduce the severity and duration of a cold. Honey added to tea will soothe a sore throat and act as a cough suppressant. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"
