This process usually takes about two weeks. If your cat was taken from its mother too early, or was orphaned, you can usually start weaning around three weeks."

      "content": "Provide fresh drinking water daily. You shouldn't need to do anything to \"teach\" a cat to drink but provide plenty of fresh drinking water in an accessible location for your cat. Each day, pour out any leftover water in the cat's bowl and refill it to provide for the cat. Don't worry if you don't see your cat drinking regularly or your cat doesn't drink just because you put some water in front of it. Water can be room temperature. It doesn't need to be cold for the cat to be attracted to it. Try mixing an enticing flavor like tuna into the water.

      "content": "Make sure the bowl is easily accessible. Experiment some with different sizes and shapes of cat bowls if your cat seems hesitant to eat or drink from them. Stainless steel, ceramic, and glass bowls are all easy to clean and make for fine cat dishes. If your cat has difficulty reaching into the bowl, get a smaller bowl. Keep the cat's food and water right next to each other, and introduce them to your cat by sitting and petting the cat while you pour food and water into the bowl. The cat shouldn't have to go looking for something. The cat's food and water should be in a separate place from its litter. Just like people, cats don't like to eat and do their business in the same place."

      "content": "Clean the cat's water bowl. Your cat's water bowl can get gummed up with saliva and minerals from tap water, and it needs to be rinsed out thoroughly every couple of days. Rinse the bowl with warm soapy water and a dish sponge, then rinse it thoroughly before refilling it. No, you don't need to scour cat bowls like you might your fine china, but it's a good idea at least to rinse it out every couple of days. It only takes a minute and your cat will appreciate drinking from a clean bowl."

[4] X Expert Source Rita Reimers Cat Behaviorist Expert Interview. 22 June 2021. They work like regular water fountains, which cycle water continuously in a little pond that burbles up for the cat to drink. Some cats go crazy for these products. Typically, these range anywhere from $20-30 and are usually operated by plugging into an outlet. Most cats shouldn't need these, but it's a good way to pamper, if you want to give your cat a little extra."

[5] X Research source Feeding cats food with a higher water content is usually a good idea. If you can, try to feed your cat canned \"wet\" food a few times a week. You can even mix some water into your cat's wet food to make it a little more soupy. [6] X Expert Source Rita Reimers Cat Behaviorist Expert Interview. 22 June 2021. Wet cans of food are typically more expensive, making it difficult to feed a cat exclusively cans of Fancy Feast. Instead, try buying a few big cans and mixing a few spoonfuls into the cat's dry food every day, to make sure your pet's getting the water content it needs. You can also add some water to the cat's dry food. When you add some dry food to the cat's bowl, add some water to the dish, mixing it in to make sure the cat gets the water it needs. Giving them about two tablespoons of water should be enough. You can also mix some bone broth into your cat's dry food.

      "content": "Introduce the cat to water early. Kittens are more likely to be calm around water the earlier you introduce them to it. Within the first few months of the cat's life, it's ok to try to introduce them to water calmly and gently, going a little at a time. Introduce the cat to water when its calm and tired. The best time to bathe a cat? Right after its been playing, or has eaten. Cats tend to get really active just before eating, and just after is the perfect time to try to introduce your kitten to water, if necessary. Trim the cat's claws before you try to introduce it to water, and wear long sleeves when you're trying to play with the cat in water."

For a quick test, to see whether or not your cat will be water-friendly or easy to bathe, try to set your faucet to drip at a slow, even rate. Set your cat up on the counter and see if it seems interested in the dripping. Some cats will play with faucet water, or even drink from it. Others will ignore it completely. Both are perfectly normal cat responses. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Be gentle. Make sure to be quiet, slow and gentle and use warm water in a spray bottle. Use a calm tone of voice and hold the cat against your body with one hand firmly under its belly. Pet the cat along the back of the neck and the jaw to help it calm down some if you're trying to introduce it to water. Move extremely slowly. In some cases, it's good to wrap the cat in a soft, fluffy, warm towel while you're doing this. You can use it to dry the cat off when you're finished, and use it to calm the cat now. Never try to introduce a cat to water by submerging it in the tub. There's no reason to use that much water to clean a small cat, and you'll only serve to aggravate the animal."

Go very slowly, gently adding a small amount of water to the cat's fur at a time. Hold the cat firmly against your chest to keep them calm and restrained. If you just want to see if your cat will play in water, let your cat dictate the move. If it screeches and struggles to get away from you when you put some water on its paws, guess what? Your cat doesn't like water. If the cat makes a break for it, it's usually best to just give it up. Don't force interactions if the cat's not having it."
