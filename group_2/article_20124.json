If you don't have your driver's license, working at a bookstore thirty miles away from home might not be the best idea.

If the job requires you to work afternoons but you're in high school, you'll want to apply for other jobs. Ask your potential employer if they hire students and whether they'll be flexible with your schedule. Having a job is not worth failing school grades. Choose a job that does not exceed 15 hours a week for a balanced school schedule. [1] X Research source Most states (and countries) have limits for how many hours teens can work a week.

Start offering oboe lessons, or look for a job at music stores in your area. If you have good school grades, become a tutor or apply for jobs at your local library. Take some time with your parents or a mentor to write a list of all your talents, and brainstorm ways you could translate them into job opportunities. You could also look for jobs fixing what you love. Computer geeks, for example, might look for computer repair jobs. [3] X Research source"

You have limited space on your resume, so be sure that you only include relevant information. If relevant, include education achievements like your GPA, any awards you've won, or projects you've completed.
