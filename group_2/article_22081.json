As long as the toggle is grey and pointing left, the feature is off. By doing this, your windows won't be closed, which makes it easier for the OS to restore the previous full-screen version of Safari. If you're using an older macOS version, this is a checkbox in \"General\" instead. Make sure it's unchecked so your Safari windows will not be closed when you quit the application. Press Cmd + Q to quit Safari without closing any windows. If you go to your open windows and close them with \"Cmd + W,\" then you won't be able to restore that window by opening Safari again. Instead, press Cmd + Q to be able to re-open that window in full-screen mode whenever you open Safari."
