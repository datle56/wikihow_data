      "content": "Watch for clear, watery drainage from your nose. A CSF leak from your nose can look and feel very similar to a runny nose from a cold or allergies. See if this discharge gets worse when you bend over, tilt your head forward, strain your muscles, or get physically active.

      "content": "Pay attention to the feeling of fluid running down your throat. Sometimes, fluid from a CSF leak will run down the back of your throat instead of out your nose. Watch for a tickling sensation in the back of your throat, or a feeling similar to the post-nasal drip you might get from a cold, allergies, or a sinus infection. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cedars Sinai Hospital Website of one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Discharge in the back of your throat can make your throat sore or irritated.

      "content": "Check for a salty or metallic taste in your mouth. Much like nasal mucus, cerebrospinal fluid can taste salty. [6] X Research source Some people also describe a metallic flavor. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might notice a persistent odd taste in your mouth due to fluid drainage in the back of your throat. A metallic taste in your mouth can also have a variety of other causes, such as gum disease, a cold or sinus infection, or certain medications. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Make note of headaches that get better when you lie down. If you lose enough cerebrospinal fluid, your brain may press directly against the inside of your skull, which can cause a severe headache. See if the headache feels better when you lie down and gets worse when you sit up or stand, since these are common symptoms of a CSF leak. [9] X Research source These headaches might begin suddenly or come on gradually."

      "content": "Look for changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of smell. If you have a runny nose along with symptoms like blurred vision, double vision, or ringing in your ears, you may have a cerebrospinal fluid leak. [10] X Research source You may also lose some or all of your sense of smell. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some people experience unusual sensitivity to light or sound."

      "content": "Note any pain or other unusual symptoms. A CSF leak can cause a variety of other symptoms, and they can differ from one person to another. If you have a runny nose and a headache, watch out for other possible symptoms of a CSF leak, such as: [13] X Research source Pain in your neck, upper back (between your shoulder blades), or arms Stiffness in your neck [14] X Research source Difficulty thinking or remembering things Tremors or involuntary movements"

      "content": "Call your doctor immediately if you suspect a CSF leak. If you think you might have a CSF leak, don’t wait. Call your doctor or go to an urgent care clinic immediately. A quick diagnosis and treatment will help ensure that you have a better, faster recovery. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The possibility of having a CSF leak can be frightening, but try not to worry. Most people recover very well with proper medical treatment. In some cases, a few days of rest is enough to help the leak heal. [16] X Research source An untreated CSF leak can sometimes lead to meningitis, an infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Getting your CSF leak diagnosed and treated quickly can help prevent this dangerous infection. Despite the risk of infection, your doctor likely won't give you antibiotics unless they're sure you have a bacterial infection. Taking antibiotics before the infection occurs doesn't help prevent it."

Let your doctor know about any injuries you’ve had that might be related to your symptoms, since this will help them diagnose the problem. [17] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For example, mention if you have recently been in a car accident, bumped your head in a fall, or were injured playing a sport.

A CSF leak can sometimes develop after a medical procedure, such as an epidural, spinal tap, or surgery on your head or neck. It can also be a complication of certain medical conditions, like hydrocephalus (a buildup of excess CSF in your skull).

They may also ask you to bend forward to see if the drainage of fluid from your nose increases. [21] X Research source They might pass a long, thin tube, called an endoscope, into your nose to get a closer look.

Let them collect some of the fluid so that they can send it to a lab for analysis.

If your doctor confirms that you have a CSF leak, they may need to run other tests to find the source of the leak. These can include imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan, or special X-rays that involve injecting a contrast material into your spine to make possible leaks more visible. [25] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source In some cases, your doctor might want to do a lumbar puncture (or spinal tap) to test how much CSF you have. This sounds a bit scary, but your doctor will give you a local anesthetic to make the process more comfortable. You may feel a pinch or sting from the anesthetic injection, and then some pressure as the needle enters your spine.

While you’re receiving treatment for the leak or waiting for it to heal, talk to your doctor about trying IV hydration.

They may prescribe a stool softener so you don’t strain when you go to the bathroom. Try not to cough or sneeze, if possible. If you have to sneeze or cough, keep your mouth open. Avoid blowing your nose. Drink straight from the cup instead of using a straw. Keep your back straight as much as possible—use your knees and hips if you need to bend down."
