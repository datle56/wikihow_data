It can help to work on your shooting ability in continuous three-week rotations, spending one week working on each type of shot. You can never be too precise. Try to maintain a strong shooting average: At least 60% average from the 2-point field goal, 40% from 3-point line and 75% from free throw line. [1] X Research source"

Watching your body move when you make good baskets and when you miss can help you tweak things that are off and improve your game. If you’re in middle or high school, have a friend or parent attend a game to help you record some video footage. If you’re in college, many teams have media assistants who record games for the university. Ask your coach if you can review some game footage. It can be helpful to compile your best footage from these games into a highlight reel for potential NBA recruiters, if you are in college. Edit the video to keep lagging moments to a minimum and keep your video under 5 minutes. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Play with people who are better than you are. You become a stronger and more strategic basketball player when you are challenged by someone whose skills are superior to yours. Elevate your game by regularly scrimmaging other players who push you to be better. If you are in high school and are already the best basketball player you know, try to join a local AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) team to find people whose playing ability really pushes you to a new level. Top AAU teams are tracked by prominent college recruiters and are one of the top ways to get athletic scholarships. These regional teams attract top players from many high schools, so recruiters like to visit them to see a bigger pool of talented kids. Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant and Josh Smith, for example, all grew up playing AAU basketball. You can find an AAU club in your area at aausports.org."

      "content": "Find the right coach. If you’re in middle school or high school, your school basketball team likely has a coach already. If you’re not getting much individual attention from that coach though and feel really passionately about improving your basketball game, consider hiring a private coach. A private coach can give you personalized feedback to help you grow more quickly as a player and work on weak areas of your game. Coachup.com can connect you with a private skilled basketball tutor in your area. Working with a coach one-on-one enables you to build a more intimate mentor-mentee relationship. When interviewing potential private coaches, look for someone you have good rapport with and whose accomplishments you respect. It is a bonus if they have connections with influential recruiters."

There are lots of great basketball players, but you’ll need to distinguish yourself from the pack as a specialist in one area if you want to be in the NBA. If you are particularly fast, for example, try to bring speed to every skill you perform on the court. People will notice that this is a unique strength of yours as a player."

Getting in front of talent scouts from major universities (if you are in high school) and NBA teams (if you are in college) are key to advancing in your basketball career.

The more influential people who see you play the better. [8] X Research source If you’re in high school, many AAU leagues participate in regional tournaments your school may not. You don’t need to sign up for anything extra, but the schedule can be grueling on top of your other commitments. If playing in the NBA is really your dream, try to attend as many as you can.

Excel to the best of your ability in high school and AAU basketball, so you can play at a competitive basketball school such as Duke, Kentucky, or North Carolina. Top NBA recruiters usually only consider players from Division 1 basketball programs. [9] X Research source A private basketball coach can help step up your game if you’re not where you need to be. If you’re in high school, good grades will help round you out as a full “package” and make you more attractive as a student-athlete. Think like a recruiter: You want to be an easy sell to whomever they need to make your case to. If you need an academic tutor to bring your grades up, contact your dean’s office. They can connect you with a tutor who will meet your needs. Most high school and college coaches will have a good sense of which recruiters will be at specific games or showcases. Ask your coach if they have any information about this, if you’re hoping to connect with someone."
