How much water you end up using will vary, but about 3 to 4 cups (700 to 950 milliliters) should be enough. [2] X Research source If you used a food processor, you may notice some white stuff in the bowl. This is some of your starch. Swirl some water in the bowl to loosen the starch, then add it to the potatoes. [3] X Research source"

Cover them with more warm water, then pour them back into the cheesecloth-lined strainer or colander. Squeeze the cheesecloth to drain more water.

It can take up to 24 hours for the starch to dry, depending on how thick or thin it is. [14] X Research source If you are using a dehydrator, set it to low, about 105 to 115°F (40 to 46°C).
