      "title": "Alphabets",
      "content": "Alphabets In this game, players act out a scene where each line of dialogue has to start with the next letter of the alphabet from the previous line. For example, if the first line is “ H ello, Aunt Janice!” then the following line could be “ I haven’t seen you in months!” followed by “ J eez, I’ve been busy,” etc.​ [1] X Research source The first line of dialogue doesn’t have to begin with the letter A. Whoever initiates is free to say whatever they like. After a Z line, the next line should begin with A. The game ends when players have made it through the entire alphabet. Number of players: This game is sillier and more challenging with small groups (2-3 players), but large groups up to 26 can play so each person gets one line of dialogue."

    {
      "title": "5 things",
      "content": "5 things Here, players will list 5 items, facts, or lines of dialogue inspired by a prompt from another player. Have everyone stand in a circle facing each other. One player will choose another player in the circle and might say, “Name 5 brands of cereal that don’t exist” (or any prompt that makes a player list 5 things). The player they chose must then list 5 imaginary cereals. After each item, the whole group will yell “One,” “Two,” and so on until they reach 5 things. [2] X Research source Then, the player who listed 5 things will choose a new player to go next and make up their own original prompt. Tip: Get creative with your prompt. You could ask for facts (“Name 5 reasons I forgot my lunch today”) or even lines of dialogue (“Give me 5 things a melancholy postal worker would say”). If you’re responding, don’t overthink your 5 things and say the first things that come to mind. Surprise yourself with what you come up with! Number of players: This game works best with medium-sized groups (5-10 players) but can be adapted for groups of any size. For large groups, have 5 people name one thing instead of one player naming all 5."

      "title": "Freeze",
      "content": "Freeze This game is a fun way to explore physical comedy and justify strange behavior mid-scene. Have 2 players act out a scene while the rest of the group watches from the side. At any point, an observer can yell “Freeze!” and clap their hands, forcing the actors to freeze in whichever position they were in. The observer will tag (lightly tap) one player to swap places and assume the same position they froze in. Then, they will begin a brand new scene that explains why the new characters are in that position. [3] X Research source The game continues until everyone has gotten a chance to yell “Freeze!” or the moderator ends the game. Number of players: You’ll need a minimum of 3 players, but this game is more fun with a medium-sized group (5-10 people)."

      "title": "Four square",
      "content": "Four square This crowd favorite depicts 4 scenes happening at once. Have 4 players stand in a “square” (2 in front, 2 in back) facing the rest of the group and a fifth player off to the side as a moderator. The moderator will get a suggestion (prompt) for a scene for the players standing in front, then yell “Rotate right!” The players will move one spot to the right so that a different set of players is in front, and the moderator will get a suggestion for the new pair. This continues until all 4 sides of the “square” have a suggestion. [4] X Research source When the game begins, the players in front will begin acting out their suggestion. At any point, the moderator can yell “Rotate right!” or “Rotate left!” to shift between scenes. The players must remember where they left off and continue their scene every time they’re up front. As the game progresses, the moderator can start yelling “Rotate!” more rapidly to make the game more challenging for the players (and more fun for onlookers). Number of players: 5"

      "content": "Last line scene tag Have 6 players line up on stage (or whichever space you’re using) in pairs—2 players to the left, 2 in the center, and 2 to the right. Each pair will get a suggestion from the moderator or onlookers, then one pair will begin acting out their scene to begin the game. At any point, a player from another team can clap loudly to begin their scene. When they do, they must take the last line of dialogue from the previous scene and use it to initiate theirs. For example, if a player clapped right after someone said “I don’t like that monkey,” then their first line of dialogue in the new scene must be “I don’t like that monkey” also. Tip: It’s fun to wait for a silly line to clap on and start your scene with, but don’t force yourself to wait for the perfect line. The fun comes from taking anything and trying to justify it in a new context! Number of players: At least 4 to make 2 scenes, but having 6 players is preferable."

Have the kids stand in a straight line, then choose a moderator to pick the title of a story that doesn’t exist (like “The Tale of the Mighty Giraffe Princess”) and a genre (like a fairytale, an adventure story, etc.). To start the game, the moderator will point at one player, who has to begin telling that story. [5] X Research source At any point, the moderator (or conductor) will point to a new player. This player has to continue telling the story seamlessly, even if it means picking up right in the middle of a sentence! The game ends when the story reaches a natural conclusion or when the moderator ends the game. Number of players: You’ll need 3 at a minimum (2 players and one moderator), but a medium or large group of at least 5 storytellers works best."

One player will say the first word of the story, then the player to their left will say the second word, and so on until the story ends. [6] X Research source If you’re playing in a line, the first person will contribute a word after the last person says theirs.

Have a moderator choose a shape or item, then yell “Go!” All other players then have 10 seconds to arrange themselves into that shape or item. Tip: If you’re the moderator, start with something simple that kids can easily arrange themselves into, like a triangle. Then, up the ante and try something more complex, like a bicycle (2 kids might crouch down to become wheels while a third stands in front with their arms out like handlebars, for example). Number of players: This game is perfect for large groups (10+ players)."

Have everyone stand in a circle, including a moderator. The moderator will mime holding an imaginary ball about the size of a softball, then lock eyes with another player and say “This is a red ball.” The other player must say “Thank you, red ball” to receive it. Then, the moderator will “throw” the ball to the other player, who pretends to catch it. Players continue passing the red ball, always making eye contact and saying “This is a red ball” and “Thank you, red ball” with each pass. As the game progresses, the moderator introduces more colored balls of varying sizes (like a large purple ball or a tiny yellow marble). The same passing dialogue applies, and players must mime throwing and catching different-sized balls based on the color. The challenge is to make eye contact and focus on passing or receiving a specific ball while other players attempt to do the same around them. The game ends when the moderator “catches” all the balls they released. Number of players: You’ll need at least a medium-sized group (5-10 players), but the more, the merrier!"

The player must improvise a convincing sales pitch for the item. They might describe its features, all the activities it can be used for, and any other silly fact they can come up with to make it more appealing. [7] X Research source After a minute, all other players decide by vote if they would buy the product or not. Continue having sellers try to pitch their random items until everyone has had a turn. Number of players: This will technically work with just a handful of players, but it’s more fun with at least a medium-sized group (5-10 people)."

Have a moderator ask half of the players to form a “family portrait” of their choosing (like a family of construction workers or a family of wolves) while the other half watches. Then, the players must arrange themselves into a family portrait, using facial expressions and physical characteristics to sell their character. [8] X Research source Once the portrait is formed, the observing half of the players will try to guess each family member’s backstory or relationship to the other players based on the portrait. Then, have the groups switch and play again! Number of players: You’ll want at least about 10 players, including a moderator, so that each portrait gets 4-5 family members."

After they begin a scene based on a suggestion or prompt, a fourth player will enter the scene as a hitchhiker with a particular quirk or strong personality trait. When they enter the car, all players must adopt the hitchhiker’s quirk and continue the scene. [9] X Research source In the scene, the hitchhiker will find an excuse to leave the car (“Hey, we made it to my destination!”). Then, a new hitchhiker will join with a new quirk that players must adopt. Continue the game until all remaining players have gotten a chance to be the hitchhiker. Number of players: This works best with a medium-sized group (5-10 players) so you can have 3 permanent car riders and at least a handful of rotating hitchhikers."

      "content": "Oscar-winning moment This is a great exercise to encourage students to heighten their character’s POV and practice owning a monologue. To start, a group of 3 players will begin a scene based on a suggestion from a moderator or someone else in class. At any point, the moderator will say “Oscar-winning moment!” and the player who was just speaking will have to launch into a dramatic monologue related to what they were just talking about. For example, if they had just said “You never listen to me” when the moderator calls, they could explore their relationship to the person who doesn’t listen or expand on how it makes them feel in their monologue. Encourage the person monologuing to step downstage, face the class, and use big, dramatic, cliché movements and emotional moments to sell their performance—like they’re trying to win an Oscar. When the monologue is done, the scene continues where it left off. The game ends once all 3 players get to have their “Oscar-winning moment.” Number of players: 4 (3 actors and one moderator)"

Big Booty will initiate a basic 4-count clap, saying “Big Booty, Big Booty, Big Booty” (followed by a rest). Once the group latches onto the rhythm, the game begins: [10] X Research source Maintaining the beat, Big Booty will say “Big Booty, number 7” (or any number). Still keeping the beat, number 7 will respond “Number 7, number 2” to pass the buck to another player. This pattern goes on until a player misses their number, responds too late, or falls out of the rhythm. That player is then eliminated and leaves the circle. The remaining players must renumber themselves, making the next round more challenging for those who had to change their number as a result. Alternative: The eliminated player becomes the new Big Booty, and the game repeats with the same number of players. Number of players: This works best in large groups (10+ players)."

New players will walk up and replace the previous ones, but retain the same characters and storyline. They then must continue the scene as if there were no changes. [11] X Research source This is a fun way for students to learn how to observe a character and then mimic them. Number of players: At least 4 players to make two 2-person scenes, plus a moderator."

The idea is to create a collaborative dynamic where the actors' emotions and physicality inspire the translators, while the translators’ dubs simultaneously inspire or influence the actors’ choices. [12] X Research source After the scene ends, the players can switch roles or a new group of 4 players can take a turn. Tip: To add an extra element of fun (and a challenge), select a genre for the film like noir, action adventure, or romance. Note: You don’t have to choose a language for the foreign film. You could say it’s an Italian film, for example, inspiring the translators to play with Italian accents. However, just be cautious that all players are using accents respectfully and that the accent doesn’t become the focal point of the game. Number of players: 4"

Have a group of 2 or 3 players begin a scene based on a suggestion with a moderator or caller on the side. At any point, the moderator can call “New choice!” after a line of dialogue. The player will then have to come up with a brand new line of dialogue to replace what they just said. The moderator will continue calling “New choice!” until they’re satisfied with the new line, and then the scene continues. [13] X Research source For example: “I love what you’ve done with your home.” “New choice!” “I love what you’ve done with your hair.” “New choice!” “I love my childhood blanky so much!” Number of players: 3 to 4 (2 to 3 players and one moderator)"

Before the game starts, have all players (or audience members) write down random lines of dialogue on small slips of paper (or song lyrics, or quotes from movies, or old proverbs—there are lots of options!). Then, have 2 or 3 players begin a scene based on a suggestion. [14] X Research source As the players act out the scene, they’ll periodically pull a line of dialogue from a bucket on stage (or from the floor, or from their pockets—however you decide to distribute the slips). They’ll have to naturally include that dialogue into the scene and then justify why they just said it. Encourage players to choose slips fairly frequently. The whole point of the game is to try and include as many wacky lines as possible! Tip: Players can set themselves up for a pick-up line by prefacing it with something like “As my mother always used to say…” or “I read a really inspiring quote the other day that said…” Number of players: A small group (2 to 4 players) works best for this game. Otherwise, each player may only get a small handful of lines to pick up."

Have the host leave the room, then use audience suggestions to give each party guest a strange (and obvious) habit or quirk, profession, or other trait (you could even assign them to impersonate celebrities). When the host returns, a scene will begin where each guest interacts with the host. [15] X Research source Throughout the scene, the host will try to figure out what each guest’s quirk is. When they guess correctly, the audience or observers will cheer and the guest will find an excuse to exit the scene (“Oh, my cab is here!”). The scene ends when the host has guessed all players’ quirks. Number of players: About 4 (1 host and 3 guests). Larger groups make it more challenging for the host (and audience) to guess or keep track of quirks. Alternative: Instead of a party, the host can be a participant in a speed-dating session and the guests can all be people they meet throughout the evening."

For example, “Dating me is like a houseplant. I need attention or I’ll die!” [16] X Research source Number of players: A medium-sized group (5-10 players) works best for this one. Smaller groups put more pressure on players to come up with ideas rapidly, while bigger ones make it harder for players to get a turn speaking. Alternative: “Dating me” is a cleaner version of the original game, “Sex with me.” Save “Sex with me” for adult audiences, late shows, or activities where all players are adults and have a similar, raunchy sense of humor."

Have all players stand in a circle. One player will make eye contact with another player and make a motion to send them some “energy” (like a clap or whooshing motion) while saying “zip.” The receiving person will use the same motion to send the word “zap” to a new player, then that player will send “zop” to someone else. [17] X Research source Players continue sending zips, zaps, and zops (in that order) to each other, always making eye contact to successfully receive and send their word.

Each person must repeat all the names and movements that came before them before adding their own. Number of players: This works best with medium or large groups of at least 8-10 people.

Then, a moderator will ask one of the numbered groups to cross the circle while performing a whimsical action, like swimming, skipping, or being chased by a bear.

To start the game, that person will whisper the rumor into the ear of the person next to them. That player will then repeat what they heard to the next player while also adding a new element or fact to the rumor. [20] X Research source The rumor continues traveling and growing around the circle until it reaches the starting player, who then has to recite the entire rumor out loud for the whole group. Tip: Keep your additions to the rumor lighthearted and silly. Avoid saying anything that may come across as offensive or presumptuous (especially since you’re meeting these people for the first time).

With the 2 words that were just spoken in mind, this new pair will try to think of a word that’s related or “in between” the previous 2 words. On the count of 3, they’ll say their word at the same time, with the goal of saying the exact same word. For example, if the previous words were “sharp” and “green,” the players might guess “cactus” and “grass.” This pattern continues around the circle until 2 minds finally “meld” and come up with the same word.

Then, players must count up to 21 with one person saying one number at a time. If any players interrupt or speak over each other, the count starts over at 1. Tip: Adjust the number based on the challenge level you want or the number of players.

If the boss turns around and catches a worker miming, that worker is “fired” and must leave the scene.

[‘Yes’ means] that you accept whatever your partner or the world has given you. The ‘and’ is really important because that means that you add to that idea. I see people mess up with ‘yes, and’ when what they say or do does not add to the idea. They’re adding their own idea that they thought of before.

When a scene falls flat or lacks direction, it’s often because the improvisers aren’t totally sure where they’re supposed to be or who they’re supposed to be to each other. There’s an easy fix for this—just say it in your first couple of lines of dialogue! There’s no need to be coy in improv; you can be fairly expository at the top of the scene to get to the “good stuff” faster. For example: “Hi, Professor Jenkins!” (This immediately tells us that there’s a student-teacher relationship between the characters.) “Hello! It must be weird seeing your professor at Bally Total Fitness.” (This tells you exactly where these characters are and informs what types of objects or people they may use in the scene.) Tip: Avoid starting your scene with a question. Questions rarely add or establish a new idea, and they put the responsibility on your scene partner to come up with an answer that moves the scene along."

      "content": "Use object work to bring your surroundings to life. In traditional improv, there are no props or stage decorations to set the scene for you—that’s your job! Improvisers use “object work,” or interaction with imaginary objects, to add depth and interest to their scenes. Say your scene is in a kitchen. You could open an imaginary fridge, pour yourself invisible coffee, or chop pretend celery, all while talking to your scene partner about an unrelated topic. Klein encourages improvisers to “become a brilliant artist…interacting with invisible, imaginary objects.”"

      "content": "Remember that improv is collaborative and not a chance to show off. “When we collaborate in improv, we’re not just going along with our partner’s idea; we are sharing responsibility,” Klein explains. “Sometimes, you might not be needed. You would be contributing if you just sat back and watched.” He continues, “I think there are 3 pieces to collaborating in improvisation. One is to make offers to inspire your partner. Two is to accept offers to make your partner look good. The third is to be there with and for your partner, no matter how it goes. We may get glory or we may go down in flames, but I will not leave you hanging.”"

      "content": "Relax and have fun! Improv is about exploration, not perfection. There’s no right or wrong thing to say or do, and if you’re having fun, then your audience and scene partners will too. As long as you’re responsive to your partner, building on each other’s ideas, and not saying anything blatantly offensive or rude, then you’re perfectly set up for a successful improv scene! Don’t be afraid of making mistakes. One of the best ways to improve at improv is through trial and error, making note of the choices you made before and deciding how to handle similar scenarios in the future."
