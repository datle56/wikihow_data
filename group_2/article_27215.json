      "title": "Write the key term or concept on one side of the flash card.",
      "content": "Write the key term or concept on one side of the flash card. Write it in large letters so it’s easy for you to read. Keep this side of the card as simple as possible. The point of flashcards is to train you to see a concept or term and then be able to recall pertinent information about it in an exam setting. Make sure your writing is large, clear, and well-spaced. If your writing is small, you will not be able to read it easily. If it's crowded, you’ll have too much to take in at one time. If your teacher has given you key questions to consider, write out the question on this side. The same applies if you have a vocabulary list or other study guide from which to draw. Tip: If you’re making paper flashcards, you’ll need index cards, pens, pencils, markers, highlighters, or whatever writing implements you’d like to use."

    {
      "title": "Write definitions or concise notes on the other side of the flash card.",
      "content": "Write definitions or concise notes on the other side of the flash card. Distill the key information on this side of the flashcard: a single definition, an overview of a topic or event, or a simple explanation of a concept. [1] X Research source Don’t rewrite your teachers’s entire lecture on the history of the Supreme Court. For explanations, take the most important points your teacher emphasized and bullet-point them. Write with pencil or light pen ink so the information doesn't bleed through on the other side of the card. Draw diagrams if you need to. As long as it is essential information, a visual answer could be a helpful tool in the studying process."

    {
      "title": "Make conceptual flashcards that synthesize information.",
      "content": "Make conceptual flashcards that synthesize information. One study found that students who made conceptual flashcards instead of memorization flashcards had better performance on a short-answer test if they were less able learners. [2] X Research source To make conceptual flashcards, compare and contrast two concepts or explain multiple steps in a process. Don’t just write a definition—think about what it means in the context of all you’ve learned. For example, a recall flash card might ask you to remember the dates of WWII. A conceptual card would ask something like “What were the lasting impacts of WWII and why?” By placing information in context and even generating connections between topics or concepts, you may learn better than if you only create detailed flashcards with just facts or definitions. You gain a deeper understanding of the material by thinking deeply about it. Some topics, like vocabulary, may require detail flashcards. That’s okay! Just try to create conceptual flashcards when the material lends itself to a deeper understanding and not just memorization."

    {
      "title": "Break up complex topics into multiple flashcards.",
      "content": "Break up complex topics into multiple flashcards. Place the keyword on the first side with a qualifier in parentheses. For example, if you wanted to remember the causes of the French Revolution, but couldn’t condense it onto a single flashcard, make several cards: “French Revolution Origins (Political)”, “French Revolution Origins (Social)”, and “French Revolution Origins (Economic).” Another way to break up complex topics is with color coding using highlighters or different colored ink. For example, if you’re studying for a French verb test, you might write the conjugated forms in a different color than the definition so they stand out."

      "title": "Use shorthand to save space.",
      "content": "Use shorthand to save space. Sometimes, you might have a lot of information to put on a single flashcard. In this case, consider adopting a form of shorthand. In general, people use shorthand to highlight essential information and de-emphasize non-essential words. Turn “and” into “&” and “for example” into “e.g.”. Use acronyms for long terms on their second mention. [3] X Research source"

Cut them apart and stack them so all the key terms are facing the same way in a deck. To make studying more convenient, punch a hole through the upper-left corner of the deck. String the cards on a binder ring to keep them together. Now you can flip through them as needed without worrying about dropping them."

Study them frequently for 15 to 45 minutes a day in the weeks leading up to your exam. Research suggests that studying over multiple spaced-out sessions is more effective than cramming for promoting students’ long-term learning and memorization. [11] X Research source Keep your flashcards at hand throughout the day and reference a couple during television commercials, when you’re sitting on the bus, or while waiting in line at the grocery store. Your goal is to know the entire stack quickly and easily."

      "title": "Sort flashcards you miss repeatedly.",
      "content": "Sort flashcards you miss repeatedly. Some topics are harder to learn than others. As you go through the deck, find a way to mark cards you miss so you can study them again. For paper cards, put a sticker on them or dot the corner with a marker. For digital flashcards, see if the software lets you star missed terms or tracks them using your feedback. Keep going over the cards you miss until you get them right multiple times. Make sure you’re actually challenging yourself to come up with the answer, and not just flipping over the flashcard and reading the information. Take time to think of it, and only flip the card over when you’re sure you don’t know the answer. Numerous studies suggest testing yourself helps memory retention more than simply restudying material because you force yourself to retrieve information by self-testing. This is known as the testing effect. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Have someone else test you. Ask a peer, a friend, or a family member to help you study your flashcards. All they have to do is be able to read to you what you’ve written on the card. Have them show you the key-terms side of the card. Explain the material on the other side, making sure that you use key phrases. Let them reveal the answer once you’ve responded. If you’re very new to the information, have your study helper show you the side of the flashcard with the information. Identify the keyword or key concept it relates to. When you’ve done this once or twice, switch to studying the other way. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add to your flashcards throughout the course.",
      "content": "Add to your flashcards throughout the course. One of the biggest mistakes students make is discarding their flashcards after a quiz or exam. Information compounds over the course of the semester and from one class to the next, so it’s important to study your flashcard sets cumulatively. This is especially important for subjects like a foreign language, math, or science, where vocabulary or concepts build on one another. If you’re taking a course that has several parts, consider creating a much larger “bank” of flashcards to reference over multiple terms. If you have younger siblings or friends who will be taking the same classes in the future, offer to share your flashcard sets with them. Keep in mind the curriculum may change, however."

      "content": "What’s the most effective way to make flashcards? The best way to make flashcards depends on your goals. If you want to review the information as you make the flashcards, it may be better to write them by hand than to copy and paste your notes into software. If you’re pressed for time, it may be more effective to make digital flashcards. Prioritize key information so you don’t make unnecessary flashcards or write too much information on them."
