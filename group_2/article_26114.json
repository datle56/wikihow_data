      "content": "Ask Jesus into your life if you haven't already. If you're just learning about Christianity, you'll need to become a follower of Christ before you can live a good Christian life. To do this, pray to Jesus and ask Him to forgive you for any sins you've committed in your life. Ask him to come into your heart to help you turn away from those sins, and devote yourself to following him. [1] X Research source In John 14:6, Jesus said: \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\" This means the only way to have a relationship with God is to be a follower of Jesus. While each person's prayer is personal, it might go something like this: \"Dear Lord, I know I haven't always been perfect. Please forgive me for all the times I've sinned, like when I was impatient or told a lie. I want to become your follower so I can be more like you. Please guide me and help me to become a better person. Amen.\""

      "title": "Confess your sins",
      "content": "Confess your sins to God. Although the Bible says you must confess your sins in order to become a follower of Jesus, this isn't the end of the story. As a human, you're going to make mistakes. If you do something that you know was wrong, pray to God to forgive you, and ask Him to help you overcome that sin in the future. [2] X Research source The Bible says in 1 John 1:9 that God will be merciful: \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\""

      "content": "Strengthen your bond with God by praying constantly. Once you've asked God into your life, try to make it a habit to communicate with God about everything. In 1 Thessalonians 5:17, the Bible says to \"Pray without ceasing.\" Thank God for all of the blessings in your life, praise Him for His goodness, ask for His guidance as you make decisions, and turn to Him for comfort in times of need. [3] X Research source In Matthew 6:9-13, Jesus offered up a model prayer that you can use as an example of how to talk to God. Also known as the Lord's Prayer , it says: \"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Amen.\" For another example of how to pray, read the Psalms, which is a Biblical book full of various prayers to God."

      "content": "Read your Bible each day. Prayer is a way for you to communicate with God, but if you want to hear what He has to say, you need to make time to study Scripture. You might read the Bible from start to finish, you could pick a book to study for a while, or you can read guided devotionals for insight into what different verses might mean. [4] X Research source To have a close relationship with Jesus, you have to study his words. In John 6:63, Jesus says: \"The words I have spoken to you are my spirit and they are life.\""

      "content": "Join a group of like-minded followers for fellowship and worship. If you want to strengthen your relationship in Christ, it's a good idea to join a church where God's word is being taught. Not only will you receive relevant teachings from church leaders, but you'll find other believers you can talk to and a space where you can worship freely. [5] X Research source You may also find missions, Bible study groups, or other fun activities that will enrich your life. In Hebrews 10:24-25, the Bible says that when believers meet together, you can uplift each other: \"And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.\""

      "title": "Try to avoid the temptation to sin.",
      "content": "Try to avoid the temptation to sin . It can be really hard, but if you want to have a good life as a Christian, you'll have to do your best to avoid sins. Since sin is anything that isn't part of God's will for your life, it can feel almost impossible to avoid them all. However, even if you do commit a sin, pray for God's forgiveness and try to do better next time. [6] X Research source In Colossians 3:5-10, the Bible lists a number of earthly sins to avoid, including sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, idolatry, anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene talk, and lying. John 14:21 says following God's laws is a way to show Jesus that you love him: \"Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him.\""

      "content": "Treat others with love, charity, and forgiveness. Try to channel God's love for you into the way you treat other people. If someone does something hurtful to you, try to forgive them the way God has forgiven you for your sins. Encourage and support the people you meet as much as you can, and reach out to help when you see someone in need. [7] X Research source In James 1:19-20, the Bible advises you to be \"quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.\" In Matthew 5:3-10, Jesus gives a speech known as The Beatitudes, where he admonishes his followers to be peaceful, meek, and righteous. The Beatitudes say: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\""

      "content": "Avoid falling into the trap of materialism. While it's tempting to put a high value on your earthly possessions or your personal accomplishments, the Bible says those things are \"of the world.\" Try to let go of the idea that you need certain items in order to be happy, or that you must achieve a level of success that society has set as important. Instead, make your relationship with God the priority of your life. [8] X Research source In 1 John 2:15, the Bible says: \"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\" This means it's important to focus on God's values, rather than the things the world says are important, like lust, beauty, and material objects. The next verse continues that thought: \"For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world.\" (1 John 2:16)"

      "title": "Listen for God's calling for how you should serve others.",
      "content": "Listen for God's calling for how you should serve others. Service is an important part of living a Christian life, so look for opportunities in your life to give back to others. Your call to service might be to go into the ministry to share God’s word , you might feel called to gather school supplies for disadvantaged youth in your community, or your calling might simply be to remain a faithful, honest employee where you work. [9] X Research source Not only will helping other people please God, but it will also give you a sense that you're doing good in the world, which can be very fulfilling. Philippians 2:3-4 says you have a duty to take care of those who are in need: \"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.\" 1 Peter 4:10 encourages you to find ways to use your specific talents and gifts to help others: \"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms.\""

      "title": "Share your faith with others.",
      "content": "Share your faith with others. One of Jesus' commands to His followers was to spread His word. In Mark 16:15, he said: \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.\" To share your faith with others, look for opportunities to witness about what your relationship with Christ means to you. This might mean talking to strangers about your beliefs, or it may sometimes mean showing God’s love by your actions toward others. [10] X Research source In the book of Matthew, Jesus says that you should be proud to share your faith: \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.\" (Matthew 5:14-16)"
