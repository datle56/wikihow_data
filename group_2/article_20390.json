      "content": "Develop a trusting relationship by getting to know him better. Make him feel special by showing an interest in him as a person. Ask him about his passions and his dreams for the future, and be sure to reciprocate by opening up to him about your own passions and dreams: this will make him feel trustworthy and cement the bond between you both. [1] X Research source Tell him what your greatest fears are or share one of your most embarrassing moments. If he reciprocates, it's a sign he feels safe with you, maybe even safe enough to confess his feelings. Some people are more likely to open up over text, as it's lower pressure and it gives them more time to think out what they want to say. If your guy is too shy to open up in person (or if you are!), try drawing him out over text."

      "title": "Listen to him and avoid judgment.",
      "content": "Listen to him and avoid judgment. The fact that you could reject him may be what's holding him back from confessing his feelings. So don’t just invite him to open up to you: actively listen to what he says, maintaining a positive and calm attitude while he shares to make him feel comfortable. Let him know he’s free from judgment and that you appreciate the things that are unique about him. The goal is to develop let him know that he can speak freely to you about anything. [2] X Research source It’s hard for many guys to be emotionally available, and they often need a judgment-free environment to be comfortable opening up."

      "title": "Give him space.",
      "content": "Give him space. Many people don’t like it when they feel trapped by another person, even if they like that other person, so fawning all over him may actually push him away rather than draw him closer! Even as you develop a more trusting and emotionally open relationship with him, be sure not to smother him or pressure him to share personal things if he’s not up for it, and to give him space when he withdraws. [3] X Research source Be patient. Trying to move too quickly may frighten him and cause him to be less open around you. Be careful not to bombard him with text messages. Make sure that the text exchanges between the two of you are more equal than one-sided. In general, try not to initiate hanging out more than half of the time. If you ask him to hang out and he gives you a reason why he can't, let him be the one to ask you to spend time together next. If you give him space and he doesn't reach out to you to chat or initiate hangouts, it may be a sign he's not as into you as you'd like."

      "content": "Avoid chasing after him. If you chase after a guy you like in hopes that he will confess his feelings for you, he might want to keep running. Being chased might be more exciting for him than confessing how he feels about you. He may start to really enjoy being pursued by you instead of being the one to pursue you! Lay off a little bit and let him have the opportunity to realize that he does not want to lose you. This will help push him into telling you how he feels. [4] X Research source Don't show up to his work or house without being asked. If you cross paths at a party, don't follow him around all night. Mingle with other friends and show that you can hold your own."

      "content": "Be confident, but humble. Pretending to feel confident or boastful in order to hide your true feelings will make a man feel uneasy around you because he’ll sense that you’re pretending. If he feels uneasy, he can’t be honest with you about what he’s feeling. Be confident about who you are, but don't brag or come across as arrogant because it may push him away. [5] X Research source Lift people up rather than talking down to them, and try not to talk about how great you are. Offer compliments, listen well, and remember it’s okay to be wrong. If he hears you being judgmental about other people, he may fear that you’ll judge him too."

If you focus your attention on one of his friends, he might start to fear the idea of losing your interest to someone else and quickly let you know he’s into you. You don’t have to go too far with your flirtation, just engage his friend in a fun conversation to stir up some insecurity. Ask them questions about themselves to get a conversation going and hint you may be interested. \"What do you like to do with your free time?\" \"What do you do for work?\" or \"What type of job do you want to do in the future?\" If your guy tries to join or interrupt your conversation with his friend, it could be a sign he doesn't like you chatting one-on-one with his friend, or that he wants your attention to himself! Just be careful not to overdo it: if he thinks you actually like his friend, he'll back off. Or he may realize you're trying to make him jealous, and he won't appreciate it! [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Conceal the extent of your feelings for him. Be friendly and flirty, but avoid letting on that you’re into him: he could be refraining from telling you his feelings because he thinks he already has you. Try playing a little hard to get by not always being available to hang out or not answering your phone every time he calls. This may make him confess his feelings for you sooner. [7] X Research source Give him a chance to miss you or wonder what you’re doing. Allow him the opportunity to text or call you first. If he asks you what you’re doing over the weekend, be honest, but make your plans sound exciting and rich. You might say, \"I’m spending time with friends and catching a movie,\" or you may say, \"This weekend I’m hanging out with my family for a little bit and then I’m not sure what I’ll do after that.\""

If he's being shy about confessing his feelings, then be honest and tell him you like him. It may cause him to reveal his undying devotion to you. If you’ve already developed a close friendship and you’ve noticed that he responds to your smiles and flirts with you, feel free to ask him. Here are some ways you can ask him: Try sitting or standing next to him and say, \"I like you and I'm wondering if you maybe like me too?\" or \"I really like spending time with you, and I'm kinda hoping you like spending time with me. Do you like me?\" If he doesn't know how to reply at first, giggle and say, \"You like me, don't you?!\" He’ll surely fall victim to your charm. If he says yes, congrats! You’ve won your heart's desire. If it’s a no, at least you know, so you can stop wasting your time and move on. If he takes time to think, don't worry: he may be having a hard time putting his thoughts into coherent words.

If you find that you’re always laughing with one another and are like-minded, chances are there’s a mutual attraction. Constant laughing and smiling are the biggest indicators that there’s something between you two. Guys will also use your name as much as they can when they have a crush on you. [12] X Research source If he’s constantly fidgeting with his hands or other objects, this is a sign that he’s feeling overstimulated or nervous around you and is definitely attracted. He may scan your appearance and point out tiny details. This is called imprinting, and this type of attachment is caused by the increase of dopamine levels."
