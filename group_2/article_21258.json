      "content": "Start with seeds if you have about 6-8 weeks before the final frost date. Growing cumin from seeds is the easiest and cheapest method. You need a few weeks in advance to get them started. Plant your cumin seeds indoors so they have time to mature by the time spring arrives. Purchase cumin seeds at most nurseries, garden supply stores, or online. You can search online to find your frost date calculator, based on your zip code."

      "content": "Soak your seeds in water for 8 hours before you sow them. Place your seeds into a medium-size bowl, and pour 2–5 c (470–1,180 mL) of water into the bowl to cover the seeds. After 8 hours, pour out the water and place the seeds on a clean paper towel until you are ready to plant them. The seeds begin germinating when wet, and this helps them sprout faster once you plant them."

When the pods turn brown, the cumin is ready to harvest. Using a pair of scissors or gardening shears, trim a few plants where the flower meets the stem when you notice brown pods. Cumin seeds often ripen unevenly, so keep a watchful eye on your plants after about 4 months of growth. Repeat this every time you see about 5-6 plants with brown pods."
