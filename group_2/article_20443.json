      "title": "Finish your manuscript and prepare it for submission.",
      "content": "Finish your manuscript and prepare it for submission. Most literary agents only accept submissions if your manuscript is complete. Before you start querying agents, make sure your book is finished , edited, and proofread to the best of your ability. It often helps to have other people read it to make sure everything makes sense. Then, make sure your manuscript is properly formatted (usually in the form of a 12 pt font, double-spaced Word document) for submission. [1] X Research source Some recommend hiring a professional editor to take a look at your manuscript before you submit it. This can be pricey, however, and it may not be necessary since literary agents will help you edit your book at no extra cost to you. It may be enough to have a few beta readers (people who read the early drafts of your book) read through your manuscript before you submit it. This can help you catch any grammatical errors you missed or fix any plot holes or areas of confusion in your story. The exact formatting needed may vary from agent to agent, so carefully read all submission guidelines before submitting and make adjustments as necessary."

      "title": "Determine how to market your book.",
      "content": "Determine how to market your book. At the end of the day, publishing is a business, and literary agents and publishing houses are both looking for manuscripts that will make money. Look at recent, popular titles in your genre and see where your book fits. It’s important to know what publishing trends are popular so you can find “comp titles,” or books to compare your manuscript to. Knowing the market will help your pitch stand out when it’s time to query agents. [2] X Research source Comp titles are important because they help literary agents know if they’ll be able to market your book to fans of other popular books."

      "title": "Research literary agents in your genre online.",
      "content": "Research literary agents in your genre online. While there are thousands of literary agents out there, not all of them will represent your genre or be interested in a plot like yours. Don’t submit to every agent you come across. Instead, focus your search on agents who are interested in and have sold books like yours, including genre and age range. The best way to do this is by looking online. Check out agents’ profiles on their literary agency’s website, industry sites like Publisher’s Marketplace and Manuscript Wish List , and even by following agents on social media. [3] X Research source For example, if you’re publishing a children’s novel, you wouldn’t want to query an agent who specializes in adult thrillers or vice versa. Literary agents typically specify which genres and age ranges they represent on their profiles and websites. Publisher’s Marketplace lists the sales records of different agents so you can find one who sells books like yours. It does cost $25 a month, however. Manuscript Wish List is a website in which many literary agents post what they’re looking for in new manuscripts, as well as their favorite books, TV shows, and other media. This is a great way to see which agents have a similar taste in books as you. If you’re not sure where to start with researching agents, flip to the “Acknowledgements” section of some of your favorite books or comp titles. Most authors will thank their agent here, so you can look them up and see if they’re accepting submissions. Screenwriter Lucy V. Hay recommends following agents on social media: “Agents love Twitter, for instance. So [use social media to find out] what agents are interested in, and [target] the right ones. It sounds really, really straightforward, but you wouldn't believe how many people send the wrong stuff to the wrong people, or the right stuff to the wrong people.”"

      "title": "Narrow down a list of potential agents.",
      "content": "Narrow down a list of potential agents. Researching hundreds of agents can seem daunting, but it will make the process easier once it’s time to query. As you’re researching, make a list or spreadsheet of any agents that catch your eye. Note what genres they’re looking for, whether they’re open to submissions, which agency they work for, and any necessary links, like where to submit your manuscript. This helps ensure you send your manuscript to agents who are most likely to enjoy it, and it allows you to keep track of who you’ve queried and who you haven’t. [4] X Research source Understand that as a new writer, it’s unlikely you’ll sign with a top agent, as they typically don’t take unsolicited submissions. Instead, Hay says, “You need to find the people that are just further down the ladder in the agent world: the agent's assistants who will become agents, for example, or junior agents who are just starting out and building their [client] lists.”"

      "title": "Write and personalize your query letter.",
      "content": "Write and personalize your query letter. A query letter is a formal letter addressed to the literary agent that allows you to pitch your manuscript and entice the agent to read it. Think of it as a cover letter for your query. The query letter is likely the first thing an agent will read, so it’s important to personalize it by explaining why you think your book is a good fit for that particular agent. Be sure to follow all formatting guidelines provided by the agent, as well. [5] X Research source For a detailed guide on what to include in your query letter, skip to the “How to Write a Query Letter” section of this article. Carefully proofread each query letter you send to an agent to make sure you don’t accidentally address it to the wrong person. That would likely get you an automatic rejection!"

    {
      "title": "Prepare and send the requested submission materials.",
      "content": "Prepare and send the requested submission materials. Each agent will specify what they’re looking for in a submission. In general, though, most agents require a query letter, a short novel synopsis or nonfiction book proposal, and at least one sample chapter. Most agents require these materials to be submitted online via email or a digital form, though some may prefer hard copies. Make sure to follow each agent’s guidelines specifically to increase your chances of having your manuscript read. [6] X Research source Many literary agents will request the first chapter or 10 pages of your manuscript, though some may request the first 3 chapters. Do not send more or less than the agent requests. A synopsis is a brief summary (no more than 1-2 pages) of your story from beginning to end, and it must reveal the ending. A nonfiction book proposal is more complex and is usually 20-30 pages long. It often includes details like comp titles, target audience, a marketing plan, a book overview, a table of contents, sample chapters, and an author bio. When submitting sample chapters for fiction, always start from the beginning of the manuscript. For nonfiction, any chapter is usually acceptable, but be sure to follow the agent’s guidelines."

      "title": "Submit to multiple agents simultaneously.",
      "content": "Submit to multiple agents simultaneously. In many cases, it takes at least 3 months to hear back from a literary agent, so submitting to one at a time would be too slow. In general, try to query about 12-15 agents at once. If you don’t hear back or get rejections from all of these agents, it’s often a sign to adjust your query. Try changing up your query letter and submit to another batch of agents. If you still get the same results, it may be time to take another look at your manuscript. [7] X Research source Don’t submit to more than 15 agents at once. If you blow through your whole list at once, there will be no one left to submit to once you make any necessary changes to your query."

    {
      "title": "Wait for feedback and follow up as necessary.",
      "content": "Wait for feedback and follow up as necessary. If an agent likes your submission, they may request to read your partial or full manuscript. While this doesn’t guarantee they’ll offer you representation, it is a good sign you’re headed in the right direction and you’ll likely get personalized feedback on how to improve your manuscript. Have patience while waiting to hear back, as silence doesn’t automatically mean rejection. If you don’t hear back from an agent within the timespan it typically takes for them to reply, send a polite follow-up email. This often encourages agents to read your submission and could even land a request for your full manuscript. [8] X Research source While it typically takes at least 3 months to hear back from an agent, it may take up to 6 months or longer. Sometimes, the agent’s typical response time is listed online, which can give you a rough estimate of when you can expect to hear back. In general, it’s best to only follow up if it’s been at least 6 months since you submitted."

      "title": "Prepare for rejection.",
      "content": "Prepare for rejection. Literary agents receive thousands of submissions a year, so unfortunately, your chances of landing an agent are pretty slim. Getting a rejection doesn’t mean your book is bad—the odds are just against you and every other writer out there. When you get rejected, it’s important to stay positive and have faith in yourself and your book. Be persistent and keep submitting. It may take some time, but the right agent will come along. Remember, even the most famous writers faced many rejections before getting published. [9] X Research source Try not to take it personally when you get a rejection, and remember to be professional and courteous. The publishing industry is small, so you will inevitably cross paths with these people again. Harry Potter , which is now one of the most popular children’s series in the world, was rejected by 12 publishers before being picked up, and Stephen King’s Carrie was rejected over 30 times. Even classic children’s author Dr. Suess was rejected by 27 publishers. None of these writers gave up, and neither should you! [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t accept your first offer immediately. If a literary agent likes your submission, they may request to read your full manuscript, and if they like that, they may schedule a call to offer representation. This is great news, but don’t accept it immediately. It’s important to make sure the agent is the best fit for you and your manuscript. Ask them any questions you have and tell them you’ll give them an answer in 2 weeks. This is the industry standard, so quality agents will expect and accept this. Then, send a follow-up email to any agents you’re waiting to hear back from, telling them you’ve received an offer. This way, if other agents plan to make an offer, they know to do so immediately. [11] X Research source When an agent offers to represent you, ask to contact their other clients. This way, you know if other authors have had a good experience working with the agent. If you choose to accept the offer, congratulations! Once you sign the contract, you officially have a literary agent and are one step closer to getting your book published. If you don’t accept the offer, don’t get discouraged. Keep submitting and remember the best agent for you is still out there.

      "content": "Evaluate their sales track record. This is often a strong indication of whether the agent is good or not. Take a look at the agent’s client list and publishers they’ve recently sold to. Determine if these are the types of publishers you want to publish with and if the advances (upfront payment from the publisher) their clients received are within an acceptable range for you. If you’re not confident the agent has the ability to sell your book to an appropriate publishing house, you may want to keep looking for other agents. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider their agenting experience and credentials.",
      "content": "Consider their agenting experience and credentials. The more experience an agent has in their field, the more likely they’ll be able to sell your book. However, it’s often easier for first-time authors to get signed by new agents who are trying to build a roster of clients. This doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea to sign with a new agent, but it’s important to trust that they’ll be able to sell your book. See what, if any, previous experience they have in publishing and consider the experience and reputation of the agency they’re associated with. If the agency is reputable, it’s a good sign the agent knows what they’re doing. [13] X Research source For example, an agent might have just started agenting six months ago, but perhaps they have several years of experience as an editor for a Big 5 publishing house. This shows that they have an understanding of what publishers are looking for and will probably be able to sell your book. When asking a potential agent about their credentials, it’s also a good idea to get in contact with their other clients. Ask them how long they’ve worked with the agent, if the agent has sold any of their books, if they’re happy with their contract, etc."

      "content": "Pay attention to their communication skills and professionalism. Quality agents will address any questions or concerns you have with full transparency. They won’t give you vague or defensive answers, and they’ll always treat you with professionalism by communicating in a clear, timely manner. If an agent ignores your calls, emails, or concerns, it’s best to look somewhere else. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine their level of enthusiasm for your manuscript.",
      "content": "Determine their level of enthusiasm for your manuscript. If an agent is right for you, they’ll be excited about your book. While agents ultimately choose clients and manuscripts that they believe will make money, they’re also interested in projects that genuinely excite them. If an agent doesn’t seem genuinely interested in your manuscript and career, they may not be able to pitch and sell your book the way it deserves. [15] X Research source That being said, a good agent will still offer constructive criticism and realistic feedback for your manuscript. If it seems like they’re just flattering you, they could just be trying to get you to commit to a contract without actually caring about you or your work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Address the literary agent by name.",
      "content": "Address the literary agent by name. Open your query letter with “Dear [agent’s name].” This lets the agent know that you took the time to personalize your letter rather than sending a generic one. It may be a small detail, but addressing the agent by name creates a more personal connection than simply writing “Dear agent.” [16] X Research source Double-check to make sure you spell the agent’s name correctly."

    {
      "title": "Introduce your book and state why you chose this agent.",
      "content": "Introduce your book and state why you chose this agent. In the first paragraph of your query letter, show the agent that you picked them for a reason by personalizing your pitch to their work. This shows that you know who they are and that you’re not submitting to every agent you come across. In the same paragraph, briefly introduce your manuscript by including your title, word count, and genre. [17] X Research source For example, say “I’m submitting to you because I saw that you represent two of my favorite authors, X and Y.” Or, “We met at a writing conference last year and chatted briefly about your work with up-and-coming horror and thriller writers.” Introducing your manuscript can be as simple as saying, “I’m seeking representation for my 70,000-word contemporary romance novel, TITLE.”"

      "title": "Summarize your story in 1 or 2 paragraphs.",
      "content": "Summarize your story in 1 or 2 paragraphs. A query letter should be no longer than a page, so it’s important to hook the agent with your book’s synopsis in no more than 2 paragraphs. This section should present the most interesting elements of your story, like an original plot or concept, an intriguing conflict, or a compelling question. The agent should be able to understand who and what the book is about within just a few sentences. [18] X Research source For example, this could be a potential query for Twilight by Stephenie Meyer: “When 17-year-old Bella Swan moves to the sleepy town of Forks, Washington, she is quickly captivated by the mysterious Edward Cullen, a boy with strange golden eyes and icy skin who always seems to know when she’s in danger. Even though Edward warns her to stay away, Bella is drawn to him and quickly finds herself immersed in a world of bloodthirsty vampires.” If you’re not sure how to summarize your manuscript, start by filling in the blanks in this template and adding detail as you go: “MAIN CHARACTER, a ________, desperately wants to ______, but _______ is getting in the way. To reach their goal, they _________ but fail because of ___________.”"

      "title": "Compare your book to published titles.",
      "content": "Compare your book to published titles. At the end of your synopsis, mention your comp titles, or the books your book can be compared to. While you want your book to be unique, having comp titles shows agents that your book can be marketed and sold. Choose 2 books that have elements similar to yours (this could be plot, theme, setting, etc) and briefly compare them in one sentence. [19] X Research source For example, “With fast-paced action scenes like The Hunger Games and a lush, fantasy world like A Court of Thorns and Roses , this book is perfect for fans of YA fantasy.” Or, “For fans of Stephen King and Grady Hendrix, this is an eerie horror novel that will keep you up at night.”"

This could be other books that you’ve published, degrees you’ve obtained, or residencies you’ve attended. If you don’t yet have any credentials, that’s okay, too. Instead, mention how passionate you are about your chosen genre and how long you’ve been writing as a hobby. [20] X Research source For example, “I’ve previously self-published 3 novels in a high fantasy series and received a Bachelor’s degree in English.” Or, “I’ve been reading horror for as long as I can remember and writing since my fifth grade teacher gave us a creative writing assignment for English class.”"

Sign with your full name, and include any relevant contact information, like your phone number and email address. [21] X Research source If you have an author website, include a link to it, as well.

In general, you need an agent if you’re seeking traditional publication through a publishing house (like Penguin Random House, Harper Collins, etc.), as these publishers only take submissions from agents. This includes both fiction and nonfiction works. [27] X Research source You do not need a literary agent if you intend to self-publish your book or if you’re considering small indie publishers that accept submissions from non-agented authors. If you’re publishing poetry, flash fiction, or other niche or non-commercial art forms, you don’t need a literary agent and you’d likely have difficulty finding one.
