If your printer came with a CD, you can run the installation program to set up the printer, though most modern printers will install automatically or the software can be downloaded from the manufacturer's site. To install via a CD, simply insert the CD into your computer's CD tray, then follow the on-screen instructions. For computers without a built-in CD drive, you'll need an external CD reader to perform this step."

[1] X Research source This method uses Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) to connect your printer to your wireless network. This lets you connect without needing to know your router name or password. Connecting using this method requires a router that supports WPS. There will be a dedicated WPS button on your router. The problems in wireless printing arise because of an older router or router modem combo. If you have an older router, it may get clogged, drop some packets, or skip them. You can use an EC router or something within the last three years. If you have an old one, upgrade it. If the printer is not working, check whether it is online. There are solid blue wireless lights on most printers or a small light that says wireless is good. If it's blinking, it implies wireless was connected but is no longer connected."
