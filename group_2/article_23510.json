    {
      "title": "Work hard and complete tasks in a timely manner.",
      "content": "Work hard and complete tasks in a timely manner. Show your boss that you care about your job by putting effort into all of your tasks. Put thought into everything you do, and make sure to fix any mistakes. For example, proofread reports before submitting them. [1] X Research source Make sure to get everything done on time. Early is even better! If a project doesn't have a hard deadline, ask your boss when they would like your work to be done. If you have multiple tasks, prioritize in order of importance. For example, if you're leading a team of people on 1 project, it's probably more important to help them get organized than to work on a solo project that doesn't need your immediate attention."

    {
      "title": "Be consistent in your attendance.",
      "content": "Be consistent in your attendance. Show your boss that you are dependable by showing up on time. And remember that, to many people, on time is late. Show up early to get a head start on work and make a good impression. For example, if you're due to start work at 8, try getting there at 7:45. That gives you time to stow your lunch and get settled in for the day. [2] X Research source It's fine to leave at your scheduled time, but notice whether you're always the first to leave. If your co-workers routinely stick around to finish up important tasks, you might consider doing the same. Consistently showing up might seem obvious, but it’s also essential. Try to limit the days that you call in sick. When possible, arrange for someone to cover your work. This will show your boss that you care about the job that needs to be done. Arrange your vacation days as far in advance as possible. Your boss will appreciate the extra time to find someone to fill in for you."

      "title": "Take initiative on projects.",
      "content": "Take initiative on projects. If you want to stand out, it’s not enough to just do the work you are assigned. Be proactive and volunteer for more responsibility. You can also come up with ideas for ways to make improvements. [3] X Research source If your boss asks for someone to head up a new project, volunteer. Seeking out a leadership role is impressive. Maybe your boss is concerned about sales. Take the initiative to come up with a few ideas of how your team could help boost numbers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prove you can be trusted.",
      "content": "Prove you can be trusted. Your boss won’t be impressed if they can’t depend on you. Go out of your way to demonstrate that you can be trusted. If you say that you will do something, make sure to follow through. If you run into a problem, talk to your boss instead of just not finishing the task. [4] X Research source You can show that you're trustworthy by handling problems as they arise. For example, if someone needs help with a task, take time out from what you're doing to give them a hand. If your boss shares important or sensitive information with you, don’t repeat it. Let your boss know they can depend on you to be discreet."

    {
      "title": "Communicate effectively.",
      "content": "Communicate effectively. You likely need to work with others in order to succeed at your job. Clear communication is key to being effective. Make sure to ask questions if something is not clear. If someone asks you a question, make sure to give a clear and thorough response. [5] X Research source For example, if your boss assigns you a task and you don’t know how to do it, say, “I’m excited to get to work on this. Can we take a few minutes to go back over your expectations so that I know exactly what you’d like me to do?”"

      "title": "Keep up with advances in the field.",
      "content": "Keep up with advances in the field. Your boss will be impressed if you make an effort to stay current with trends in your profession.

      "title": "Avoid doing personal things on company time.",
      "content": "Avoid doing personal things on company time. Focus only on work related tasks when you are at work. This means that you should not make personal calls, send personal emails, or spend time on non-work related social media. Online shopping and reading your favorite blogs are out, too! [6] X Research source Of course it is okay to take breaks throughout the day, but make sure to respect your company's policies regarding personal use of the internet. In many offices, it is appropriate to take an hour for lunch. You can probably also take a short break in the morning for 10 minutes or so to grab coffee and another break in the afternoon. Check with your boss or another team member to find out what's appropriate for your workplace."

    {
      "title": "Express curiosity.",
      "content": "Express curiosity. Curiosity is a sign of intelligence. It also indicates that you are eager to learn and improve. Work on developing this trait in yourself by simply making an effort to learn as much as possible. Don’t limit yourself to just focusing on your own role. [7] X Research source Say to your boss, “I know I’m not on that team, but would it be okay if I sit in on the marketing meeting today? I’m really interested to know more about our upcoming strategy.” Keep up on new trends and innovations in your field by reading trade publications and following industry leaders."

I’d love to do an even better job next time.”"

      "title": "Look for creative solutions.",
      "content": "Look for creative solutions. Your boss will appreciate it if you show that you are able to think outside of the box. When they ask for ideas in a meeting, don’t be afraid to speak up and suggest trying something new. [9] X Research source You might say, “Let’s look into increasing our online presence. I know we’re a traditional firm, but more and more people are using social media for business purposes.” Don't take offense if your boss doesn't take all of your suggestions. Notice what sorts of ideas they respond to, and try to offer better ideas in the future."

    {
      "title": "Demonstrate gratitude when appropriate.",
      "content": "Demonstrate gratitude when appropriate. If you have a good relationship with your boss, it’s likely that they’ve done a few favors for you. Make sure to offer a sincere thank you when it feels right. For example, if they let you duck out of a meeting early to take your mom to the doctor, let them know that you appreciate the kindness. [10] X Research source You don't have to go overboard with your thanks. A simple \"I really appreciate your flexibility\" will likely be appropriate. You can send an email or stop by their office to say this in person."

      "content": "Be honest at all times. Nothing is less impressive than lying. Make sure to demonstrate that you are a truthful, trustworthy person. Be upfront with your boss (and others) and don’t ever try to manipulate the truth. [11] X Research source For example, don’t take credit for work you didn’t do. If your boss mistakenly compliments you for another team member’s work, make sure to say, “I actually didn’t have a hand in that, but I’ll let Beth know how pleased you are.”"

      "title": "Show that you can work well with others.",
      "content": "Show that you can work well with others. Work on being someone who can cooperate and compromise. Show this by being willing to work on a team. You can also help out co-workers with their tasks, and delegate responsibilities when it is appropriate. [12] X Research source Don’t whine about others to your boss. If you have a legitimate complaint which affects work, of course you should voice it in a professional manner. You might say, \"I'm having a little trouble managing Bob. He is routinely late to team meetings, and calls in sick at least once week. Do you have some thoughts on how I can get him to increase productivity?\" If you're simply annoyed that your co-worker frequently tells you stories about their dog, you probably don't need to bother your boss with that."

      "title": "Be energetic.",
      "content": "Be energetic. Showing up and slogging through the work day is not good enough. Demonstrate your enthusiasm for your job by showing some energy. Be ready to engage with others.

[14] X Research source Similarly, maintain a professional appearance. If your workplace has a dress code, make sure to follow it. Even if they don't, make sure that you look put together whenever you show up for work. Dress appropriately for your industry. Wear clothes that are clean, unwrinkled, and fit well, take care to keep your hair and fingernails neat and clean, and avoid wearing strong cologne or perfume. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Get to know your boss.",
      "content": "Get to know your boss. When you know someone on a more personal level, you can often develop a better working relationship. Try to show an interest in your boss’s life outside of work. For example, if they have to leave early for a child’s event, you could say, “What position is Clara playing on the team this year?” [16] X Research source Maintain boundaries by avoiding personal questions. For example, you don't need to say, \"Are you and your husband planning to have more children?\" But showing a basic interest is a great way to get your boss to warm up to you."
