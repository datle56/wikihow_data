      "content": "Neurologist Eric Baron explains, \"some common causes of shaky hands include excess caffeine, poor sleep, overexertion, and anxiety.\" Breathing helps you manage the anxiety and nerves that cause shakiness. Whenever you’re feeling nervous, close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Try “box breathing,” where you inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for another 4 seconds, and finally exhale through your mouth over 4 seconds. Take as many breaths as you need until you feel more relaxed. Usually within a few seconds, you won’t be as shaky. [1] X Research source Your body releases adrenaline when you get nervous and the extra energy makes your hands shake. Shakiness of the hands is also known as tremor."

      "content": "Rest your wrist on a table or on your other hand to keep it from moving. If your hand shakes while you’re holding something, hold onto your wrist with your non-dominant hand so you can support the weight better. Otherwise, try setting your wrist down against the edge of a table to keep your fingers from trembling. [2] X Research source This works well if you need to do something precise with your hands, such as painting a small detail or threading a needle."

      "content": "Maintain your dexterity by doing a few reps of this simple exercise. Make fists with both of your hands and gently squeeze them. Keep your fist clenched for 1 minute before spreading your fingers open as wide as you can. Do this up to 5 times a day with each hand. Try the tabletop fist by starting with your fingers pointing straight up. Bend your fingers at the first knuckle until they’re parallel with the floor. To make a claw fist, start with an open palm. Curl your fingers so the tips touch the top of your palm. Don’t bend your first set of knuckles where your fingers connect to your hand."

      "content": "Improve grip strength and stability with some quick squeezes every day. Place a soft ball in your palm and try squeezing it as hard as you can without causing pain. Hold the ball tightly in your grip for 3–5 seconds before relaxing your fingers again. Repeat the exercise 10–12 times for each hand at least 2 or 3 times per week. If you don’t have a stress ball, you can also use a tennis ball or grip strengthener. Ask your doctor if you can safely do the exercise if you have arthritis since it could make your symptoms worse."

Touch the tip of your index finger to the pad of your thumb and then relax. Then, one at a time, touch your middle, ring, and pinky to your thumb. When you reach your pinky, go back through your fingers again so you end on your index finger. Do 5 reps with each hand at least 3 times a day to strengthen your hands.

When you’re ready to start, bend your wrist as far to the left as you can. Hold the position for 2 seconds before relaxing. Then bend your wrist to the right as far as it is comfortable. Count to 2 before going back to the starting position. Aim to do 5 reps per hand 3 times throughout the day. [5] X Research source For a slight variation, ball your hand into a fist. Rest your hand and wrist so your pinky is against the table surface. Bend your wrist in toward you for 2 seconds before relaxing."

Instead, try half-caff coffee or replace your drinks with low-caffeine or caffeine-free alternatives so you’re less likely to have tremors during the day. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re trying to overcome shakiness from too much caffeine, drink some water to flush out your system or take a walk to burn off the energy.

If you normally have a lot of caffeine, avoid completely cutting it from your diet since it could cause withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, irritability, and drowsiness.medicine.org/Press_releases/2004/09_29_04.html</ref>"

Choose options like grilled chicken, whole-wheat bread or pastas, baked potatoes, and green vegetables. If you just need a quick bite between meals, try having some crackers, nuts, or a piece of fruit.

      "content": "Neurologist Eric Baron reminds those experiencing tremors, \"if shaky hands are affecting your ability to use your hands (such as write, eat, or drink), you can take medications to lessen the tremors.\" Some medications cause tremors while others can help get rid of them. [14] X Research source Reach out to your doctor and let them know that you’re having tremors in your hands that interfere with your daily life, especially if you can’t determine the cause. If you’re currently on prescriptions for seizures, cancer, or antidepressants, they may be causing your tremors and your doctor may recommend a new medication. If your tremors aren’t from medications, your doctor may run a few blood tests or a CT scan to determine the cause. Then, they might give you a prescription to treat your condition. Common prescriptions that help tremors include beta blockers, primidone, gabapentin, and clonazepam. While hand tremors are more common and benign when you’re elderly, seek medical attention if you’re younger and otherwise healthy."
