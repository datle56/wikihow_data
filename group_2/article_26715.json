For many people, it might be helpful to put a little distance between them and the friend they kissed, especially since this can reduce some of the tension or awkwardness. [1] X Research source Maria Avgitidis. Dating Expert. Personal interview. 20 December 2019. Taking a break might give you the strength and the perspective you need to continue the friendship, no matter what your feelings might be. Make sure to explain to your friend that you need a break. If you just stop talking to them altogether, they might think that you don't want to be friends anymore. But by telling them directly, you're setting a clear boundary .

      "content": "Talk about the kiss. The first thing to do after you kiss is talk about it openly. Discussing what happened is the first step in maintaining your friendship. Ultimately, your discussion will help you both agree on how you want to act and how you want to proceed. [3] X Research source Share your feelings about what happened. Say something like, \"I feel we really need to talk about our kiss.\" Discuss your concerns about what it means for your friendship. Or, you could try: \"I'm worried that the kiss might hurt our relationship, and I want to stay friends.\" Or, if you have feelings for them, let them know how you feel . If either of you likes the other romantically, it is best to get that out in the open. This way, there's no room for miscommunication, and one way or another, you two can move forward together."

Coming to an agreement will enable you both to know how you should act around each other. Depending on how you both feel and what you want, decide on: How you want to move forward as friends. Example: \"I just want to stay friends, and I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.\" Whether or not you'll tell other friends. Example: \"I'd rather us keep this between the two of us. That way, there won't be any confusion or gossip.\" How you’ll want to maintain a romantic relationship, if that's what you want. Example: \"It sounds like there might be something here...I think we should go on an official date.\" Whether or not you'll have physical contact in the future. Example: \"I'm not sure how I feel, but I think if we kiss again, it'd make things more confusing. I don't think I want it to happen again.\""

While your initial conversation might have solved a lot of problems and set the tone for a continued friendship, one or both of you might still be confused about your relationship. At the same time, one or both of you might still have some feelings for each other. This is why it is essential to continue communication in order to avoid confusion. [4] X Research source If your friend wants to talk to you, encourage them to do so. \"I just want you to know that if your feelings change or you want to keep talking, I'm here.

After you’ve communicated, come to an agreement, and worked out any confusion, you need to abide by the understanding you’ve both come to. This will prevent any awkward situations. Try to internalize what your friend said in your prior conversations. If you’ve both agreed to just “be friends,” then act as friends would. If you still hold feelings for your friend but they don't want to be romantically involved, don't act on your feelings (we know, this is easier said than done). Remember, you both came to an agreement to be friends, and to keep your friendship, respect that. If you're struggling with your feelings, reach out to a loved one for help, because you deserve to feel supported. Even if you don't have romantic feelings, it might still feel confusing at times after a kiss. Continue reminding yourself that you made the right choice, and vent to friends for extra support.

If you act awkwardly or treat your friend differently, it could endanger your relationship. There is no need to act nervous or avoid your friend. You two care about each other and you're putting the past behind you, so feel free to relax. If you’re nervous or feel awkward around your friend, talk to them about it. Honesty can help you both feel at ease. Whether or not you have feelings for your friend, a little awkwardness after a kiss is normal. Try taking a few deep breaths and remind yourself that the nervousness or awkwardness will fade with time."

If you two choose to stay friends (instead of exploring a romance), then your chances of maintaining the friendship will be higher if you just focus on being a great pal. Continue to talk to your friend. Share thoughts and feelings, just like you would've before the kiss. Continue to do things together. Try to enjoy your time together, like you normally would. Fun is an important foundation of friendship. Continue to view each other as friends. This one can be tough. Whether you have feelings for your friend or not, it can be confusing to kiss someone, and then return to a platonic relationship. Keep reminding yourself that you made this choice for a reason, and things will go back to normal in time."

While it's perfectly natural to feel a little bit jealous (even if you never had feelings for your friend), try to keep those feelings in check and resist jealousy as much as you can. In the end, being jealous or resentful will only undermine your friendship. And if you two have decided to stay friends, then jealousy could get in the way of that. Don’t act out or be passive-aggressive toward your friend after they’ve entered a new relationship. Remind yourself that you want your friend to be happy. If their new partner makes them happy, then remember: this is what you want for them. Treat your friend’s new love interest as a friend as well. Being mean will only endanger your relationship. If you have any concerns or issues with your friend’s new love interest, it is best to keep the thoughts to yourself or to discuss them with your friend. On the other hand, if you have no issues with your friend's new partner, that's great! In that case, go ahead and enjoy getting to know them."

This means that you can continue to do things together, as a group. Continue to do the same activities you’ve done in the past. Maybe your friend group loves movies, picnics, or concerts. Whatever it is, go enjoy it together! Don’t try to win over or steal a friend in the group. Whether or not you have feelings for this friend, the kiss might be confusing (and maybe you find yourself tempted to do unusual things!). If you're tempted to gain the favor of the group for any reason, resist that urge. And on that note, don't exclude the friend you've kissed from group activities."
