      "title": "Mix the flour and water together into a dough.",
      "content": "Mix the flour and water together into a dough. Set out a big mixing bowl and measure out 9 cups (1350 g) of whole wheat flour. Pour 3 c (710 mL) of water into the flour, which will help you form a nice, firm dough. Knead the ingredients together or mix them with a stand mixer until you have a big ball of dough on your hands. [1] X Research source This process involves “draining” this ball of dough until only the gluten is leftover. You may need to make this in batches."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submerge the dough in cold water for 4-8 hours.",
      "content": "Submerge the dough in cold water for 4-8 hours. Set your dough in the same mixing bowl, covering it all the way with cold water. Leave the dough somewhere in your kitchen so it can soak for at least 4 hours. [2] X Research source This soaking period helps the gluten form in the dough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the dough until the water is running clear.",
      "content": "Rinse the dough until the water is running clear. Set the bowl in the sink, pouring out the extra water. Turn on your tap and pour cold water over the dough, kneading it with your hands as you go. Keep pouring water over the dough until it looks clear instead of murky. At this point, you’ll notice your ball of dough getting smaller and smaller. [3] X Research source The goal of this is to rinse everything but the gluten from the bread. This usually takes around 10 minutes to do. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the dough in cold water for several minutes and drain it.",
      "content": "Soak the dough in cold water for several minutes and drain it. This gives your gluten a chance to harden after all of the rinsing, so it’ll be easier to work with. [5] X Research source Once you’ve given the new dough a good soak, pour it into a mesh sieve so you can drain out any leftover water. [6] X Research source It helps to prop the sieve over a bowl, which will catch all the leftover water. This recipe will give you about 1 lb (0.45 kg) of seitan. Generally, 12 oz (340 g) of whole wheat flour will produce 5 oz (142 g) of wheat gluten."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the dough into small pieces if you’re making seitan.",
      "content": "Cut the dough into small pieces if you’re making seitan. Grab a pair of kitchen scissors and snip the dough into small, dumpling-sized pieces. Work your way through the entire ball dough so your wheat gluten is ready to cook! [7] X Research source You can always break the dough apart with your hands, as well. Only use 1 lb (0.45 kg) of the dough for this."

    {
      "title": "Mix vital wheat gluten, yeast, liquid amino acid, and broth into a ball shape.",
      "content": "Mix vital wheat gluten, yeast, liquid amino acid, and broth into a ball shape. Pour 1 cup (128 g) of vital wheat gluten into a mixing bowl, along with 3 US tbsp (28 g) of yeast. Stir in 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of vegetable broth and 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of liquid amino acid to help create a nice dough consistency. As a finishing touch, mix in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil, along with 1½ (4.2 g) of minced garlic. [8] X Research source Nutritional, powdered yeast works well for this. The garlic helps add a little extra flavor to the dish."

      "title": "Work the dough until it has a rubbery texture.",
      "content": "Work the dough until it has a rubbery texture. Knead the dough with your hands, meshing all the ingredients together into a firm ball. Once the dough feels rubbery, you can take a break in your kneading. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the dough and let it rest.",
      "content": "Knead the dough and let it rest. Work your fingers through the dough, kneading the dough at least 2 dozen times. Then, wait up to 5 minutes for the dough to rest. Give the dough a good kneading a dozen more times, then wait 10 minutes for the dough to rest. Wetting your hands makes it easier to work with the dough. Kneading and resting the dough helps the gluten to activate and relax, which makes your seitan dough easier to work with. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Separate the dough into 3 evenly-sized chunks.",
      "content": "Separate the dough into 3 evenly-sized chunks. Set the dough on a flat, clean surface, like a cutting board or countertop. Then, split apart the dough with your hands, dividing it into 3 identical pieces. [11] X Research source You can split the dough into 6-8 pieces, if you’d like."

      "title": "Flatten each chunk of dough into a 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) thick patty.",
      "content": "Flatten each chunk of dough into a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick patty. Press down on each piece of dough with your hands, turning the dough into a patty. Eyeball the sides of each patty to make sure they’re about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick, which is ideal for cooking. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Boil vegetable broth, tamari, and water in a big pot.",
      "content": "Boil vegetable broth, tamari, and water in a big pot. Set a big pot on your stove and pour in 4 c (950 mL) of broth and 4 c (950 mL) of water, which will serve as the cooking base for your wheat gluten. [13] X Research source For some extra savory flavor, stir in 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of tamari, a Japanese soy sauce. Turn on your stovetop to high heat and wait for the mixture to boil.

      "title": "Transfer the wheat gluten dough to the boiling water while letting the pot vent.",
      "content": "Transfer the wheat gluten dough to the boiling water while letting the pot vent. Carefully move your patties or pre-cut pieces of dough into the boiling mixture. Once all of the pieces are in the boiling broth, leave the pot lid slightly off-kilter so the steam can vent. [15] X Research source Tongs are a great way to transfer the gluten pieces while protecting yourself from hot water splashing back."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the heat to low and let the patties simmer for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Adjust the heat to low and let the patties simmer for 1 hour. Cooking seitan is a bit of a slow-going process, so the broth mixture doesn’t need to be boiling constantly. Instead, flip over your gluten patties or pieces once or twice, so everything’s evenly cooked. Set a cooking timer for 1 hour, so you know when to turn off the heat. [16] X Research source Let your seitan pieces simmer for at least 45 minutes."

    {
      "title": "Wait 15 minutes for the patties to cool before eating them.",
      "content": "Wait 15 minutes for the patties to cool before eating them. Turn off the heat and remove the pot. Move the pot to a separate, cooler area so the broth mixture and wheat gluten stop booking. Give the seitan a few minutes to cool off in the broth mixture—after this, you can serve and enjoy your wheat gluten! [17] X Research source If you have any leftover seitan pieces, place them in a container submerged in leftover broth."
