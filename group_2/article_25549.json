If you're an adult, get a Td (tetanus and diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years to stay protected.

Complications from tetanus are highest among people who have not been immunized at all or in older adults with inadequate immunization in industrialized countries. You may also be at increased risk of tetanus after a natural disaster, especially if you live in a developing country.
