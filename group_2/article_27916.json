      "title": "Get to know people who share your interests.",
      "content": "Get to know people who share your interests. You do not have to have everything in common with someone to become friends, but having a few things in common will help you to find things to talk about and make spending time together more fun. It may also make it easier to bond with the person. Try to search out people who share some of your interests. Try talking to people who share your hobbies, such as other members of your kickboxing class or members of a book club you belong to. Talk to people that you meet at events, such as at a poetry slam, at a protest, or at a 5K race. Join a Meetup group on Meetup.com to find people who share your interests. There are meetups for board games, hiking, knitting, and other special interests."

      "content": "Find people who are genuinely interested. True friends will be curious about what's going on in your life. They'll ask how you're doing and care to hear the answer. They won't spend the whole time you're together talking about themselves and not paying attention to what you have to say. [3] X Expert Source Adam Dorsay, PsyD Licensed Psychologist & TEDx Speaker Expert Interview. 11 April 2019. In your daily interactions, notice people who ask about your opinions and feelings.

      "content": "Notice people who are accepting. Good friends will let you freely express yourself without judging. Pay attention to current friends and acquaintances. Notice how they treat you and other people. If you identify as gay, a good friend is someone who will be accepting of your sexuality.

[5] X Research source If you don't come from a wealthy background, a real friend will understand that friendship is about more than status, labels, and brands. They'll accept you for your style or where you live. They won't hold your background against you, pity you, or make fun of where you come from."
