They center around joy, love, accomplishments, and well wishes for the future as they navigate new and exciting challenges. However, most young kids have fairly rigid ideas about gender stereotypes that typically fade as they get older. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This means they may be more comfortable with a card or message that appeals to their gender identity. For example, some girls may relate best to brightly colored cards and birthday wishes about love and feeling empowered, while some boys may prefer cards with superheroes or sports figures on them and messages about being a leader or a strong young man. However, you know the 8-year-old best! When it comes down to it, most kids will enjoy any card or message that makes them smile and feel like they’re growing up (no matter what their gender is)."
