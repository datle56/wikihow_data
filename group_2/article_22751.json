Hold onto your key firmly and stab it forcefully at any of these vulnerable areas that you can reach on someone who is attacking you as a first defensive move. Don’t let go of your keys and don’t stop defending yourself until you get away. [4] X Research source You can combine this with other self-defense moves, such as a front kick. For example, you can stab your assailant in the eye with your key, then kick them in the groin and run away. If someone grabs you from behind, you can use your key to stab at their arms and hands to get them to let go."
