      "content": "Get a pair of scissors that works with your dominant hand. Although it may seem like all scissors are all the same, the blades on a left-handed pair of scissors are mirrored to make them more effective at cutting. Hold the scissors so the smallest hole on the handle is face up and look at the blades. If the top blade is on the right side, then they are right-handed scissors. If the top blade is on the left side, then they’re made for left-handed people. [1] X Research source If you’re teaching a child to use scissors, be sure to buy blunt-ended safety scissors so they don’t hurt themselves. If your child doesn’t have a dominant hand, allow them to try both left- and right-handed scissors. Don’t force them to use a particular kind of scissors."

      "content": "Put your thumb through the smaller hole in the handles. The handles of your scissors will usually have a small hole and a larger hole so you can get the best grip. Slide your thumb into the smallest hole from the right side if you’re right-handed or from the left side if you’re left-handed. The larger hole should be below the smaller hole and your thumb. [2] X Research source If the scissors have the same size holes, position the scissors so the top blade is on the same side as your dominant arm before putting your thumb in. If you’re teaching a child to hold scissors, tell them to give a thumbs-up so their hand is in the right position for holding the scissors. [3] X Research source Mark the handle that’s supposed to be on top with a sticker or marker to make it easier to see."

      "content": "Keep your index and middle fingers in the larger hole. Slide your index and middle fingers into the hole from the right side if you’re right-handed or the left side if you’re left-handed. Press the fingers against the top edge of the handle to keep the scissors closed. Tuck your ring finger and pinky into your palm as if you were making a fist. [4] X Research source You can put your other fingers in the larger hole if there’s room, but you don’t need to. It may be easier for your child to keep their index finger outside of the hole so they can get more support."

      "title": "Move your thumb up and down to operate the scissors.",
      "content": "Move your thumb up and down to operate the scissors. Hold the scissors perpendicular to the object that you want to cut. Lift your thumb to open the blades and put the object you’re cutting between them. Press your thumb down to close the blades and cut through the material. Open the blades again and move your scissors to the end of the cut if you need to continue. [5] X Research source Avoid bending your wrist while you’re cutting with scissors since you may not make a clean cut through the material. Always keep the blades of the scissors pointed away from you so you don’t accidentally hurt yourself. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source If you want a child to practice cuts, try giving them straws, construction paper, or play-dough to help them develop their skills. Always supervise a child while they’re using scissors so they don’t hurt themselves."

      "title": "Hold the blades so they point down when you need to carry scissors.",
      "content": "Hold the blades so they point down when you need to carry scissors. If you need to walk with scissors or carry them somewhere, close the blades completely and point them toward the ground. Wrap your fingers around the outsides of the blades so they can’t open up and cut you. Walk slowly with the scissors and keep the blade tips pointed down at all times. Never run with scissors since you may be more likely to trip. Don’t let young children walk or run with scissors since they could fall and hurt themselves."

      "content": "Use your thumb and ring finger for a traditional grip on stylist’s shears. Look for the curved hook, or tang, attached to one of the handle holes and position it so it’s pointing up. Put your thumb in the larger bottom hole and your ring finger through the smaller hole on top. Rest your index and middle finger on the curved areas of the handle, and set your pinky on the tang. When you use the scissors, only use your thumb to open and close the blades. [7] X Research source When you use the shears to cut hair, you can either hold them so the blades are parallel with the ground or perpendicular to them."

      "content": "Keep your thumb and index finger in the holes for a European grip on shears. The European grip on shears is slightly different and allows you to hold the blades vertically without wrist strain. Place your thumb through the larger hole on the bottom of the shears, and slide your index finger into the smaller hole so the blades point down. Rest your middle finger and ring finger on the curves of the handle. Hold your pinky up and away from the shears so it doesn’t get in the way. [8] X Research source This technique works well for slicing and texturizing hair."
