      "content": "Wash and prepare the fruit. Wash 1 large apple, 1 orange, and 1 lemon. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the apple into four wedges and remove the core. Peel the lemon and the orange and cut them to fit the opening of your juicer. [1] X Research source You can use your favorite variety of apple. Try to choose one that's sweet instead of tart to balance out the flavor of the radishes. For example, use fuji, gala, or jonagold."

      "content": "Wash and trim the vegetables. Wash 3 medium carrots, 6 radishes, and 2 stalks of celery with the leaves. Trim off and discard the tops from the carrots and the leaves from the radishes. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Peel the fresh spices.",
      "content": "Peel the fresh spices. Get out two fresh pieces of ginger and turmeric. Cut each piece to 1/2-inch (12 mm) and use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to peel the ginger and turmeric. [3] X Research source If you don't have fresh spices, you can whisk 1/2 tablespoon (2 g) of dried ginger and 1/2 tablespoon (2 g) of turmeric into the juice before you drink it. The flavor just might not be as intense."

      "title": "Feed all of the ingredients through the juicer.",
      "content": "Feed all of the ingredients through the juicer. Set a bowl or glass below the spout of the juicer to catch the fruity radish juice. Drop each piece of fruit, vegetable, and spice into the juicer. If your juicer has a slow speed, use it when you add the citrus. Your juicer should come with an attachment that you'll need to push down to force the rest of the produce through the machine. [4] X Research source Ensure that the glass or bowl doesn't overfill. If the produce is very hydrated, you might need to fill an extra glass."

If you used multiple containers to catch the juice, pour all of them into the pitcher and stir the juice. Place ice cubes in your serving glass and pour the juice over. If you'd like to share the drink, pour half into another serving glass. Serve the fruity radish juice immediately since it will begin to separate.
