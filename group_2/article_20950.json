      "content": "Travel to the Sonar Collections Dock at Paleto Cove. You can find it along the northern edge of Blaine County. It appears as a purchasable property on your map."

      "title": "Enter the dinghy or submersible.",
      "content": "Enter the dinghy or submersible. The submersible is located at the end of the dock. You can find the dinghy along the right side of the dock. Exiting either of these vehicles while in the water will automatically equip a scuba suit. The dinghy is significantly faster than the submersible and is preferable for long distance travel. You can unlock a scuba suit for each character’s wardrobe after completing all of the main story missions."

      "title": "Pilot your vehicle to the location where you want to scuba dive, then exit your vehicle.",
      "content": "Pilot your vehicle to the location where you want to scuba dive, then exit your vehicle. Upon exiting, you will don scuba gear, including an oxygen tank and mask that allows you to breathe indefinitely underwater. Afterward, you will either be standing on the top of the submersible or in the boat, but not behind the wheel, depending on your vehicle choice. The submersible must be at the surface of the ocean to exit."

      "title": "Jump into the water and submerge yourself.",
      "content": "Jump into the water and submerge yourself. The controls for swimming are the same with or without scuba gear, but the gear allows you to stay underwater indefinitely. Near the coast, it’s possible to swim all the way down to the ocean floor; further out, swimming beyond a certain depth is deadly due to extreme water pressure. Scuba diving is required to complete Michael’s “Murder Mystery” mission if you are playing the enhanced version of the game (for PS4, Xbox One, or PC). Michael is also required to scuba dive in the mission titled “Monkey Business.” Any character can scuba dive to find wrecked planes and boats, in which money and weapons can sometimes be found."
