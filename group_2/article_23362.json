      "title": "Find a breeder.",
      "content": "Find a breeder. If you want to adopt a cat from a breeder, make sure to find a reputable breeder.

Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Cat Fanciers’ Association, The Fanciers Breeder Referral List , and The International Cat Association . If you visit breeder websites, watch for red flags. These include immediately available kittens, multiple litters, paying online with a credit card, and your choice of any kitten. If you purchase your cat from a breeder, ask for the pedigree papers for the kitten, which will show the lineage of its parents. This documentation will prove that your cat is purebred."
