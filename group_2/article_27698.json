      "content": "Cut the end off a cotton swab stick. Get a cotton swab stick and a pair of sharp scissors. Position the scissors just above 1 end of the cotton swab stick, around where the cotton area begins. Cut the end off and discard it, but make sure to keep the rest of the cotton swab stick. This becomes a stirrer that you use to mix together the nail glue ingredients."

      "content": "Place 1 cup of PVA glue into a bowl. Get an old bowl and a kitchen measuring cup. Measure out the PVA glue into the measuring cup and pour it directly into the bowl. Make sure to scrape the sides of the measuring cup so that you use up all of the glue. You can choose either white or clear glue, as the color doesn't affect how the glue works. Selecting the right PVA glue: Opt for a high-quality, non-toxic PVA (polyvinyl acetate) glue, commonly known as white school glue. This ensures safety and effectiveness when applied to nails."

      "content": "Apply the nail glue to your whole nail if you are adding an artificial nail. Dip the wooden end where you cut off the cotton into your homemade nail glue to get a small dollop of glue on the stick. Start at your nail cuticle and gently wipe the nail glue over your nail towards the free edge. Use even strokes to apply the glue thoroughly over your whole nail. Avoid using the other end of the cotton swab stick as you may get small pieces of cotton stuck to your nail."

      "title": "Press the artificial nail into the glue for 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Press the artificial nail into the glue for 10 seconds. Position the artificial nail over your real nail and make sure it aligns properly with your nail. Press down on the nail firmly for 10 seconds to help it stick to the glue. Try not to move your hand while you're holding the artificial nail in place, as this could cause it to slip. This ensures that the artificial nail sets in the right spot."

      "title": "Paint the nail glue directly over a split to repair a split nail.",
      "content": "Paint the nail glue directly over a split to repair a split nail. If you want to hold together a split or broken nail, then you don't need to apply the nail glue to your whole nail. Simply dip the wooden end of the cotton swab stick into the nail glue mixture and then apply a thin coating over the broken part of your nail. The nail glue won't heal the broken nail, but it will help to hold it together and to prevent it from breaking further."

      "title": "Let the nail glue dry for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the nail glue dry for 10 minutes. Regardless of if you used your homemade nail glue to apply an artificial nail or to fix a broken nail, the glue won't take long to dry properly at all! Rest your hand that has the glue on it on a flat surface. Try not to move your hand while the glue is drying to prevent the artificial nail from moving out of place or to damage the repair. If you used the glue to stick on an artificial nail, press on it gently when you think the glue is dry to check that the nail has set properly."

Take a brand new, empty nail polish bottle and pour the homemade nail glue inside. Then screw the nail polish brush on tightly to secure the bottle and to ensure that the nail glue doesn't dry out. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you can clean out an old nail polish bottle by soaking it in nail polish remover and then rinsing the bottle out with water thoroughly. Let the nail polish bottle dry completely before you pour the nail glue inside. Make sure to clean the brush too!"
