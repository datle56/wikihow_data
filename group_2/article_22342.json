Place it gently on your swollen lip and apply light pressure for no more than 20 minutes. This will reduce swelling for a recent injury. After the first few hours, cold is not typically effective, except to relieve pain.

      "content": "Try a warm compress for swelling from sores or chapping. Warmth may soothe pain and encourage blood flow to the lip, which stimulates healing (especially if bruises are present). Dip a clean cloth in warm (not hot) water, then wring out the excess. Hold it to your lips for 10 minutes. Repeat once an hour, several times a day or until swelling reverses. [2] X Research source If the swelling is from an injury, use ice or a cold compress for up to the first 24 hours. Then, switch to warmth to encourage further healing."

NSAIDs are medications that decrease pain and swelling, and may be effective for swollen lips caused by injury, piercings, dryness or chapping, and mild allergic reactions. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common OTC NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), aspirin (Bayer, St. Joseph), and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Take only the recommended dosage, and consult with your healthcare provider before trying an NSAID to ensure it won’t adversely interact with any prescription medications you take. If the lip is only painful and not swollen, try acetaminophen (Tylenol)."

      "content": "Rinse the swollen lip with water throughout the day to keep it clean. While your lip is swollen and sore, it is more vulnerable to infection (especially if you have a cut, scrape, or sore that is causing the swelling). Remove dirt or food particles by running the lip under a faucet or by sponge it with water gently several times a day or whenever it gets dirty. Do not pick at it, wipe it, or scrub it harshly. [4] X Research source Additionally, rinse your mouth and lips with warm salt water after meals. Mix and dissolve 1 tsp (5.7 g) of salt in 1 cup (237 mL) of warm water, then swish the mixture around in your mouth for several seconds to dislodge food bits and clean any lip and mouth wounds. [5] X Research source If the lip swelled after an injury, especially a fall, disinfect it with an antiseptic or by gently washing it with water and antibacterial soap. If the lip is swollen due to a piercing, follow the aftercare advice from the person who did the procedure. Leave the piercing in your lip and wash your hands before handling it. Do not clean the lip with rubbing alcohol or peroxide, which can further inflame and irritate the lip."

If you want to make your own lip balm , combine 2 parts coconut oil, 2 parts olive oil, 2 parts grated beeswax, and a few drops of essential oil for scent. Avoid balms that contain camphor, menthol, or phenol. Use petroleum jelly sparingly, as it may not add much additional moisture and can block fresh air from reaching injuries or cracked skin."

[9] X Research source To speed up healing and prevent irritation, center your diet on cool, bland, low-sodium foods and beverages. Drink plenty of water to keep your lips hydrated and avoid further cracking or swelling. If chewing hard or crunchy food hurts or causes irritation, healing will take longer. Replace some of your diet with healthy smoothies and protein shakes through a straw. In general, a healthy diet with enough vitamins and proteins may aid recovery."

If you have no other symptoms of an allergic reaction and the swelling subsides after moisturizing and using ice, medical attention is likely not necessary. If you have braces or other dental fixtures and they were recently adjusted, you may experience trauma-related swelling in your gums, mouth, and lips as you adjust to the new position or tightness. If your lip came into contact with a household cleaner or other irritant, the swelling may be from a chemical reaction. Flush the lip with water to clean it and use the methods above to reduce swelling. If your lip is only swollen or is drooping on one side only, there is a chance you’ve had a minor stroke or are developing a neurological condition such as Bell’s palsy.
