This inexpensive, albeit temporary, method for achieving a larger look is quite easy to do with a little practice: [12] X Research source Get fully dressed with the bra and top you want to wear. Since this solution involves a trick of the eye, your cleavage and chest area should be visible—wear something low-cut. If you're concerned about getting makeup on your shirt, you can protect it with some toilet paper or tape. That said, you probably don't want to use this method while wearing white. Create a cleavage shadow with dark bronzer by applying it between your breasts. Load the brush and sweep it upward from the center of your chest and up and out, creating a v-shape between your breasts. Apply a lighter-colored face powder to the top half of your breasts. Use a makeup sponge to blend the edges with the bronzer for an even finish."
