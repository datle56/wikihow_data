Avoid these scams by: Not clicking on suspicious links or downloading any attachments from unknown sources. Verifying the sender's identity. (If you know the sender but don't recognize the link, make sure their account hasn't been hacked and that your friend or family member meant to send the link.) Looking for inconsistencies in the message; most scammers use poor grammar and spelling or unusually urgent language."

But once this user has the money, they might vanish, or stick around, depending if the scammer believes they can get more money out of the victim. Avoid these scams by: Being cautious when interacting with others online. Not sending money to people you haven't met. Being wary of profiles that have limited information or too-perfect profile pictures."
