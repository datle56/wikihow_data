      "content": "Measure the dimensions of your windows to size your fabric. Use a measuring tape to find how wide and how tall your window or doorway is. This helps you find out how much fabric to purchase. Jot your measurements down, then add 7 in (18 cm) to the height to give you enough fabric to hem, and double the width to give your curtains some fullness. [1] X Research source If you’re making full-length curtains, subtract about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the final height, so that they don’t quite touch the floor. If you’re making window curtains, add about 3 in (7.6 cm) to the final height, so that the curtain extends past the bottom of the window. This is a matter of preference, though, so alter this number as you see fit."

      "content": "Choose a fabric that complements your space. Sheer fabrics are great for letting in light and fostering a casual vibe. [2] X Research source But even sheer fabrics come in a variety of styles. Go with a plain fabric for an understated look, or an embroidered or patterned fabric to add more visual interest. A thinner fabric may be a touch trickier to sew, but will let in more light. A thicker sheer fabric will be easier to handle and provide more privacy."

      "title": "Cut your curtain fabric according to your measurements.",
      "content": "Cut your curtain fabric according to your measurements. Lay your fabric down on a flat surface. Using a measuring tape, measure out your final dimensions (height and width), and use a pencil to lightly mark them on the fabric. Make a small mark to denote the width, and another to denote the height. Then, use scissors to cut the fabric to size. [3] X Research source For 2 separate curtain panels, first cut out a panel that’s the full width of your measurements. Then, cut that panel in half along its width so that you have 2 identical panels. Many sheer fabrics are delicate enough to rip along the threading, rather than cutting. Start your cut with your scissors, then gently but firmly pull either sides of the cut apart to rip the fabric in a straight line."

      "title": "Lay the fabric face-down and pin the side hems.",
      "content": "Lay the fabric face-down and pin the side hems. Lay your fabric so that the “good” side is facing down on the table. Then, fold the two opposite edges of the fabric that make up the curtain’s height inward by 0.5 in (1.3 cm), then fold them another 0.5 in (1.3 cm) inward and pin them in place every 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) with sewing pins so that they stay . These will be the side edges of your curtains. [4] X Research source If you’re making 2 curtains, repeat this step on both panels. Optionally, use an iron on low heat to press the fabric flat after you’ve pinned it in place, which helps to make the final product neater."

      "title": "Sew the edges down with a sewing machine.",
      "content": "Sew the edges down with a sewing machine. Use a sewing machine to sew along the folded and pinned fabric, creating a hem . Keep the line as straight as possible in the center of the fold. Use a thin, 80wt thread that’s the same color as the fabric to sew. Sheer fabric requires thin, lightweight thread in order not to rip or tear. [5] X Research source Also, use a thin, “microtextile” needle, which has a fine, sharp point that’s delicate on sheer fabrics. [6] X Research source Use a loose tension on your sewing machine when handling sheer fabrics, which will help you avoid ripping the delicate material. [7] X Expert Source Donna Serino Dry Cleaning & Alterations Specialist Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. Remove the pins once the length of the sides are sewn. Or, hand-stitch the hem with a running stitch. This isn’t recommended, however, since you’re working with a lot of sheer fabric, and hand-stitching in this case would be a bit tedious and time-consuming."

      "title": "Fold, pin, and hem the bottom and top of the curtain panel.",
      "content": "Fold, pin, and hem the bottom and top of the curtain panel. As you did with the side edges, fold the top and bottom edges it inward 1 in (2.5 cm), then again by 3 in (7.6 cm). Pin the edges in place, iron it flat, then use your sewing machine to sew along the inner folded edge, about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the inner edge. Sheer fabric can be a bit tricky to keep in place, so if you like, pin a sheet of tissue paper behind the fabric to make it sturdier as you feed it through the sewing machine, then simple tear the tissue paper away after. When you’re done sewing, these hems will form a sort of tube through which you can thread a curtain rod."

      "content": "Thread a curtain rod through the top hem and hang the curtains. Slip a curtain rod through the fabric tube made by the top hem, than place the curtain rod across your window or entryway. [8] X Research source Place the rod so that the curtains sit just 0.5 in (1.3 cm) above the floor, so that the bottom hem doesn’t get dirty. For a layered curtain that gives you a bit more privacy and blocks a bit more light, sew another curtain panel and hang both curtains using a double curtain rod ."
