      "content": "Energize your key endocrine glands. This will promote balanced hormone secretion and appropriate appetite. Your endocrine glands are responsible for your response to stress, so applying pressure to the reflex points for your thyroid (at the base of your big toe), pituitary gland (in the center of the bottom of your big toe) and your adrenals (between your waistline and your diaphragm line) will help balance your emotional and physiological stress. The less stress you have, the better chance you have to stay on your diet . [12] X Research source While many weight loss functions of reflexology are not supported by clinical research, reflexology has an excellent track record at reducing stress.
