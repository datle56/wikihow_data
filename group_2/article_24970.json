      "title": "Measure your dog's neck carefully.",
      "content": "Measure your dog's neck carefully. Wrap a cloth tape measure snugly around your dog's neck to measure the thickness. If you don't have a tape measure, you can use a shoelace or string, then measure the string against a ruler. For brace-type collars, you'll also need to measure the length of your dog's neck from its chin to its shoulders. [2] X Research source Cones and collars typically require a relatively close fit to keep your dog from working its way out of it. Different types have their own sizing and may have their own measuring instructions in terms of what part of your dog's neck you should measure. Keep your dog's collar in mind when measuring for the cone or collar. Some collar styles don't work with a collar that needs to slip on over your dog's head, rather than being buckled around its neck."

      "title": "Fit your dog with a cone.",
      "content": "Fit your dog with a cone. The plastic cone, also called an \"Elizabethan\" collar, is the traditional method for keeping a dog from licking a wound. [3] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. This is typically the initial protection your veterinarian will provide. Transparent cones tend to be less scary for the dog than the opaque ones because the dog can see through it. [4] X Research source Pay close attention to your dog while it is wearing an Elizabethan collar. These collars allow no peripheral vision, so your dog may be clumsier than it normally is. Your dog will be able to eat and drink just fine with the collar on, but it will take some adjustment and the dog may not like it. Monitor your dog to make sure it's eating and drinking. If it refuses to eat or drink while wearing the cone, try a different type of collar or take the cone off to allow the dog to eat. If you are away from home for an extended period of time, such as for work or school, it's a good idea to crate a dog wearing an Elizabethan collar so that it doesn't injure itself."

      "title": "Try a soft or inflatable collar if the cone doesn't work.",
      "content": "Try a soft or inflatable collar if the cone doesn't work. The hard plastic cone may limit your dog's movement too much or make sleeping difficult. There are also some dogs that simply reject the hard plastic collar and try to destroy it. Soft or inflatable collars may work better for these dogs. [5] X Research source Many alternative collars won't work on dogs with long noses and thin necks, such as greyhounds or Dobermans. Some inflatable collars can be easily punctured, so this variety may not work if your dog repeatedly tries to claw the collar off."

      "title": "Have your dog try on several different options.",
      "content": "Have your dog try on several different options. There are many types of collars and cones available at pet stores or online. It's hard to know which one your dog will tolerate the best until you've tried them. The one you think your dog will reject may be the one it finds the most comfortable. [6] X Research source If you shop for a cone at a pet store, you can likely take your dog with you and try them on in the store. Otherwise, buy several different types to try and return the ones you end up not using. Keep in mind that the size of the cone that your dog will need to wear will depend on the type and location of your dog’s injury. For example, if your dog has had eye surgery, then it will only need a small cone to prevent it from rubbing its eye. However, if your dog has a tail tip injury, then a larger cone will be necessary to prevent your dog from getting at its tail."

      "title": "Use a brace if your dog removes other collars.",
      "content": "Use a brace if your dog removes other collars. Some dogs are determined to remove the infernal cones from their necks and will stop at nothing to destroy them. If your dog is like this, you can try a neck brace similar to the type of brace humans would wear after suffering a neck injury such as whiplash. [7] X Research source The size of the brace is determined by the length of the dog's neck, not the width. If your dog has an extremely long neck, like a greyhound, or an extremely short neck, like a pug, the brace may not be very effective. If your dog's wound is on its front feet, a brace of this sort likely would not prevent your dog from licking its wounds."

      "title": "Clean the wound carefully before bandaging it.",
      "content": "Clean the wound carefully before bandaging it. Use warm tap water or a saline solution to carefully clean the wound. You can mix your own saline solution by adding 1 teaspoon (5 mLs) of salt to 2 cups (500 mLs) of water. [8] X Research source Your veterinarian may recommend using a particular type of soap or cleaning solution to clean the wound. Only use soaps or solutions recommended by your veterinarian. Do not use any soaps, disinfectants, or other cleansers designed for humans. They may irritate your dog's skin and delay the healing process. After cleaning the wound, gently pat it dry before applying any medicated lotions or bandages."

      "title": "Apply lotions or ointments only if prescribed by your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Apply lotions or ointments only if prescribed by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian may prescribe a medicated lotion or ointment to apply to your dog's wound. Apply immediately after cleaning the wound, then allow it to dry before you cover with a bandage. [9] X Research source If your dog frequently licks the medication off, try applying it immediately before you feed your dog. The food will divert your dog's attention, and by the time it's done eating, it will likely have forgotten about the medication."

      "content": "Choose a bandage designed for the wounded body part. Bandages for dogs vary in shape and size depending on the size of the wound and the location of the wound on the dog's body. The bandage should be large enough to completely cover the wound and allow you to secure it in place. [10] X Research source For wounds on a dog's legs or feet, there are special bandages you can use that look like a sleeve or a boot. These ensure that the wound is kept clean while healing. Use surgical tape to adhere the bandage to your dog's body. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray the bandage with a \"no-lick\" spray. These sprays are available at pet supply stores and online, and are designed to keep your dog from trying to lick the wound or chew at the bandages covering the wound. Typically they have a disgusting taste that repels the dog from licking. [12] X Research source These sprays don't work with all dogs. Some dogs simply lick them off, regardless of the disgusting taste, and then go after the wound or bandaging. [13] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021."

[14] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. There are sleeves available at pet supply stores for this purpose. You can also make one yourself by repurposing old clothing. [15] X Research source For example, a piece nylon stocking with the toes cut off would work to cover a leg injury, or even a torso injury on a smaller dog. You can also use t-shirts, boxer shorts, sweaters, or baby clothes to cover the area."

If the wound continues to bleed or is leaking a colored or foul-smelling pus, take your pet back to the veterinarian – the wound may be infected. [16] X Research source Your veterinarian may give you different instructions for cleaning the dog's wound and changing bandages. If you need to deviate from those instructions, ask your veterinarian first if it would be okay. Search online to find different types of surgical clothing to protect your dog’s wound, such as sleeves and shirts."

      "content": "Take your dog for a walk after first putting on the collar. A calm walk on a leash will help your dog focus and re-establish the relationship between you and your pet. Walks are especially helpful if your dog is wearing a cone or collar, as they give your dog a safe opportunity to adjust. [17] X Research source Most dogs will acclimate to the cone within an hour if they know they are safe. Keep your dog on a short leash, and speak to it in a calm, soothing voice. While your dog is wearing a cone or collar, always keep it on a leash when going for walks."

      "content": "Wait 7 to 14 days before you try other distraction techniques. Restrict your dog's activity until the wound has partially healed – particularly if your dog has a surgical incision. You don't want to risk reopening the wound through activity, or getting the wound infected. [18] X Research source Ask your veterinarian how long you need to wait before you can allow your dog to run or play off-leash. Depending on the severity of the wound and its location, your veterinarian may want you to wait longer."

      "content": "Hide dry food for your dog to find in addition to a bowl. If you give your dog a bowl of food, it will likely scarf it down immediately. Hiding biscuits and dry food for your dog to find gives your dog a challenge and will distract it from its wounds. [19] X Research source This distraction technique works particularly well if you have a hound or similar dog that hunts instinctively. Remember where you hid the treats so you can retrieve them and dispose of them properly if your dog doesn't find them within a day or so."

      "content": "Train your dog to perform new tricks . If your dog enjoys learning new tasks and tricks, this can be a great way to distract your dog from its wound so it won't be tempted to lick. Choose a trick that will be a challenge, but that you know your dog can master. [20] X Research source Avoid tricks that require too much activity, especially if the wound is still healing. For example, you might be able to train your dog to sit up or beg, but teaching it to catch a frisbee in mid-air would likely be too much."

While your dog is chasing after the ice cube treat, it will likely forget all about wanting to lick its wound. [21] X Research source This treat is better given outside, as it can get messy. The ice cubes will eventually melt, and you'll end up with a puddle of gravy to clean up."
