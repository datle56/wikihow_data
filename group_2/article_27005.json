      "title": "Cut out a piece of fabric.",
      "content": "Cut out a piece of fabric. Choose a fabric that will not fray, such as felt. The fabric should be wide enough to fit around the doll and overlap by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). The fabric piece can be as long as you want the top or dress to be. Measure the widest part of your doll to find the width. Then, use the doll to find the length. For a top, cut the fabric so that it will end about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the doll's waist. For a short dress, cut the fabric so that it will come to the doll’s knees. For a long dress, cut the fabric so that it will come to the doll’s toes."

The top of the doll’s shoulders should be about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the top edge of the fabric. Use a pen or piece of fabric chalk to place a small mark on the fabric next to each of your doll’s shoulders. There should be 2 marks when you are done. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Slide your doll’s arms into the holes. Insert your doll’s hands through each of the holes and slide the holes up to your doll’s shoulders. If the holes are not wide enough to get them all the way to the doll’s shoulders, then snip a little more fabric to widen the holes. [3] X Research source Keep mind that it is better for the armholes to be a little too small than too big because you can always make them larger."

      "content": "Cross the fabric in front of the doll’s body. Next, wrap the fabric across the doll’s body, as if you were closing a robe. Wrap the fabric as tight or as loose as you want it to be. The fabric should be long enough to wrap all the way around to the back of the doll if you want it to. [4] X Research source"

Wrap it around the doll’s waist and tie a bow to secure it. [5] X Research source You can also use a piece of ribbon to secure the dress if you prefer."

Just add a dab of fabric glue to the jewel, bead, or sequin and press it onto the dress where you want it to go. Let the glue dry overnight. Add a jewel to the center of the neckline. Apply some beads to the bottom of the skirt. Layer the skirt with sequins."

      "title": "Lay the doll on the fabric and mark the fabric.",
      "content": "Lay the doll on the fabric and mark the fabric. Choose a fabric that will not fray, such as felt. You can make a skirt for your doll using a method similar to making a dress for your doll. The fabric should be wide enough to fit around the doll and overlap by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). Cut the fabric so that it is as long you would like the skirt to be. Mark the fabric to indicate this length and then turn the doll so that she is centered on the fabric between these marks. Mark the fabric where you want the skirt to begin and end on the doll. For example, if the doll is 18 inches (46 cm) and you want the skirt to extend 10 inches (25 cm) from its waist, then the rectangle should be 18 inches (46 cm) wide and 10 inches (25 cm) long. Use a fabric that is a little stiff. You can use a tape measure to measure the waist."

      "content": "Cut a strip of fabric to secure the skirt. The strip of fabric should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and as long as the width of your rectangle. This is necessary so that you can wrap the strip around the doll’s waist multiple times to secure the skirt. You can also trim it down shorter after you have tied it around the skirt. For example, if the rectangle is 18 inches (46 cm) wide, then the strip should be 18 inches (46 cm) long."

Then, wrap the rectangle around the doll’s waist and legs to create the skirt. You can wrap the fabric around the doll so that it is tight or somewhat loose. Just make sure that the ends overlap by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). [7] X Research source Try wrapping the fabric around the doll tightly for a pencil skirt. Do a loose wrap for a full flowing skirt. Wrap the fabric so it is tighter at the top than at the bottom for an A line skirt."

Get a piece of fabric that is long enough and wide enough to cover your doll’s legs when wrapped around them. Fold the fabric in half. Place your doll on top of the fabric so that her legs are centered over the fabric. Make sure that the print sides of the fabric are facing each other."

Trace closer or further from the edges of the doll's legs to determine the fit of the pants, and stop tracing at the point where you want the pant legs to end. [9] X Research source Try tracing 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the edges of the doll's legs for fitted pants. Trace 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the doll’s legs for loose fitting pants. Trace 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the doll's legs for baggy pants. Stop tracing at the ankles for full length pants, or stop tracing higher up, such as mid-calf for capris or mid-thigh for shorts."

Use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to sew a straight stitch about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the edges of the inner and outer edges of the pantlegs. Or place several small dots of fabric glue between the 2 fabric layers along the edges of the pant legs. [11] X Research source Make sure the non-print sides of the fabric are still facing out. If you use glue, make sure to let it dry overnight. Ask an adult for help if you want to sew the seams on the pants."

Cut a strip of fabric that is about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and long enough to wrap around the doll's waist a few times. For example, if the doll's waist is 5 inches (13 cm), then the strip should be at least 15 inches (38 cm). Wrap the strip around the doll's waist over the pants and tie the strip in a knot or bow to secure it."

Find a spare sock with a long cuff that will fit around your doll’s torso, such as a baby sock for a Barbie doll or an adult size sock for a larger doll. You can use a solid color sock or a sock with designs printed on it. Then, cut the sock where the cuff meets the ankle of the sock.

Make sure the holes are large enough for your doll’s arms to fit through. [14] X Research source Don't worry if you make the armholes too small. You can always make them wider later."
