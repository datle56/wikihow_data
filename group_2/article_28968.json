      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. Wires are commonly used to make fake septum piercings. You can buy various types of wires from your local craft store. Choose a wire that has the color you want but is also easy to bend. You'll also need a pencil and a pair of pliers."

      "title": "Cut off a piece of wire using your pliers.",
      "content": "Cut off a piece of wire using your pliers. You'll trim it down later but to start with go for wire that's 2 to 3 inches in length. Fold your wire around a pencil. This will create the curve you need for a septum piercing. Then, take the pliers and trim down the wire until both sides are roughly the same length. Make a swift, strong cuts with your pliers. You need to make a clean cut for the septum to be safe for use. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Add beads.",
      "content": "Add beads. Many septum piercings are decorated with beads. If you want yours to look more elaborate or realistic, consider adding small beads to your fake piercing. [2] X Research source You can buy tiny beads at most craft stores. Pick a color and design you like. If you want to add beads, pause before creating small loops on either side of your fake piercing. Slide the beads in place and then use your pliers to curve both ends of the piercing."

      "title": "Use the pliers to bend the ends of the wire backwards.",
      "content": "Use the pliers to bend the ends of the wire backwards. You want to sharp edges of the wire to fold out away from the curve. Create two small loops on either side of your fake piercing. This assures that your piercing will not poke or irritate your inner nose when you put it in place. Then, use your fingers to bend and fold the wire as needed to create a smooth semi-circle that fits your nose. It may take quite a bit of manipulation with your fingers before the wire forms an even semi-circle, so don't get discouraged if it's taking you awhile. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. If you can't find a type of wire you like at a craft store, you can also use earring hooks. Earring hooks are fairly cheap and available for purchase at most craft stores. You'll also need a pair of pliers. You can also use a barbell earring to make a fake barbell piercing. If you're going this route, get a pair of barbell earrings instead of earring hooks."

    {
      "title": "Use the earring hook.",
      "content": "Use the earring hook. An earring hook should have one end that's folded inward, forming a loop. Use your pliers to bend the unfolded end into a loop-like shape, roughly matching the other end. [4] X Research source Squeeze the earring hook into a semi-circle. Use your fingers to gently form a semi-circle with the hook. Then, squeeze the ends together so they close enough to fit your nose. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Bend a stud earring to make a barbell piercing.",
      "content": "Bend a stud earring to make a barbell piercing. Barbell septum piercings are piercings with large studs on either end rather than curved edges. You can get a barbell earring, which is an earring shaped something like a barbell, and use pliers to create a curve. This will give you a fun barbell septum piercing to wear. [6] X Research source Barbell earrings may require a lot of force to manipulate. It may take you awhile to get the right shape if you're using this method."

      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. A paper clip can also be used to make a fake septum piercing. Paperclips are often easier to manipulate than wires or earring hooks. You'll also need a pencil and pliers."

      "content": "Bend the paperclip into a septum ring. Unbend the paper clip until it stretches into a thin line. Then, bend the clip around your pen to form a loop. [7] X Research source Clip the ends of the paperclip so they're even in length and you have a small circular loop, roughly the size of a septum piercing. Use your fingers to bend it into a semi-circle until it comfortably fits on your nose. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use different colors of paperclips. If you're using paper clips, consider using different colors. You can make a fake septum piercing in a variety of fun colors, like red or purple. [9] X Research source One downside to colored paperclips is that sometimes the paint is cheap and chips easily. If you're using a colorful paperclip, you may have to frequently replace your fake piercing."

      "content": "Keep everything clean. Keep all the materials you're using for your fake septum clean.

[13] X Research source If you do experience an allergic reaction, apply antibacterial cream. Make an appointment with your physician to see how to treat the infection. Stop using any fake piercing that resulted in an infection. Try to make a different septum using other materials. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Try on your piercing and adjust the size if necessary. With any of the above methods, wear the piercing around your house before wearing it out. You may have to adjust the size if it does not fit in your nose. A septum piercing is worn on the bridge of flesh separating your nostrils. Place your piercing around this bridge and walk around for a bit. If the piercing falls off or feels loose, use your pliers or fingers to tighten your fake piercing. Conversely, if it's feels painful you may have to increase the size of your loop."
