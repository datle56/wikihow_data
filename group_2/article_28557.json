If you are not signed in to your Google account automatically, click an account you wish to sign in with and type the password to sign in to that account. If none of the accounts listed are an account you want to use, click Use another account and sign in with the email and password associated with that account. You can also create a new account by typing an email address in the email bar and clicking Next . Then follow the on-screen instructions. You'll also need to agree to the terms of service and privacy policy. The first time you sign in to SketchUp, it gives you the option to view a tour. If you wish to take a tour, click Take Tour . The tour explains each of the buttons in the tool bars to the left, right, top and bottom of the screen. If you wish to skip it, click Start Modeling instead.
