      "content": "Define what a life is to you. This notion of \"a life\" is subjective. You need to reflect on what is important to you. What do you want to achieve in life? What makes you happy? Only once you think about those kinds of things will you begin to realize how to attain a life. [1] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 March 2020. Don't let others define a meaningful life for you. While it is true that many people will tend to see certain things as more indicative of \"a life\" than others based on human universal needs, such as having kids or family, having fun experiences, or having meaningful work, ultimately, what matters most is what you personally find to be important.

Regarding your health, you could take some time adjusting your budget to see if you can afford a gym membership. You could spend some time researching local sports teams you could join. If you are particularly busy, you may also have to think about where to cut back on to gain the extra time or resources.

To live more in the present, you can: [9] X Research source Do only one task at a time; avoid multitasking.
