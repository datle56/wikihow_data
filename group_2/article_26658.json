      "content": "The Lululemon Affiliate Program lets participants earn commissions on sales made through affiliate links. It’s open to members of the media, those who work for editorial publications, and bloggers (not social media influencers). Once accepted, you promote Lululemon gear to your audience to earn commissions. You also get first notice of new product drops, access to special promotions, and invites to community events. [1] X Research source Anyone in media or blogging can apply to join, as long as you’re 18 or older. [2] X Research source There’s no stated minimum follower requirement. However, the Lululemon Creator Network requires a minimum of 3000 followers, and many major brands require affiliates to have a decent following (> 5000 followers) before applying. [3] X Research source Your publication’s content matters—if your publication or blog is fitness-focused, you’ll have a better chance of being accepted than if fitness is just a small part of your niche. Similar programs like the Lululemon Sweat Collective require you to be an active trainer, athlete, or coach. [4] X Research source If you don’t have fitness, health, or wellness expertise, you may not be a fit for the affiliate program. Consider other Lululemon Ambassador programs instead."

      "content": "Promote Lululemon products to your followers with your unique affiliate link. Embed it in your blog when raving about a new favorite product, like an anti-slip yoga mat. Or, put the link in your publication’s shopping roundups and fitness-related articles. Once customers click the link and make a purchase (within 30 days of clicking), you’ll receive a commission. [6] X Research source While an exact commission rate isn’t publicly available, many sources estimate it to be around 7% per purchase. [7] X Research source So, if a customer purchases $60 worth of products through your affiliate link, you earn $4.20. Many Lululemon products are on the more expensive side, making it easier to earn a higher commission. [8] X Research source Lululemon doesn’t publicly share how frequently affiliates are paid, but generally, affiliate programs pay out commissions on a monthly basis. [9] X Research source Some sources suggest Lululemon affiliates can choose to be paid by direct deposit or by check. [10] X Research source"
