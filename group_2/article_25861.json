      "content": "Use makeup to strategically cover it up. Try to make your jawline feature more prominently than your neck by using a powder that is a shade darker than your skin tone. The powder should be blended in from ear to ear and into the neck area. Draw attention away from the neck area with colorful blush and interesting eye makeup. If you can't get it right yourself, see a makeup artist to show you how to do this. Wearing eyeliner and mascara makes the eyes look larger and draws attention away from the chin. Minimize attention to your lower face by wearing neutral lipstick shades."

      "content": "Change your hairstyle. Don't have a haircut that rests right at the level of your chin, or very long hair, because both styles will draw more attention to your chin. A medium cut just below the chin is your best bet. Here are a few options: Go for a long bob. This classic cut looks great on people with larger chins. It should stop an inch or two below your chin line. Get an angled haircut. Have the longer hair in front, shorter hair in the back. The longer hair in front reduces the size of and draws less attention to the chin. Try layered waves. A full hairstyle balances the face and draws attention away from the chin."
