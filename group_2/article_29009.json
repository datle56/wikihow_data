If you are going to be wearing this wreath over a hairstyle (such as for a wedding), get your hair into that style first and then measure your hair. Some hairstyles, such as French braids and braided crowns, can add bulk to your head."

      "content": "Cut a piece of sturdy wire according to that measurement. Try to use some thicker floral, like the kind that has paper around it. This will help the florist's tape stick better to it. Do not use scissors to cut the wire or you will dull them. Use wire cutters instead."

      "content": "Make a ring with the wire and overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). The ring should hold its shape. If it is too floppy, twist two to three strands of wire together, and make the ring again. This should make it sturdier."

      "content": "Wrap florist's tape around the overlapping ends to secure them. You can also wrap some more tape around the entire wire ring. This will give you a base to work on. It will also make the color more consistent."

[1] X Research source Use scissors to cut real or dried flowers, and wire cutters to cut fake flowers. Try to cut all the stems down to the same length. This will make the crown neater in the end. Try using large, medium, and small flowers. This will give your crown some variety."

      "title": "Arrange the flowers in a pattern you like.",
      "content": "Arrange the flowers in a pattern you like. Don't tape the flowers to the base just yet. You want to get your design down first. It is easier to make changes while the flowers are still on the table. Try alternating between different shapes, sizes, and colors. Here are some more design ideas: Place the largest flowers in the top/front of the crown. Use smaller and smaller flowers as you go towards the back of the crown. Try having all the flowers pointing in the same direction, towards or away the top of the crown. The flowers don't have to be right up against each other. You can have them spaced as close together or as far apart as you want. Instead of attaching flowers all the way around the wire base, place them only on the top."

Daisies and dandelions are classical, but you can also use alyssum or forget-me-nots. Flowering herbs, such as mint, thyme, oregano, chamomile, and lavender work as well. Not only will they look beautiful but, they will smell amazing."

Try to get wire as close to the blooms as possible. You want all the blooms to be at the same level; if one sits higher than the other, your crown will look uneven. The wire will hold the flowers together while you braid them. If you don't have any floral wire, use twist ties or thread instead."

You can use any color of ribbon you want, but green might blend in with the flowers better. If you don't want a green ribbon, then try to match the color to the flowers you are using instead. There are two ways you can attach the ribbon: Choose a ribbon that is the same width as your headband. Cut it so that it is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) longer than your headband. Center the ribbon on top of the headband, and hot glue it down. There will be an inch (2.54 centimeters) of ribbon handing off of each end. Cover both ends of the ribbon with glue, and fold them under the headband. Put a drop of hot glue onto one end of the headband. Press the end of a long piece of ribbon down onto the glue. Wrap the ribbon around the headband, like a candy cane. Start from one end and move towards the other. Try to overlap the ribbon slightly. This way, you will cover the headband entirely and not get any patches. Secure the end of the ribbon with a drop of glue."
