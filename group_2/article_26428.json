      "title": "Yes, “looking forward to seeing you” is grammatically correct.",
      "content": "Yes, “looking forward to seeing you” is grammatically correct. In the phrase “looking forward to…,” “to” is used as a preposition. When “to” is used as a preposition, it has to be followed by a noun, pronoun, or the -ing form of a verb (called the gerund or present participle) to be grammatically correct. [1] X Research source So, it is grammatically correct to say “looking forward to seeing you” (but it is not grammatically correct to say “looking forward to see you”). Additional examples : “I look forward to meeting you” is correct; “I look forward to meet you” is incorrect. “I’m looking forward to taking a vacation” is correct; “I’m looking forward to take a vacation” is incorrect. “Looking forward to hearing from you” is correct; “Looking forward to hear from you” is incorrect.” Note : Be careful about mixing up “to” as a preposition with “to” as a part of an infinitive verb. An infinitive is the base form of a verb with the word “to” in front of it, like “to see,” “to sleep,” and “to eat.” So, it’s correct to say “I am excited to see you” instead of “I’m excited to seeing you” because “to see” is an infinitive.

      "content": "No, \"looking forward to see you\" is not grammatically correct. Because \"to\" is used as a preposition in this phrase, it must be followed by a noun, pronoun, or a gerund (the -ing form of a verb, which turns it into a noun). For this phrase to be correct, we would have to change \"see\" to its gerund form: \"seeing.\" [3] X Research source"

We’re going to have so much fun together!” “Looking forward to seeing you at the company picnic tomorrow! I can’t wait to catch up with you and the other team members around the state.” Note : In casual speech and written communication, dropping the first few words from a sentence is common practice. This is called left-edge ellipses or deletion. So while “I am looking forward to seeing you” may be more grammatically correct, it’s perfectly acceptable to say “looking forward to seeing you.” [4] X Research source"
