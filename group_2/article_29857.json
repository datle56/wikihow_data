[7] X Research source You will be \"inverting\" a fold with each petal. This is the hardest part of the process. Move slowly and gently, and try not to tear the paper. You may have to slightly \"unfold\" the lotus to get the petals to come up. When you're finished, the flap you grabbed from the bottom should be nearly vertical."
