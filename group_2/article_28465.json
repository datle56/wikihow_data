      "title": "Wear a dust mask to protect yourself from the paint.",
      "content": "Wear a dust mask to protect yourself from the paint. Since you will be working with paint pigments and a medium, protect yourself by wearing a mask or respirator. You may also want to cover your arms by wearing long-sleeved clothing. [1] X Research source The paints are non-toxic unless you use metal-based pigments like “cadmium red.” However, these paints are not meant for use on skin."

      "title": "Pour raw color pigment onto a flat mixing surface.",
      "content": "Pour raw color pigment onto a flat mixing surface. You will need dry paint pigment in the color you wish to make. Pour about 1 tablespoon, or 1 ⁄ 2 ounce (14 g), of pigment onto a mixing surface such as a paint palette or slab. [2] X Research source You can find dry paint pigment at art supply stores. Each pigment has a visible color and is labeled appropriately, such as Titanium White or Red Iron. Many artists use glass or stone slabs. You may be able to find plexiglass at a home improvement store and use that to mix your paint."

      "title": "Pour 2 drops of water if you want to smooth out the pigment.",
      "content": "Pour 2 drops of water if you want to smooth out the pigment. Adding a little bit of water can help you get the paint to the proper consistency. Spread the paint to create space in the center of the pigment pile. Using a pipette or eye dropper, squeeze 2 or 3 drops of water into the space. [3] X Research source If the pigment isn’t completely smooth, the paint may look grainy once you use it later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the paint and water with a palette knife.",
      "content": "Mix the paint and water with a palette knife. Use a palette knife or spatula to spread the water throughout the pigment. Mix the paint until it has a smooth, sauce-like consistency. Try to eliminate any clumps of raw pigment you see. [4] X Research source You might not be able to remove all the lumps right away. This is okay, since you will get another chance to thin the paint. If you make your own paint often, consider purchasing a paint muller online or from an art supply store. A paint muller grinds and disperses raw pigment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your paint medium to the pigment.",
      "content": "Add your paint medium to the pigment. Start with approximately 2 tablespoons, or 1 fl. oz., of your liquid paint medium. The medium you choose depends on what type of paint you want to make. Art supply stores sell different mediums for acrylics, or you can get a plant-based oil to make oil paint. [5] X Research source For example, you can use a gloss medium to make thin, transparent acrylic paint. You could add a gel medium to acrylic paint for an impasto-style painting. [6] X Expert Source Jeanine Hattas Wilson Professional Painter Expert Interview. 7 July 2021. For oil paint, use linseed, walnut, or poppy oil."

    {
      "title": "Mix the paint and add more of the medium for consistency.",
      "content": "Mix the paint and add more of the medium for consistency. Use your palette knife or spatula to combine the pigment and medium. When the paint is at the proper consistency, it will appear smooth, firm, and a little glossy. Adjust the paint by adding more of the medium as necessary until it reaches the consistency you desire. [7] X Research source Add the medium gradually while mixing it into the paint. Check the consistency frequently so you don't add too much. Excess paint may be spread onto tin foil, wrapped up tightly, and preserved in a freezer for at least 2 or 3 months."

      "content": "Boil sugar and water in a stovetop pot. Add about 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) to a pot safe to heat on the stove. Stir in 16 ounces (450 g) of white sugar. Turn the heat on the stove to high until the water boils. [8] X Research source Instead of doing this, you can purchase light corn syrup from a grocery store. You don’t need to boil anything. Simply mix the syrup in with the other ingredients. This creates a non-toxic paint safe for children. It’s easier to spread and more similar to store-bought watercolors than flour paint."

    {
      "title": "Turn the heat down and stir the mixture into a syrup.",
      "content": "Turn the heat down and stir the mixture into a syrup. Turn the heat down to low after the water begins to boil. Stir the sugar mixture continuously for about 3 to 5 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Once the mixture becomes a clear syrup, remove the pot from the heat. [9] X Research source Scoop up the mixture with a spoon to check for undissolved sugar crystals. The longer you boil the mixture, the thicker it becomes after it cools. If you boil it too long, it may burn."

      "title": "Add 2 drops of food coloring to the paint.",
      "content": "Add 2 drops of food coloring to the paint. Pick out a few different dyes to give your art plenty of color. Start with only a few drops of food coloring so the paint doesn't turn too dark. You can add more drops after mixing the paint. [12] X Research source If you can’t find a specific color, mix different colors to create it. For instance, mixing 2 drops of yellow and 1 drop of red can create orange."

    {
      "title": "Mix in the food coloring using a toothpick.",
      "content": "Mix in the food coloring using a toothpick. Stir the paint around in the container until the food coloring is dispersed throughout it. Use a different toothpick for each container in order to avoid crossing the colors. Then, you can brush the paint onto paper. The best surface to use is watercolor paper, since it holds up better to liquid paint than regular paper.. [13] X Research source Wash off your paint brush after using it to crossing colors. This paint is like store-bought watercolors, so you can mix colors on paper. The paint also dries slowly, drying faster under heat. The paint can be stored in a covered container in a refrigerator. It will usually last a couple of weeks. Throw it away if you notice mold growing on it."

Next, add about 4 ounces (110 g) of baking soda. [14] X Research source This paint is an inexpensive way to give furniture an aged, distressed look. The paint is non-toxic, but swallowing it can make you feel temporarily sick. The paint can also be made with Plaster of Paris or unsanded grout instead of baking soda. Use 4 ounces (110 g) of either substance. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the mixture into a cup of latex paint.",
      "content": "Pour the mixture into a cup of latex paint. Pour about 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) of a latex paint into a paint bowl. The paint can be any color you want. Then, add the baking soda and water mixture into the paint, stirring it with a paint mixing stick. [16] X Research source You can get latex paint at a home improvement store. Make sure it is latex-based. Oil paints are different and dry slower."

      "title": "Spread the paint onto furniture with a paint brush.",
      "content": "Spread the paint onto furniture with a paint brush. The chalk paint will come out smooth like any regular latex paint. It needs to be applied right away to any furniture you wish to color. Coat the furniture with the paint to give it a chalky, distressed appearance. [17] X Research source The paint will begin drying within a few hours. Wait about a day to ensure it dries completely. After the paint dries, you can sand it even with 180 to 220-grit sandpaper. To dispose of excess paint, leave it out in the open. Since it is made with latex paint, it will dry. Then you can throw it in the trash."

Also add 12 ounces (340 g) each of white flour and table salt. Mix the ingredients into a smooth liquid. [18] X Research source This creates a quick-drying, non-toxic paint safe for children of any age. Adjust the amount of each ingredient you use to create more or less paint. Keep the ingredients in the same ratio."

    {
      "title": "Divide the paint into separate containers.",
      "content": "Divide the paint into separate containers. Distribute the paint evenly among a few small bowls or squeeze bottles. Resealable plastic bags also work well with this kind of paint. [19] X Research source With a zippered plastic bag, you can cut a corner later to let out a steady drip of paint. This eliminates overturned paint containers and reduces messes."

      "title": "Pour 2 drops of food coloring into the paint.",
      "content": "Pour 2 drops of food coloring into the paint. Choose a paint color, then squeeze 2 or 3 drops of food coloring into the paint. Give yourself a color palette by mixing a different color into each container. You can add more drops as needed if the paint’s color isn’t dark enough. [20] X Research source If you can’t find a specific food coloring, mix drops of other colors. For example, try adding 3 drops of red and 1 drop of blue to make purple."

For bottles or bags, close the container and shake or squeeze it. Keep doing this until the paint becomes a consistent color. [21] X Research source If you are using resealable bags, leave the bag open slightly so that excess air can escape. Be careful to avoid squeezing the paint out of the opening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add more water to thin the paint.",
      "content": "Add more water to thin the paint. Paint made using a flour mixture may seem pretty thick at first. To thin the paint, gradually pour more water into the container. Mix the ingredients together until the paint is exactly how you want it. [22] X Research source Since the paint is non-toxic, you can safely touch it with your fingers as well as pour it from the container. This paint tends to be a little thicker than traditional store-bought paints, so it isn’t quite as easy to spread."

    {
      "title": "Use the paint on paper and refrigerate excess.",
      "content": "Use the paint on paper and refrigerate excess. The best paper to use is watercolor paper from an art supply store. The paper is made of wood pulp or cotton and may hold up better than regular printer paper. You can also try similar flat surfaces such as cardboard, cardstock, or canvases. Store excess paint in a closed container in the refrigerator. The paint should be safe to use for about 2 weeks. However, it may harden over time."

      "title": "Stir 16 fluid ounces (470 ml) of cold water into the paste.",
      "content": "Stir 16 fluid ounces (470 ml) of cold water into the paste. Use only cold water so the paste doesn’t thin out too much. Slowly pour it onto the paste, mixing the entire time. The water will thin the paste to a paint-like consistency as you stir.. [26] X Research source Adding the water too quickly can thin the paste out more than you want, so it won’t be thick enough to cover your walls."

    {
      "title": "Add the filler material to the paste.",
      "content": "Add the filler material to the paste. Slowly add the clay mixture to the paste, stirring it the entire time. Mix the ingredients together until the paste reaches the consistency you desire. You can then spread it over your paint surface with brushes like you would with any regular latex or oil paint. You can thin the paint further by boiling it for up to 30 minutes, then mixing in about 32 fluid ounces (950 ml) of linseed oil. Let it cool to the touch before using it."

    {
      "title": "Use the paint and store the excess in a sealed container.",
      "content": "Use the paint and store the excess in a sealed container. Brush the paint over your painting surface, then wait for the paint to set. The paint will dry out in about 1 hour and cure within 24 hours. You may then wish to give your painting surface a second coating to make it look great. Move the excess to a sealed container, such as a paint can, in a closet, garage, or similar area. Properly-stored paint should last 5 to 10 years. You can also leave the excess paint out in the open to dry, then dispose of it in the trash."
