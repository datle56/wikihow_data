Starting with a foot massage and stroking upward promotes better blood circulation , which helps ease pain and tension in the legs. Put a few drops of oil into your palm. Then, sandwich the person's foot between your palms and rub firmly for a few minutes. When you're done rubbing the foot between your hands, give it a few gentle strokes moving from the toes to ankles.

Slide your hands up over the shin area from the ankle to just below the knee. Then move your hands behind the leg to the calf area and slide all the way back down to the ankle. After doing this a few times, work your way up and down the lower leg by using your thumbs to knead and scoop the sides of the leg. [3] X Research source Morales cautions against overusing your thumbs when giving a massage. “If we start to drill on someone’s shoulders, it’s a really solid muscle [to work on] with our little thumbs. We're going to start to feel it. We're going to be sore. So try to look for other techniques that you can use.” [4] X Expert Source Marty Morales Certified Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 December 2019."

      "content": "Learn about basic anatomy to give better massages. It's helpful to know some anatomy before you give a massage . Thigh muscles are in 4 basic groups, which run from the hips down to the knee in the front, sides, and backs of the legs. Knowing where they are can help you better target and relieve pain. Understanding where bones are and how tissues that connect muscle to bone function is also important for an effective massage. The connective tissues around the joints, like the hips, the knees, the ankles, and the feet can be pulled, kneaded, or compressed. The hamstrings and calves in the back of the leg are notoriously tight, and people who run often have issues related to the outer thigh area, the TFL (tensor fasciae latae) or the IT (iliotibial) band, the muscle and ligament that run along the outside of your thigh."

As circulation increases, so can the intensity of the massage. Move your fingers and hands quickly and lightly or slowly and firmly, but not quickly and firmly. [19] X Research source The body parts you use to perform a massage affect the pressure. The elbows generally provide the strongest pressure. The palms and fingers will generally apply less pressure. [20] X Research source Deeper tissue massage can include pressing down with the heel of the hand, the thumb, one hand on top of the other, the knuckles, a fist, or the forearm. Types of massage include gliding, kneading, compression, friction, percussion, vibration, jostling, and range of motion movements.

Using oil is optional when giving a massage, but it makes it easier to run your hands and fingers over someone's legs. Oils may also give the person you’re massaging a soothing effect. For leg massages, go for oils like olive oil, avocado oil, or almond oil. You can also use essential oils, or oils that are infused with scents such as lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree, for a pleasantly aromatic experience. [22] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "content": "Help the person you're massaging find a comfortable position. For leg massages, it's usually easier to lie down somewhere like a bed. This allows the person to relax with their legs stretched out. If you're only massaging one leg, have the person lie on their side with the leg you're massaging extending upward at an angle. Or, have the person lie with their legs stretched out and elevated slightly. Use a pillow to elevate to help them lift their legs more comfortably. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "Communicate with the person throughout the massage.",
      "content": "Communicate with the person throughout the massage. At the beginning, ask the person you’re massaging if there's a particular area where they want extra pressure or attention. For example, if someone's thighs are bothering them, they may want you to focus on massaging their thighs. You may want to linger on certain areas and give them more attention. Morales recommends keeping communication open throughout the massage and asking the person how they're feeling so you can adjust your technique if necessary. “Let's say you find a “knot”. Some people proceed to really dig into it, even if it's painful to the recipient…My advice is more is not necessarily better. Listen to the recipient. If something is too much, you can back off and possibly get more done by keeping steady pressure instead of constantly pushing harder and harder on a knot.” [25] X Expert Source Marty Morales Certified Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 December 2019."
