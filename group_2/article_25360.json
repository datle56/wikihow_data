[2] X Expert Source Yvonne Mo Fitness and Health Coach & Kung Fu Instructor Expert Interview. 2 September 2021. You can use a step exercise to test your aerobic fitness. Before performing any fitness exercises and tests, always consult your doctor. If you feel any exhaustion, stop the exercise immediately and rest. Use a step approximately 18 inches (460 mm) high and grab a stopwatch Climb up and down the step for three minutes at a rate of 24 steps per minute. That’s roughly a step every 2 seconds (don’t forget to breathe). After three minutes, stop. Then rest for one minute. After resting, take your pulse for 30 seconds. Once you know your pulse, look at the table below and find your pulse to rate your current fitness level. Note that these results are accurate for 18-25 year olds. To check your results with a different age range, look at the full results list . Men Excellent: 84 or lower Average: 85-100 Poor: 101 or higher Women Excellent: 93 or lower Average: 94-110 Poor: 111 or higher"

This test not only checks your overall flexibility but can also increase coordination. To perform the test, try touching your toes or stretching your arms across your body. If your muscles tighten or pull, it may be time to start stretching again. If you’re looking to increase your flexibility at home, add stretching into your gym routine. Try holding a hamstring stretch for 30 seconds three times a week, and you should start to see results within the month."

      "content": "Test your flexibility. [4] X Expert Source Yvonne Mo Fitness and Health Coach & Kung Fu Instructor Expert Interview. 2 September 2021. Check your hips and hamstrings. They're a good gauge of overall flexibility since they link the upper and lower body. The tests here are preferable to the classic sit-and-reach, which can aggravate back pain: Lie faceup on an exercise table or bench, your lower legs hanging off the end. Put the bottom of your buttocks on the edge of the table. Try to hug one of your knees into your chest. If your opposite leg (the one that is hanging) rises above the height of the table, then you have tight psoas (not hamstrings). Side note: you may also have tight gluteal and QL (quadratus lumborum) muscles. The psoas is a muscle within the front of your hips that wraps around the bottom of your spine. If it's too tight, then it can cause poor posture and lower back pain. To improve this by opening the front of your hips to extend them, you should kneel on the side that you want to stretch while the other leg is positioned with the bottom of your foot flat on the floor in front of you like when a person proposes to another to be married. Ensure that the knee of the leg on the side that your are stretching is right below your hip if you are a beginner of this stretch. Raise the arm of that same side that you are stretching straight up. Then, flex your buttocks. You should feel the stretch in the front of your hips. If you don't feel much of a stretch in the front of your hips, then move the knee of the side that you are stretching backward an inch or two and push your hips forward while flexing your buttocks. Hold the flexion of your buttocks for 15-30 seconds and do this for a total of 3 sets per side (left and right). Thank me later."

On the hamstring test, if you can lift your leg to 80 degrees, you'll also know that your hip flexibility is good. Less than that means you have tight hamstrings, which can tug on your lower back, affecting your posture and causing pain. Get more flexible. Lie faceup in a doorway with your left knee bent and right hip near the right side of the door frame. Extend your right leg to the ceiling with the back of the leg against the edge of the door frame. Flex your foot, pressing your heel toward the ceiling. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Repeat on your left leg. Do up to three times a day."

The test allows you to push yourself and challenge your endurance. Chart a two-mile course with a GPS. Jog for 10 minutes to warm up, and begin running. Time your running with a stopwatch, and run quickly while knowing your limits. While a finish time of 17:30 is enough for servicewomen ages 37 to 51 to pass the test, breaking 18 minutes is considered above average for those in that age range. To develop your speed, include intervals—short bursts of maximum effort—to your cardio sessions. Interval training pushes your heart and lungs past what they're used to. This delivers speedier results than if you were to exercise at a regular pace. Intervals used to be considered as an exercise for people who are very fit because the exercise so difficult, but it can benefit everybody."

      "content": "Pay attention to the amount of weekly exercise you get. If you are fit enough to exercise for at least 120 minutes each week, you are considered fit. Switch up your workouts, challenge yourself, and set a goal of two hours of exercise or more per week. You'll want to get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. This can include walking briskly or even mowing the lawn. For vigorous activities like running or higher-intensity aerobics, the recommendation is 75 minutes. Try to follow all of these guidelines. If you're pursuing peak fitness, try to exercise more vigorously when possible (remember to take lots of breaks). If you don’t exercise this much, not to worry—incorporating beneficial interval training is a perfect place to begin a fitness regimen."

When you think of muscular strength, think of the force that your muscles need to exert during activities. Can you perform everyday tasks with ease and sustain increased periods of exertion? The best way to make your muscles more robust is by pushing them against an opposing object or by doing resistance training. Resistance training can come from gravity or by using weights. To gain muscle strength, lift weights or run up and down the stairs. Muscular strength is the maximum amount of force a muscle can produce. You might want to combine resistance training with walking, jogging, dancing, or bicycling."

To check your pulse at your wrist, place two fingers between the bone and the tendon over your radial artery, located on the palm side of your wrist below the thumb. When you feel your pulse, look at your watch and count the number of beats in 10 seconds. Multiply this number by 6 to get your heart rate per minute. Let's say you count 15 beats in ten seconds.

BMI is used by medical professionals when diagnosing whether a person is at a healthy, overweight, or obese weight level. The basic formula for determining BMI is: Your weight in pounds times 704.5 divided by your height in inches times your height in inches. The result should be between zero and more than thirty. If you are physically fit, your BMI should be between 19 and 24.9. If you are between 25 and 29.9, you are considered overweight. A BMI over 30 indicates obesity."

The skin fold test of testing for fat content and physical fitness is not as commonly used, but it has been used in schools to easily test the health of students. The test measures total fat percentages by measuring the layer of fat that is directly under the skin. There are various points on your body that are tested using this method, and after these six sites have been examined, your body’s composition is determined. The triceps, abdomen, front of the thighs, below the shoulder blades, and directly above your pelvis is included in skin-fold tests. In males, the chest may be tested, and in females, the back of the thighs may be tested. Calipers define a precise measurement of the thickness of the sub-skin fat layer. Weight, gender, and age all help calculate physical fitness. If a male has between fifteen and seventeen percent body fat, they are considered fit. If the normal female resides between eighteen and twenty-two percent body fat, they are healthy. Athletes generally have quite a bit less body fat and they are considered ultra-fit."
