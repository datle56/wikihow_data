      "title": "Wash your jeans in hot water to shrink their size.",
      "content": "Wash your jeans in hot water to shrink their size. Turn your jeans inside out and toss them into the laundry machine by themselves. Use the “hot” setting on your washing machine, and avoid using fabric softener. The tumbling action combined with the hot water can open and shrink the fibers of the denim, making your jeans smaller. If you don’t have a laundry machine, head to the local laundromat or soak your jeans in a bucket of boiling water for 20 to 30 minutes and wring them out to dry. [1] X Research source Check the tag of your jeans before trying this hack, as this shrinking method may not work on preshrunk or synthetic fibers. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Toss the jeans into the dryer to make them smaller.",
      "content": "Toss the jeans into the dryer to make them smaller. After you wash your jeans, put them in the dryer and dry them on the hottest setting for the longest time possible. This will tighten up the denim fibers and help them shrink quickly. Be sure to read the label on your jeans before trying this method, as jeans that can’t be tumbled dried might shrink two or three sizes too small."

    {
      "title": "Dip the waistband of your jeans in boiling water to shrink the waist.",
      "content": "Dip the waistband of your jeans in boiling water to shrink the waist. Pour boiling water into a tub, sink, or bucket. Immerse only the waistband into the water using a large wooden spoon, and let it soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Wring the waistband out and then dry on high heat in a dryer. This can help tighten the waist size rather than shrinking the entire jean. [3] X Research source Consider wearing rubber gloves while you do this to avoid burning yourself."

      "title": "Try taking a hot shower in your jeans.",
      "content": "Try taking a hot shower in your jeans. We know it sounds super silly, but wearing your jeans in hot water can actually help them mold to your body better. Jump in the shower with your jeans on and make the water tolerably hot. Stay in the shower for around 15 to 20 minutes, wiggle out of the wet jeans, and immediately toss them in the dryer. [4] X Research source If standing in the shower for that long isn’t feasible, no worries! Try taking a warm bath in your jeans instead."

      "title": "Try on your jeans inside out to see where they need altering.",
      "content": "Try on your jeans inside out to see where they need altering. Pull the legs inside out and put them on like you would when they’re right-side out, buttoning them where you’d like them to rest. Stand in front of a mirror and note where you want the jeans to be tighter. [5] X Research source Remember that when you turn your jeans inside-out, your left leg inside-out is your right leg right-side-out."

      "title": "Pin the fabric together at the crotch and down the inseam to form a new seam.",
      "content": "Pin the fabric together at the crotch and down the inseam to form a new seam. The seam is where the two pieces of fabric meet and are sewn together. By making a new seam, you can tighten the leg of the pant. Simply pinch the fabric together at the inside of your leg to make it fit snugly around your leg. Then, use a safety pin or straight pin to hold the fabric in place. [6] X Research source Pin horizontally so you can guide your sewing machine over each pin without jamming the machine. Once one leg is pinned, gently remove the jeans."

    {
      "title": "Pin the other pant leg to continue the inseam.",
      "content": "Pin the other pant leg to continue the inseam. Lay the jeans on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles in the fabric. With a ruler , measure the distance between each pin and the bottom of the pants. Copy your measurements onto the other leg, and pinch and pin the fabric to finish the layout of your inseam. [7] X Research source Make sure your pinned seams are flat as you measure; otherwise, your stitching may be bumpy."

      "title": "Use a sewing machine",
      "content": "Use a sewing machine to sew the new seam. Thread the sewing machine with an all-purpose polyester thread that matches the color of your jeans. Start at the crotch and sew along your pins , keeping the jeans as flat as possible. Continue stitching along your pins until you reach the bottom of the pants. [8] X Research source Consider using a temporary basting stitch first, so you can try on your jeans with the new seam and easily remove and adjust any stitching."

      "title": "Reverse your stitch to fasten off the thread.",
      "content": "Reverse your stitch to fasten off the thread. When you get to the bottom of your pants and the end of your pins, press the reverse sewing lever and sew a quick knot. Lift the needle and remove the pants from the machine, cutting the connecting thread. Place the other pant leg into the sewing machine and repeat the sewing process. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut off the excess fabric to finish the new seam. If the jeans fit, take them off and turn them inside out again. Use a pair of fabric scissors to cut off the extra fabric on the outside of your new seam, leaving about 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.3 to 1.9 cm) of space between the scissor blades and the new seam. [10] X Research source Consider securing the new seam with a serger , if you have one, as denim can easily fray."

Use this measurement to create a new mark on either side of the center mark.
