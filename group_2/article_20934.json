Most people don't have hair that's a level 9 or 10, so you'll probably need to bleach it. Check to see how many shades lighter your hair needs to be, if any. [1] X Research source You can do a quick online search to find a chart that will show you the different hair color levels."

      "content": "Apply the lightening mixture to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) sections of your hair. Use an applicator brush to begin applying the bleach and peroxide to your hair. Begin applying it on your ends first, working your way up to doing the roots last. Put your hair up in a cap once you've finished your whole head to help the process go faster. [5] X Research source Be sure to use thin sections so all of your hair is saturated with bleach. If you apply the mixture to your roots first, you'll end up with much lighter roots that don't match the rest of your hair color due to the heat coming from your head. Work through each of the 4 sections until all your hair is bleached."

      "content": "Check your hair over the next hour to see if it's light enough. Most people will need to leave the bleach on their hair for about an hour to get the right shade. To make sure everything is going smoothly, check your hair color periodically during the hour to see how close it's getting to a level 9 or 10. If your hair reaches the right shade before the hour is up, you can wash it out. If your hair is still too dark once the hour is up, wash all the bleach out then dry your hair. You can simply repeat the process again. If you choose to bleach again, be aware that this may cause damage to your hair."

[7] X Research source You can buy level 10 peroxide and ash blonde hair color at a big-box store, beauty supply store, or online.
