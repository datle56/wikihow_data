      "content": "Beeline access. Bumble's Beeline feature is a special Swipe Deck that includes strictly users who have already swiped right on you. This allows you to swipe right on whoever you like, knowing that you are guaranteed to match! If you're nervous about making the first move, Bumble Premium might be worth it for Beeline access alone. Bumble Boost used to offer access to the Beeline, but no longer does with the introduction of Bumble Premium. Legacy subscribers, however, maintain access to the Beeline. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Unlimited swipes. One of the more frustrating features of online dating can be the limits on swiping. With Bumble Premium, you can swipe as much as you would like. If you find yourself running out of swipes often, Bumble Premium can be a worthwhile upgrade."

      "title": "Unlimited Advanced Filters.",
      "content": "Unlimited Advanced Filters. All Bumble users can set basic filters for their Swipe Deck for age and distance, but Premium subscribers can also add Advanced Filters to better curate their matches. These include religion, height, education, attitudes towards drugs/alcohol, and more. You can only set a filter for an area in which you have also self-identified. For example, you cannot filter out smokers if you have not already input your own attitude towards smoking. You can designate any Advanced Filter as a dealbreaker, ensuring there are no exceptions to this rule appearing in your Swipe Deck. Otherwise, Bumble may relax your filters so as to keep giving you options when you are running low. [2] X Research source"
