      "title": "Place a cup of cold water on top of the door.",
      "content": "Place a cup of cold water on top of the door. Fill a small, lightweight cup with cold water. Choose a door, and open it just slightly. Stand on a stable chair and balance the cup on top of the door. Make it so that the cup is just barely shifted toward the door frame while still being balanced. When the intruder goes to push the door open, the water will fall right on their head! [1] X Research source Avoid using buckets of water. Buckets of water are heavy, and you can seriously hurt someone. A plastic cup, though, is enough to get them wet without hurting them. Or, to make it so that the door is closed, duct tape the far rim of the cup to the wall, so that the door knocks the bottom of the cup away when it’s opened."

      "title": "Tape saran wrap across the doorframe.",
      "content": "Tape saran wrap across the doorframe. Get some clear plastic wrap and cut off a length that spans the doorframe. Pull it tight, then use clear tape to secure it across the doorframe at about head level. Do your best to make sure there are no wrinkles, so that the saran wrap is basically invisible. When someone walks into the room, they’ll get a face full of plastic! [2] X Research source Stake out in the room or set up a phone recording video so that you can see the moment when it happens."

      "title": "Make a popping doormat.",
      "content": "Make a popping doormat. Get some Pop-Its , those little snappers you throw at the ground to make a crackling noise. Sprinkle some under the welcome mat of your home, then gently lay the welcome mat over them. When someone comes to your house, they’ll step on the mat and pop the snappers, giving them a little jump."

      "title": "Make a leaking bottle of juice.",
      "content": "Make a leaking bottle of juice. Find a bottle of juice or soda in the fridge that’s already been opened. Then, near the top of the bottle, use a thumbtack to poke several holes around the sides. When someone goes to pour themselves a glass, the juice or soda will leak all over!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make someone spray themselves with the sink hose.",
      "content": "Make someone spray themselves with the sink hose. Here’s a classic! All you need to do is wrap a rubber band around the spray hose of your kitchen sink. Make sure it’s aimed toward someone who might use it. The next time anyone turns on the water, they’ll get a surprising spray. [3] X Research source This trap is great because it’s pretty harmless. Nobody gets hurt, just a little wet."

    {
      "title": "Put saran wrap over the toilet.",
      "content": "Put saran wrap over the toilet. This is part prank , part booby trap. All you need to do is lift up the toilet seat and cover the inside of the toilet with saran wrap, then set the seat back down. Try to avoid leaving any creases in the saran wrap—you want it to look as see-through as possible. Next time someone goes to use the restroom, they’ll get a messy surprise. Just be sure it’s not you! (Also, be ready to clean up any mess.)"

    {
      "title": "Rig a balloon to pop when someone opens a door.",
      "content": "Rig a balloon to pop when someone opens a door. This one gives someone quite a scare when they enter a room. Just tape a tack or a pin to the doorknob, then tape an inflated balloon to the wall where the doorknob would touch it when the door opens. When someone enters the room, the pin will pop the balloon and give a huge, terrifying BANG! Just don’t do this to someone with heart problems—it could scare them too much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake up a can of soda.",
      "content": "Shake up a can of soda. This one’s dead simple, but super effective. Find an unopened can of soda, shake it up real good for 30-60 seconds, then just leave it in the fridge. When someone tries to steal your soda, they’ll be in for quite the sticky surprise. All that shaking makes the soda more likely to bubble and fizz everywhere. [4] X Research source This works best if you shake it up right before they open it, so shake the soda just before your victim comes home."

    {
      "title": "Hot glue eggs to the counter.",
      "content": "Hot glue eggs to the counter. Here’s another simple one. Find a stone countertop in your house, or a surface that hot glue won’t damage. Then, use a hot glue gun to add just a dab of hot glue to the side of an egg, then stick it to the counter. When someone goes to pick up the egg, it’ll stick and crack as they try to pull it away. Stone countertops are best, since you can more easily peel off the hot glue when you’re done. Countertops like linoleum or even wood may get damaged, though."

      "title": "Use a greeting card to add a noisy alarm to your diary.",
      "content": "Use a greeting card to add a noisy alarm to your diary. Find the loudest, most annoying musical greeting card you can—the ones that start singing or talking when you open them. Then, just tape the greeting card on the inside of the front cover of your journal, so that when someone opens it, it starts talking, and you know that someone’s snooping. It’s even better if you can get a greeting card that lets you record a message yourself, like, “Hey! Put the diary down!” When you want to open your journal yourself, just slip a finger inside and undo the tape before you open it."

      "title": "Turn off the hot water in the shower.",
      "content": "Turn off the hot water in the shower. This is a quick and easy in-the-moment booby trap. If someone you want to prank is taking a hot shower, run over and turn the hot water off, so that they’re blasted with frigid water. Just be sure you’re far away by the time they realize what’s happened."

      "content": "Install a motion-sensing noise alarm to your front door. These days, basic noise alarms are common and cheap. Usually, these adhere to your door or door frame and are armed with the push of a button. Then, when someone opens the door, they make a loud noise that alerts you to intruders. They’re a simple and practical solution to home security. Installation and operating instructions vary by model, so consult your alarm's instructions included in the box. Or, check out our more detailed guide on making a DIY alarm ."

      "title": "Install a video doorbell for a more high-tech solution.",
      "content": "Install a video doorbell for a more high-tech solution. Police captain Sgt Jaeger says a visible security camera goes a long way toward deterring intruders. Video doorbells like Ring offer a little more security, with a video feed that you access on your phone. If someone makes unwanted visits, the doorbell will alert you, and also record the event. They’re relatively cheap and easy to install. Ring doorbells are often mounted near your door with screws or adhesive. Consult the included installation instructions."

      "content": "Avoid violent booby traps for home intruders. While it might seem like more aggressive or dangerous traps are the best way to deter burglars and other criminals, the reality is that you might be held responsible if they do end up hurting someone, as demonstrated by a number of court cases related to booby traps. [5] X Research source Sgt. Jaeger reminds us that often, a visible camera is enough to get thieves to leave you alone."

      "title": "You could be held responsible for any injuries or damage.",
      "content": "You could be held responsible for any injuries or damage. If you’re just setting up a harmless prank that won’t hurt anyone, you’re in the clear. But if you’re trying to defend your home with more aggressive force, like blunt force, automated weapon traps, or hazardous chemicals, you might want to think twice. In some cases, people who used violent booby traps were taken to court or arrested for harming another person or their property. [6] X Research source If you do want to set up your own home security , it’s best to hire a professional service or to only use non-violent traps, like noise makers."

      "content": "They’re called that because only a fool, or “booby,” would fall for them. A “booby” is a someone who’s dumb or stupid. [7] X Research source So a “booby trap” is a trap that will work on someone who’s stupid, or at least not prepared to be fooled by a trap. Booby traps were famously used during the Vietnam war, when Vietcong soldiers set up various traps that often worked against enemy troops, who weren’t used to navigating the Vietnamese landscape.
