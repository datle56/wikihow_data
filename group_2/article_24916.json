      "content": "Rodents are crafty, and can squeeze through very small openings. In fact, mice can wiggle through a blueberry-sized hole, and rats can fit through a cherry-sized opening. Scour both the inside and outside of your home, looking for any gaps and holes a rodent could possibly fit through. Stuff any small gaps or holes with steel wool and caulk. Then, cover up any larger holes and openings with metal sheeting, cement or lath screen. Inside, rodents tend to sneak in near cabinets, appliances, closets, fireplaces, doors, pipes, vents, basements, attics, crawl spaces, and drains. Outside, these crafty critters can enter through windows, doors, foundation gaps, the roof, attic vents, crawl space vents, and holes for utility services, like plumbing, cable, gas, or electricity."

      "content": "Store your food in thick, sturdy containers. Experts suggest transferring your food to thick, plastic or metal bins with secure lids. If you live on a farm or with pets, move any pet food or animal feed to sturdy, secure containers. Always pour old pet or animal food back into the original container; this way, rodents won’t get a free snack."

      "title": "Trash cans, grills, and compost piles can attract rodents.",
      "content": "Trash cans, grills, and compost piles can attract rodents. Switch to trash cans made with thick plastic or metal and place a secure lid on top, so rodents can’t get in. Then, move any compost bins at least 100 ft (30 m) away from your home, so rodents aren’t as tempted to sneak in. If you grill outside pretty frequently, clean up any food scraps or crumbs once you’re done cooking. If you feed your pets outside, bring the food and water dishes inside for the night. Pour out any leftover water, and transfer the leftover food into the original food bag."

      "content": "Vines and branches can offer easy access to your home. Cut back any vines, branches, and other growths that are especially close to your home. [1] X Research source While you’re at it, clear away any mounds of junk or trash around your home, and move any firewood stacks at least 18 in (46 cm) off the ground. Then, trim any bushes, shrubs, or tall grasses near your home, as rodents may hang out there. [2] X Research source If you’re getting rid of any old furniture or appliances, place them far away from your home. Rodents may build a nest in these items."

      "content": "Snap traps are a quick, efficient way to kill rodents. Arrange the trap along the wall, so the spring and metal form a T-shape. Rodents like to stay near the walls, and are more likely to stumble into a trap this way. Follow the directions provided with your snap trap and add a bait that will tempt the rodents to come over. Peanut butter, bacon, apple, sausage, nuts, fish, and pumpkin seeds are all great bait options. [4] X Research source Stay away from glue traps, if possible. These traps are very inhumane and traumatizing for the rodents, and may cause them to urinate and poop. Rodent feces and urine can carry diseases, so this definitely isn’t ideal."

      "content": "Rodents hate ultrasonic sounds. When set up, these devices give off an unpleasant ultrasonic sound that may deter rodents. These devices work great to keep mice out of your home, but they don’t work for a very long distance. Your pets can also hear these devices, so they might not be the best option if you have some other furry friends at home.

Then, mop the floors with a bleach solution and wipe down your counters with disinfectant wipes. If needed, steam clean any soiled carpets or furniture, and wash any contaminated bedding in a hot water cycle. To make a diluted bleach mixture, combine 1 part bleach with 10 parts water."
