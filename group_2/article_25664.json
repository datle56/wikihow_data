      "content": "Obtain the equipment to lead your horse. You will need a few tools to lead your horse: halter, lead rope, gloves, and dressage whip. The halter will fit snugly yet comfortably on your horse’s head, and the lead the rope will attach to the halter. The gloves are useful to protect your hands from rope burns and/or irritation. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source The dressage whip is a semi-rigid rod that is about 36 to 44 inches (91 to 110 cm) in length. The semi-rigidness will prevent the horse from experiencing painful or bothersome pokes from the whip. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Lead ropes come in different materials. Cotton lead ropes can be more forgiving on your hands (if you are not wearing gloves), [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source but may rot or mildew if stored when wet. Polypropylene lead ropes have several advantages, including being soft and flexible and easy to grip. [6] X Research source Nylon lead ropes are also available. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Choose a lead rope that is about 8 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) long. A rope halter with a rope crown snap is useful when teaching a horse to yield to pressure. Pressure is sometimes needed when leading a horse.

Holding the unbuckled halter in your left hand, stand on your horse’s left side and slowly guide your right hand over his neck to guide his head toward you. With your right hand, slowly guide the halter’s nosepiece over your horse’s muzzle and the headstall over and behind his ears.

[11] X Research source Secure the halter. Keep in mind that halters have different ways of being secured (e.g., buckles, snaps, clips). [12] X Research source Talk to your horse in a reassuring voice as you are placing the halter on him.

You should be to fit two fingers easily and snugly between your horse and the noseband. [14] X Research source Adjust the halter accordingly if it fits too tightly or too loosely. Your horse may signal his discomfort if the halter is too tight on his head or behind his ears."

      "content": "Stand on your horse’s left side. A horse’s left side is the customary position to lead a horse. You can stand so that you are either even with your horse’s head or about halfway between his head and shoulder. Stand about 12 inches (30 cm) away from your horse. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Leading a horse is possible from the lead (in front of your horse) or drive positions (behind your horse’s withers), but is not as safe as standing by your horse’s side."

      "content": "Apply pressure with your lead rope. An important aspect of leading your horse is teaching him how to yield his hindquarters from a standstill. To begin, face your horse’s left side. With the lead rope in your left hand, apply even pressure with the lead rope to get your horse to turn his head turns towards you. Teaching your horse to yield his hindquarters is important because he may have the tendency to do a partial halt when being led: stopping his front legs while moving his hindquarters in a quarter circle. [19] X Research source A full halt is when your horse can yield both his front and hindquarters."

      "content": "Lead your horse through a narrow opening. Narrow openings, such as a stall door, can be dangerous to move through with your horse. He may be reluctant to move forward because the inside of the area looks different from the outside. This reluctance may lead to bolting or extreme resistance, both of which could injure you. To safely lead your horse through a narrow opening, it is advisable for you to walk through the opening first, then let your horse walk through when he is calm. [36] X Research source Make sure to quickly move to the side of the opening after you move through and before you cue your horse to move forward. This will prevent your horse from crowding you as he walks through the opening."

      "content": "Lead your horse through a swing gate. A swing gate is wider than a stall door. However, you will still need to control your horse as he moves through it. While leading your horse from his left side, approach the gate with as much room as possible to open the gate. Unlatch the gate with one hand while keeping a firm hold on your horse’s lead rope with your other hand. Open the gate widely enough for you and your horse to walk through easily. Your horse should not have to back up and reposition to get through the gate. Make sure to swing the gate closed when you and your horse have gone through it to prevent other animals from entering through the gate. Do not walk in front of the horse when walking through the gate. Horses tend to move quickly through openings, and he may injure you if he moves quickly when you are in front of him."
