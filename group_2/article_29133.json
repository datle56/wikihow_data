      "title": "Choose a bread for your sandwich.",
      "content": "Choose a bread for your sandwich. The classic choice for a grilled cheese is a fluffy, white bread, but if you're a little more health-conscious, go for a whole grain or flax bread. Otherwise, just follow your taste buds—from pumpernickel to sourdough, there is no wrong answer. Avoid bread with large air bubbles or holes, as your cheese may melt right through and drip out.

      "title": "Use dry, day-old bread if you have it.",
      "content": "Use dry, day-old bread if you have it. Since the moisture in fresh bread makes it soggy (unlike a hot oven, a microwave won't evaporate the moisture, which would allow it to get crispy), a dry piece of bread will fare much better in a microwave. [2] X Research source Always check old bread for mold, just to be safe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use sliced sandwich bread if possible.",
      "content": "Use sliced sandwich bread if possible. Each slice of pre-sliced bread will have the same thickness, which means they will toast evenly. If you are buying an unsliced loaf from a bakery, ask if they can slice it for you. Most bakeries, and bakery departments at grocery stores, have a bread slicer. If you slice the bread by hand, use a serrated bread knife and try to cut the slices about 3/4 of an inch thick. Bread at this thickness will fit in a standard toaster and be thin enough for the microwave heat to penetrate. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a cheese that melts easily.",
      "content": "Pick a cheese that melts easily. American and Cheddar are the go-to cheeses for a grilled cheese, but you can branch out with cheeses like Monterey Jack, Gruyere, Munster, Gouda, or Brie, as they all melt smoothly. Avoid fresh, crumbly or very hard, aged cheeses, including fresh goat cheese, Feta, and aged Parmesan. These cheeses just don't melt well when they are the main cheese in a sandwich. A very hard cheese like Parmesan will melt smoothly if you grate it and pair it with a melter, like Cheddar. The moisture in the Cheddar will help the Parmesan melt better. If you can't resist those hard-to-melt cheeses, you can still add them to your sandwich for the taste (like you would add pickles or a tomato). Just make sure you also have plenty of cheese that melts easily, like Havarti or American. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider adding extra ingredients to your sandwich.",
      "content": "Consider adding extra ingredients to your sandwich. Pickles, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, even potato chips—get creative with additional fillings if you want to branch out from the classic cheese-and-bread-only sandwich. [6] X Research source Up your protein intake with a few slices of ham, turkey, or other deli meat. Just wipe off extra moisture before putting it on your sandwich. [7] X Research source Remember that ingredients with additional moisture—like tomatoes—might make your sandwich a little soggy. Enjoy your sandwich with a side of mustard, ketchup, sriracha, or tomato soup."

      "title": "Toast both slices of bread in a toaster until golden brown.",
      "content": "Toast both slices of bread in a toaster until golden brown. If you are unsure of the settings on your toaster, try turning the dial to the medium, or middle setting. That way if your bread is a little under-toasted, you can pop it back in at the lowest setting to crisp it up. [8] X Research source The drier the toast, the better. You will be adding moisture back into the bread when you microwave it with the cheese and butter. Too much moisture can make your sandwich soggy. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Butter one side of each slice of toast.",
      "content": "Butter one side of each slice of toast. You can butter both sides, but you run the risk of adding too much moisture and ending up with a steamed, soft sandwich. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the cheese and any additional ingredients between the two slices of toast.",
      "content": "Place the cheese and any additional ingredients between the two slices of toast. The dry, unbuttered side of the bread should be touching the cheese, with the buttered side on the outside. Two slices of cheese at about 3/4oz (or about 1.5oz total) is usually plenty of cheese. Make sure the cheese is evenly distributed across the bread so it melts evenly. You can tear slices into smaller pieces to make them fit. Don't pile your sandwich too high with extras. Microwave heat can't penetrate very deep--only about 1-1 1/2 inches--so a fat sandwich may not heat all the way through and your cheese might not melt. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap the sandwich in a paper towel and place on a microwave-safe plate or rack. The paper towel will absorb the excess moisture, keeping your bread from getting too soggy. [12] X Research source Don't wrap the sandwich in plastic wrap, as this traps moisture instead of absorbing it. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Microwave between 15-20 seconds, or until the cheese is melted. [14] X Research source The time it takes to melt will vary depending on the microwave. If you see the cheese begin to drip out of the sides, the sandwich should be done. You can also see if the cheese is melted by trying to lift the top slice of bread. If the cheese is fully melted, the bread will stick together and be difficult to separate."

      "content": "Place your crisper pan (or browning dish) in the microwave and follow the manufacturer's instructions to pre-heat. A crisper pan is made from microwave-safe metal that becomes extremely hot and works the same as a griddle or pan you would heat up on the stove. It will brown and crisp your bread, just like if you made your sandwich in a frying pan. [18] X Research source To get the griddle-effect, a crisper pan must become extremely hot during the preheating process. Only use it with adult supervision and never, ever touch it with your bare hands. Use heat-proof oven mitts to handle the crisper. [19] X Research source Follow the manufacturers directions about where to place the pan. It may have to sit on the floor of the microwave or may have built-in legs that lift it closer to the grill on the ceiling of the machine. Do not put anything on the crisper pan until it has pre-heated."

If your bread doesn't appear to be browning, try adding more time in 5-second increments. Remember, the bread that is touching the pan is the side that will be getting crisp, so you may not be able to tell until you flip it over. [21] X Research source"

Press the sandwich with the spatula on either side to add crispiness. [22] X Research source Be very careful no part of your skin comes in contact with the pan. If it is easier, first remove the pan with oven mitts, then flip the sandwich and return the pan to the microwave."
