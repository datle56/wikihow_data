This saves both of you from being all over each other in public. Even if you feel okay about that, he might not. Try out these excuses: \"I just saw the funniest drink name at the bar. Come see!\" \"I really need to step out for some air. Want to come with?\" \"I actually brought that hat of yours. It's in my car. If you walk to my car with me, I can grab it and finally give it back.\""
