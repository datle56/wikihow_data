      "content": "Select a humidifier for your room size. There are a number of humidifiers available. To humidify your room, the most important thing is getting one that is an appropriate capacity for the room in which you want it. Look on the box to check the square footage or square meter rating for the humidifier. Invest in a model that most closely matches your room’s size. [1] X Research source A humidifier’s size rating might not exactly match your room, but you want to buy the closest size possible. For example, if your room is 500 square feet, opt for a humidifier that covers up to 600 square feet. Going too small could leave your room too dry. Generally, a compact humidifier or tabletop humidifier will work in most bedrooms, while a tower humidifier will work in an office, living room, or other shared spaces."

Typically, you will need to connect your reservoir to the base, add the filter, and add any additional components such as wheels. Typically, you won't need any tools to assemble your humidifier, but this could vary from model to model. Be sure to keep the humidifier on a flat surface when you're using it, and monitor the humidity in the room so you'll know when to turn it off.

      "content": "Minimize your use of heated appliances. Your dryer and your oven both dry out the air in the room around them. So do appliances like space heaters. Take a look at your room and see if there are any heated appliances that could be sucking out the moisture. If you find any, aim to use them less. [11] X Research source If an oven is the problem, consider trying something like meal prep where you only have to use it once or twice a week. If a dryer is the problem, try line-drying your clothes, or tumble drying on a no-heat setting. Avoid using small beauty tools like hair dryers and flat irons in the room you’re trying to humidify."

Place a few bowls of water around the perimeter of the room you want to humidify and leave them there to allow the moisture to evaporate into the air. [14] X Research source If you have a radiator, you could place a ceramic or glass bowl of water on top to heat up the water and speed up the evaporation process. Placing the bowls in direct sunlight can also help."
