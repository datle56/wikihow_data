Symptoms are pain, swelling, bruising, limited mobility and a “popping” sound when the injury occurred. The sprain is temporary and tissues are not permanently damaged. Sprains usually improve in just a few days. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"

      "title": "Check for symptoms of bursitis.",
      "content": "Check for symptoms of bursitis. Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, which are small pouches of fluid that sit over joints to protect them. Normally the amount of fluid in the bursa is very small, but with injury it can swell up and become very painful causing bursitis. It usually develops from repetitive movements of the arm, and the pain often improves in a few weeks. Swelling can last longer but will gradually get better as well. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source An area affected with bursitis will be swollen or red and will likely hurt when you press on it. Cases of bursitis along with injuries that have broken the skin may become infected and require antibiotics."

      "content": "Consider nerve pain as the cause. The nerves in the spinal cord can become compressed, especially as you age. Symptoms include radiating pain from the neck to the arms or a feeling of pins and needles. Pain can fluctuate from day to day but usually improves with non-prescription painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and exercise. A trapped nerve can happen in the arm as well. If it happens in the wrist, it is referred to as carpal tunnel syndrome, and when it happens in the elbow, cubital tunnel syndrome. Symptoms usually include pain and tingling in the affected arm or hand."

When you use your arm or hands to do tasks regularly, such as at manufacturing, manual handling, heavy machinery and computer jobs, RSI can occur. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one type of nerve injury that can result from repetitive motion like typing. Employers can improve conditions and modify your workspace to help prevent aggravating your condition by, for example, offering an adjustable chair or moving your work platform so that you don’t have to reach up as high.

Be careful not to wrap your arm too tightly to avoid swelling around the wrapped area. Always loosen bandages that become too tight. [8] X Research source Numbness, tingling, an increase in pain, coolness or swelling around the bandage are all signs that your wrap is too tight. Talk to your provider if you have to use a wrap for more than 48-72 hours."

If you make the same arm movements often throughout the day, then you should consider finding other ways to move your arms to avoid RSI. It is sometimes necessary to have a professional evaluate your arm movements at work or while performing other actions to ensure they aren't problematic. Always make sure that the equipment you are using to exercise or do sports with are correct for your ability level and size. Call your human resources department at work to discuss modifications, other ways of performing job tasks or about getting another position within the company if what you are doing is causing sore muscles, tendons or joints."

Grab the wrist of the bent arm with the other hand and pull it down toward your back. Repeat with the opposite arm. Stretch your biceps by clasping your hands together behind your back and straightening your elbows. Bend forward, moving your clasped hands toward the ceiling. You can stretch your shoulders by putting one arm across the chest and using the opposite arm to grab your forearm. Gently pull the arm toward your back shoulder. Repeat with the other side. To stretch your wrists, cross your hands together to form a cross. Push down with the top hand, so your wrist flexes. Repeat with the other hand. [16] X Research source"
