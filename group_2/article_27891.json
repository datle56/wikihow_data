      "content": "Soak the prunes for 30 minutes or until they're soft. Leave the bowl of prunes to soak at room temperature until they soften and absorb most of the water. They should swell a little too. If the prunes were very dry, they may need to soak longer."

To get all of the juice, push against the strainer with the back of a spoon.

You may prefer to drink the juice in the morning before you leave your house if you think you'll need to pass stool. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you'd like your prune juice sweeter, stir in honey according to your taste. If you'll be giving the juice to a baby under 12 months, avoid using honey because of the risk of botulism. You can store extra prune juice in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
