Make sure you paint the boots in an open space with painters cloth on any items you do not want to be painted red. Mix the paint with one part paint and one part water in a bowl. Use a paintbrush to apply one coat of paint to the boats. Do two to three coats total, allowing the paint to only partially dry between coats. To prevent the leather from cracking, flex the leather with your hands between each coat of paint. Do not let the paint dry fully between coats, as this will cause the paint to crack."
