      "title": "Talk with them about your boyfriend.",
      "content": "Talk with them about your boyfriend. Instead of hiding the fact that you’re seeing someone, discuss with your parents about your boyfriend when the relationship becomes more serious. Tell them more about him, and how long you’ve been dating. Open communication with your parents will likely feel better and healthier for you in the long run. If you are fearful that they will disapprove, be calm and polite. Focus on showing them why he is a good fit for you, and what you like about him. Explain how your relationship will not interfere with your work, life, or school."

      "title": "Listen to their perspective.",
      "content": "Listen to their perspective. While hearing that they don’t like your boyfriend may be tough, give them a chance to explain themselves. Have them provide clarity about why he’s a bad fit for you. While you may not like what your parents have to say, sometimes it comes from a place of wisdom. [1] X Research source Ask them why they have an issue with your boyfriend. Are they worried that your boyfriend doesn’t respect you? Are they concerned about the way he talks to you? Do they think that he’s controlling? If this is the case, these may be serious concerns to consider."

      "title": "Avoid being immediately defensive.",
      "content": "Avoid being immediately defensive. While you may want to talk back to your parents, and provide criticism about their choices, this will not help you get any closer to having your parents like your boyfriend. Being overly defensive will likely make them even less approving of your relationship with him. [2] X Research source Avoid putting your parents down or stating that their views are wrong. Tell them that you love them. Explain that you came to them for support rather than judgment. Focus on being calm even if they make you upset."

      "title": "Respond to their concerns with respect.",
      "content": "Respond to their concerns with respect. Your parents or family history may be rooted in certain traditions or norms. It may seem like they are outdated in their views or don’t understand your perspective. While there may be differences, focus on keeping a positive relationship with them. [3] X Research source Even if you and your parents disagree, that doesn’t mean you should be rude and disrespectful of their concerns. If you are kind, mature, and respectful, they are more likely to take your relationship seriously, and try to find the positives in your boyfriend."

      "title": "Prep your boyfriend about expectations.",
      "content": "Prep your boyfriend about expectations. Before introducing your boyfriend to your family, provide him with your family’s possible expectations.

[4] X Research source Avoid blindsiding your boyfriend about how your parents may act. Provide him with reassurance. Teach him ways to win your parents over. Good manners in particular will help. Consider asking him to dress up for the first meeting with your parents. Tell your boyfriend to avoid cursing or crude language that could bother your parents. Tell your boyfriend what to call your parents, such as Mr. and Mrs. Smith or by their first names if less formal. Reader Poll: We asked 1307 wikiHow readers how they usually dress for a first meeting with their partner's parents, and only 6% of them said they like to wear something that makes a statement . [Take Poll] This may be too bold for most people, who prefer to wear something that’s put together, comfortable, and represents them in the best way possible."

      "title": "Have introductions in low pressure settings.",
      "content": "Have introductions in low pressure settings. When you and your boyfriend meet up with your parents, make the settings less awkward or uncomfortable. Find ways for your boyfriend to meet your parents well before a big family gathering or a holiday dinner. Make the interactions seem natural between your boyfriend and your parents, rather than awkward, big events. [5] X Research source Have opportunities for you and your boyfriend to meet your parents at home or at a family dinner on a Sunday night. Consider having your parents meet you and your boyfriend at a neutral place like a shopping mall or a restaurant. The interactions between your boyfriend and your parents don’t have to be long, but should help to put both sides more at ease."

      "title": "Avoid taking sides.",
      "content": "Avoid taking sides. You may feel torn between your parents and your boyfriend. But it’s not about who’s right or who’s wrong. It about reconstructing each side’s ideas about each other. Focus on being understanding. [6] X Research source Tell you parents that ultimatums will likely be less helpful than having your parents get know your boyfriend. Find ways to see compromise as a benefit for them and your boyfriend. Remind your parents that you love them, and you’re not trying to hurt them with your choice of boyfriend."

It may simply take time for them to feel more comfortable. Make your boyfriend feel welcome at your home or in your life. Provide your boyfriend with reassurance that your parents may change their minds with time."
