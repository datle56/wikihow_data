[5] X Research source For instance, if you’re at a coffee shop, you might say, “I always get the same vanilla latte. What’s your drink order? I’m thinking of mixing it up.” Some women might not want to be approached in public, which is fine. If the girl you’re talking to isn’t responding or looks uncomfortable, don’t push it."

Try to avoid looking down and crossing your arms, since that signals you don’t want to talk to anyone. If you like a girl, try using your body language to flirt with her. Look into her eyes a little longer than you normally would, lean in closer to her, or touch her on the arm or elbow, for instance. [7] X Research source [v161073_b01]. 13 December 2018."
