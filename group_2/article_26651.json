      "content": "Lubrication is great in these scenarios: Your keyboard has tactile or linear switches. These switches benefit the most from lubricant, since these are the type where you might want deeper sounds and less friction. The sound while typing is too high-pitched and you want lower, deeper-sounding shocks and clacks. Your mechanical keyboard typing experience seems too pingy or crunchy. Lubrication can reduce these qualities. Typing feels rough or scratchy as you press down the keys. Applying lube can help the keys slide past their component parts better."

Lubricants may interfere with the optical sensing, depending on your model. If you decide to lube optical switches, look into how your keys function to avoid blocking the optical sensors."

      "title": "Choose your lubricant.",
      "content": "Choose your lubricant. There are several lubricants available specifically made for keyboard switches. While shopping for a lubricant, keep viscosity in mind. More viscosity is good for linear (red) switches, but can make tactile (brown) switches less tactile. Less viscosity is a great choice for reducing roughness without decreasing tactility too much. You can always go with a medium level viscosity if you’re not quite sure what to pick!"

Press the switch after reassembling it and reattaching it to the keyboard to assess whether you need to add more. The key areas for application are where the lower housing and stem make contact.
