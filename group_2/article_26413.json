      "content": "Choose a trendier hairstyle that suits your face. A new haircut is a great way to appear younger. If your hair is on the longer side, a side-part quaff or slick can be a great way to update your hair without looking like you’re trying too hard. If your hair is shorter or you’re partially balding, the high and tight is a strong, simple choice. [1] X Research source If you’re balding and your hairline has receded dramatically, try leaning into it and just shaving your head. If it looks like a conscious choice to shave your head, you won’t look like you’re trying to cover anything up! When choosing a new cut, pay attention to the shape of your face. A big, frizzy cut won’t work well with a longer face, while slicking back your hair may be a mistake if you’ve got a rectangular head."

However, keep your clothes age-appropriate by staying away from items that are clearly designed for people more than 10 years older than you are. [4] X Research source You don’t want to buy clothes that are way too young for you. If you’re in your forties and buy clothes based on teenage trends, you’re going to look like you’re trying too hard. For business attire, some thinner, cooler ties are a great way to stand out as youthful and modern. When it comes to headwear, stay away from visors and low-profile baseball hats. These are typically associated with an older crowd. Journal to keep track of what outfits made you feel the best."
