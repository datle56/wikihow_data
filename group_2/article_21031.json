You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

      "content": "Inspire her with words of wisdom from others. Not sure what to say? Try sending your loved one a motivating and deep quote from spiritual leaders and other notable figures: “Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone—we find it with another.” —Thomas Merton “Let nothing disturb you, nothing frighten you, all things are passing, God is unchanging. Patience gains all; nothing is lacking to those who have God: God alone is sufficient.” —St. Teresa of Avila “Be fervent in God, and let nothing grieve you, whatever you encounter.” —Hadewijch “If the only prayer you said was thank you, that would be enough.” —Meister Eckhart “Somewhere in those depths of silence I came upon my first experiences of God as a loving presence that was always near, and prayer as a simple trust in that presence.” —Cynthia Bourgeault “You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope.” —Thomas Merton “Even if you do the best you can in all things, your human nature must often fall short; so entrust yourself to God's goodness, for his goodness is greater than your failures.” —Hadewijch “Spirituality is not to be learned by flight from the world, or by running away from things, or by turning solitary and going apart from the world. Rather, we must learn an inner solitude wherever or with whomsoever we may be. We must learn to penetrate things and find God there.” —Meister Eckhart “God will bring people and events into our lives, and whatever we may think about them, they are designed for the evolution of His life in us.” —Thomas Keating “Faith does not need to push the river because faith is able to trust that there is a river. The river is flowing. We are in it.” —Richard Rohr “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” —C. S. Lewis “For human beings, the most daunting challenge is to become fully human. For to become fully human is to become fully divine.” —Thomas Keating “The shortest distance between a problem and a solution is the distance between your knees and the floor.” —Charles Stanley “Christ has no body now on earth but yours, no hands but yours, no feet but yours. Yours are the eyes through which to look out Christ's compassion to the world. Yours are the feet with which he is to go about doing good. Yours are the hands with which he is to bless men now.” —St. Teresa of Avila “You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.” —C. S. Lewis “There’s a place in the soul where you’ve never been wounded.” —Meister Eckhart “Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.” —C. S. Lewis “The people who know God well—mystics, hermits, prayerful people, those who risk everything to find God—always meet a lover, not a dictator.” —Richard Rohr “It is the duty of every Christian to be Christ to his neighbor.” —Martin Luther “Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and, in fact, it is nobody's business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves and our neighbors worthy.” —Thomas Merton “Whoever possesses God in their being has Him in a divine manner, and He shines out to them in all things; for them all things taste of God and in all things it is God's image that they see.” —Meister Eckhart “It is love alone that gives worth to all things.” —St. Teresa of Avila"

      "content": "Trust that God will hear your prayer. “I think prayer is the foundation for any religious practice, any relationship with the divine, and our connection to our soul, and spirit,” says Woodford. Whether you share your blessing with the person or you’re praying alone to God, it’s important to go into your prayer with faith that God will hear it and that He’s watching out for you and your friend. [3] X Research source Woodford reminds us that “God is always answering your prayers, even if you don't like his answer.” So rather than approach prayer with an expectation that God will give you what you’re asking, instead approach it with the trust that He’ll give you what you need—even if it’s not what you think it is. She also emphasizes letting go and letting God, noting that if you want to pray for someone who’s going through a difficult time, you can “pray for their protection” and for the “highest good to be done,” but avoid “trying to interfere,” and instead “appeal to the Divine to support” them."

      "title": "Try to personalize your prayer.",
      "content": "Try to personalize your prayer. When you’re sharing your blessing with someone, personalizing it can make it even more meaningful. Try to tailor your prayer to the person, perhaps by referencing your relationship to them or your history together, or by referencing a specific situation they’re going through. For instance, if they’re your spouse, you might make your prayer more romantic and emphasize how grateful you are to be married to them. If they’ve got something stressful on their plate—say, an important job interview—pray that they do well and remind them you and God are on their side."

      "title": "Offer support and love.",
      "content": "Offer support and love. First and foremost, your prayer should be a way to offer love and attention to those around you. Woodford observes, “People who are filled with the Spirit—it's like they bring light [that] other people respond [to].” As it says in 1 Corinthians 13:13, “These three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.” [4] X Research source Think of your blessing as an opportunity to imbue someone with God’s grace and compassion and help them feel encouraged to face whatever life may throw their way."
