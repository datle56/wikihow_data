      "title": "Tell funny stories.",
      "content": "Tell funny stories. Sometimes, the funniest thing you can do is tell a funny story. Jokes are great, too, but your audience will likely find that something that actually happened to you will be a little more humorous. Think of a few funny things that have happened to you and tell those stories when appropriate. [1] X Research source For instance, perhaps your friend group starts discussing coffee shops. You might say something like, “Oh no. Never again. The last time I went to a coffee shop, the barista poured hot coffee all over my pants. And yes...it got in my underpants.”"

      "title": "Keep your stories concise.",
      "content": "Keep your stories concise. When telling a joke or funny story, get to the point. People have short-attention spans in general, but they are even shorter for jokes. Keep your story quick, to the point, and hilarious. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make the end funny.",
      "content": "Make the end funny. When trying to surprise your friends or coworkers with a funny story or joke, put the surprise at the end. This will keep them on the edge of their seat and ensure they don’t laugh until you’re finished with your sentence. [3] X Research source You might say “And do you know what was in my car when I opened the door, Rebecca? A cat!” This will be funnier than saying “And, Rebecca, a cat was in my car when I opened the door!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use exaggeration.",
      "content": "Use exaggeration. When telling a funny story, it’s okay to exaggerate sometimes for comedic effect. Make sure, though, that you exaggerate wildly so your audience knows you’re not telling the truth; they’ll still laugh! [4] X Research source For instance, you might say, “Yeah, the steaks at that new place are MASSIVE. They’re bigger than my first apartment!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Swap out dull words for funnier ones.",
      "content": "Swap out dull words for funnier ones. Some words are just funnier than others; use that to your advantage. These words often allow for more emphasis than do words that are more monotone. One example of this is the word “Pop-Tart”, which sounds funnier than just saying “breakfast.” [5] X Research source Other examples are using “underpants” instead of “underwear.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make fun of yourself.",
      "content": "Make fun of yourself. Sometimes the funniest thing you can do is poke fun at yourself. Think about it - you probably do some hilarious things on a daily basis that nobody knows about but you! Share those things with others and laugh with them. [6] X Research source For instance, maybe you’re a neat freak, but you left a dish in the sink this morning. You might tell a coworker, “I’m so stressed out right now! I’m such a clean freak and I left a dish in the sink this morning. Is this the first step to becoming a hoarder?!”"

      "title": "Find at least one funny joke or story you can tell.",
      "content": "Find at least one funny joke or story you can tell. Identify some funny story, event, or joke that can work in any situation and with any group.

Chances are you’ll get caught, and you’ll look like you’re trying too hard. For instance, use a funny story about your friends, family, or yourself. [7] X Research source"
