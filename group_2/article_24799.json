      "content": "Buy about 10–20 pounds (4.5–9.1 kg) for a 40 quarts (38 L) ice chest. You can buy dry ice at most grocery stores for about $1.00-$3.00 USD per pound (0.45kg). Dry ice evaporates at a rate of about 5–10 pounds (2.3–4.5 kg) a day, so if you get it too far in advance, there won’t be any left. [1] X Research source Dry ice usually comes in 10 by 2 inches (25.4 cm × 5.1 cm) squares weighing about 10 pounds (4.5 kg). You'll need one square for every 15 inches (38 cm) of cooler length. [2] X Research source You can make your own dry ice by spraying a CO2 fire extinguisher into a pillowcase for 2-3 seconds. Wear gloves, closed-toe shoes, and other protective gear if you try this yourself."

      "title": "Choose an insulated cooler with an air vent.",
      "content": "Choose an insulated cooler with an air vent. Since dry ice creates vapor, make sure your cooler has an air vent or a valve that allows the gas to escape. If your cooler is completely airtight, the vapor will cause pressure to build up, which can lead to an explosion. If your cooler doesn't have a valve, leave the top open slightly. [3] X Research source Plastic and styrofoam coolers are common options for storing dry ice."

      "title": "Use thick gloves to handle dry ice.",
      "content": "Use thick gloves to handle dry ice. Dry ice can “burn” your hands — although at temperatures of −109 °F (−78 °C), the burns are actually severe frostbite. Either way, don’t let your bare skin come into contact with the block of dry ice when you’re getting your ice cream out of the cooler! [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your ice cream on the bottom of the cooler.",
      "content": "Place your ice cream on the bottom of the cooler. Since cold air sinks, dry ice works best when it’s placed on top of the items that it needs to keep cool. If it’s possible, you should put your dry ice on the top of the other items in the cooler. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap your dry ice in a towel and place it in the cooler.",
      "content": "Wrap your dry ice in a towel and place it in the cooler. This will insulate the dry ice and keep it cooler longer. It will also help protect anything in the cooler from being damaged by the dry ice. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep drinks and other snacks in a separate cooler so they don’t freeze.",
      "content": "Keep drinks and other snacks in a separate cooler so they don’t freeze. Dry ice is powerful enough to freeze anything beneath it. Keeping drinks and snacks in a separate cooler from your ice cream will help ensure they don’t freeze, and it will also help prolong the life of your dry ice. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fill up all of the extra space in the cooler.",
      "content": "Fill up all of the extra space in the cooler. Empty space in the cooler will cause the dry ice to evaporate more quickly. If you don’t have enough food to place into the cooler, you can fill the cooler with regular ice or you can use fillers like towels or crumpled-up newspaper. Or just buy more ice cream! [8] X Research source Close the lid securely after filling the cooler."

      "content": "Store your cooler in the trunk if you’ll be taking your ice cream on the road. As dry ice evaporates, it turns into carbon dioxide. In a small, closed-in space like a vehicle, the carbon dioxide buildup can cause you to become light-headed and even pass out. If you don’t have room in your trunk, make sure you roll down your windows or set your air conditioner to circulate fresh air from outside. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave the dry ice at room temperature when you’re finished with it. Cleaning up dry ice is a breeze! Once you’ve finished your ice cream, just open your cooler and leave it in a well-ventilated place. The dry ice will convert to carbon dioxide and will simply dissipate into the air. Never dispose of dry ice in a sewer, sink, toilet, or garbage disposal. It can freeze and rupture the pipes, and may even lead to an explosion if the dry ice expands too quickly."

      "content": "Choose a high-quality insulated cooler. Not all coolers are created equal! Different brands use their own methods of insulation. A quality cooler from a brand like Yeti or Coleman is going to keep your ice cream from melting much more efficiently than a disposable styrofoam cooler. [10] X Research source"

If you need to, pour a bucket of ice into the cooler to chill it. When you’re ready to pack your ice cream, pour the ice out and refill the cooler with fresh ice. [11] X Research source"
