      "content": "Hang an air freshener in the car. There are many types of air fresheners that are designed specifically for cars. To pick a scent, simply find one that appeals to your sense of smell. No matter what kind you get, be sure to place it in an area that gets lots of airflow, so that the scent circulates throughout the car. Vent clip and dashboard air fresheners are meant to be clipped to or positioned over the vents. Tree-style and other air fresheners can be placed hanging from the rear view mirror. Alternatively, you can hang them under the dash. This can help get more good smells into the air circulation. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray perfume in the car. Instead of purchasing an air freshener, you can also use a few spritzes of your favorite cologne or perfume to make the inside of your car smell nice. As with the air freshener, don’t spray the liquid directly onto any of the car’s surfaces. If you have an old tree-style air freshener lying around that doesn’t have any scent left, you can spray perfume directly on this and place it back in the car."

      "content": "Place an unlit scented candle under the front seat. Scented candles come in hundreds of different smells, and there's no reason you can't use them to make your car smell nice. Look for a smaller candle that will fit under the driver or passenger seat. A tea light or votive will be a good size. Don’t use candles that are in jars, otherwise you won’t be able to smell them."

To make for a slower release of the scent, keep the box sealed and poke a couple holes in the top and sides."

      "content": "Go for a drive with the windows down. Sometimes a smell gets into your car and just won’t leave, and the first thing you can do is try to force the smell out. Pick a warm day, and make sure you don’t have any papers or garbage in the car that could fly out while you're driving. If you don’t want to drive around with the windows open, leave the car in the driveway with the windows down and the doors open on a windy day, and hopefully some of the smell will blow out.

The right cleaner will depend on what kind of stain you're dealing with: [7] X Research source Tackle mold and mildew with disinfectant sprays. Address bodily fluids (such as vomit) and food stains with bio-enzymatic cleaners. For really powerful smells—think skunk—use an oxidizing cleaner."

Then do the passenger seat, followed by the back seats, the dash, the floors, the mats, and any remaining surfaces.

It can be easy to forget that sandwich in the back seat, or the cereal that spilled the other day, or the leftover apple in the cup holder, but always make an effort to remember to clean these things from your car daily.
