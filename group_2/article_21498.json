Though your facial hair may grow quite quickly, it may take several weeks to over a month to grow in fully, depending on the type of mustache you want to sport, and the speed that your beard grows in. It can take a while, so try not to rush it. [1] X Research source Contrary to popular belief, trimming your beard regularly does not cause it to grow back thicker. You can use some basic good health techniques to promote facial hair growth to speed up the process. Maintaining a diet high in protein, saturated fat, and Vitamins A, E, and C, getting enough exercise and rest, and keeping your face clean and well-groomed can help promote facial hair growth in men."

If you want to avoid some initial awkwardness, consider growing out all your facial hair first and then trimming the rest of the beard off when the mustache is thicker, or progressively trim everything except your mustache to make the transition less abrupt.

      "content": "Invest in a good quality trimmer. Any time you're sculpting facial hair, it's a good idea to invest in a beard trimmer to make the job easier. It's easier to shape your mustache accurately with an electric trimmer than with a basic razor you'd use to take all the hair off completely. Usually, you can get a decent rechargeable beard trimmer for $15-40. They typically come with various guard shapes and size options."

      "content": "Trim what you don't want. Most basic mustaches extend just about down to the sides of the mouth, leaving the hair atop the lip untouched. All it takes to shape a basic mustache is shaving off any facial hair you don't want. This usually means everything on your cheeks, under and along your jaw, and around your mouth, except your top lip. [3] X Research source After trimming the basic shape you want, leave your mustache alone. Shave or continue trimming the other areas of your facial hair growth regularly to keep your mustache standing out above the rest of the hair in your beard."

      "content": "Keep your mustache clean. Growing a mustache can be an itchy process, but washing and cleaning your face and mustache regularly can help keep that itch at bay. Wash and condition your mustache hairs (even if theyâ€™re short) 2 to 3 times a week. This will help your hair and skin stay soft and healthy. [4] X Research source Choose a shampoo and conditioner that matches your skin and hair needs. If you have sensitive skin, opt for products that are allergen-friendly. If you have dry skin, look for moisturizing products. Having facial hair can keep your natural body oils and dirt trapped against your skin, which may lead to breakouts, which is why it's important to keep your facial hair clean and well-groomed."

      "content": "Keep the ends trimmed. Although some mustache devotees argue about the merits of trimming, your mustache may need grooming every so often. Certain mustaches will require more work than others. But a combination of washing, waxing, combing, trimming, or shaving will most probably be part of your regiment every day if you want your fully grown mustache to live a full, well-worn life. Depending on your mustache, trim it with scissors every day to once a week. After a month of trimming the mustache weekly, you should have a pretty good idea of how much facial hair to chop off each time you trim."

      "content": "Shape your mustache . Some mustache styles involve a bit of training and a lot of wax, while others can be kept in place with a comb. If you're building a bountiful handlebar or a polished pencil, you'll probably need to comb, twist, trim, and even shave every day to keep your particular style looking good. After you wash your face or get out of the shower, apply a bit of mustache wax to the middle of your mustache with a finger. Next, lightly work the wax outwards, covering your entire mustache. Then, use a comb to get the 'stache fully saturated. To comb a mustache, use a beard comb, which should be smaller and with finer teeth. Add a small dab of natural beard oil to wet the tiny teeth of the comb, which will help lubricate the hairs and train them into place. Start combing at your philtrum (the cleft under your nose), combing outward toward the corner of your lip and down."

      "content": "Try out a shorter style. Shorter mustache styles are best for men with very coarse, thick, and dark hair. Since the style and the hair will be short, these styles will show up better the thicker and coarser the hair. Try out the following short mustache styles: The pencil : Famously sprouted by John Waters (and innumerable silent film villains), a pencil mustache looks as if it were drawn thinly on top of the lip with a make-up pencil. To trim one, follow your upper lip line with a trimmer, carefully removing the hair between your nose and your lip until a thin line is left. The mustache should end at the corner of your upper lip or just beyond. [6] X Research source The fu manchu : This classic features a slim pencil-like mustache that starts at the upper lip but continues down the sides of your face until reaching the bottom of your jaw, and sometimes beyond, just like a stereotypical Chinese philosopher. [7] X Research source The boxcar : A boxcar is a fairly simple mustache, but one that ends just a bit before you reach the corner of your lip. To trim it, leave your mustache alone, but trim a straight line perpendicular to the corner of your lip so the hair ends just before it. It should look like a perfect rectangle.

      "content": "Try out a longer style. If you want to try out a bushier, burlier mustache, it usually works best with generally straight hair that's still somewhat coarse. Thin hair can grow long but won't bush up and might hang over your lip. If you've got the right kind of hair for it, consider the following longer mustaches: The English, Imperial or Handlebar : An English-style mustache is your ticket to looking like you stepped out of a Victorian novel. For this style, stop trimming your mustache just above the corner of your mouth and let it grow out to a point. Then, twirl the longer hairs at the corner up into a curl using mustache wax . [9] X Research source The Walrus : A walrus is a mustache for outdoorsmen, rhinoceros hunters, and men who know how to throw tomahawks. Think Theodore Roosevelt. To grow a walrus, do absolutely nothing but shave your cheeks, leaving your mustache alone. [10] X Research source The Selleck : Named for the famous TV personality Tom Selleck, this mustache is also known in some quarters as the \"pornstar.\" Shaped essentially like a walrus, pointing down at the corners gently, the Selleck is full from lip to nose but trimmed to avoid hanging over your lip."

      "content": "Experiment with combo styles. While it might be cool to slap silly names on mustache styles, the truth is that growing a mustache is largely about getting creative in the mirror with your beard trimmer. If it looks good to you, it's not wrong. Try combinations of the following the next time you shave to see what works. You can always shave it off. Goatees or circle beards are like fu manchus or handlebar mustaches that connect on the chin. Just shave your cheeks and under your neck. Mutton chops connected directly to the mustache give you a vaudevillian or Civil War vibe. [11] X Research source Try a straight mustache with some deep-set 5 o'clock shadow and a soul patch if you want to look like an out-of-work actor."
