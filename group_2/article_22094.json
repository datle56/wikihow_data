      "title": "Look pretty",
      "content": "Look pretty . If you’re not used to taking care of yourself , it’s a good reason to start improving something about yourself. First of all, try not to look messy or sloppy; it’s a huge turn-off for any guy, unless he doesn't mind it. Abandon that old, dusty pair of jeans and huge T-shirt for something more flattering. Wear something that makes you feel confident . Have a sense of style . Okay, you may not be the kind of girl who pampers herself all day long, but don't be afraid to take fashion risks. Do you like bright colors? Show him just how fabulous you are. Express your individuality with earrings, scarves, or whatever makes you feel pretty. Don't worry about fitting in; you're a trend setter! Don't go overboard with sexy clothing. Show him you are beautiful without having to give away all the goods. Sexy is good. Trashy is risky."

      "content": "Be sweet to boys. Everyone likes the girl who acts like a tom boy , but don't let the boys forget that you are also a lovely woman. Say kind things to him, laugh at his jokes, make him feel like he's awesome. It'll get him asking for your number for sure. Don't try to impress him by cussing like a sailor. Remember, act like a lady . Speak to him in gentle tones. Remind him of how feminine you can be. Compliment guys . An honest compliment can go a long way. If you like somebody, compliment them on the particularities you like about them. Don't compliment them too much or gush. Act romantic and sensitive . Let guys know you need to get affection. Sometimes, if you don't tell them directly, they may even forget you have feelings too. Speak your mind!"

      "content": "Hang out with the girls from time to time. Even if guys often don’t understand friendships between girls they will respect you if you show them you have friends of your own. Don't be afraid to show your social independence."

      "title": "Be mysterious",
      "content": "Be mysterious . Girls' little secrets are fascinating for guys. Don't give away too much information, you want to keep that boy wanting more! You want to seem interested, but you don't necessarily have to make yourself too available or pursue the guy. This is also a great way of protecting yourself, so you don't have to worry about the other person knowing every detail about your life when you're getting to know each other."

      "title": "Don't be mean.",
      "content": "Don't be mean . Mean girls may be popular, but they often end up alone. Believe it or not, guys find cat fights quite scary and they'll back off when they see how mean you can be at times. There's nothing wrong with being nice . Surely you can stand up for yourself without being mean, right?"

    {
      "title": "Be Yourself.",
      "content": "Be Yourself. It most often happens when a guy tries to act up for a new girl he will look like a pretentious oaf. Being yourself is a much better method. Not only that, but the girls that do like you will be ones you will get on with a whole lot more, why? Because they share your real interests, not fake ones you made up to impress people. And besides, a lot of girls go for dorky guys, its very sweet."

      "title": "Show your sensitive side",
      "content": "Show your sensitive side . This is perhaps the most difficult thing for guys to do; some would rather bite their tongue to avoid saying something related to their feelings, than to actually say it. A girl is very pleased to find out that guys do have feelings. Showing that you can be hurt, that you care, is not an act of weakness; on the contrary, it means that you had the strength to overcome your fear of vulnerability. On the other hand, don't go about feeling sorry for yourself. Be a man when you need to; being afraid of everything and everyone won't get you too far. When you've got problems, face them and try to solve them, instead of denying their existence."

      "content": "Don't act superior to girls. Everyone is equal, and this isn't the 50s. Chivalry is not the same as patronizing someone."

      "title": "Be mature",
      "content": "Be mature . Show her you are capable of intelligent conversation . Burping contests and potty humor are fun, but consider your audience. Some girls feel that stuff is immature."

      "title": "Look approachable",
      "content": "Look approachable . Acting cold and distant may seem cool, but it's a turn-off to other people. If you don't act open and available enough, not even girls/guys that do like you will have the courage to talk to you."

      "title": "Flirt",
      "content": "Flirt . The first step in getting a boyfriend/girlfriend is expressing interest in that person. Don't be afraid that you will be turned down; comfort yourself thinking that you've at least tried. In time, becoming better at flirting will improve your chances of getting someone to like you. Remember to make eye contact and to hold it for more than three seconds to really show your interest. When acceptable, try some light touching on the arm of the other person to initiate physical contact. Mirror their behavior, subtly copying their body language and paraphrasing what they say before commenting or answering a question."

      "title": "Express affection",
      "content": "Express affection . When you like somebody, hint it to them or tell them directly. The more love you give, the more you receive. Touch them softly, play with their hair- these are little gestures that express affection and make you feel closer to others. Help them out when they need help and be understanding when they talk about their problems. To sum it up, show them that you care about them."

      "title": "Be confident",
      "content": "Be confident . Confidence is the key; it's what makes the difference between the \"hot\" and the \"not\". A person can seem absolutely awesome even when they're not like that in reality, due to their confidence. Confidence is the way to make people acknowledge what a wonderful person you are. If you don't see your own qualities, how would you expect others to see them? Find something that you like about yourself and point them out to boys/girls. Enhance your best features ; not only in your look, but also in your personality."

      "content": "Have a good reputation . It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be popular in order to be liked by the opposite gender (although it would help), but having a bad reputation decreases your chances to get a significant other. If you have a reputation as promiscuous/a player, weirdo, nerd, gossiper, mean girl/guy etc., people would be less likely to talk to you because of the prejudices they have about you."
    },

      "title": "Make the first move",
      "content": "Make the first move . It often happens that the person you like doesn't make the first move; you have two options: either to wait until the other one initiates a flirt (which may never happen), or to do something yourself. This doesn't apply only to boys, although the tradition is that the boy should make the first move; but there's nothing wrong if a girl does, either. On the contrary, it's even recommended; the guy will admire your courage."

      "title": "Don't get nervous!",
      "content": "Don't get nervous! If you fixate on how scared you are, you'll psyche yourself out. Everything you do, do it with confidence. When talking to somebody you like, stay cool and try not to blush or act nervous. There's nothing to be afraid of; they're probably just as nervous as you are."

      "title": "Take care of your looks.",
      "content": "Take care of your looks. This applies to girls and boys; not only girls are the ones who are supposed to look good for the opposite sex. Having a high standard of personal hygiene is the very least you can do to improve your appearance. Don't smell ; take showers and use deodorant and maybe fragrance, if you want to. Have nice, clean hair and clean teeth; make sure your mouth doesn't smell, either. Clean and cut your nails, don't let them grow too long- especially if you're a boy. Wear clean, ironed clothes. Be well-dressed . The clothes must not necessarily be very expensive, but they always must be clean, fit for your size and appropriate for your body type. Very important: dress tastefully. Okay, maybe you're not an expert at choosing the right clothes for you and combining them, but at least ask for advice from somebody who is one. It's crucial not to look like your blind grandmother picks your clothes."

      "title": "Don't be annoying",
      "content": "Don't be annoying . Being annoying may seem fun to you, but it's certainly not fun for those you annoy. A little teasing or playing every now and then is acceptable, even welcome in some cases, but being annoying on a regular basis is the perfect way to repel boys/girls."

      "title": "And, of course, be yourself.",
      "content": "And, of course, be yourself . Really, there will be many people who will like you for you, not just your looks. Plus, if you're being crushed on because you're on the football/cheerleading team, but no one knows your passion for singing/karate, what's the point?"
