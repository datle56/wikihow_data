It is dependent on various things such as whether the child was born in or out of wedlock, when the child was born, when the parent was born, and if one or both parents were US citizens at the time of birth. In some circumstances, blood tests would need to be done to prove a parent is indeed blood related to the child. If parents are naturalized US citizens after the birth of a child, the child must have been under 18 at the time their parents were naturalized and must have had a green card before 18. If you were adopted or your child is an adopted Canadian child, the adoptive parent must have adopted them before the child's 16th birthday and have had legal custody at the same time.
