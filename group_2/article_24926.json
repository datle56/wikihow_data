To help you get over this, think about what you were going to say and imagine how the conversation would play out. Then, don't say what you were going to.

      "content": "Write down your thoughts instead of speaking. If you still have a difficult time keeping your mouth shut, try writing down your thoughts in a journal. Sometimes, just putting your thoughts down is enough to remove the feeling like you have to talk. Then, you can throw away what you wrote or use the note to phrase what you're planning to say. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source For example, your note might say, \"Why did you schedule that party without asking me?! You're thoughtless sometimes.\" Then, throw the note away without saying that or respond by saying, \"I wish you hadn't scheduled the party without talking with me first.\""

      "content": "Practice active listening . Pay attention to not only what the person is saying, but how they're saying it. Look for non-verbal cues, such their facial expressions or what they're doing with their hands. You'll have a better idea of what they're trying to communicate and they'll feel more comfortable speaking if they know you won't cut them off. [3] X Research source For example, if you ask someone if they'd like to babysit your kids and they say, \"I'm not sure if I can,\" don't interrupt them. If they're also frowning and fiddling with their hands, you may tell that they feel uncomfortable with the idea and you shouldn't press them on it. Focus on bringing a non-judgmental feeling to that conversationâ€”make sure that they know that you're there to listen and be supportive."

      "content": "Keep quiet instead of complaining or whining. If you tend to speak out about everything and everyone that bothers you, others will begin to see you as a whiner. You might lose some respect and people will be less likely to listen to you.

Instead of getting mad or calling the person out, let them say what they need to and try to be kind .

People are less likely to trust you if they know that you frequently gossip and you might say something hurtful or get into trouble. It's better to stop gossiping altogether.

It's easy to lash out when you're mad about something, but you're more likely to create conflict if you react in anger. It's much better to not say anything than to say something you'll regret. [8] X Research source It's also a good idea to keep your mouth shut if saying something would only make another person really angry."

Don't discuss details about a new hire, offer you've been given, or group project you're working on, for instance. Others might not like that you're telling people what's happening, especially if plans aren't final yet. You'll also feel silly if things don't work out like you'd said.

No one like to listen to someone talk about their own accomplishments so don't always bring the focus of the conversation back to yourself. People will appreciate your actions more if someone else mentions them and praises you for them.
