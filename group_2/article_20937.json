      "content": "Put on something you feel confident in. Clubbing is about having fun, and you’ll have more fun if you feel great in your outfit! Just make sure you're dressed appropriately for the club you're going to. Avoid things like sweatpants, t-shirts, and sneakers (unless the club you're going to is casual). If you're going to a high-end club, call ahead or check their website to see if they have a dress code. [1] X Research source A button-up shirt and slacks or a shorter dress are always safe outfit choices for the club. Wear shoes you won’t mind dancing and walking around in all night (just avoid sneakers and flip flops)."

      "content": "Designate a driver or order a cab. If you and your friends plan on drinking alcohol at the club, designate someone to be the sober driver. If everyone wants to drink, order a cab, Uber , or Lyft to bring you to the club."

      "content": "Bring your wallet and ID. You'll need money to buy drinks and pay the cover charge if the club has one. Make sure your ID is in your wallet; you won't be able to get into the club without it. You can use your license or passport as your ID. [2] X Research source Make sure your ID is valid and current or you won't be able to get into the club. If you don't have any pockets to carry your wallet in, bring a clutch with a wrist strap to carry your money and ID in. Don't bring a large handbag unless you don't mind carrying it around the club all night."

      "content": "Show the bouncer your ID. Most clubs have a bouncer standing outside that checks everyone’s IDs to make sure they’re old enough to get in. Take your ID out before you get to the bouncer so you're ready when it's your turn. Be polite and respectful! The bouncer can turn you away if you're group is being rowdy or rude.

      "content": "Let the bouncer or attendant put a wristband on your wrist. The wristband is so the bartenders and security know you’re of legal age and that you paid to get in. If the bouncer doesn’t put a wristband on you, there may be an attendant inside that will. Don’t take off or lose your wristband or you could get kicked out of the club!"

      "title": "Order a drink at the bar if you’ll be drinking.",
      "content": "Order a drink at the bar if you’ll be drinking. Go up to the bar in the club and wait for the bartender to ask what you'd like. There may not be a drink menu, so have an idea of what you want to order beforehand. After you get your drink, wait for the bartender to bring you your receipt so you can pay for it. [4] X Research source If you're not used to drinking alcohol, come up with a drink limit for yourself so you don't accidentally drink too much. Or, if you're not feeling like drinking at all, you can order a non-alcoholic drink such as a virgin strawberry daiquiri. Keep a tab open and leave your card with the bartender if you plan on ordering multiple drinks throughout the night. Never leave your drink unattended. There is a chance it might get spiked. Don’t forget to leave a tip! Reader Poll: We asked 191 wikiHow readers, and 63% agreed that the best way to prepare when going out drinking is to eat well beforehand . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Dance with your friends. Bring your drink on the dance floor if you have one, but be careful not to spill it. Try to dance along with the kind of music that's playing. If you're not sure how to dance, just try to keep time with your feet. Try out some basic club dance moves like nodding your head or rolling your shoulders. Be respectful of other people on the dance floor. Don't dance with someone unless they make it clear they want to dance with you too."
