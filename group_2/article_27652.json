Begin by scoping out bulletin boards on campus and paying careful attention to email announcements. You can also search online for new funding opportunities, and there are apps that you can download for free (or for very little, such as the app Scholly, available for just $.99) that can help you tailor your search.

You can often get paid through your school to tutor other students in classes you have completed and done well in, or you can advertise your own services to your fellow classmates.

Some professors assign take-home essays that are more like exams, and they forbid students from talking to one another during the writing process.

      "content": "Barter your services with friends. Do you spend more than you'd like getting your hair and nails done each month? Do you have a friend who can't resist the pastries at the coffee shop or who pays for a personal trainer? Think about what both you and your friends spend money on, and then see if there's a way for you to barter and trade services with each other in order to save money. For example, in exchange for doing your hair before a big date, you can offer to supply your friend with some fresh-baked goodies."

      "content": "Reduce your transportation costs. The costs associated with commuting to and from school (or across town as you run errands) can be quite high. In an effort to save money on gas, insurance, and parking, try to take public transportation as much as possible. Your school may have discounted bus passes available for students, or you may be able to arrange to carpool with your fellow students to classes or for supply runs."

Make your coffee at home, consider cutting out the cable and switching to free or cheaper tv options (such as NetFlix or Hulu), and hold off on upgrading to the newest, shiniest electronic gadgets. [11] X Research source By going without luxuries, you'll of course free up money, but you'll also come to enjoy and appreciate them more once you can truly be able to afford them again."

While it's important that you have a social life and find ways to relax when you aren't hitting the books, you don't have to spend a lot of cash (or any!) to have a good time in your free time. Actually read the fliers and posters around campus, which advertise free, fun, and/or interesting activities and lectures. You may be able to see plays and concerts on campus, attend lectures from important thinkers, or go to university-sponsored parties all for free with your student ID."
