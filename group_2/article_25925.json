      "content": "Grow your hair long. It is recommended to have hair at least to your eyes in the front, possibly longer in the back, so that your spikes will be as durable and in-your-face as possible. Longer hair in the back is recommended because the spikes in the sides and back of your head stick out horizontally and won't be as noticeable. Since the intense styling required to keep that fierce hairdo up may stunt its growth, grow your mane out before you do any other steps."

      "content": "Get some pictures of liberty spikes online or from others so you can see how it looks when it is done. While you are spiking it, use the pictures as a reference. Look at these closely, they are your best guide as to how it should look. Jorge Herrera from the band The Casualties has spiked his hair in this fashion numerous times. Do not confuse styles where the hair has multiple \"loose\" looking spikes or what appear to be undefined spikes/no discernible spikes at all but plenty of volume; this is called \"charged\" hair and is done somewhat differently than this. A quick Google search should give you some idea as to what proper liberty spikes should look like."

      "content": "Obtain a strong product. Most commercially available hair styling products don't have enough strength to hold your hair in liberty spikes for any reasonable amount of time. Other \"products\", namely things like Knox brand gelatin, glue (some punks swear by Elmer's school glue; others go so far as to use wood glue to keep their hair on end for long periods of time, especially if it's on the longer side), or clear glycerin soap are much better for keeping hair up. The thing with Knox gelatin is that you have to mix it perfectly or chunks of it will be left behind, and if left in your hair long enough, it will begin to smell. [1] X Research source"

You'll know when you're done because when you let go of your hair, the teased section should stick up. The teasing creates a strong base. Do not tease anymore than an inch of your spike.

It will most likely not be anywhere near completely dry, but should stay up on its own now. If it flops over or seems like it's coming apart, repeat the addition of the product and blow-drying as needed. Spikes don't have to look perfect, but if you want yours to have a visually pleasing point to them, this can be done later; right now you're focusing on creating the spike to begin with.

To do this, reapply product (although not as heavily as you did to create the spike) and rub it up the length of the spike as you blow dry it on a low setting saving just enough product to twist the tips of your hair into a point. Done correctly, the spike should look like it's capable of stabbing or poking something. [8] X Research source Make sure to use dryer with low power on heat for one minute then cool for one minute."
