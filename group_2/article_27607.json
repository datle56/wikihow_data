    {
      "title": "Get your supplies.",
      "content": "Get your supplies. You will need a canvas (your choice of size), crayons (your choice depending on the size of the canvas), a hot glue gun, and a hair/blow dryer. You'll probably want to lay newspaper or an old t-shirt or blanket under the canvas in case the wax splatters, too. [1] X Research source Whatever area you think will get messy, cover up a bit more on each side. Don't forget to cover up yourself too! Hot colored wax on your skin and nice clothes shouldn't be part of this project."

    {
      "title": "Sort the crayons out.",
      "content": "Sort the crayons out. Sort depending on what you want. A rainbow is a popular design, so if you choose it, place the crayons in the order of the rainbow. [2] X Research source Some people order their crayons lightest to darkest, others use different shades of the same color. The arrangement is totally up to you. Just make sure you have enough to cover the entire top of the canvas. Repeating colors is just as beautiful."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hot glue each crayon in order on the top of your canvas.",
      "content": "Hot glue each crayon in order on the top of your canvas. Some people keep the wrappers on and some take them off, but either way works. You can opt to unwrap the crayons and cut them in half. This makes it look more natural and keeps the top three inches of your canvas from being obviously lined with crayons."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slant the canvas so that the wax will drip.",
      "content": "Slant the canvas so that the wax will drip. A common idea is to lean it against a wall. If you do lean it against a wall, tape newspaper onto the wall to avoid any accidents."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your blow dryer and blow the crayons.",
      "content": "Use your blow dryer and blow the crayons. It's best to point the blow dryer downwards so that the wax will drip. Take note that this will get messy! However, it doesn't really matter how messy it gets, as long as your newspapers are laid out correctly. [3] X Research source You can use birthday candles for quicker melting. It's a bit more dangerous and the candle wax drips everywhere, too. If you'd rather be messy than pressed for time, a candle might be a better bet for you. A heat gun is also a quicker alternative and can be picked up at most craft supply stores."

      "title": "Let your work dry.",
      "content": "Let your work dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean up your work.",
      "content": "Clean up your work. Remove the crayons and collect all the dried bits of wax that have seeped onto less than desirable areas. Color in whatever you want to if desired. Display your artwork! Hang it up on the wall, post it on Facebook or Tumblr, call over a family member. Show your creativity to the world; they'll love it! The kids will, too!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab your canvas.",
      "content": "Grab your canvas. Prop it up against a wall or a chair lined with a towel. Some area that you're not concerned about getting messy. Choose a size of canvas that you think you can cover with the amount of crayons you have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a crayon into the glue gun.",
      "content": "Place a crayon into the glue gun. Unwrap the crayons of your choice, shave them down to size (in order to fit), and place one into the glue gun. [4] X Research source If you want to use multiple colors, once you've placed the first crayon into the glue gun, start pushing in the second, then third and so out - this will force crayon in front of it out ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Color your canvas.",
      "content": "Color your canvas. With this method, you have the ultimate power of color control; it'll go wherever you want. You could keep to the standard drip look or create shapes and designs. Put the gun tip close to the canvas and create away! Once you have nothing to push in, add another crayon. You'll see the color coming out of the tip slowly lighten or darken as the next crayon gets ready to take the spotlight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let dry.",
      "content": "Let dry. That was a lot quicker than blow drying, huh? If you think your glue gun is salvageable, insert a regular glue stick and work through until what comes out is clear and glue-y and no longer colored and waxy. [5] X Research source If you aren't happy with a section of your painting, with this method it's very easy to go back and redo (or add to) an area."
