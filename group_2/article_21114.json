      "content": "Griefing is a gaming term that means to intentionally annoy a player. In online and multiplayer video game communities, the verb “griefing” refers to a player’s deliberate actions that disrupt and prevent other players from playing and enjoying the game. Players who grief you are called “griefers.” For example, someone “griefing” you might destroy things you built, trap you to keep you from moving, or attack you when you’re on the same team. [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Intent is an important part of the definition: Playing the game as it’s supposed to be played is not considered griefing. For instance, if friendly fire is enabled, it’s not griefing if your teammate shoots you. Accidental actions are not considered griefing, even if they’re annoying or prevent you from playing the game. Griefers enjoy annoying and harassing other players. Their main purpose is to disrupt players, not to win the game."

For instance, tell the chat or report them through the game. “That guy is griefing us! He keeps taking our flag and bringing it to the enemy. Is there any way to kick him off the team?” “Does anyone know what I can do about this person griefing me? She destroys every block I put down. I’m just trying to build a house!” “Can someone block this griefer? They’re obviously spamming the chat so we can’t strategize and win.” “I swear this player is griefing us and playing poorly on purpose. How many times can you accidentally build stuff and trap us in the tunnel? I’m gonna report them.”"

Unlike “griefing,” trolling behaviors aren’t just reserved for video games—trolling happens all over the Internet, like on social media and forums. No matter where you encounter a troll , their goal is to get a reaction from the people they’re upsetting. [6] X Research source “Don’t interact with them, they’re just trolling. I’ve played with them before and they like to shoot their teammates for fun.” While trolling and griefing might seem similar, many gamers consider the intent different. People who troll might annoy you, but they’re generally not trying to keep you from playing or enjoying the game. For instance, a troll might kill you once in the game, while a griefer will repeatedly harass and kill you."
