      "content": "Scrape off any remaining food as soon as you can so it doesn’t stick. When you’re done using a plate, glass, or cooking dish, scrape off the food remnants into the trash or down the garbage disposal right away. If you let the dish sit for more than a few minutes, the food will start to lose moisture and stick to the surface, making it much more difficult to clean off by hand. [1] X Research source Use a fork to push food off into the trash. You can also scrape food into the sink and run it down the garbage disposal with some water. Try not to let dishes stack up, especially overnight. They’ll be more difficult to clean, and you’ll be less motivated to clean them!"

They’ll also make it more comfortable to keep your hands under hot water, and help you avoid getting nicked by sharp knives or forks. [2] X Research source Rubber gloves are available at cleaning stores and most general stores."

      "content": "Wash the dishes under a steady stream if you have a small sink. If your sink isn’t divided or you’re just short on time, simplify your washing routine. Turn the hot water on in your sink in a low, steady stream, and pour soap onto your sponge to work into a lather. Wash each dish from the least to most dirty, then rinse it under the hot water.

      "content": "Plug the sink and line it with a plastic mat if you have 2 sink bowls. If your sink is split into 2 sections, you’ll be able to devote one to washing and the other to rinsing. In your washing sink, plug the drain and line the sink with a plastic or rubber mat, if you have one, to protect your dishware. [4] X Research source You can also use a separate plastic dish tub."

While you’re running the water, pour in a ½ cup (118 mL) of plain white vinegar, which will act as a rinse agent and help you avoid spots and streaks on your glasses. [6] X Research source You can also set up a rinsing station in a separate tub. You can also rinse the dishes in the same half of the sink, but the water level will rise faster and get dirtier more quickly."

You’ll start with your least dirty dishes and move steadily towards the ones that need the most scrubbing and cleaning. This will keep your water clean for as long as possible, meaning you won’t have to drain it as frequently. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Drain and refill the water when you notice it getting dirty or greasy. The water in both sinks will inevitably start to get a little grimy or greasy—you’re washing dirty dishes, after all! When you see this start to happen, pull the sink plug. Wash the dirty water down the drain, run the garbage disposal for any food remnants, and repeat the process of filling up your sink. [10] X Research source You can tell the water needs to be drained when it starts getting gray or discolored, when you can spot a shiny layer of grease or fat on top, or when you can see food particles floating."

      "content": "Scrub off starches and dairy products with cold water so they don’t clot up. Hot water can cause dairy products and starches, including potatoes, pasta, and rice, to gum up on the surface of dishes. To make these foods easier to clean off, wash dishes under cool water instead of hot. [12] X Research source For dairy products, be especially vigilant with thicker foods like yogurt and cheese. You’ll likely be able to wash milk glasses with regular hot water."

Pots and pans, as well as some serving dishes, can develop caked-on food or stains that are tough to get rid of with normal washing methods. Instead, fill them with warm water and a few drops of liquid dishwashing soap. Sprinkle some baking soda on top for mild abrasion to work away really tough foods, then let the dish soak overnight.

If you need to clean your burned pot, pan, or baking dish more quickly, sprinkle a spoonful of baking soda into the bottom and fill it with water. Place the pot or pan on the stove and set it on high to let it simmer for about 5 minutes. For a baking dish, place it in the oven until the water starts to simmer. Then, dump out the water and wash the dish as normal. [15] X Research source Use a dish brush or the coarser side of a sponge to scrub away the burnt food."
