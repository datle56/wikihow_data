      "content": "Clip a candy thermometer to the side of a saucepan. You can get one at any cooking supply store or online. Some arts and crafts stores may also sell them in their baking department. If you absolutely cannot get one, don't worry; you will still be able to make hard mint candies."

      "content": "Stir together the sugar, light corn syrup, and water over low heat. Add the sugar, light corn syrup, and water to the saucepan and turn the heat to low. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves. Make sure that you are using light corn syrup and not dark. It will show up nice and clear, which is important if you wish to color your candy."

[4] X Research source Do not stir the mixture during this time. Also, keep an eye on your candy thermometer. The temperature will rise slowly at first, but then it will jump very quickly to the necessary temperature. [5] X Research source If you do not have a candy thermometer: Wait until the mixture has been boiling for a few minutes, then place a small drop of it into cold water. [6] X Research source If it has reached the hard crack stage, it will form hard, brittle strands that snap when bent. Let the candy cool before trying to snap it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the mixture onto the baking sheet. If you need to, use a rubber or silicone spatula to help spread the mixture across the baking sheet. You don't have to spread it from edge to edge or be perfectly neat, but you want the sheet to be somewhat thin."

      "content": "Cut the candy into small squares or rectangles using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Aim to make the squares about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) big. You might also find it easier to lightly score the lines first, then cut them using a pizza cutter. [8] X Research source"

You will be setting the finished mint onto this to dry. Plan ahead: avoid making these if it is humid. The moisture will make the mints stickier than usual. [10] X Research source"

Take about 2 tablespoons worth of the dough, and roll it into a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick rope. Keep the rest of the dough you aren't working with covered with a damp towel.
