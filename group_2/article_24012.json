      "content": "Choose the right spring for your car. There are two factors to consider when buying your springs. The first is how much you are willing to spend. Better (lower) springs can be more expensive. Second, decide how much you want to lower your car. Some springs can lower a vehicle as much as 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). [1] X Research source This might not sound like much, but it is a considerable amount for a single small modification such as springs. Lowering springs are made to replace coil springs and are not the same as a coilover design. [2] X Research source"

This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs."

As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are: Your service manual will recommend jacking points The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack . You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands . If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time."

If this happens, have your car checked by a professional to be sure that your installation was done correctly."
