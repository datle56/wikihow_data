      "content": "The flavanols in cocoa may boost blood flow to your brain. A recent study showed that when participants drank a cocoa beverage that was formulated to be rich in flavanols, they showed increased regional blood flow in the brain. While you might not find that same concentration of flavanols in your favorite candy bar, there can be up to 2000 mg of flavanols in a 3 oz (90 g) piece of dark chocolate. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You can also find flavanols in natural (not Dutch-processed) cocoa powder. Of course, you should still enjoy chocolate in moderation, and avoid add-ins like marshmallows or caramel that are high in sugar and fat. A good rule of thumb is that you can have about 1 oz (30 g) of dark chocolate a few times a week.

Studies have shown that when a person chews gum, they have increased regional cerebral blood flow to widespread areas of their brains.

      "title": "Beet juice may help widen your blood vessels.",
      "content": "Beet juice may help widen your blood vessels. Beets contain nitrates, which are then converted to nitrites in your body. Nitrates help increase the size of your blood vessels, which allows them to carry more blood to key areas of your body—including your brain. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Beets contain particularly high levels of nitrates, but nitrates are also found in leafy green vegetables like spinach, cabbage, and lettuce, along with fennel, celery, radishes, and parsley. You can still get nitrates from eating these vegetables, so it's fine if you prefer eating beets to drinking beet juice. Drinking the juice just allows you to ingest the nitrates more quickly."

      "content": "The antioxidants in berries can stimulate blood flow to your brain. Specifically, eating berries seems to increase blood flow to the areas of your brain used for memory and paying attention to tasks. Furthermore, they help protect your brain from oxidative stress, which can deteriorate your brain function over time. Try eating 1 cup (150-200g) of berries each day to get brain-boosting benefits. It doesn't matter if the berries are fresh, dried, or frozen. Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, mulberries, bilberries, and black currants have all shown promising results in studies.

      "content": "Turning on the tunes you love the most can fire up your brain. Studies show that when people listen to their favorite songs, they have increased blood flow to their brains. It doesn't really matter what type of music it is—as long as it's something you enjoy listening to. [7] X Research source Try listening to a song you love right before you do a task you really need to focus on and see if it helps! Learning a new language can also help increase blood flow to your brain by encouraging you to think more. [8] X Research source Blood flow to your brain also increases when you're reading—although interestingly, different areas of your brain are activated when you're studying than when you're reading for pleasure."

It's thought that the increased blood flow helps clean out any metabolic waste that accumulated in your brain during the day. That's a big part of the reason why you feel foggy when you stay up too late. [9] X Research source If you're 13-18 years old, you need 8-10 hours of sleep each night.

Try setting aside a few minutes every hour to stretch your body—you might just notice that you feel a little sharper afterward. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Simple stretches that result in increased blood flow to the brain include touching your knees or toes from a standing position. Alternatively, sit with your legs outstretched and touch your knees, shins, or toes. When you're stretching, be careful not to do anything that causes pain or discomfort in your back. Some people believe that inversion poses in yoga will increase blood flow to the brain, but this has not been scientifically proven. [14] X Research source"

Focus your entire attention on counting your breaths—when other thoughts enter, simply notice them and let them go."

You might not notice a dramatic difference if your tie is too tight—your brain will still have healthy levels of blood and oxygen.

On the other hand, the brain's oxygen uptake and blood flow decrease by up to 17% immediately after people stop smoking. [22] X Research source Smoking has been linked to strokes and brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. E-Cigarettes contain nicotine, which constricts blood vessels and lowers the blood flow to the brain.
