      "content": "Measure the distance between the slots on the back of the mirror. Use a tape measure or straightedge to take the measurement. Write the distance down because you’ll need it later on to install the mounting screws. [1] X Research source On a standard Stockholm mirror, the distance between the slots is 23 inches (58 cm), but double check to confirm that distance."

      "title": "Draw a line connecting the 2 slots.",
      "content": "Draw a line connecting the 2 slots. Use a straightedge to make the line as straight as possible. Since this is the back of the mirror, you can use a pencil or marker since the line won’t be visible. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to draw across the mirror, you could just make a mark at the midpoint between the slots. If the mirror is 23 inches (58 cm), then the midpoint would be 11.5 inches (29 cm)."

      "title": "Measure the distance from the middle of the line to the top of the mirror.",
      "content": "Measure the distance from the middle of the line to the top of the mirror. Find the midpoint of the line you drew. Then, measure up from there to the very top edge of the mirror. Make a dot at that midpoint on the top of the mirror. [3] X Research source Remember to write down this measurement as well."

      "title": "Mark the point on the wall that you want the mirror top to reach.",
      "content": "Mark the point on the wall that you want the mirror top to reach. Hold the mirror on the wall and position it where you want it. When you find the right spot, make a dot on the wall marking the top of the mirror. This is where the mirror will reach when it’s mounted. [4] X Research source This will be easier if you work with a partner. Either you hold it up and they tell you where to move it, or vice versa. Stockholm mirrors usually weigh 10 lb (4.5 kg). If that’s too heavy for you to handle on your own, work with a helper. Ideal mirror height is for the center to be roughly eye-level with the people looking at it. Since people are different heights, this is more of a general rule. In most cases, this means the center of the mirror should be 55–60 inches (140–150 cm) from the ground. Also make sure there are at least 6 inches (15 cm) between the bottom of the mirror and any furniture."

    {
      "title": "Draw a line on the wall that matches the one on the mirror.",
      "content": "Draw a line on the wall that matches the one on the mirror. Start by measuring down the same distance from the top of the mirror to the line on the back of it. From that point, draw a straight line half as long as the line connecting the slots in each direction. Make dots at each end of the line. [5] X Research source If the line connecting the slots was 5 inches (13 cm) below the top of the mirror, measure down 5 inches (13 cm). Then make a line 11.5 inches (29 cm) long on either side of that point, if the original line was 23 inches (58 cm). Confirm that the line is straight with a level."

      "title": "Screw in the anchors at each end of the line.",
      "content": "Screw in the anchors at each end of the line. Make sure you get wall anchors that can hold more than 10 lb (4.5 kg), or the weight of the mirror if it’s different. Poke the anchors into the wall in the middle of the dot you drew. Then, use a Phillips head screwdriver and turn clockwise until the anchor fully enters the wall. Do the same for the other side of the line. [6] X Research source You can buy multiple anchor types at the hardware store. Mainly, make sure the type you use can support the mirror weight. Also check reviews to see if the anchor brand has any problems with falling or breaking. If you know exactly what type you want, shopping online might be faster. These anchors work well with drywall or plaster. If you have brick wall, use a brick drill bit and drill screws into the dots instead. It is always a good idea to drill into the mortar between the bricks rather than into the brick itself, because the hole will be easier to patch if you decide to remove your mirror."

      "title": "Insert screws through the anchors.",
      "content": "Insert screws through the anchors. Anchor kits also come with screws. Take a screw and hold it in the middle of the X on the anchor. Then use the same screwdriver and drive the screw into the anchor. Leave enough space for the mirror to hook over the screws. [7] X Research source You might hear a click or snap noise as you’re inserting the screws. This is normal, and indicates that the anchors snapped into the wall."

Hook the mirror over one screw, then lean the mirror to the other side to find the other. Once both mounts are secure, the mirror is successfully up. [8] X Research source If you have trouble getting the mirror to mount, the screws may be in too far. Try pulling them out a bit more so the slots have more room to catch. Make certain that both mounts are secure before letting go of the mirror. Otherwise it could fall."

First, slide the screw into the thin portion of the slot on the back of the mirror. Then, place the screw section of the D-ring over that. Finish by screwing the nut into position tightly. Do the same for the other slot. [9] X Research source Get a D-ring set from a hardware store or online. If the screws that come with the D-rings are too small to mount securely into the slots, you can use different ones. Get screws with wide heads that won’t slip out of the slots."

      "content": "Loop twine through the D-rings and leave it slack. Cut a piece of twine long enough to loop through both D-rings and meet again. Wrap the twine through each D-ring. Pull the twine so it’s slightly taut, but still has a bit of slack. Then tie a tight knot in the twine. [10] X Research source Look for twine or rope than can hold at least 10 lb (4.5 kg), the average weight of a Stockholm mirror. If the mirror is too heavy for twine, try using wire instead."

      "title": "Test the strength of the twine and knot before hanging the mirror.",
      "content": "Test the strength of the twine and knot before hanging the mirror. Hold it up by the twine over a soft surface, like your bed. Keep holding it for a minute to make sure the knot doesn’t come undone or the rings don’t pop out. If all holds, then the mirror is ready to hang. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Nail a picture hook into the wall where you want to hang the mirror. Find the location that you want the mirror to hang in. Then, place a picture hook at that point. Hammer it into the wall all the way. [12] X Research source Make sure that any hook you use can hold at least 10 lb (4.5 kg) so it supports the weight of the mirror. You could also use a plain nail or screw to mount the mirror. Angle the screw up so the twine loops over it. The center of the mirror should be roughly eye-level with the people looking at it. This could vary since people aren't the same height. On average, the center of the mirror should sit about 55–60 inches (140–150 cm) from the ground. Alternatively, you can use two hooks, about a third of the way in from each side of the mirror. This way it will be less likely to get crooked."

      "content": "Hang the twine on the hook. Finally, lift the mirror up to the hook. Work it around so the twine loops onto the hook. Adjust the mirror so the hook is right in the middle of the twine. After this, the mirror is all set. [13] X Research source Make certain that the mirror is attached before letting it go. Let go slowly to confirm that the mirror is secure."
