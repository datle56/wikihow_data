      "content": "Look for underlying issues. Some kids, like some adults, are simply naturally slender and have trouble putting on weight. However, you should try to rule out other reasons for your child's difficulty in gaining weight. [1] X Research source Children are notorious for being \"picky eaters,\" but if your child simply has little interest in eating, that could be a sign of some sort of medical or psychological issue. A hormonal or metabolic problem such as diabetes or an overactive thyroid can sometimes be the cause of poor weight gain. Gastrointestinal or other problems may make eating uncomfortable, or undiagnosed food allergies could be at play. Some medications can reduce appetite, so consider this possibility if your child is on medication. Unfortunately, even pre-teen children can develop eating disorders due to factors like peer pressure. Your child could also just be excessively active, and simply be burning more calories than he or she takes in."

      "content": "Consult your child’s physician. If your child is receiving regular medical check-ups, the pediatrician may be the one who informs you that your child would benefit from increasing his or her weight. But never be afraid to raise the subject if you are concerned. [2] X Research source As mentioned, food intolerances or allergies, digestive problems, and a range of other medical issues can sometimes be the cause of a child being underweight. Your child's physician can help diagnose and treat such problems. That said, most often the issue can be improved by changes that you and your child can make at home. But the advice of a medical professional is always beneficial."

      "title": "Follow special advice for infants.",
      "content": "Follow special advice for infants. Dealing with an infant who needs to gain weight will of course be different from an older child. While serious causes are rare, normally the issue lies in feeding technique, breast milk production, or gastrointestinal problems. [3] X Research source Always consult a doctor if you are concerned your infant is underweight. The physician may order tests for your baby or refer you to a feeding specialist (to observe feeding technique) or a pediatric gastroenterologist. Remedies will vary based on your infant's particular situation, but may include: supplementing breastfeeding with formula (if milk production is insufficient); letting the infant feed as often and for as long as he/she desires (thus avoiding rigid scheduling); changing formula brands (in the case of an intolerance or allergy or increase the calorie content); or introducing solid foods a bit earlier than the typical age of six months. Occasionally medications for acid reflux may be prescribed. Early life weight gain is essential to long-term health, so shortfalls should always be addressed with appropriate medical advice. Below-average weight gain can almost always be reversed and result in no lasting problems."

      "content": "Feed underweight children more often. Many times, the problem is not what a child is eating, but simply how much. Small children have small stomachs and need to eat more frequently than adults. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Children may need to eat five or six smaller meals, along with snacks, each day. Whenever an underweight child feels hungry, feed him or her."

      "content": "Make mealtime important. While sprinkling in snacks as needed, make mealtimes regular focal points in your child’s day. Teach him or her that eating is both important and enjoyable. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If mealtime seems like an annoyance or afterthought, or some sort of punishment (such as sitting until you clean your plate), then children are less likely to be enthusiastic eaters. Make mealtimes a regular routine. Turn off the TV. Make eating and enjoying the focus. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Set a good example. While your kid may need to put on a few pounds, you might benefit from losing a few. Even if this is the case, your eating habits should not be as different as you may think. Eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods is essential for the underweight, the overweight, and everyone in between. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Children learn by watching you. If you regularly try new foods and make healthy options, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains your first choices, they are more likely to adopt these habits. Making junk food a rare indulgence will benefit both of you, whether you need to gain or lose weight."

      "title": "Encourage regular exercise.",
      "content": "Encourage regular exercise. Like healthy eating, exercise is more often associated with weight loss than weight gain. When paired with smart eating, though, it can be part of a weight-gain regimen. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For older children in particular, adding muscle mass is likely to increase weight, and is always healthier than adding body fat. Exercise can often stimulate the appetite, so try encouraging physical activity before mealtimes and see if that helps."

      "content": "Skip unhealthy choices. Yes, cakes, cookies, sodas, and fast food meals have high calorie counts that can increase weight. However, the cost in other potential health problems (including even childhood diabetes or heart disease) outweighs any small benefits. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Calorie-rich but nutrient-poor foods, such as sugary drinks, are not the answer to healthy weight gain. Foods that are rich in both calories and nutrients are the best option, because they help add weight and provide essential vitamins and minerals. Don’t tell your child he or she needs to “fatten up” or “get some meat on those bones” — say that you both need to choose and eat more healthy foods."

      "title": "Serve a variety of nutrient-dense foods.",
      "content": "Serve a variety of nutrient-dense foods. Variety is important not only because it offers the best range of vital nutrients, but also because it helps keep mealtime interesting. If mealtime is a chore or a bore, it will be more difficult to get your kid to want to eat. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source A high-calorie, high-nutrient diet for weight gain in children should include starchy carbohydrates (pastas, breads, cereals); at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily; proteins (meat, fish, eggs, beans); and dairy products (milk, cheese, etc.). All children under two should consume full-fat dairy products, and your child’s doctor may recommend continuing this practice past that age to support weight gain. While fiber is important to a healthy diet, you may not want to overdo it with children trying to gain weight. Too much whole grain pasta or brown rice can leave a child feeling too full for too long."

      "title": "Utilize healthy fats.",
      "content": "Utilize healthy fats. We tend to think of fat as bad, but that is not always the case. Many plant-based fats in particular are necessary components of a healthy diet. Healthy fats are also ideal for weight gain because they provide about nine calories per gram, as opposed to about four per gram for carbohydrates or proteins. [11] X Research source Flaxseed oil and coconut oil are good choices and can be added to a wide variety of foods. Flaxseed oil has a neutral flavor that can go unnoticed, while coconut oil can add a pleasant sweetness to everything from sauteed vegetables to smoothies. Olives and olive oil are another good choice. Nuts and seeds, like almonds and pistachios, provide ample amounts of healthy fats. Avocados can provide a creamy texture to a range of foods and offer beneficial fats at the same time."

      "content": "Select smart snacks. Children who need to gain weight should be offered regular snacks. But, as with meals, healthy options should be chosen over empty-calorie foods. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Focus on high-calorie, high-nutrition, easy to prepare and serve snack options. For instance, try peanut butter and jelly on whole-grain bread; nuts and dried fruit; apples with cheese; or a turkey wrap with avocado. For treats, present options like bran muffins, granola bars, and yogurt before resorting to cakes, cookies, and ice cream."

      "content": "Watch what and when your child drinks. Adequate water intake is important for children, but drinking too much can be filling and reduce the amount of food kids eat. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Empty-calorie drinks like soda provide no nutritional value, while the amount of sugar in fruit juices can be bad for teeth and overall health when consumed in excess. Water is always a good choice, but children who need to gain weight may benefit from drinking whole milk, smoothies or shakes, or even nutritional supplement drinks such as PediaSure or Ensure. Talk to your child’s pediatrician about the best options. Have your child drink most of his or her beverage after the meal. Skip drinking beforehand, and have him or her drink only enough to comfortably (and safely) eat. This can help keep your child from “filling up” on beverages. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Make milk your friend.",
      "content": "Make milk your friend. The ease in adding dairy products like milk and cheese to a wide variety of foods makes them great options for enhancing calorie (and nutrient) content. Smoothies and milkshakes are easy ways to help kids drink their calories, and the addition of fresh fruit can further boost the nutrition content. Cheese can be melted into or sprinkled on top of just about anything, from eggs to salads to steamed veggies. Try adding milk to canned soups instead of water, and serve sour cream, cream cheese, or yogurt-based dips with fruits or veggies. You can adapt if your child has an allergy or intolerance, or if you prefer not serving milk products. Soy and almond milks also provide substantial calories and nutrients, and silken tofu can be used in smoothies, for example."

      "title": "Provide peanut butter.",
      "content": "Provide peanut butter. So long as allergies are not an issue, peanut butter is almost always a welcome addition to a kid’s meal, and provides substantial calories and protein. Slather peanut butter on whole grain breads, bananas, apples, celery, multigrain crackers, and pretzels. You can also blend it into smoothies and shakes, and use it as a layer of “glue” between two pancakes or French toast squares. If peanut allergies are an issue, almond butter can be a good alternative. Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil also provide ample calories and nutrients."

Try, for instance: [15] X Research source Cooking pasta and rice in chicken broth instead of water. Serving dried fruit, which children may eat more of because of the lack of water content to fill them up. Adding flaxseed oil, with its mild flavor, to everything from salad dressings to peanut butter and banana smoothies.
