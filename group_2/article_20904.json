While thorough cleanings are recommended from time to time, you may just have a muddy pup on your hands who needs a little rinsing. Before getting started, gather these materials so you have everything in one place: Towels: enough to both dry the dog and protect the ground from splashing water Dog shampoo: shampoo formulated for humans will dry out a dog's skin, so buy dog shampoo at the pet store, vet, or online. If your dog has any skin conditions, consult your vet for recommendations. Sponge Comb or brush Small cup or bucket (for pouring water) Doggy treats (optional, but can comfort stressed dogs)"

      "content": "Consider optional materials for thorough cleanings. While bathing a dog too often will cause dry, flaky skin, you should still give him a thorough cleaning every once in a while. When you notice your dog getting smelly, it might be time for a cleanup. You'll need everything listed in the last step, plus as many of the following optional materials as you'd like: Dog conditioner: this will keep his fur soft and smooth after shampooing Toothbrush and dog toothpaste Cotton balls for ear cleaning You don't have to do all these things at once the first time. If you feel your dog is getting overwhelmed, just work on the bath-time first. Then, you may add in more extensive things, like nail trimming, later."

      "title": "Decide where to bathe your small dog.",
      "content": "Decide where to bathe your small dog. Since your dog is small, you have the option of choosing a bathtub, sink, or even a plastic tub or bucket outside. Choose a location where you can stand, sit, or kneel comfortably without straining yourself. The bath area should be warm and free of drafts — only bathe a dog outdoors on hot days, so he won't get cold. If there's any chance your dog will get skittish and jump away from you, bathe him in a bathtub. Don't risk a fall from the sink! Consider taking your dog with you right into the shower. You'll get wet no matter what, so this can be an effective time and mess-saving approach. Put cotton in your dog's ears if you take him into the shower. This prevents water from getting in the ears and causing an ear infection."

[3] X Expert Source Lancy Woo Certified Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. Depending on the dog, this might take a few days, a few hours, or just a few minutes — let your dog set his own pace. Help your dog into the dry tub. Speak reassuringly in a soothing voice, petting and praising him while he sniffs around and explores. Give him treats for being calm inside the tub. Touch and rub him all over while he's in the tub, so he knows how the bathing process will look. When he's comfortable with that, try splashing a little water on him and continue praising and treating. Let him hear the sound of the running faucet while he's not in the tub until it's no longer frightening. Rub him down with a dry towel after every session, to get him used to the drying process. Place him in a tub or sink that has enough water to just cover his paws, then gradually work up to a full, immersive bath."

If the fur is too matted, take your dog to a professional groomer, then groom him more regularly in the future to avoid matting. Even professionals can knick the skin handling severe mats — you might do serious damage trying to do it yourself. To remove small mats, place your fingers between your pet's skin and the mat, then snip it away a few hairs at a time. Check under the tail for fecal mats (\"dingleberries\") that need to be trimmed off. If the stool is too hard, you can wait until after it's soaked in the bath to work it out of the hair. After the bath, put diaper rash or hemorrhoid cream on any irritated skin around the anus after the mat is removed."

This is especially important for breeds with protruding eyes. You can buy this ointment from your veterinarian's clinic. You can also use a drop of mineral oil instead of prescription ointment. Use a dropper to place the ointment or mineral oil onto the eyeball without touching the eye itself. Let the dog blink several times (or push the eyelid open and shut yourself) to spread the ointment or oil around. Never use your finger to wipe ointment onto the eye, and don't let the tip of your container touch the eye."

Never use a cup or bucket to rinse as it's not effective enough to get under the coat of a long-haired or double coat dog. Either way, use a wet washcloth on the face so you don't overwhelm the dog. If you can still see bubbles on the dog, you need to rinse a couple more times. Any soap, shampoo or conditioner residue left on the dog will attract dirt, defeating the purpose of the bath. Soap residue can also irritate your dog and cause itching. To check if residue is still there, gently pull some fur in between your fingers and if it feels squeaky then you are done. A dog conditioner is a good idea for dogs with long fur. Apply after thoroughly rinsing out the shampoo and follow the instructions on the bottle.
