      "title": "His feelings for you have made him unsure how to act.",
      "content": "His feelings for you have made him unsure how to act. If he has a crush on you, those feelings make him feel vulnerable around you (because you could easily hurt him). [1] X Research source That vulnerability makes him uncomfortable, so he's more likely to act out of character. This is really more about vibes than anything else, but it's a pretty good way to tell if he's picked up a crush on you. What \"different\" means depends on the boy—if he's normally pretty quiet and reserved, but gets really animated around you? He might have a crush on you. Having a crush may even cause him to behave coldly towards you to overcompensate for his feelings, even if previously he'd always been really sweet to you. If there's anything about the way he's acting that's making you uncomfortable, say something! You don't have to mention that you suspect he has a crush on you—just say something like \"I really enjoy hanging out with you but I feel uncomfortable when you do that.\""

A lot of times if a guy has a crush, he'll go out of his way to seem like he's the best around—like, who wouldn't fall head over heels for that guy? What a charmer! If he's not currently doing anything he can impress you with, he might tell you about something impressive he did earlier. If he's actively doing something, does he keep looking back at you to see your reaction? He might be quietly hoping you're impressed. If you're interested in him and want to call him out on this in a playful way, you might say, \"Are you trying to impress me? Because it's definitely working!\""

      "content": "He might see them as a threat if he's insecure about his feelings for you. He's not necessarily going to come right out and say that he's jealous—but there will be signs. Maybe he talks about what a loser one of your guy friends is, or randomly brings up how another guy you hang out with cheated on his girlfriend. He's trying to make himself seem better than them in comparison. [2] X Research source There's usually nothing wrong with this kind of behavior as long as he's not being rude to these other guys. If it makes you uncomfortable, you can bring it up in a subtle way. If you're kind of into him, you might say something like, \"Hey, are you jealous? Because trust me, you have nothing to worry about!\" That'll usually get him to calm down a little. If you don't return his feelings, ask him what's motivating his jealous-sounding comments. You might also say something to reinforce your platonic feelings for him, such as, \"Is there some reason you don't want me hanging out with them? We've been friends for a long time, you know I trust your judgment.\""

The second anyone says the first critical word about you—even if you deserved it—he'll be jumping to your defense. For example, if someone in your study group is complaining that you're always late, he might remind them that you have to come from soccer practice, which sometimes runs late."

This is what's going on in this boy's mind if he has a crush on you—he wants to be around you, but he doesn't want to scare you off. So he'll come up with whatever excuse he can to be as close to you as possible. For example, if he sees you sitting at a café, he might invent several reasons for needing to pass by your table, such as to get more napkins, to go to the restroom, and then to get a straw. Dating coach Candice Mostisser mentions this as one of the biggest signs that he might have a crush on you. \"Do they choose to be around you when they can be around other people?\" she asks. \"Let's say you're at a party. If you walk away, are they making the point to come be next to you at some point? And do they try to spend time alone with you?\" she continues.

Guys just don't flirt with someone unless they're interested in them in some way. [9] X Research source Don't expect him to be the king of rizz, either—if he has a crush on you, he's probably going to be pretty awkward (and that's totally okay). His \"flirting\" might come across more as teasing or roasting you, which is pretty normal. But if he says something that actually hurts your feelings, speak up.

Don't be surprised if he's constantly quizzing you on your favorite things. He also probably wants to make sure that everything's to your liking when you're out someplace.

A lot of things that might seem like a sign that he could have a crush on you could just be how he is. You'll never know unless you start watching him around other girls. For example, if he's always extremely courteous and holds the door open for everyone, you can't really assume anything from that. But if he goes out of his way to be more courteous to you, he might have a crush on you. This can go in the other direction as well, although this can really be confusing. If he's really outgoing and flirtatious around other girls but standoffish around you, it could mean he has a crush on you. The key is that he's treating you differently."

[14] X Research source For example, if he knows you had to leave school early, he might pick up notes and assignments for you from the classes you missed so you don't fall behind.
