      "content": "Choose a site to download custom content from. You can find plenty of custom content on sites like Mod The Sims or Garden of Shadows, and many creators also share content on Tumblr, LiveJournal, or Dreamwidth. Most custom content will appear in addition to the currently existing game content. Recolors can be for existing Sims 2 content or for another creator's custom content. This will add more color options in Create-a-Sim or Buy Mode. Custom Sims will appear in the Sim Bin in Create-a-Sim, and custom lots will appear in the Lots and Housing bin in the neighborhood view. Default replacements will replace an in-game object or Create-a-Sim piece with a piece of custom content."

      "content": "Check for any content requirements. Some custom content requires certain expansion or stuff packs, or a mesh from another piece of custom content. If you don't have a required pack or mesh, the content won't show up or appear properly in-game. Read the download description to see if the content requires something."

      "title": "Extract the content.",
      "content": "Extract the content. Most creators compress their content into .zip , .rar , or .7z files. While Windows and Mac can extract .zip files by default, other files need programs to extract them. On Windows, use 7Zip to extract files. Right-click the file, hover over 7-Zip > , and choose Extract to \\* . On Mac, use The Unarchiver to extract files. Double-click the file to extract it."

      "content": "Place package files into your Downloads folder. If the file extension is .package , you'll need to place it in your game's Downloads folder for it to work. Open File Explorer or Finder . Go to Documents. Open the folder titled EA Games . Open the folder titled The Sims 2 . Drop the .package file(s) in the game's Downloads folder. (If there's no Downloads folder, make a new folder titled Downloads and place the file in there.)"

This will open up Package Installer and display the name and description of everything you're installing. Click Install to install the content. Custom lots cannot be installed if they were made in a game with expansions that you don't have. (For instance, if you have Bon Voyage, you can't install lots made with FreeTime or Apartment Life.)"

If you see the new content with a star in the corner of the thumbnail, your content is working! In Create-a-Sim, the Sim Bin, and the Lot Bin, custom content will show up in front of default content. In Buy and Build Mode, things are sorted by price, so you might need to search to see if the content is showing up. If only some content is showing up, you're probably missing something, like a mesh or a required expansion or stuff pack. (Files themselves can sometimes not work, but this is uncommon.) Default replacements won't have the custom content star, but will show up in place of the original game content."

Because mods alter game code, they can require certain expansion packs to run properly, or have different versions per expansion. If two separate mods change the same code, they can also cause problems when used together. Read the mod description thoroughly to see if the mod requires any expansions or is known to be incompatible with other popular mods."

Most game hacks don't require too much tinkering, and can just be placed in the game's Downloads folder like you would with normal custom content. Put them in Documents > EA Games > The Sims 2 > Downloads. Always place hacks in a separate subfolder from other custom content.

You'll need to open the drive that you installed your game on, open Program Files, and then find your game directory to adjust it. (Your game directory and what files you modify will depend on your OS, your version of the game and the mod you're installing. The instructions will tell you where the specific mod needs to go.) If you run the Ultimate Collection through Origin, your game directory will usually be C: > Program Files (x86) > Origin Games > The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection . If you play on Windows, but don't have the Ultimate Collection, your directory will usually be C: > Program Files (x86) > EA Games > The Sims 2 . If you're playing on a Mac, open Finder .

However, many hacks alter a fundamental part of the game, like enabling teen pregnancy or showing previously-hidden interactions. Test out a function related to the hack; if the Sim is able to complete the action and nothing goes wrong, it's working! If your Sims \"jump\" or don't complete actions, there's glitchy behavior that wasn't previously present, or the game crashes, the hack isn't working. Make sure the hack you're using is compatible with your game version and other hacks."
