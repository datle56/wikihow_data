Does your family come before or after your faith in God, if you believe in God? Is it more important for you to spend time on the hobbies that make you personally happy, or to focus on the career that supports your family and gives them a comfortable life? By ranking your values and priorities, you’ll be better able to tell whether or not you’re devoting an appropriate amount of energy to each aspect of your life."

Maybe you love to talk about books, and you should practice literary criticism. Maybe you like to be the one writing the books, not the one talking about the books other people have written. The list might evolve over time. What makes you happy at 20 might not be what makes you happy at 30. Don’t be married to an image of “who you are” — update your list over time to reflect what makes you happy in the present moment. Ask yourself what you want to do if money wasn’t an issue to find out what you’re truly passionate about."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even though it has religious and mystical roots, meditative techniques can be used by anyone for relaxation and stress relief. Find a tranquil environment free from distracting sounds and activities — someplace where you can clear your mind and focus on your state of being. Sit in a comfortable position like the lotus position with your eyes closed, and focus on your breathing. Inhale and exhale slowly, deeply, and purposefully. Focus on your breath, how it feels entering and exiting your body. Be present fully in your body in the moment, and do your best to think of nothing else. Do this at the same time every day to make it part of your routine. Early in the morning, before you go to work, is a good time for meditation because it calms and prepares you for the rest of your day."

Be aware that your career strengths are different from the skill strengths that make you happy.

If you crave the flexibility to work at your own pace, during your own work hours, and from a setting of your choosing, maybe freelance or contract work appeals to you. Others might not see themselves following the constantly shifting schedule of a university professor with its attendant ever-changing focus. Instead, they might flourish in a setting with stability and the sameness of a 9-5 workday filled with well-known, repeating duties. Ask yourself what kind of schedule would work best with your work habits. Don’t choose freelance work if you slack off and lose focus easily! Note that freelance and contract work is less stable than regular office work and usually does not offer benefits."

You need to put everything on the back burner except for your career satisfaction. To prepare for a career change, you should begin saving as much money as possible.

      "content": "Figure out if you want to have children. Some people know from a young age that they want to be parents, but it’s not so obvious an option for many. There’s nothing wrong with that! Don’t let anyone — parents, friends, society at large — pressure you into a choice you don’t want for yourself. Some things to keep in mind include: Are you called to parenthood? Though it’s more commonly ascribed to women (biological clocks, maternal instincts), both men and women sometimes just feel the urge to start a family. Other times, that need simply isn’t there. Can you afford a family? As of 2014, the estimated cost of raising a child from birth to legal adulthood is $245,000. [10] X Research source How much wiggle room will that give you, based on your family income? Will you be able to give children a good quality of life? Will you have a comfortable retirement? Do you understand the realities of parenting? Although most parents will say that their children are their greatest joy and achievement, they’ll also tell you how hard it is to raise a child. As a parent, it will be your responsibility to safeguard your child against all dangers, to provide them with the best possible life, and to socialize them into a responsible citizen of the world. You’ll have to put up with temper tantrums and expensive Christmas lists, etc., etc. It’s a hard job! Remember that women can always have their eggs frozen if they choose not to have children in prime child-bearing age. [11] X Research source Although it’s difficult to get pregnant as women’s bodies age, freezing young eggs gives you a better chance of having a child if you choose to start a family later in life."

Again, some of this is just instinct; some people can just feel in their bones that they want a large family. But there are many practical considerations you should keep in mind. Again, each child will cost about $245,000 over their 18 years of legal childhood! How much attention can you devote to each child? A single child will get as much attention as their parents have to offer, but with each additional child, your attention will grow more and more diffused over your growing brood. How much time will you have to drive each child to their individual after-school activities, help with homework, listen to them talk about their days, etc.? How much companionship do you want your child to have? Even if you can’t devote undivided parental attention to a child, having many siblings means your children will always have playmates to keep them occupied and to help each other through the trying emotional times when they don’t always turn to their parents. Remember that with your third child, you are officially outnumbered. With two children, one parent can manage each in a given situation, but with three children, there’s a spare child running loose!"

Though traditional gender roles see a man in the workplace and a woman raising the children at home, these days, both men and women should feel equally comfortable in either role. Childcare for children whose parents work can be so expensive, depending on where you live, that it may not be worth the income from your job. [12] X Research source Would be comfortable with other people spending that much time raising your children, regardless of how much you trust them? Do you want to be present for all of your child’s developmental milestones, and would working in an office get in the way of that? Would staying at home with your child all day make you feel claustrophobic, or like you’re being defined solely by your identity as a parent? Would staying at home keep you from the passions and interests you get to explore every day at a job you love?"

After all, people raised children for centuries without guidebooks. It is important, though, to think about what kind of parent you want to be to be as happy as possible. Look into different parenting styles to learn how you want to raise your family. [13] X Research source Do you want to be a hands-on parent who walks their children through all of their decisions and activities, or do you want to be a more laissez-faire parent who lets their children make and learn from their own mistakes? How involved do you want to be in their education? Will you check homework every night? Assign extra homework outside of class? Or let more qualified teachers handle their education? How do you want to reprimand your children when they make mistakes? Would you feel more comfortable in a good cop or bad cop role? Another way to think of it might be, “Do you want to be more of a coach who helps make good decisions or a referee who identifies and punishes mistakes?” Do you put your children first before all others, or does your marriage take priority? What about your personal happiness?"
