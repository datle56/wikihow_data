Relevant: I spend most of my day sitting and need to consciously make an effort to get more physical activity in. Time-bound: I’ll maintain this routine for 1 month then reassess my needs and adjust my goals. Ask friends, family members, or co-workers to join you on certain goals. Having people there to support you will make working toward your goals much more fun.
