      "content": "Use these Gojo-related rizz lines to flirt with your crush. Satoru Gojo is one of the most beloved characters in the Jujutsu Kaisen fandom. Fans obsess over him whenever they see him on screen, lovingly admiring his shiny blue eyes and flowing white hair. If your crush is a fan of Gojo, use these flirty rizz lines to show them your JJK knowledge and win them over: Reverse is red, Lapse is blue, Heaven and Earth have never seen anyone as beautiful as you. Is your name Gojo? Because you have beautiful eyes. Reversal is Red, Lapse is Blue, My Six Eyes can’t see a future without you. Your smile shines brighter than Gojo’s Six Eyes. Call me Satoru Gojo, because my Six Eyes can see our future together. Without you, my heart’s an Infinite Void. I don’t need Six Eyes to see how amazing you are. Are you using a reverse curse technique? Because you’re healing my heart. You must be a reverse curse technique user because my heart heals every time you’re near. Like Gojo and Geto, you’re the only one who can keep up with me. Like Sukuna and Gojo, you’re the only one who can break through the domain to my heart. Like Gojo during the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, I’ll take on anyone who tries to get in your way. My heart is hollow and purple without you. Whenever you’re away, it feels like I’m stuck in the Prison Realm. Throughout heaven and earth, you alone are the honoured one. Call me Gojo because my love for you is limitless. My love for you is limitless, but my heart is hollow without you. Like Gojo and Toji, I can spot your beauty from a mile away. Are you Gojo’s infinity? Because the closer I get to you, the more I want to stay. [1] X Research source You must be Gojo’s infinity the way I could spend forever with you. Reversal is Red, Lapse is Blue, even without the Six Eyes I can see the beauty in you. Like Toji did Gojo, you ambushed my heart. Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I teleport away and try again like Gojo? Like Gojo’s Six Eyes on a sunny morning, you brighten my day. I may not have the limitless technique, but I can see us lasting for Infinity."

      "content": "Use these Gojo rizz lines to make your crush laugh. Satoru Gojo’s also known for his humorous, non-caring demeanor. While some see this as him being full of himself, others think it’s hilarious! So, if your crush is a fan of Jujutsu Kaisen , there are plenty of lines you can use to make them crack up. These lines include: Domain Expansion: Infinite Rizz How nice for you to meet me! Let’s play a drinking game. Name all the things you like about me! See who names the most! Sorry I’m late. I had to pull a Gojo and grab us some Kikufuku. Limitless Rizz Technique! You must be Geto the way I’ve been obsessing over you. Cursed Technique Amplification, Maximum Output: Rizz! Cursed Technique Amplification: Maximum Rizz! Through heaven and earth, you alone are the finest one. If I ever fumble you please hit me with a Hollow Purple. Sealing me in the Prison Realm is the only way to cut off my love. Your beauty’s like a cursed technique. Wanna be my student? Let’s touch hands like Gojo and Jogo. I promise I’ll let you through my Infinity. When I see you I freeze up like you cast Infinite Void. I need Gojo’s blindfold when I’m around you, your beauty is overwhelming. Don’t mind the blindfold, I’m cosplaying Gojo to show you I’m the strongest choice. I spent all this time trying to handle my cursed energy, but the second you’re around I lose all control. I know you opened your domain when we met, because I’ve been falling infinitely for you. Usually I’m the only honored one throughout heaven and earth, but I can make room for you. If we ever break up we have to do it in front of a KFC. We have to stay faithful to Gojo & Geto! Domain Expansion: Infinite Love When you’re away, I feel an Infinite Void. But when we’re together, I feel limitless. You did well on our date, [insert name]. I won’t forget you for as long as I live. How about we grab some blindfolds and pick who gets to be Gojo tonight? I know I get a little antsy when you try to touch me. I’m just not used to someone being able to break through my Infinity, you know?"

      "title": "Use these lines when your crush is a fan of the King of Curses.",
      "content": "Use these lines when your crush is a fan of the King of Curses. Ryomen Sukuna is often considered one of the most powerful characters in Jujutsu Kaisen . Whenever he’s on screen, he’s always giving his enemies a run for their money. So, it makes sense that he’s also one of the most beloved characters in the fandom. His devilish nature attracts many fans, so if you’re trying to rizz up someone who loves Sukuna, use these lines: Just like Sukuna in Yuji’s body, you’ve taken over my heart! If loving you is wrong, I must be Ryomen Sukuna, because I’m ready for the chaos. Stand proud. You are beautiful. You must be Sukuna’s fingers the way I want to eat you up! Call me Sukuna the way I’d only let you touch my soul. Like Sukuna when he first saw Kugisaki, I know I’d have fun with you. Even without Sukuna’s four eyes I can still see how beautiful you are. I’ve had my eye on you like Sukuna had his on Megumi. You dare touch my soul? Since we’re starting to have a connection, I’ll allow it. You look happy. Want me to praise you? Like Sukuna’s domain expansion, I wouldn’t mind dedicating a shrine to you. They say Sukuna’s the king, but I wouldn’t mind bowing down to you, either. I’m not Sukuna, I won’t tear your heart out. When you’re with me I feel invincible. Are you sure you’re not one of Sukuna’s fingers? Even if Sukuna was wreaking havoc in Shibuya again, it wouldn’t be enough to separate us two. I won’t shred your heart. Don’t worry, I’m not Sukuna. I may seem Malevolent, but all I want is to enShrine our love. Like Sukuna did Jogo, I wouldn’t mind you towering over me under the moonlight. I’ll wait under a meteor with Sukuna if it means being able to take you out. I’d let Sukuna possess me if it gave me a shot at you."

      "content": "Use other JJK rizz lines if your crush is a fan of other characters. While Gojo’s a fan favorite, there are plenty of other Jujutsu Kaisen characters who receive love from fans. Whether they’re in love with Sukuna and his chaotic nature or are pining for the mysterious Megumi Fushiguro, we’ve got a bunch of JJK rizz lines for you to rizz your crush up with. Those lines include: I’m ready to make a binding vow together if you are. I feel like Megumi the way my domain is incomplete without you. Even Kenjaku would envy our bond. You must be Nobara the way you nailed my heart with your smile. Are you a cursed technique? Because I wouldn’t mind exorcising you. Like Yuta and Rika, I’ll love you forever. I want you like Toji wants his cursed tools. Call me Toge Inumaki the way I’m speechless around you. I’d fight a Special Grade Cursed Spirit if it means being able to take you out. Call me Kinji the way I’m ready to take a gamble on you. Your beauty alone would change Mahito’s mind on humans. I might not have a domain, but I’d expand my world for you anytime. I’ll do overtime like Nanami if it means we get to spend more time together. I’ll break through domains like Toji if it means I get to see you. Like Kenjaku, your greatness is making me lose my mind. Call me Maki Zenin the way I’ll take down an entire clan for you. I’d participate in the Culling Games if you were the prize. Like Nobara Kugisaki, I’m really feeling some resonance between us. Like Yuji’s fists, your love is overwhelmingly strong. Even if Kenjaku took over my body, it wouldn’t be enough to stop my love for you."

      "content": "Playfully use the rizz lines to break the ice between you and your crush. When it comes to using rizz lines, Jacoby says to “just authentically be yourself.” Casually strike up a conversation with one of the rizz lines if they’re a fan of Jujutsu Kaisen , and if they seem interested in conversing, use that as an opportunity to talk about shared interests. Mention some of your favorite JJK characters and let the conversation flow from there. If they continue to show interest, ask for their number and go from there . A genuine compliment can make your crush’s day and leave a good impression on them, so be genuine in your playfulness. Jacoby isn’t the biggest fan of pickup lines, saying “I really prefer an authentic hello to a pickup line any day of the week…A big smile, warm personality, and being friendly is all it takes.” If you do choose to use rizz lines, Jacoby says that you don’t “have to be super smooth or rehearse all the time. Just being oneself–warm, smiling, making direct eye contact–and just chatting and introducing yourself is all you really need to do.”"
