      "content": "Give your guinea pig some space for the first day or two. Cover your guinea pig's cage with a light blanket that still lets in light. This will help your guinea pig feel safer and more secure while they're adjusting to their new home. After that, you can move on to introducing yourself."

      "content": "Let your guinea pig get used to you. It's best not to take your guinea pig out of their cage right away. Instead, take a few days to let them get to know you. Put your hand in the cage, and let them smell you. Softly stroke your guinea pig so they learn to trust you. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a towel ready for poop and pee. If you're worried about your clothes, have a towel available to put under your guinea pig while holding them. Your guinea pig may not go to the bathroom while on you, but it's better to be prepared. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Be calm.",
      "content": "Be calm. You might be feeling a little nervous, but try your best to stay calm around your guinea pig since they'll pick up on your emotions. Make sure you are calm and collected before you try to hold your guinea pig. Take a moment to take a few calming breaths before approaching the cage. Also, keep the environment calm. Limit loud noises and sudden movements while your guinea pig is out. You don't want to startle them. For instance, turn off the television and the radio. Turn off your phone so it doesn't go off while you have them out."

      "title": "Use the cage to your advantage.",
      "content": "Use the cage to your advantage. To catch your guinea pig, you need to gently trap them in the cage. One easy way to catch them is to trap them in one of the cage's pipes, if yours has pipes, and then pull them out. Put your hand out to encourage your guinea pig into the pipe, making sure to block the other side. If your cage doesn't have pipes, try guiding your guinea pig into their house, and then lifting one edge to pick up your guinea pig. If your guinea pig seems very upset or tries to bite you, you should wait until another day to try picking your guinea pig up."

[6] X Research source Though you can move around while holding your guinea pig, it's best to sit down while holding them. That way, they won't be confused by your movement, and you're less likely to drop them."

Make sure there is nothing they can get into that they shouldn't (such as cleaning supplies). Also, make sure you cover any potential dangers, such as floor vents. Close the door. Place them on the floor, and let them run around. They'll enjoy exploring, and they'll also take some time getting to know you, too. If you want, sit on the floor with them."

Hold the guinea pig for her, and allow her to pet the animal. [13] X Research source That is, practice safe holding practices, and let your child come up and gently pet the guinea pig while you have them against your chest. If you allow your child to hold the guinea pig, tell him how to hold them, and make sure he is not holding them too tightly or too loosely."

If another child wants to hold them, wait until another day."
