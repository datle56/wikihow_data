Fold this top into a loop, and twist the end around the rest of the pipe cleaner to secure it. You will have something that looks like a stick with a loop at one end. This will make your first petal. This pipe cleaner will make the petal part of your flower. It can be any color you want. Popular flower colors include: white, blue, pink, and purple."
