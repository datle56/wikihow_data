      "title": "Eat foods rich in zinc, like oysters and pumpkin seeds.",
      "content": "Eat foods rich in zinc , like oysters and pumpkin seeds. Oysters and pumpkin seeds are packed with zinc, which is responsible for increasing testosterone levels and, as a result, ensuring healthy and plentiful sperm. Aim to eat anywhere from 11 to 25 mg of zinc per day to increase your sperm count. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source 3 medium oysters contain 16 mg of zinc (which is just over the daily recommended amount). Every 1/2 cup (100 g) of pumpkins seeds has 7.99 mg of zinc. Avoid taking in more than 30 mg of zinc per day because doing so can cause fever, coughing, stomach pain, fatigue, and other unpleasant conditions. Taking zinc long-term can also deplete your body’s supply of copper, so you’ll need a copper supplement if you take zinc for an extended period of time."

      "title": "Take in 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams of Vitamin C every day.",
      "content": "Take in 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams of Vitamin C every day. Eat foods rich in vitamin C or, with the approval of your doctor, take a vitamin C supplement. This vital antioxidant can help relieve oxidative stress that might be causing your low sperm count. Studies have shown that taking 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C every day can increase your sperm count by 100% in as little as 2 months! [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oranges, papaya, pineapple, kiwi, bell peppers, tomatoes, kale, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbage are all packed with vitamin C. In addition to improving your sperm count, vitamin C has been shown to improve sperm motility (movement) and shape , which can make conception even more likely."

      "title": "Aim to take in 400 micrograms of folate every day.",
      "content": "Aim to take in 400 micrograms of folate every day. Eat lots of spinach, kale, swiss chard, brussels sprouts, and asparagus to get your daily dose of sperm-healthy folate (also known as vitamin B9). If you and your partner are trying to conceive, you’ll both benefit from lots of folate! Ask your doctor about taking a supplement to increase your folate levels. Folate has the same effect on the body as folic acid. The main difference is that folate is a form of B9 that’s present in foods and folic acid is a synthesized form of B9 that’s used in supplements. Don’t take more than 1,000 micrograms of folate per day because it might cause your B12 levels to drop, which can negatively affect your nervous system."

      "content": "Consume 250 to 500 milligrams of omega 3 fatty acids each day. Eat lots of healthy fats and proteins that contain omega 3 to increase your sperm’s motility and overall health. Omega 3’s have been shown to ensure each sperm develops a healthy membrane, making it more likely that you and your partner can successfully conceive. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseeds, egg yolks, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, cod, halibut, and sardines are great sources of omega 3s. If you have allergies or dietary restrictions that prevent you from getting enough omega 3 from food, talk to your doctor about taking a supplement. Remember to balance your intake of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids because too much of any one can cause health issues. Sources of omega 6 fatty acids include safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower seeds, walnuts, and pumpkin seeds.

      "content": "Drink up to 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of pomegranate juice every day. Sip on pomegranate juice every day to increase the health of your sperm and give you a boost of antioxidants. Studies have shown that drinking even just 5 fluid ounces (150 mL) of pomegranate juice every day can improve sperm motility and vitality in just 3 to 4 weeks. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also eat pomegranate seeds straight from the fruit each day for the same effect. Toss 1/2 cup (64 grams) of seeds onto a salad or make a tasty parfait with low-fat yogurt and granola."

      "title": "Eat 1 or 2 brazil nuts every day to increase your selenium intake.",
      "content": "Eat 1 or 2 brazil nuts every day to increase your selenium intake. Brazil nuts are packed with selenium, so you only need about 1 or 2 to meet the daily recommendation of 100 micrograms. Avoid taking in more than 400 micrograms of selenium per day (over 5 whole brazil nuts) because doing so can lead to selenium toxicity. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have an allergy to brazil nuts, yellowfin tuna is also a great option—just 3 ounces (85 grams) contains 92 micrograms of selenium."

      "content": "Enjoy a couple squares of dark chocolate to increase your sperm count. Treat yourself to 1 or 2 ounces (30 to 60 grams) of dark chocolate each day as a dessert or snack. Dark chocolate contains arginine, an amino acid that’s been proven to double sperm count and semen volume. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Just don’t go overboard! Putting on extra weight can cause hormonal imbalances that lower your sperm count. Look for dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa to get the most health benefits."

      "content": "Avoid eating trans fats for the health of your sperm. Ditch fried, greasy foods and replace butter and lard with healthy fats and oils. Eating trans fats not only causes a low sperm count, but can negatively affect how your sperm develops (that is, some might have faulty membranes and, as a result, impaired motility). [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Trans fats can be found in certain fast food items, frozen meals, packaged desserts and pastries, vegetable shortening (and some margarines), premade doughs (for biscuits and cookies), and coffee creamer."

      "title": "Swap full-fat dairy products for low-fat or nonfat varieties.",
      "content": "Swap full-fat dairy products for low-fat or nonfat varieties. Full-fat dairy products raise your estrogen levels, which lowers your testosterone and, subsequently, your sperm count. The vitamin D and calcium in dairy products are great to produce healthy and plentiful sperm, just be sure to choose low-fat or non-fat cheeses, yogurts, and milk. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Cheddar, colby, and swiss are considered high-fat varieties while mozzarella, feta, and goat’s cheese are considered low-fat cheeses. Choose plain (unsweetened) yogurts made from skim or nonfat milk for the most benefits. Instead of whole milk, opt for skim, 1%, or nonfat varieties (and skip soy milk altogether)."

      "title": "Steer clear of soy products that raise your estrogen levels.",
      "content": "Steer clear of soy products that raise your estrogen levels. Soy contains non-human estrogen, which directly impacts your sperm count by raising your estrogen levels and lowering your testosterone levels. That means tofu, tempeh, textured soy protein, soy sauce, miso, edamame, soymilk, and soy cheeses are all off-limits if you want to increase your sperm count. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you are vegan or vegetarian and rely on soy products for protein, switch to alternatives like seitan, beans, and legumes to meet your daily protein requirement. Soy tends to have an even stronger effect on the estrogen levels of men who are overweight or obese, so be especially cautious if you struggle with weight issues."

      "content": "Limit your alcohol intake to 2 drinks per day. Drinking more than 14 drinks per week can lower your testosterone levels and, as a result, decrease your sperm count. Alcohol has also been shown to increase your estrogen levels and affect the size, shape, and motility of your sperm. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A single drink is equal to 12 fluid ounces (350 mL) of beer, 5 fluid ounces (150 mL) of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL) of distilled spirits.
