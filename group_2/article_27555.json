[4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Tymia Yvette Makeup & Lash Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. You can even add a pinch of cocoa powder if you want chocolate-flavored lip balm. If you do this, however, it would be a good idea to add a drop of vanilla extract for sweetness as well. [6] X Research source Strawberry is another great flavor to consider."

      "content": "Heat some petroleum jelly in the microwave until it is melted. Place about 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of petroleum jelly into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat it on high for 25 to 30 seconds, then stir it with a toothpick. You need the petroleum jelly to be clear and lump-free. If it isn't, keep heating it at 45-second intervals until it is completely melted. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Add some color with lipstick.",
      "content": "Add some color with lipstick. Use a knife to slice off a small piece of lipstick (smaller than a pea) and add it to the lip balm. Stir the two together until the color is even and no streaks remain. You can also use eyeshadow or blush instead of lipstick, if you prefer. If you don't have lipstick in the color that you want, you can add in a little eyeshadow in the preferred shade. [10] X Expert Source Nini Efia Yang Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 27 August 2019. If you want to add color and flavor, add Â¼ of a 0.14-ounce (3.9-gram) packet of powdered drink mix. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a few drops of juice for flavor, if desired. Lemon, lime, orange, or cranberry juice are all great options. You can also use a few drops of essence or extract instead, such as vanilla or mint. Lemon juice and lime juice are very sour. Unless you are using lemonade, which is sweeter, add a drop of vanilla extract so that it's not as sour. Skip this step if you used powdered drink mix as it would already have given the lip balm some flavor. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the lip balm into a small container. If the lip balm has started to harden, you can use a small spoon to transfer it instead. You can also melt the lip balm in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it back up again. A 1/2-ounce (15-milliliter) tin or jar will work the best."

      "title": "Wait at least 1 to 2 hours before using the lip balm.",
      "content": "Wait at least 1 to 2 hours before using the lip balm. It would be better to wait overnight, however. Keep the lid on the container while the lip balm cools so that it doesn't get dusty or dirty. Once it has cooled, you can apply it to your lips with your finger. [13] X Research source If you flavored it with juice, it would be a good idea to store it in the fridge and use it within a few weeks. This is because juice is perishable."

Fill a small, microwave-safe bowl with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (15 grams) of beeswax, 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) (52 grams) of coconut oil, and 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) (60 grams) of petroleum jelly. Heat them at 45-second intervals until they are completely melted. [14] X Research source Stir between each interval to help the mixture melt more smoothly. If you can, use beeswax pellets or shaved beeswax. This will help the beeswax melt faster. If you can't find any, that's okay; it will just take longer."

      "content": "Stir in some powdered drink mix for color and flavor. You can use as much or as little powdered drink mix as you want. The more you use, the deeper the color will be. The flavor will also be stronger. Plan on using up to one packet of powdered drink mix. [15] X Research source If you don't care about the color, you can use extracts or essences (i.e.: vanilla or mint) to give your lip balm flavor. You can also create your own color and flavor combo with some lipstick and extract/essence."

If you are in a hurry, however, you can stick it into the fridge instead. Once the lip balm has cooled, you can apply it to your lips straight from the tub. If you poured it into a jar or tin, you can apply it with your finger instead."
