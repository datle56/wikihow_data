      "content": "Condition your dog's coat. If your Yorkie's coat is dry or has a skin condition that requires moisturizing, buy a spritzing coat conditioner to use before brushing. This helps strengthen the coat and avoid damage from splitting or tearing hairs. If your Yorkie's coat is naturally oily, you can skip conditioning since it might just weigh his coat down. [1] X Research source You can also make your own conditioner. Mix 5 parts water and 1 part dog coat conditioner in a spritzer bottle."

Divide an area of your dog's coat into sections and brush from the root to tip with the lie of the hair. Brushing against the lie of the coat is uncomfortable and can lead to tangles. Proper brushing will condition your dog's hair by spreading natural oils throughout your dog's coat. [2] X Research source A rubber backed brush can tear your Yorkie's coat. You might want to start brushing an area like the shoulder where your dog is less sensitive and ticklish."

Position a pair of scissors above the comb and snip the knot away. The comb protects the skin and keeps you from accidentally snipping it when the knot is raised. [4] X Research source Look for knots in areas where the fur rubs together such as the armpits, groin and behind the ears. Check under the tail to make sure there is no fecal soiling in the fur around the anus. If there is, consider bathing your dog, or snipping the soiled hair off if the soiling is extreme."

If you use the floor, lay out a large, soft towel. This will also keep hair off the floor. If you use the grooming table, never leave him unattended in case he gets frightened and jumps down, which could lead to injury. Before your bathe your dog, make sure he's been properly brushed. Use a pin brush to completely brush your Yorkie and then use a comb to completely brush him again. This will prevent tangling."

Make sure you wet all the way back to the end of his tail. Squirt some shampoo into your hands and work a lather from the top of your dog's neck to the end of the tail. Shampoo the outside of the ears, the legs, the chest, belly, featherings (the fringe or longer hair), and the rest of the body. To shampoo the head, start at the top and work down to the muzzle.

It may be easier to rinse your dog in a sink. If your dog is larger, you can also set him in the tub to rinse, but he may be frightened by the larger space.

You may want to buy a tiny finger brush with plastic bristles (available at pet stores, catalogs, or from your veterinarian) which may be easier to use than a toothbrush. Clean the tooth brush or tiny finger brush by running it under hot water for a few seconds and rinsing in cold water for a few seconds. Do this before using it in your dog's mouth.

If you're unsure where the quick is or how far back to clip, try buffing the point off the nail with a coarse emery board.

This is optional, as some argue it can make the ears sore and inflame the skin, causing infection. Others believe plucking can improve air circulation within the ear canal, preventing infections. Many veterinarians advise a middle path which is not to pluck unless your dog gets regular ear infections. In this case, plucking can help ear drops penetrate deeper into the ear canal."

Avoid putting water into your dog's ears, since it will soften the skin and could lead to infection. Instead, squirt a cleanser into your dog's ear and rub it in a circular motion. Place a cotton ball right under the flap and tip your dog's head toward it, so the solution drains out. Wipe out any remaining solution with a clean cotton ball.

But, don't be too afraid to clean your dog's ears. It's almost impossible to touch a dog's eardrum, let alone rupture it through routine cleaning.

Gently, but firmly hold your dog's foreleg and clip the extra hair between the pads. Cut the hair on the front of the foot in a semi-circle, leaving the hair on top of the paws alone. [16] X Research source Using other scissors may thin your dog's hair too much or create split ends.

Clipping your dog's featherings is a completely personal preference. You may want to find reference photos of looks that you like. For example, a popular cut is the \"puppy dog clip\", which has the top third of the ears clipped short so the ears stay pricked up and the hair along the jawline is clipped straight.
