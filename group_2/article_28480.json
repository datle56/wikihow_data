      "content": "Gather your materials. To make your own trading cards, you're going to need paper, a pencil, markers, and scissors. Other materials, such as stickers or photos, can be used if you want to use those as your artwork. Choose a paper with a thick consistency. Index cards, construction paper, or thick card stock paper are all good options. You want your playing cards to be sturdy so that they last longer and appear to be more professional. Choose bright colored markers to give your trading cards a vibrant look."

      "title": "Cut out your cards.",
      "content": "Cut out your cards. Typical trading cards are 2.5 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall, but you don't have to make your cards that size. Whichever size you want your trading cards to be, cut your paper so that all of the cards are as even as possible. If they are not even, then you will have trouble writing in small cards and filling in space with the big cards. [1] X Research source Use a ruler to draw guide lines on your paper. This will make cutting your cards much easier. Trace a trading card you already have (Pok√©mon, baseball card, etc.) multiple times until you've filled up your paper with outlines, and carefully cut each card out. This will help your cards be uniform in size. Using small index cards as your trading cards is a great option that requires no cutting. Although index cards are slightly larger than typical trading cards, choosing this option will require less work and give you completely even cards to play with."

      "title": "Add your artwork.",
      "content": "Add your artwork. Your artwork will depend on whether you're making a trading card game, baseball cards, or personalized trading cards. Create a unique character on each trading card if your making a Trading Card Game. Draw each character in pencil first so that you're able to fix any mistakes you may make. Once you're satisfied with your drawing, trace and color in your character with marker to give it a polished, colorful look. If you are uncomfortable with drawing, use stickers as the images for your characters. Find stickers that you like and simply stick them in the center of your trading cards where the artwork would typically go. If you're making baseball cards, it's best to print out photos of the players you're putting on the cards. Then, tape or glue them to the card. Remember to use a small quantity of glue so it dries faster. If you're making personalized trading cards, print out pictures of your friends and family to tape or glue to your cards. You can also use wallet sized class photos if you're making the cards for a group of friends at school. Be sure to leave room on the top and bottom of your card to write in details about your person or character."

      "content": "Add details to your trading cards. Each person / character should have a name as well as details about them. The information you choose to include is entirely up to you.

List the details about the character / person under the image. This is where you'd add the character's powers, skill level, etc., the baseball players stats, team history, etc., of the person's favorite food and color.

      "content": "Create the artwork for your cards. The type of artwork you use will depend on the type of trading cards you're making. Create a folder on your computer to store your images in. Using this folder, save your artwork or photos to set them to the side while you create your card template. Drawing your own artwork is a great option if you want to create a unique trading card game. You should draw your characters in pencil, and color them in with marker to give them a finished look. Once you've drawn your characters, you'll either scan your images into your computer using a scanner printer, or take a photo of each character and upload the photos to your computer. (If you choose to take photos, make sure you have bright lighting with no shadows). Using photos of your friends, family, or even pets for your characters is a great way to make a personalized trading card game.

      "content": "Design the template for your cards. Open up your chosen computer software and create a new document / project. We will pretend we are using Pages since it is a simple software. Using Microsoft Word will be extremely similar, but the buttons / commands may be named slightly differently. Click \"Insert Shape\" to insert a rectangle into your document. Drag the dimensions of your rectangle so that it is the size of your desired trading card. As you drag your rectangle, the size measurements will appear. Typical trading cards are roughly 2.5 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall. For size reference, you can hold a trading card or playing card up to your computer screen, and drag your rectangle's dimensions so that it is the same size as that card. Be sure your document is zoomed in to 150% for accuracy if you use this method. Give your rectangle shape a thick border for you to cut around. Once you've created the shape of your card, it is time to insert text boxes for your character / person's name and details. Add a thin text box along the top of your card, and type in your character / person's name. Next, add a slightly larger text box along the bottom of your card. This will be where you list your character / person's details. Use a legible font so that the name and details are easy to read. You should now have an open square area in the middle of your card, this is where the image / artwork of your character will go."

If you've done a standard card size, your card template should fit on one sheet 9 times. If you've done a larger card size, put 4-6 card templates on one sheet. To copy and paste your entire template (the rectangle shape and the text boxes together), click \"Edit\" in the upper left hand corner, then click \"Select All,\" and finally do your copy and paste. Add the names and details for each of your characters into your templates so that each card is for a different character / person. Drag the image for each character / person into the templates, and resize accordingly. Once you've done this for each card template, you should have a sheet full of individual trading cards ready to print."
