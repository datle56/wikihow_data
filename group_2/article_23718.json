Additionally, your laptop has a limited number of RAM slots. [5] X Research source Note: Some laptops have only soldered-on memory. This means the RAM components have been soldered to the logic board in the laptop. These can’t be replaced without micro-soldering, an advanced soldering technique. Your laptop’s manual will likely say what type and how much RAM you can install. If not, you can try calling the manufacturer's customer support line to ask about RAM specifications. Baron explains that you can find compatible memory by going to the manufacturer's official website and searching for your laptop model on their support or store page.
