      "title": "Get a leather belt with a buckle.",
      "content": "Get a leather belt with a buckle. The buckle is necessary since it acts as the locking mechanism. Any belt width is fine but the thicker the belt, the stronger the handcuffs will be. If you want to test the handcuffs out, you also need a consenting partner. It’s possible to put these handcuffs on yourself, but it might take a bit of maneuvering on your part to get out of them! [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the non-buckle end halfway to the buckle and flatten it.",
      "content": "Fold the non-buckle end halfway to the buckle and flatten it. Grab the loose tail end and fold it back on top of itself to create a flat loop. The non-buckle end should hit about midway on the belt, and the side that faces out (when you’re wearing the belt normally) is pressed against itself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thread the top of the flat loop partially through the belt buckle.",
      "content": "Thread the top of the flat loop partially through the belt buckle. Don’t push the loop all the way through the buckle! The non-buckle end needs to remain on the outside of the buckle (you’ll be using it to tighten the cuffs)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create one large cuff or circle with the loop.",
      "content": "Create one large cuff or circle with the loop. Manipulate the belt to form a big circle, tugging and tightening in a few different spots so the belt doesn't lose shape. You're essentially forming a loop within a loop, with the non-buckle tail end sticking out."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the size of the cuff to fit who or whatever you’re cuffing.",
      "content": "Adjust the size of the cuff to fit who or whatever you’re cuffing. If you’re working with a partner, ask them to make a fist with each hand and hold both fists in front of them, pressed together. Slip the large cuff over both hands and use the tail end to adjust the cuffs to fit their wrists. If you’re cuffing yourself, sit down and slip both wrists through the cuff loop. Then, use your foot to tighten the cuffs to the size you want. Don't cuff yourself too tight, though, or you won't be able to wriggle out. You'll have to ask someone for help (and good luck explaining this one!) [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Push the tail end of the belt through the buckle and tighten it. Tighten the loop so it’s sized to your partner’s wrist (or whatever it is you're cuffing—we don't judge). This creates the first cuff. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Loop the tail end of the belt back through the buckle to create a figure 8. The figure 8 shape creates 2 loops or cuffs (one loop per wrist). You can pull the tail to tighten the second cuff so it creates the same fit as the first cuff. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Loop the tail around so that it encircles the first cuff.",
      "content": "Loop the tail around so that it encircles the first cuff. Once you do, poke the tail through the buckle. Then, pull the tail up over the second cuff and push it through the buckle. This encircles the second cuff just like you did with the first cuff. [6] X Research source Be careful not to shrink the size of the first cuff as you do this."

      "title": "Pull on the tail to tighten the cuffs to the size you want.",
      "content": "Pull on the tail to tighten the cuffs to the size you want. Your partner can slide their wrists through the loops now (one loop for each wrist). Be careful not to alter the size of the cuffs or tighten them too much. [7] X Research source Cuffing their hands in front of their body (not behind their body) is safer and more comfortable. If the tail is super long and it bothers you, repeat step 4 to use up the slack."
