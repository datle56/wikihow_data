      "title": "Buy items that are small or flexible.",
      "content": "Buy items that are small or flexible. Small, flat items are easy to wrap. Larger items, like DVDs aren't because they are large and rigid. If you want to include a larger gift, then stick with something flexible, like a pair of socks. [1] X Research source Remember, these items have to wrap and curve around each other in order to form a spherical shape."

      "title": "Pick candy and cheap toys for the outer layers.",
      "content": "Pick candy and cheap toys for the outer layers. The outer layers of a saran wrap ball should be inexpensive. Candy is a great choice, but you can also choose goodie bag fillers, stocking stuffers, and other $1 toys. For example: Edible treats, such as chocolate, mints, or gum. $1 toys, such as plastic bugs, toy cars, or crayons. $1 stocking stuffers, such as hand sanitizer, lip balm, or compact mirrors."

    {
      "title": "Choose small gifts for the middle layers.",
      "content": "Choose small gifts for the middle layers. As the ball grows smaller, the game will get more exciting and intense. Here is where you should put in larger, more expensive gifts. Themed jewelry and socks that are in the $2 to $5 range are great here. You could even step the gifts up to a $10 or $15 value here. For example: Christmas jewelry, such as necklaces or earrings. Christmas accessories, such as scarves or socks. Money in $1 or $5 increments."

      "title": "Save the most expensive gift for the center of the ball.",
      "content": "Save the most expensive gift for the center of the ball. This is the final prize, so it should be something that is worth waiting for! Gift cards are the most popular choice, but you can also pick out something that's more expensive too. For example: A small, themed gift, such as an action figure. Money, but in a higher amount, such as a $20 or $50 bill. Movie or concert tickets."

      "title": "Keep the age of your guests in mind as you pick the final gift.",
      "content": "Keep the age of your guests in mind as you pick the final gift. Candy is appropriate for all ages, but as you get towards the center of the ball, you should consider what your guests would like. You don't want to let them down with something that they wouldn't find interesting, after all. For example: A 7-year-old might enjoy a $15 gift card to a toy store. A college or high school student might prefer a $25 gift card to iTunes. An adult might appreciate a $50 gift card to store that sells home d√©cor or accessories."

      "content": "Match the gifts to the theme of the party. Saran wrap balls are a popular Christmas party game, but you can also play them during other events, such as baby showers or bridal showers. Party supply stores are a great place to pick up themed prizes. For example: Pastel-colored candy is perfect for a baby shower. You can also use pink or blue candy depending on the baby's gender. For a bridal shower, consider choosing themed gifts. Anything in hot pink with lots of rhinestones is sure to be a fun bet. If this is for a birthday party, consider the theme. If this is an astronaut themed party, then use space-themed gifts, like astronaut ice cream or alien figurines."

      "content": "Sort your items from most expensive to least expensive. Try to make at least 3 piles. The first pile should contain inexpensive gifts, like candy. The middle pile should have slightly-more expensive gifts, like lip balm or hand sanitizer. The last pile should container your most expensive gift. Sorting your gifts ahead of time will make it easier to find what should go into each layer."

      "content": "Wrap your most expensive item with at least 1 layer of plastic wrap. This will be in the center of your ball, so you need to start with it first. Cover it at least 1 layer of plastic wrap, although 2 or 3 might be better. You can tear off the plastic wrap once you have the item covered, or you can leave it be and continue to wrap the ball in one, continuous layer."

      "content": "Add an item from the middle pile, and cover it with 1 layer of saran wrap. Hold the item against the plastic that's covering the first item. Wrap more saran wrap around it to hold it in place. Again, you can tear off the sheet of plastic wrap after this, or you can keep going with 1 continuous strand. This gift should be the most expensive one out of your middle pile."

For example, place 1 item on the top of the ball, another on the bottom, and a third on the side. Try to have each item separated by at least 1 layer of plastic wrap. Remember, you are working from the inside-out, so you need to start with the better gifts that will be towards the middle of the ball."

For example, you could have 1 item on 1 side of the ball and another item on the other. If the ball is the size of a soccer ball or a basketball, then stick with just 1 item per layer. If the ball is the size of a beach ball, then you could include multiple items per layer."

Rather than just going in 1 direction for each wrap, alternate the directions that you wrap the ball in. For example: Wrap the ball horizontally for the first layer, then vertically for the next. Finish off with 1 or 2 diagonal wraps."

For example, the youngest person could hold the ball first. [2] X Research source Don't get too worked up over who gets to go first. Sometimes, it's actually better to go last, because then you'll have a chance to get to the really good gifts! Make the game more challenging by having the players wear gloves or mittens.

If you can't get a pair of dice, then use just 1 die and pick a number to be the passing number. [3] X Research source For example, if you have just 1 die, then you could settle on 6 for being the passing number. Don't blindfold the dice roller!

The goal for the ball holder is to unroll as many layers on the ball as possible until the person with the dice rolls a set of matching numbers.
