      "title": "Pick Homunculus Amistr.",
      "content": "Pick Homunculus Amistr. Amistr is the best base for a Homunculus but also the slowest to level and feed due to its lack of offensive skills. If you have a lot of time in your hands, you’re well-advised to get Amistr. Leveling may take time but well worth the wait and effort. Amistr is a sturdily-built, tank-type Homunculus suitable for classes that have low defenses, such as wizards and healers. Amistr eats Zargon. It has these four skills: Castling. Instantly switches the location of Amistr and its master, causing the monster to change target and focus on Amistr instead. Amistr Bulwark. Temporarily increases Amistr and its master's VIT. Adamantium Skin. Increases Amistr's Max HP, HP recovery rate, and defense. Blood Lust. Temporarily increases Amistr's ATK, plus a chance to leech 20% of the damage as HP for each hit. Amistr Bulwark is very useful for MVP later on in the game. It boosts your VIT and even gives valuable defense for PVP."

    {
      "title": "Pick Homunculus Filir.",
      "content": "Pick Homunculus Filir. Filir is the fastest-leveling Homunculus in the game. Its downside is its lack of VIT. It’s quick to level, yes, but it sure dies a lot. If you don’t have time to level your Homunculus, Filir will be a good choice, but don’t expect it to withstand fierce attacks. Filir is a dodge/high-ASPD type, meaning it has a high-dodge and high-attack speed. Filir eats Garlet. It also has four skills: Moonlight. Commands Filir to repeatedly peck at its target. Flitting. Temporarily increases Filir's ATK and ASPD. Accelerated Flight. Temporarily increases Filir's flee rate. S.B.R.44. Commands Filir to deal massive damage on its target at the cost of its Intimacy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick Homunculus Vanilmirth.",
      "content": "Pick Homunculus Vanilmirth. Vanil is the in-between solution to Amistr and Filir. This Homunculus offers high VIT and HP, and has a decent offensive skill. However, it comes with a lower burst attack compared to Filir, which makes for slower leveling in certain situations. Nevertheless, Vanil can be powerful and has skills that can throw random elements at enemies. Vanilmirth is a magic-type Homunculus. It eats Scell. Vanilmirth’s four skills are: Caprice. Can cast magical attacks randomly, such as Fire Bolt, Cold Bolt, Lightning Bolt, and Earth Spike. The level of each one can be affected by Caprice’s skill level. Chaotic Blessings. Can cast Heal on a random target selected from among enemies, the master, or itself. Heal can restore the HP of the Undead instead of inflicting damage. Instruction Change. Increases Vanil's STR and INT. Also increases its master's chance of successfully brewing potions. Self-Destruction. Commands Vanilmirth to self-destruct, inflicts splashed damage proportionate to Vanil's Max HP that pierces the defense, and ignores the flee rate of the enemies in range. If the Homunculus successfully destroys itself, the intimacy will be reduced to 1, i.e., Hate with Passion."

    {
      "title": "Pick Homunculus Lif.",
      "content": "Pick Homunculus Lif. Not worthy to be used as a base since it has no practical use, Lif is mostly a novelty character. It’s useless in battles due to having low attack, having no burst attacks, and having a weak Heal skill. Lif is a support-type of Homunculus. It eats Pet Food. Lif has these skills: Healing Hands. Restores its master's HP with a method that mimics the Acolyte's Heal skill. Each cast will require a Condensed Red Potion. Urgent Escape. Temporarily increases Lif’s and her master's movement speeds. Brain Surgery. Increases Lif's max SP, SP Recovery, and the effectiveness of its healing hands. Mental Charge. Changes Lif so that her attacks are based on MATK instead of ATK for a short duration. This also increases VIT by 30 and INT by 20 per skill level."

      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. Once you’ve homed in on the Homunculus that you want, gather what you need to create it. The first thing you will need is an Embryo, which you can either purchase from other Alchemists or make yourself with materials bought at Al de Baran Material Selling, located in Alchemist Building (alde_alche 35,179). You also require the Pharmacy and Bioethics Platinum Skills. Make sure to purchase Seed of Life, Morning Dew of Yggdrasil, and Glass Tube. Purchase the Potion Creation Guide and Medicine Bowl at the other building, Gever Al Sharp, located at alde_alche 22, 188."

      "title": "Make an Embryo.",
      "content": "Make an Embryo. To make an Embryo, use the skill Prepare Potion along with the materials from Al de Baran Material Selling. Possessing all the skills needed, start by using your Pharmacy skill, and a list will appear showing you the names of the potions you can create, including the Embryo. Choose “Embryo” and click “OK” to create it. After acquiring an Embryo, use the skill Call Homunculus to summon the Homunculus. At first, the Embryo will give you one of the four Homunculi at random, and one of the two sprites available for each type of Homunculus. Keep on creating and destroying until you find Homunculus you want."

    {
      "title": "Evolve your Homunculus.",
      "content": "Evolve your Homunculus. Your Homunculus can grow and turn into a stronger companion. When the Homunculus' Intimacy reaches Loyal, you can use a Stone of Sage to evolve it. With evolution, the Homunculus will obtain a random bonus for each of the stats, increased max HP and max SP, and a new sprite. After evolving, the Intimacy of your Homunculus resets to 10 (Hate). Once you gain the Intimacy to Loyal again, a new skill is unlocked."

    {
      "title": "Use manual functions.",
      "content": "Use manual functions. You can manually control your Homunculus should you desire it with the following commands: Alt + Single Right-Click will target the monster. Alt + Double Right-Click attacks the monster. Alt + T puts your Homunculus on standby, idle, cancels all commands, and returns to the master's side. Alt + Right-Click Ground makes your Homunculus move to that location, with 15 tiles being the maximum range. Alt + R opens up the Homunculus window where you can see all the status of your companion. Note that if the master is dead, the manual commands cannot be used."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use AI.",
      "content": "Use AI. AI is the brain behind the Homunculus, controlled by an AI script that can be replaced by a custom-made AI. The default script is both poorly made and simple, giving your Homunculus a command to primarily kill everything or not attack anything at all. Therefore, it's advisable that you create your own script or use a pre-made one done by other users. To install a new AI, with the newly downloaded or created script, go to the default Ragnarok Online directory. Generally it's located in C:\\Program Files\\Ragnarok Online\\AI. Insert the downloaded AI script into the USER_AI folder, and re-log or re-summon your Homunculus to have this activated."

      "title": "Use a third-party program.",
      "content": "Use a third-party program. This is actually not allowed in the game, but some players like to take risks. A third-party program will be used to move the character around, feed the Homunculus, and even kill steals of other people. A third-party program is an easy way to control your Homunculus and level while you're away, leaving the AI program to do the job for you. Take note, however, that the player, the owner of the account, is held accountable and may be punished for using such a program."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your Homunculus well-fed.",
      "content": "Keep your Homunculus well-fed. Just like pets, your Homunculus requires feeding. Every feeding gives your pet increased Intimacy. Intimacy increases until it reaches the maximum level, a requirement so your Homunculus can evolve to the next stage. Note that starving your Homunculus will decrease the Intimacy level of your pet. Once the Intimacy level hits below zero, your Homunculus will leave its master."
    },
    {
      "title": "Observe your Homunculus.",
      "content": "Observe your Homunculus. During leveling or a long hunting during the game, it's common that the owner will forget to feed his pet, leaving it to starve until it leaves. To avoid this, observe your Homunculus and take note of the emote it shows you. Hunger below 11% will make your Homunculus show a /sob emote every 20 seconds. The player who feeds without the proper item makes the Homunculus use /swt. The player who feeds at 1%–75% receives a /ho. The player who feeds at 75%–90% receives a /swt2. For 91%–100%, you get a /wah. “Failed to use skill” gets /...., while “Failed to evolve” receives /hmm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Level the Homunculus' Intimacy.",
      "content": "Level the Homunculus' Intimacy. Intimacy is crucial for evolution since it gives your Homunculus a better stat and a chance to obtain the final skill. Sadly, the Homunculus window doesn't show the percent of Intimacy but nevertheless shows the status. 1–3 Intimacy shows “Hate with Passion” 4–10 Intimacy shows “Hate” 11–100 Intimacy shows “Awkward” 101–250 Intimacy shows “Shy” 251–750 Intimacy shows “Neutral” 751–910 Intimacy shows “Cordial” 911–1,000 Intimacy shows “Loyal” Once your Homunculus reaches Loyal, you can evolve it to its next level. To increase the Intimacy, make sure to feed your Homunculus on time. If your Homunculus is very active during battle, the hunger decreases quickly. The faster the hunger decreases, the more you feed. The more you feed, the quicker the Intimacy grows."
