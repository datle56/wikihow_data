      "content": "Unzip the presets. When you download a Serum preset bank, it'll usually come as a ZIP file. To unzip the file on a Mac, just double-click the file. On Windows, right-click the file, select Extract All , and then click Extract . If the file ends with .RAR, which is common when you download banks as torrents , you'll need to use a third-party program to extract the files. For Windows, you can download 7-Zip from https://www.7-zip.org . On a Mac, install The Unarchiver from the App Store. You can then double-click the RAR file and click Extract , and then OK to decompress the package."

      "content": "Double-click the Presets folder. Here you'll find your existing presets, organized into folders. This is where you'll install the banks you've downloaded. When you browse presets in Serum, they're separated into menus named after the folders you see here. For example, all the lead sounds are in the Leads folder, and sound effects are in the FX folder. You can add new folders to the Presets folder and call them anything you'd like. Any folders you add will become menu items in the Serum presets menu."

      "content": "Drag your new Serum bank into the Preset folder. In your extracted files, you'll have a new folder that contains your preset filesâ€”the files all end with .fxp. You have two options for moving them into the presets folder, depending on how you want to organize your banks: One is to simply drag the folder with the presets into the Presets folder. This creates a new folder with the name of the bank. If you want the bank name to appear in your preset menu, do this. The other option is to drag different types of presets into existing folders, or even create new folders . For example, you can drag bass sounds into the Bass or Bass (Hard) folder, and arpeggios into the Seq (sequences) folder. Serum preset files usually have names that describe the sound. For example, bass patches start with BA, arpeggios start with ARP, etc."
