      "content": "Rebuild your credit gradually. Over half of survivors say that dealing with bad or no credit is the biggest financial hurdle they faced after leaving an abuser. Building credit takes time, but it’s doable. Pay your rent on time, automate your bill payments, and open a secured credit card. [17] X Research source Secured credit cards require a refundable deposit of $200 to 300. They work like a standard credit card and will help you build credit, but they lower the risk for the bank. Be sure to make purchases that you can afford to pay off by the due date. If you have credit accounts, keep them open and active. For instance, your credit score will take a major hit if you have $2,500 in debt, cancel a card with a $10,000 limit, and your available credit to debt ratio goes from $15,000/$2,500 to $5,000/$2,500. Ask a reliable friend or relative with good credit to add you as an authorized user to their credit card. You don’t have to make any purchases, but being an authorized user on their account can build your credit. If you’re in debt, pay the minimum balance on your accounts, and add any extra money you can spare toward the one with the smallest balance. Once that’s paid off, focus on the next smallest one, while still paying the minimum balance on the others. Continue until you’ve paid the balance on all of your accounts."
