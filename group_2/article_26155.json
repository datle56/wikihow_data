      "content": "Unscrew the nozzle cap from the grease gun’s barrel. Grease guns that use cartridges are made of two basic parts: the cylindrical barrel and the dispenser nozzle. Orient the grease gun so the nozzle points up. Then, hold onto the nozzle cap tightly and turn the grease gun’s barrel clockwise to separate the pieces. [1] X Research source Set the nozzle cap aside for now since you won’t need it until you reassemble the grease gun."

      "title": "Pull the barrel’s metal handle back until it locks into place.",
      "content": "Pull the barrel’s metal handle back until it locks into place. Locate the T-shaped metal handle on the end of the gun’s barrel, which is the plunger rod that pushes on the cartridge to force grease out. Pull the handle straight out until it’s withdrawn fully from the barrel. The handle will either lock in place immediately with a ratchet clip, or you may have to turn it to the side to secure it. Be careful not to let go of the handle until it’s secured in place because the spring-loaded rod inside could snap forward quickly."

      "title": "Remove the old cartridge from your grease gun.",
      "content": "Remove the old cartridge from your grease gun. Once you've secured the handle in place, the empty cartridge will be loose inside the barrel. Tip the barrel over to make the cartridge slide out. If the cartridge doesn’t slide out on its own, hold onto the end and pull it out by hand. Throw away the old grease cartridge in the trash. [2] X Research source On some grease guns, pulling back on the handle will make the old grease cartridge eject automatically."

      "title": "Remove the plastic cap from the new grease cartridge.",
      "content": "Remove the plastic cap from the new grease cartridge . Choose the type of grease listed in the owner’s manual for the parts you’re lubricating. Pick a cartridge that matches the size of your grease gun’s barrel, which will usually be 14 fluid ounces (410 mL) or 16 fluid ounces (470 mL). Find the end of the cartridge with the plastic cap and pull it straight off of the end. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert the open end of the cartridge into the barrel, then pull off the metal seal.",
      "content": "Insert the open end of the cartridge into the barrel, then pull off the metal seal. Wipe the end of the barrel with a cloth or rag to remove excess grease that may have leaked out when you removed the old cartridge. Insert the end of the cartridge that you just opened into the barrel and push it fully in. After that, remove and dispose of the metal seal attached to the exposed end of the cartridge. [4] X Research source Simply peel the metal seal off or use a sharp object to puncture it to make removal easier. If you insert the cartridge backward, your grease gun won’t work properly and will not dispense any grease."

      "title": "Reattach the nozzle and unlock the handle of your grease gun.",
      "content": "Reattach the nozzle and unlock the handle of your grease gun. Hold the nozzle against the end of the barrel and turn it counterclockwise by 2 full rotations so it’s not completely tight. Then, unlock the handle by twisting it to the center or by pressing down on the release tab on the barrel, and slowly push it in. Once the handle is fully pushed in, finish screwing the nozzle on until it’s hand-tight. [5] X Research source Pushing the handle in before you tighten the nozzle completely helps work air through the gun so grease flows through it easier."

      "title": "Prime the grease gun until grease comes out from the nozzle.",
      "content": "Prime the grease gun until grease comes out from the nozzle. Point the end of the nozzle hose at a paper towel or shop cloth so you don’t make a mess. Start pumping the trigger attached to the nozzle to force the grease through the hose. Continue pumping the trigger until you see grease dispense from the end. Wipe the grease away with another paper towel or shop cloth so the grease gun is clean and ready to use. [6] X Research source If it’s the first time you’re loading a grease gun, then it may take a minute or two of pumping to push all of the air out. If no grease comes out after several minutes of priming, unscrew the metal plug on top of the nozzle with an allen wrench, then continue priming until grease comes out of the plug. Once that happens, wipe away the excess grease, replace the plug, and continue priming as normal."

      "content": "Insert the open end of the gun’s barrel into a grease tub . Choose the type of grease listed in the user’s manual for the parts that you’re lubricating. Push the handle on the end of the barrel all the way in. Then, stick the open end of the barrel down into the container so it’s 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep in the grease. Avoid letting the end of the barrel come above the surface of the grease. Otherwise, you’ll have air pockets inside your grease gun that will make it work less efficiently."

      "content": "Pull the handle back to fill the grease gun. Slowly pull the handle straight out to draw the grease into the barrel. As you pull the handle, push the end of the barrel deeper into the container of grease so air pockets don’t form. Once you have the handle fully extended, twist it slightly to the side to lock it in place. Some grease guns have clips that will automatically click and lock the handle in place once it’s fully extended."
