[1] X Research source While TikTok does plan to roll Playlists out to more users in the future, many users with thousands of followers still don't have the feature. Some users report getting the playlist feature after reaching certain follower milestones, such as 5,000 or 100,000 followers, but some TikTokers still can't create playlists with nearly a million followers! If you can't create a playlist on TikTok just yet, just be patient—the feature will continue to roll out to more users over time."
