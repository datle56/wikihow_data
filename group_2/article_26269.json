      "content": "Set up a tank for your terrapin. Terrapins grow to be quite large. Even if your terrapin is small now, he can easily grow up to 9 inches. Terrapins need large tanks that meet certain requirements. Terrapins, in addition to being large, are fairly active and crave a lot of space to roam. Aim to get a 100-gallon aquarium for your terrapin and try to find a tank with multiple sections. [1] X Research source Your tank should have both water and land. Terrapins do not thrive in cold temperatures, so make sure to add a water heater. Water should be around 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, add a water filter as terrapins are messy. A good filtration system will keep their water clean and bacteria free. [2] X Research source Aim for flat, stone surfaces, some of which poke out like islands within the water. Terrapins like to bask in the sun and will want space to do so. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase a heat lamp for the tank.",
      "content": "Purchase a heat lamp for the tank. Terrapins are unable to regulate body temperature in the wild and rely on heat from the sun. You need to supply a heat lamp for your terrapin. Get a heat lamp that can hold a 40-watt bulb that contains UVA and UVB waves. The lamp should be roughly 10 inches from your terrapins basking area. [4] X Research source The overall tank temperature should be between 77 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit, but the area by the bulb may be warmer. Therefore, make sure the bulb shines down on a specific area and does not extend the heat it produces into the entire tank. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the tank regularly.",
      "content": "Clean the tank regularly. You need to clean your tank on a regular basis to keep your terrapin healthy. Drinking water should be changed out every day to prevent bacteria from building up. [6] X Research source A good water filtration system should prevent you from having to change out swimming water on a daily basis. However, use a net scoop to regularly remove debris and, once every two or three weeks, completely swap out existing swimming water for fresh water. To clean basking areas, buy products specifically designed to clean turtle tanks. These can be purchased at most pet stores. Never use soap and water, as this can be harmful to your terrapin. Always move your terrapin to a separate container when cleaning. Wash your hands after handling your terrapin."

      "title": "Feed your terrapin a healthy diet.",
      "content": "Feed your terrapin a healthy diet. Terrapins are omnivores. This means their diet is comprised of both plants and animals. Most pet stores sell turtle pellets that are safe for terrapins. Ask a pet store employee for a recommendation if you are unsure. For meat, terrapins eat snails and earth worms and might eat meats like chicken and pork as well. Tuna and other oily fish are a favorite. Meat should be given raw and in small chunks. [7] X Research source For plants, let your terrapin snack on berries and leafy vegetables like lettuce and spinach. [8] X Research source Some stores sell vitamin and mineral supplements to promote healthy shells and skin. If your terrapin is having any health issues, you might want to look into adding supplements to his diet. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid handling your terrapin.",
      "content": "Avoid handling your terrapin. Terrapins have a reputation for being somewhat aggressive. A terrapin is more of a hands-off pet and should not be handled frequently. You need to earn a terrapin's trust before he will let you touch him. Never touch a terrapin if he seems timid or shy. Terrapins do bite and their bites are hard and sometimes warrant medical attention. Hand feeding is a great way to bond with your terrapin and get him comfortable with your presence. [10] X Research source If your terrapin seems calm in your presence and allows you to touch and pet him, it's okay to occasionally pick him up gently. In fact, you need to regularly pick up your terrapin in order to clean his tank. However, limit the contact you do have. Terrapins tend to thrive in solitude and too much handling can cause them stress. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep the tank free of feces and food debris.",
      "content": "Keep the tank free of feces and food debris. Terrapins are messy. When they eat, they tend to scatter food and do not usually defecate in a specific area of the tank. You need to remove fecal matter and scattered food on a daily basis, especially if it gets into the water. You can do this using a cat litter scoop or a net scoop as you won't have to remove your terrapin from the tank on a daily basis. This can be stressful for him and you. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand what a healthy terrapin looks like.",
      "content": "Understand what a healthy terrapin looks like. In order to gauge when something's wrong, you first need to have a sense of what a terrapin looks like when healthy. Terrapins eyes should be bright and clear. Shells should be shiny and free of any noticeable cracks. His beak should close symmetrically. [13] X Research source Healthy terrapins are active. Your terrapin should be able to move easily without straining his limbs. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your terrapin for an annual wellness exam. An annual wellness exam is important to any pet's well being. A veterinarian can check for any signs of health problems and recommended treatment options if needed. Call the veterinarian's office beforehand to make sure they treat reptiles. Many veterinarians focus mainly on dogs and cats and might not have experience with turtles or terrapins. You might have to call several different offices before you find a good vet. Your vet will take your terrapin's height and weight and perform a brief physical examination. He will likely listen to the heart and lungs and might ask for a stool sample to test for parasites. [15] X Research source You should discuss any behavioral changes you notice with your vet. Also, tell your vet about your pet's diet, tank size, heat lamp, and your cleaning rituals. The vet might have some helpful suggestions in regards to your terrapin's care. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Recognize signs of poor health. Bacterial infections, upper respiratory problems, and parasites are common in turtles. Know the signs your turtle might need medical care. Any problems to the shell, such as a flaky, waxy, or misshapen shell, might be a sign of vitamin deficiencies or the existence of parasites. If you notice any changes to your terrapin's shell, seek medical care. [17] X Research source A turtle's mouth should be free of lesions and sores. If you notice any, talk to a vet. [18] X Research source Upper respiratory infections are common in turtles, so watch for wheezing, coughing, and discharge from the mouth. [19] X Research source Parasites can usually be spotted by unusual weight loss, changes in appetite, and bloody stools. [20] X Research source"
