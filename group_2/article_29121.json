      "title": "Tie the tips of a tomato cage together with florist wire to make a cone.",
      "content": "Tie the tips of a tomato cage together with florist wire to make a cone. Set your tomato cage down so the closed circular end is on the bottom and the loose tips point straight up. Bend the tips so they’re above the center of the cage and hold them together. Take a piece of heavy-duty florist wire and wrap it around the tips a few times so they stay together. Your cage will look like a large cone. [1] X Research source It doesn’t matter if your tomato cage is bent or misshapen since the grape vines will cover it. For a smaller grape vine tree, just use wire cutters to snip the base of the cage just below one of the loops. If you don’t have a tomato cage, shape chicken wire into a cone instead. If you do, cut a section of chicken wire that’s 48 by 24 inches (122 cm × 61 cm) to make a 31 in (79 cm) tree. Bend the chicken wire into a cone shape by hand. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Collect grape vines of varying thicknesses.",
      "content": "Collect grape vines of varying thicknesses. You can either use grape vines cut from a living tree or reuse vines from wreaths you can buy at a craft store. Try to find thick and thin vines so you can vary the sizes throughout the tree. Collect as many vines as you can so you have a lot to choose from when you’re making your tree. [3] X Research source Try to avoid vines that are old or stiff since they could snap or break when you try to bend them around the cage."

    {
      "title": "Wrap a thick piece of grape vine around the base of the cone.",
      "content": "Wrap a thick piece of grape vine around the base of the cone. Start with the thickest vines since they’ll help make your base sturdier. Carefully bend the grape vine tightly around the bottom of the tomato cage so it covers up the wire. Keep wrapping it around the form until you reach the end of the vine. [4] X Research source Ask someone to help you with the thicker vines since they can be more difficult to work with."

    {
      "title": "Secure the grape vine to the base of the cage with more florist wire.",
      "content": "Secure the grape vine to the base of the cage with more florist wire. Cut some pieces of florist wire that are long enough to wrap around the vines and cage with a pair of wire cutters. Wrap the wire near the end of the vine and loop it around the base of the cage. Add 2 or 3 more wires evenly spaced around the circular base so your vine doesn’t come unraveled. [5] X Research source For extra security, you can also wrap wires around the vertical supports of the cage."

    {
      "title": "Add a slightly thinner vine just above the first one.",
      "content": "Add a slightly thinner vine just above the first one. It gets harder to wrap thicker vines around the cone as you get closer to the top, so choose one that’s a little bit smaller in diameter. Tuck the end of the second vine into the first one and keep wrapping it around the form. Secure the other end of the vine with some more florist wire. [6] X Research source If the end of the vine doesn’t stay tucked in, you can tie it with wire or hot glue it."

    {
      "title": "Keep winding thinner grape vines until they completely surround the entire frame.",
      "content": "Keep winding thinner grape vines until they completely surround the entire frame. Tightly wrap smaller vines so they’re just above the last one you attached. Try not to leave any gaps between the vines, or else you’ll be able to see the tomato cage underneath them. As you work your way up to the top, use thinner vines since they’re easier to bend and will fill in the space better. When you’re finished, your tree will look like a solid cone made and you won’t be able to see the tomato cage. [7] X Research source You might be able to secure the thinner vines just by tucking them into the spaces between thicker vines. If your vines extend past the top of the cone when you’re finished, just use a pair of gardening shears to trim it down."

      "title": "Spray paint the tree if you want it a different color.",
      "content": "Spray paint the tree if you want it a different color. It’s completely okay if you want to leave your grape vines their natural color, but painting them could give them a more unique look. Place the tree in a well-ventilated area or outdoors and apply your spray paint . Wait for the paint to completely dry after you apply a coat. [8] X Research source For example, you can use dark brown or black paint to help hide the wires and make the wood look darker. You could also try painting the tree white if you want a clean and elegant winter look."

      "content": "Hang string lights and bows for a festive Christmas decoration. If you want an elegant look, choose some white twinkle lights and wrap them tightly around the tree. If the lights don’t stay in place on their own, you can clip them with clothespins or tie them to the vines with twine. For something a little more fun, use multi-colored lights. Try tying large bows, hanging ornaments, or winding garlands around the tree as well to help spread the holiday spirit. [9] X Research source You can keep your tree inside or outside. Put a star on top of your tree to complete the Christmas look!"

      "content": "Add flowers to the vines to add a pop of color to your room. Grape vine trees are perfect for displaying your favorite seasonal blooms. If you want to use real flowers, push their stems between the vines and keep a bowl of water or damp moss in the middle of the tree. Otherwise, use your favorite artificial flowers to decorate. Keep the flowers tightly together if you want to hide the grapevines underneath. Switch out your flowers depending on what’s in bloom for the season."

Buy some artificial leaves from your local craft or hobby store and push the stems between the vines so they stay in place. You can also tie them onto the vines using twine. Set some pinecones or small pumpkins around the base of the tree to complete your look. [10] X Research source Some artificial leaves come in garlands so they’re easier to wrap around the tree."

      "content": "Clip photos to the vines for a fun rustic display. You can use plastic clips or clothespins to secure your pictures to your tree. Choose some smaller wallet-sized pictures to put on the top and use bigger photos closer toward the base. This works great as a centerpiece on a table so you can see photos from every side."

      "content": "Stick pinecones with birdseed and popcorn to the tree for a homemade bird feeder. If you’d rather keep your grape vine tree outside, it also works well to attract birds to your home. String popcorn and use clothespins to attach them around your tree. You can also clip on pinecones that are covered with peanut butter and birdseed to feed birds no matter the season. Be sure to check on your tree every few days to see if you need to add more food for your feathered friends."
