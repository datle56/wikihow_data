Repeat on the back and sides of your head. Do this once a day to give your hair a boost. [1] X Research source You can also use a hydrating oil, such as coconut oil, to increase scalp health.

Your hair might not be long enough to require detangling, but gently rubbing a brush over your scalp has big benefits when you’re growing out a buzzcut. Do it once or twice a day to help increase blood flow to your head and disperse any oils that have built up. [2] X Research source Try to use a brush with a mix of boar and nylon bristles."

      "content": "Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner 1-3 times a week. Hydrating shampoos won’t strip natural oils from your hair, which keeps your scalp healthy and your follicles strong. Apply a coin-sized amount to your wet hair when you’re in the shower. Once you rinse out the shampoo, apply a bit of conditioner and rinse it out with cool water to seal your cuticle and protect the proteins in your hair. [3] X Research source It’s best not wash your hair too frequently when you’re growing it out, as frequent washes can strip out natural oils and slow down hair growth. [4] X Expert Source Arthur Sebastian Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 29 April 2019. Hair doesn't need to be shampooed daily. If you can try washing it twice a week. If not, at least try washing it every other day. Once your hair starts to grow out, use a bit more shampoo and conditioner. Focus on applying the shampoo close to your scalp and keeping the conditioner near the tips of your hair, when they grow longer."

      "content": "Eat a balanced diet with plenty of proteins and vitamins. Eating healthy will give your hair the nutrients it needs to grow long and strong. Add foods with lots of protein and omega-3s, and consider taking supplements of vitamins B and D, which may help your hair grow longer.

Tapering your hair slightly near the temples and neck will give it a natural, face-framing look as it grows out. Go to your barber or hairstylist to get this done by a professional, or use different blade lengths on your own clippers to try it at home. [9] X Research source Tapering your sides also allows you to choose from a number of different styles as your hair grows longer, from a straight grow-in to a pixie cut. Make sure to trim your hair every 10 weeks or so. This will allow it to keep its shape as it grows, helping you avoid the fuzzy-all-over, “tennis ball” look."

      "content": "Try a fade for an edgy style. As the top of your hair starts to grow back, try buzzing it more dramatically along the sides to create a fade. This style has more layers tapering down to your temples and the back of your head, creating an interesting “fading” effect. [10] X Expert Source Arthur Sebastian Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 29 April 2019. This trendy style is a great way to avoid the awkward stage in between a buzzcut and a longer style or a pixie cut. [11] X Research source You can ask your stylist to give you a fade or try it yourself by experimenting with different-sized blades on your clippers. If you try it on yourself, ask a friend to help you with the back since they can see it better than you can. As your hair gets longer, go from a light fade to a medium one and start trimming the top. This is especially great if you’re going for a more masculine look and want to skip the pixie cut phase."

      "content": "Grow it into a pixie cut for a trendy look. Pixie cuts are the most natural style to grow your buzzcut into. Short pixie cuts need only about an inch (or slightly less) of hair on top—enough to flatten down and swoosh to the sides. As your hair gets longer, it’ll grow into a wispier look that you can keep casual with side-swooped bangs or slick back for a sophisticated look. For fine or medium texture hair, try putting some foaming lotion into your hands and using your palms to smooth it over your head. Then, comb your hair in the direction you want it to lay."

      "content": "Use a gel or matte putty product to play down the fuzz. One common complaint for people growing out their buzzcut is the in-between stage: when your hair is too short to lay flat, but long enough to give you a fuzzy halo effect around your head. To avoid this “tennis ball” look, flatten down your hair with a light gel or a matte putty or texturizer. Pour a small amount into your hands and work it through your hair to flatten it or push it to one side."

Changing your hair color is a great way to give your look a breath of fresh air, especially when you’re not thrilled about its length just yet. Consider lightening it a few shades to bring out more interesting texture, or going with a bright color like red or purple. Your short look is already eye-catching; play it up even more with a fresh pop of color!"

      "content": "Try extensions or a weave if you need length fast. If your hair is 3 inches (7.6 cm) long, it’s long enough to attach extensions to—a great choice if you can’t wait for your hair to grow out naturally. If it’s shorter than that, you can do a wig or a full enclosure weave, which attaches to the top of your head and hides your hair completely. These styles are complicated and difficult to put in on your own, so see your hair stylist if you think they’re for you. [12] X Research source Remember that it will be more costly to put in a weave or extensions than it is to simply wait for your hair to grow out. Ask your stylist how to properly maintain your weave or extensions. With proper care, these can last for 1-3 months."

If you’re not happy with your current hair length, a great way to distract yourself from it is to focus on other aspects of your look, like your makeup. Try brighter or more dramatic looks with different shades of eyeliner, eyeshadow, or lipstick, or even try contouring. Unique, eye-catching makeup styles are a great way to draw people’s attention to your face, rather than your hair."

Wearing a hat is a great way to disguise your hair while maintaining a casual, put-together look."
