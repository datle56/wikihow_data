      "content": "Attend an organized group or club. If you want to meet new people, you'll need to go where the people are. Most people find it easier to meet and make new friends in small group settings, so an interest group is often a better choice than a club or bar. [1] X Research source Groups that allow you to engage with the same group of people regularly are more likely to result in friendships. Pursue your own hobbies and interests. Depending on your interests, you could join a writing group, book club, bowling league (or similar adult sports league), gym, photography club, or cooking class. Getting involved in activities you can enjoy will help you meet people with similar interests. Get involved with your child's school by joining the PTA or becoming a chaperone on field trips. This can be a great way to meet other parents. Go to a house of worship. If you believe in a certain religion, start attending a church, synagogue, mosque, etc. If you already go to church, get involved with any religious study groups, volunteer activities, or social events the church sets up."

Look for local groups and activities designed for the sole purpose of bringing strangers together.

Go to source Choose activities and groups that you have an interest in. You will automatically have something in common with the other people. This option works especially well for extroverts who don't mind large group settings. Organizations like this usually arrange a variety of activities, from cocktail mixtures to ski trips. If you don't know where to start looking, head online and check out daily deal services (Groupon, LivingSocial) or socializing services (Meetup.com)."

      "content": "Volunteer. Ask yourself if there are any causes you feel especially compassionate about and look for volunteer opportunities that deal with those causes. You may make friends with the people you help or with some of the other volunteers. If you are shy, volunteering is good way to practice your social skills and talking to people that you do not know.

      "content": "Ask someone to set you up. Go to coworkers, relatives, or friends you already have and ask if they know of anyone you might get along with. Make it clear that you're only interested in meeting a platonic friend, not a romantic partner. Similarly, if someone suggests a friend to you without being asked, follow up and meet the person. A blind “friend date” may or may not be successful, but in each instance, you'll never know unless you try."

      "content": "Take a walk. Nowadays, few people really take the time to meet the people living around them. Go for a walk in your neighborhood and greet the people you pass. There might be someone you can get along with living closer than you realize. If you have a dog, be sure to take it with you on your walk. Most people love animals, and someone who wouldn't approach you when you're on your own might approach you if it means meeting a friendly furry companion.

      "content": "Chat with strangers. Make light conversation with the people around you as you go about your usual errands. Some people might act uncomfortable, but others may reciprocate your goodwill and start talking back. Think of every meeting as a chance to make a new acquaintance. For instance, talk to people in line at the grocery store or while standing at the gas pump. Going up to strangers is one of the most difficult ways to meet new people and can be difficult if you are shy or have difficulty starting random conversations. [5] X Research source"

Force yourself out into the world without worrying about how it looks when you're by yourself. Visit places you enjoy. Go to a museum or head to a restaurant that serves your favorite cuisine, even if it's not an especially popular one. It'll be easier to run into people who have something in common with you.

If you become a familiar face at someone's favorite hangout, though, the other individual might become curious and eventually approach you. [7] X Research source Choose a location with regular traffic yet small crowds. For example, head to a local coffee shop every Saturday at 11 AM or a low-key pub every Thursday evening at 7 PM.

      "content": "Look approachable. No matter where you go, greet the people you pass or see with a smile. Your body language needs to convey friendliness.

You might expect your new friends to be similar to you in terms of age, gender, and circumstance, but if you limit yourself to that one demographic, you may accidentally pass someone by who you'd get along with surprisingly well. [9] X Research source Just because you are single does not mean all of your friends have to be single. Build friendships based on common interests instead. For example, you might meet a neighbor 20 years older than you who happens to share your love for cooking and gardening, or you could make friends with someone 20 years younger than you who frequents the same museums and coffee shops."

[10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Ask about what he or she did the previous weekend or plans to do over the upcoming one.Showing a genuine interest in an acquaintance's social life signifies that you may not mind being a part of it. Pay attention to the person when you interact with them. You will make more friends by showing that you are interested in the person than trying to make the person be interested in you.

Think about an activity your acquaintance might enjoy and ask if he or she would be interested in doing it with you over the weekend. If you have primarily spending time with the person in the confines of a group (e.g. club, organization, volunteering, etc.), you need to invite the person to hang out outside of the confines of the group. [12] X Research source Spending one-on-one time is key to building the friendship. You can simply say, \"Hey, what are you doing on Saturday? Do you want to try out this new restaurant?\" Making informal invitations is a good way to determine if someone is interested in becoming friends, but it won't actually be enough to make someone your friend. You'll need to take the extra step and actually invite them out. Accept invitations as well. You might be hesitant to accept it depending on the circumstances, but unless you have a good reason not to—like a prior commitment or a moral objection to the activity being suggested—it's better to take the risk than to pass the opportunity by. Spending time with an acquaintance can be a good way to help your relationship grow into an actual friendship, even if the activity planned for the day usually isn't something you'd plan for yourself. If you've been invited to a group event—a birthday party, a company picnic, drinks after work—you may even find yourself meeting and befriending someone there other than the person who invited you."

The older you get, the more upfront you should be about your desire to become friends with someone.Directly telling someone that you want to be friends can break the ice, making it easier for your acquaintance to tell you where he or she stands, too. Suggest an activity that you would like to do with the person as well. Say, \"I'm going to _____ would you like to come?\" If the person does not want to be friends, it will be easier for them to turn down the activity instead of turning down you as a person. [13] X Research source There's no shame in telling someone, \"We have a lot in common; let's try to be friends.\" The key is to phrase your desire as something mutually beneficial so that you don't come across as being needy or awkward. The former statement sounds much better than, \"Would you please be my friend?\""

Casual conversation is fine for acquaintances, but if you want to turn this acquaintance into a friend, you'll need to drop the light stuff and start a heavier conversation. Vulnerability separates acquaintances from actual friends. You must be willing to open yourself up to other people. [14] X Research source Start talking about your values. You don't need to reject someone whose perspective is different from yours, but it's often easier to connect with people who share your values and convictions. This may mean turning some people off, but it'll ultimately allow you to build deeper connections. Get personal. Tell people about yourself. Explain what motivated you to pursue your current career path or describe the sorts of activities you do in your free time. Ask your acquaintances more about their lives, as well. You should be honest with yourself throughout the process, too. Don't force yourself to spend hours on a topic your acquaintance loves even though you have no interest in it."

Be proud of yourself for trying to make friends and try to learn something from the experience. Keep trying to befriend the same acquaintance. [16] X Research source Try to make plans with someone a couple of times before giving up.. The only time you should give up sooner is if you're given a clear indication that your goodwill isn't wanted. Keep trying to make friends with other people.

      "content": "Stop soothing yourself with social media. Social media is great in a lot of ways, but oftentimes, it acts as a crutch that prevents people from pushing themselves into real life social situations. When you feel lonely, turn off your computer and head out, call up a friend, or try to meet with an acquaintance. You must get out of the house to meet people and form friendships. Social media websites offer the greatest benefit when they keep you more connected to your friends. If your social media accounts only give you an excuse to avoid real, meaningful contact with people, they're doing more harm than good."

Most adults have a fairly small social circle. Even when you've had some success, you may only be close with two or three different friends. You may have different friends to meet different needs in your life. Some friends are for regular happy hour or lunches, while you may go hiking with another friend.
