      "content": "Figure out your monthly income. Add up all the income you receive in one month after taxes (most paychecks will have taxes already deducted from them). If your income fluctuates slightly, figure out a monthly average by looking at the past six months of your pay. If your income fluctuates wildly every month, moving out might not be the best option. If you need to figure out an average of your monthly income , add up the past six months of your income, then divide by 6. This is your average income. If you haven’t had a job for more than 6 months or if you have a temporary job, wait for a more stable time to move out."

[2] X Research source For example, if you make $2,000 a month, only plan to spend $1,800. Now, decide if you can survive month-to-month on your own. If you can, add up all your moving costs, and see if you have enough money saved to afford them. It may be months or years before you can save up money to afford moving costs. Be patient; moving out before you are financially ready can lead to a lifetime of debt.

[4] X Research source Consider this option carefully, however; trying to find a roommate will split the cost of rent and utilities in half, but it can add a lot of stress as well. Consider a few key issues before searching for a roommate: Would you be comfortable sharing a room or an apartment? Are you expecting your roommate to be your best friend? Do you feel comfortable having someone around your personal belongings? How clean are you? Are you loud? How clean and loud would you want your roommate to be?"

Do you have any pets, and will a significant other be living with you? Can you pay all bills on time? See if these questions influence your decision to live with the potential roommate.

      "content": "Deal with conflict in a healthy way. Conflict is bound to happen when living with others. What matters is how you deal with it. Pretending to not be bothered by your roommate’s behavior will lead to frustration, but constant bickering is stressful. If you need to confront your roommate, choose your words carefully so your roommate does not feel attacked. “I feel frustrated when you don’t wash the dishes because the room smells” is better than “You’re a slob.” Focus on the behavior, not the person. Confront problems as they arise, not when you are frustrated and overwhelmed. If your roommate confronts you, remember that they are trying to improve your relationship. Listen and reflect on what your roommate tells you."

However, there are times when it might be in your best interest, and theirs, to stay at home longer. Living at home a few extra years is a great way to save money, go to college, and build up work experience. Start a conversation with your parents. Pick a time when none of you are busy, then ask, “How would you feel if I moved out?” If your parents completely support you now, find out how much help they will give if you move out. This could change your budget. If you parents are sad or upset that you want to move out, that is normal. Reassure them you will visit and keep in touch."

First-time renters may also need an adult with good credit to co-sign a lease with them. Be gracious for any help your family offers. Take on responsibilities like doing your own grocery shopping and laundry before you move out. That way, you can ask your parents for help with these things if you have questions, and you'll be more confident about them when you're out on your own.
