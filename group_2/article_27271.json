      "content": "Talk to strangers. Practice opening yourself up to others by striking up conversation with various people you encounter throughout the day. It could be a classmate, a bank teller, your yoga instructor, or the guy ringing you up at the grocery store. A simple, “How’s it going?” could be the seed that blossoms into a lifelong friendship. [3] X Research source Keep an eye out for things that you and the other person have in common, such as a favorite band, TV show, or brand of sneaker. Topics like these can be good icebreakers. [4] X Research source Get rid of any notions you may have of separating your \"social life\" from your \"professional” or “academic” life. Even if you’re not the most social being, you should make it your goal to be sociable in all areas of your life."

      "content": "Get in the habit of saying “yes.” Every new situation you find yourself in is a chance to meet new people. The next time someone invites you to a party where you don't know anybody, or asks you to take part in a social outing that you would ordinarily avoid, make it a point to say yes. You never know who you might end up connecting with there. [5] X Research source Putting yourself in unfamiliar situations can be scary. Just keep in mind that most people will want to like you the first time they meet you. And, if you don't know them to begin with, you really have nothing to lose. You don’t always have to say “yes” to everything. If the idea of doing something makes you uncomfortable, it’s okay to respectfully decline. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use open body language to make yourself more approachable. When it comes to hitting it off with another person, what you do is just as important as what you say. Stand tall and hold your head high to project confidence in social settings where you feel uncertainty start to creep in. During conversation, face the person you’re talking to squarely, maintain eye contact, and nod or offer verbal affirmation occasionally so they’ll know you’re listening. [9] X Research source Smile! Smiling not only makes you more attractive and less intimidating to others, it also makes you feel better.

      "content": "Focus on the other person. The desire to impress, entertain, or seem interesting is the source of a lot of social anxiety.

You don’t always have to wait for someone to come up and talk to you or sit around hoping that your new acquaintances will ask you to hang out. You may not realize it, but you also have the power to set things in motion, socially-speaking. If you want something to happen, don’t be afraid to propose it yourself. Come up with ideas for things to do that you think your potential friends might enjoy. Movies, dinner dates, bowling, bar-hopping, and game nights all make great first-hangout activities. [13] X Research source Being reluctant to reach out or make plans could give someone who doesn’t know you very well the impression that you’re not interested in being their friend.

      "content": "Resist the urge to judge others prematurely. If part of the reason you don’t have many friends is because you’re waiting around for the “perfect” people to enter your life, you may be waiting a long time.

      "content": "Let go of your insecurities . Before you can make friends, you first have to let yourself believe that you’re the kind of person other people would want to be friends with.

      "content": "Pretend that you’re more social than you are. There’s some wisdom in that old saying “fake it ‘til you make it.” Rather than resigning yourself to the belief that you’re just not outgoing enough to make friends, start acting as though you are. Even if you don't believe it at first, the more you tell yourself that you’re interesting and likable, the easier it will be for you to approach others. [21] X Research source Don’t overthink things. Social exchanges aren’t tests that you’re being graded on. If you’re debating whether or not to go up and say hi to someone for the first time or add your two cents to a conversation that’s piqued your interest, the answer is yes. By the same token, don’t beat yourself up if you put your foot in your mouth. Treat life as a sketch, not a finished masterpiece. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Be your genuine self. When you’re desperate to make friends, you may be tempted to play a role or change yourself in order to please others. Understand, however, that it’s not worth the trouble. At best, you’ll be luring people in under false pretenses. At worst, you’ll be doing yourself a disservice by not being true to who you are. As long as you’re secure in yourself, you won’t have anything to worry about. The strongest friendships are based on openness and honesty. If someone is truly your friend, they’ll like you for you. By attempting to pass yourself off as something you’re not, you also run the risk of making the wrong kinds of friends, people who don’t actually share your values or your way of seeing the world."
