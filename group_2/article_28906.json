      "content": "Sketch out your cover page. Your cover page usually sets the design tone for the rest of the planner. Think about what color scheme or theme you’d like to use. Then, on a piece of paper, sketch out what you’d like it to look like, including what you want to write on the cover and what kind of font you’d like to use. Here are some examples of cover page themes to get you started: Leather-bound journal: For that traditional journaling feel, you could use a leather-textured background. Place your text over the background and use a line or shape tool to add stitching around the border of the journal. Pastel-chic : Draw vertical or horizontal lines and color them with pastel pink, purple, and blue. You can also use white lines in between each color to make the pattern really stand out. Use a rectangular shape tool to draw a box at the center of the cover and add your text inside for a beautiful journal. Outer Space: Use a starry background for a more realistic space feel. Using a shape or pen tool, you can also use a black background and add little white stars individually. Add cute details, such as spaceships, planets, and asteroids to make your cover stand out."

Most planners are organized chronologically, with a page to see the month at a glance, followed by pages where you can write your tasks for each day of the week. However, you can design it however you’d like! Here are some examples of pages you can add: [1] X Research source Yearly goals: Do you want to go outside more? Read more books? Renovate your house? Consider creating a page at the beginning of your planner where you can write your goals for the year. Monthly calendar spread: Use two pages in your journal to create a monthly calendar to write big events or birthdays and look at the month at a glance. Weekly spread: Use two pages to create a spread where you can see the events happening during that week. Feel free to use this space to take note of major appointments, daily goals, and dinner ideas. Daily planner and schedule: A daily planner can be super useful to write down all the tasks you want to get done each day. You can also create a timesheet on this page to schedule and keep track of all your appointments, meetings, and events. Habit tracker: Habit trackers are often used so you can keep track of your healthy daily habits. Create a table with each day of the month written at the top and each habit you’d like to keep track of written on the left. When you have met your daily habit goal for the day, color in the appropriate square with whatever color you’d like. Meal, water, and exercise trackers: Dedicate a page to track your meals , water intake, and exercise for each day. You can either use a list format to write out what specifically you ate or did, or you can create a habit tracker table and color in the square when you accomplished your goal for that day."

Do a quick sketch of how you’d like each individual page to look. For example, if you want to make an overview page for each individual month, use a piece of paper to sketch out its design. Draw an even grid, with seven boxes horizontally and 5 boxes vertically. At the top of the calendar, write the days of the week, the month, and the year. You can also add a notepad to the side or the bottom of the calendar, or even decorate each month with a different theme. Do you want to start with a monthly overview and then have daily planners for each day of the week under each month? Do you want to have trackers in the front of your planner, and then have a daily schedule later on? Having a plan can help you create your planner more easily when you enter your program."

Digital planners typically use hyperlinks as “tabs” so that the user can quickly flip to another page without having to scroll. Create “tabs” using a rectangle shape tool. Draw rectangles along the right-hand side of your notebook and use hyperlinks to direct to the page you’d like to go to. Use your chosen color scheme or theme to decide how you want to color your tabs. For example, if your planner is lilac themed, you can use various shades of purple to differentiate each tab."
