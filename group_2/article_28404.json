      "content": "Scent your home with a blend of spices, dried ingredients, and oils. You can buy potpourri at many home décor and craft stores—or you can make your own ! Making your own is easy and cheap, and it’s the best way to ensure you avoid potential toxins commonly used in commercial scent products. Gather flower petals, leaves, pinecones, and other plants and lay them out to dry. Drying will take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on humidity and the type of plant. Lay your ingredients in a single layer on a paper towel on top of a tray in a well-ventilated area to prevent mold growth. Try to ensure they get plenty of natural light. You'll know your ingredients are dry when they crumble or snap easily. You can forage for items yourself or purchase them. Regardless, Thakur advises using ingredients that are organic and pesticide-free. Add spices like nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon sticks, and whole cloves, or essential oils like lavender, lemon, and vanilla, as desired. Mix all your ingredients in a stylish bowl and display it in your house."

      "content": "Scented candles can really liven up a space. You can purchase scented candles at most home goods stores, but if you want to keep things cheap and avoid potentially toxic chemicals sometimes present in commercial candles, make your own using wax and essential oils. Melt your wax of choice over medium heat. Once melted, add as many drops as desired of your preferred essential oils to scent the wax. If you want to be really eco-friendly, use beeswax or soy wax—they’re compostable! [2] X Research source Take a piece of twine or cotton string and soak it in your wax to make your wick. Tie or wrap one end of the wick around a pencil, and place the pencil over your container of choice, letting the wick dangle into the container below. [3] X Research source A teacup or glass jar makes for a great candleholder! You can also reuse an old candle container. Pour your scented wax into the container and wait for it to dry. Once dry, cut the wick as needed so that it extends about a quarter-inch above the candle surface."

Then, add your ingredients—popular ingredients include citrus peels, fragrant flowers (like lavender or rose), and fragrant herbs (like rosemary or thyme).

Pick your favorite fragrant flowers, set them up in vases around your house, and let their scents spread. Popular fragrant flowers include lavender, lilac, hyacinth, lilies, gardenias, and jasmine. You can also hang them upside down to dry them and let them release their scent for a long period of time. Just avoid leaving flowers in water for more than a week or so: they may start to emit a putrid stench as they decay."

Decaying houseplants may smell somewhat putrid, and overwatered plants can lead to root rot and produce mold and bacteria that are harmful to breathe. [12] X Research source Reduce the chances of root rot by ensuring the plant has good ventilation and only watering it when needed. To determine if your plant needs to be watered, stick a dowel rod in the pot before watering and pull it out. If the bottom of the rod has dirt sticking to it, the plant doesn't need water."
