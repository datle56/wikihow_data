Bichons have a double coat that mats easily as the undercoat sheds and gets tangled up in the outer guard hairs. To keep your Bichon’s coat healthy and tangle-free, give it a thorough combing and brushing daily with a greyhound comb and pin brush. [1] X Research source Even though Bichon puppies don’t tangle much, it’s important to start brushing them early so they get used to the process. Brush your puppy every day with a pin brush, then comb the ends of its fur with a medium-tooth comb (like a greyhound comb). A greyhound comb has metal teeth and is designed to comb through medium or coarse hair. You can buy one from a pet supply store or order it online. Pin brushes are available in any pet supply store. Have your dog lie down on its side while you brush it. This will make the process easier for you and more comfortable for your dog. [2] X Research source"

It’s important to get these out before they get out of hand. Use the end tooth of a medium-coarse comb, like a greyhound comb, to work out any tangles you encounter. Start with the end of the tangle farthest from the skin, then work your way down closer to the skin as you tease out the knots. [3] X Research source If you’re having trouble working through the tangles, try a dog-friendly detangling spray. Be very careful not to get any of the spray in your Bichon’s eyes. You can buy a detangling spray for your dog online, from your groomer, or from a pet supply store."

Keep brushing up from the skin to the ends of the fur, and work your way up towards the spine.

Beginning with the undersides of the ears, brush or comb the ends of the fur first to get rid of any tangles. Use a pin brush or greyhound comb. Then, move up about 1 inch (2.5 cm) closer to the skin and brush from there to the ends. Keep doing this until you’re able to easily pull the brush through the whole length of the hair. [7] X Research source Once you’re done with the undersides of the ears, go over the outer surface with the pin brush.

Don’t brush up from the base like you would on the dog’s face and body. Instead, take your pin brush and start brushing from the ends of the hair and slowly work your way closer to the skin until you can easily move the brush all the way through the fur from roots to tips.

If you notice any issues, make an appointment with your vet to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. [9] X Research source Keep an eye out for fleas, which will look like small black or dark brown insects wiggling or crawling through your dog’s fur. You might also notice flea dirt, which looks like tiny black or reddish specks. Bichons are very prone to allergies, which can cause their skin to become itchy, red, or rashy. These allergies can also affect the ears and lead to infections, so check for signs of irritation or discharge in your Bichon’s ears. You may also notice your bichon is chewing or licking its paws, which may take on a brown or reddish appearance."

You can prevent this by keeping the fur under your dog’s eyes clean. If you notice tearing around your dog’s eyes throughout the day, dampen a washcloth with water. Wipe the washcloth on the area under and around your dog’s eyes to remove any tears before they can stain the fur, then use a blow-dryer on a cool setting to dry the fur.

Squeeze a little bit of an ear-cleaning solution recommended by your vet into your dog’s ear, then massage the base of the ear for about 30 seconds.
