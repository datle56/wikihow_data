      "content": "Choose sponge rollers covered in satin. Avoid using sponge rollers that are not covered in satin or silk. Exposed sponges can catch on dreadlocks, causing your dreads to become frizzy or tangled. [1] X Research source You'll need dreads over three inches long to use rollers. Sponge rollers work especially well on longer, thinner dreads. You can buy satin sponge rollers at your local beauty supply store or online."

      "content": "Select smaller sponges for a tighter curl. Choose sponge rollers that suit the type of curl you’re trying to create. The smaller the diameter of the roller, the tighter the curl will be. The larger the roller, the looser and wavier your curl will be."

      "content": "Dampen your hair. Plan to curl your dreadlocks after a wash, or have a spray bottle nearby to spritz your hair. Your locks should be damp but not soaking when you start curling. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Work a dime-sized amount of setting lotion through your locks. Rub a water-based setting lotion from the root of your lock to the end, working it through each strand before starting. This will help set and hold your curl. [3] X Research source The dampness in your hair should help distribute the setting lotion. You may need to use more setting lotion if your locks are very thick or long. Use your best judgment. The goal is not to saturate the lock in setting lotion, but to coat the exterior for some additional hold."

      "title": "Roll your locks around the rollers.",
      "content": "Roll your locks around the rollers. Starting at the end of your hair, roll one dreadlock around a roller. Roll the roller up the lock towards your scalp. Secure it closely to your scalp with the plastic lock on the roller. Use a hairpin to keep the roller close to your scalp if necessary. [4] X Research source If your dreads are thin, you can roll multiple locks around one roller. Note that this may result in a slightly looser curl than if you did one lock per roller."

Plan to braid your locks in the evening, as you’ll be sleeping on your braids to create curls. Try this method if your locks are too short for rollers. They'll still need to be at least three inches long to hold the braid."

      "content": "Divide your locks into 4 sections. Reach behind your head and divide your locks in half. Pull each side forward onto your shoulders, so all of your hair is in front of your shoulders and none is behind. Divide each of these sections into 2, using your ear as a dividing line. Secure the 4 new sections with hair ties. Separating your hair evenly will ensure that your curls are evenly distributed over your whole head."
