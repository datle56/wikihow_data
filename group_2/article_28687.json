      "content": "Broadcast channels allow you to reach your followers directly. You can send messages to your followers without worrying about the message getting lost in the algorithm or posting a story that your followers may or may not check. Plus you can select certain followers rather than messaging all of your followers. Broadcast channels are like sending all your followers a DM, except they can't reply back. Therefore, you don't have to worry about your inbox getting cluttered with replies. According to Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, broadcast channels are a way for creators to reach their followers in a way that is in line with how people are using Instagram these days. Today, more people share photos and text over DM than they do in stories or on their feed. Broadcast channels are a way to embrace the trend. [4] X Research source"
