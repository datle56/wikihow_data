If you want to add a website or email address to your profile, see statistics for your Snaps and Stories, and let other Snapchatters enable notifications for your latest content, you can become a Creator. First, you'll want to make sure you meet Snapchat's minimum requirements for a Creator account: You must have a public Snapchat profile with at least 100 subscribers. Your profile must be at least one week old. You'll need at least one bi-directional friend—a relationship in which two Snapchatters have accepted one another as a friend ."

      "title": "Grow your audience.",
      "content": "Grow your audience. Snapchat evaluates public profiles that meet the minimum requirements on a rolling basis and converts eligible accounts to Creator. But in addition to the previous requirements, you'll also need to show that your audience is large enough to warrant Creator status. There are many theories about how many views you'll need before Snapchat considers you a Creator. Even though Snapchat says you only need 100 subscribers, many users claim it takes thousands of views (not just subscriptions) to get noticed by Snapchat. To increase both your views and subscribers, focus on creating the type of content that people will want to share with others. Promote your Snapchat on social media platforms on which you already have a following, such as Twitter and Instagram. Engage with the Snapchat community. The more rapport you build with others, the better the chances that Snapchat will recognize you as an influencer."
