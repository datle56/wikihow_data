      "title": "Cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds.",
      "content": "Cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds. You can also use a paper towel roll instead; in that case, cut the roll into rings as thin or as thick as you'd like. Many people find a serrated bread knife the easiest for this, but you can also use a pair of scissors instead; be careful not to squish the roll too much. Sometimes, toilet paper rolls will have little bits of paper stuck to them. Try to peel these off as best as you can. For sturdier napkin rings, use the cardboard tube that comes inside a container of plastic wrap or aluminum foil."

      "content": "Hot glue the end of a long piece of jute string inside the cut toilet paper roll. If you don't have any hot glue, you can also use fabric glue instead, as it dries fairly quickly. [1] X Research source As a last resort, you can also use tacky glue, but you'll need to hold the string in place using a paper clip or clothespin until the glue dries. You will need about 95 to 120 inches (2.413 to 3.048 meters) of jute string per napkin ring. You might find it easier to cut it in half first. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Start wrapping the jute string around the cut toilet paper ring. Pull the string around the outer edge of the ring, then bring it through the center hole. Keep wrapping and winding the string, all the way around the ring. Gently push the loops of string against each other so that you don't see any gaps. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Continue wrapping until the entire ring is covered, then glue the end of the string inside the napkin ring.",
      "content": "Continue wrapping until the entire ring is covered, then glue the end of the string inside the napkin ring. If you have a lot of string left over, trim it until you have about an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so leftover, then tuck the excess inside the ring, and secure it with glue. At this point, you can also snip off any loose or fraying bits of string. [4] X Research source If you cut your string in half, now is the time to cover up the other side of the ring!"

      "title": "Hot glue a rustic or natural decoration onto the top of the napkin ring.",
      "content": "Hot glue a rustic or natural decoration onto the top of the napkin ring. Starfish, sand dollars, and flat seashells work great for the rustic, seaside look. For a rustic, country look, try fake flowers instead. [5] X Research source Flowers that go well with this rustic theme include mini sunflowers, daisies, and poppies. You can also use fabric glue for this, but tacky glue is not recommended, as it will take too long to dry, and your decoration may slide off."

      "content": "Cover a cardboard tube with wax paper and secure it at both ends with rubber bands. You can use an empty paper towel tube or an empty toilet paper tube for this. The longer paper towel tube will allow you to make several napkin rings at one time, however. [6] X Research source The wax paper will prevent the glue from sticking to the cardboard tube, and allow you to slide your finished napkin ring off easily. You can also cut a piece of wax paper longer than the cardboard tube, wrap it around the tube, and then tuck the ends inside it. [7] X Research source"

Wrap it around your cardboard tube, add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and cut it. If you absolutely cannot find burlap or lace ribbon, you can use regular or lace fabric instead. The edges will not be finished, however, and will give the napkin rings and even more rustic feel."

If this is the case, stand the napkin rings upright, and let them finish drying.

Here are some ideas to get you started: Hot glue some small, silk or felt flowers to burlap napkin rings for a rustic/fall look. [12] X Research source Hot glue a large jingle bell to a burlap napkin ring for a cozy cottage/winter look. Wrap some thin, jute string around the middle of lace napkin rings for a country-chic touch, and tie it into a bow. [13] X Research source Hot glue a pastel-colored silk rose or peony to a lace napkin ring for a vintage look. You could also add some pearl beading to the edges."

[14] X Research source If you are using fake flowers, cut them using wire cutters. Some fake flowers have wires inside of them, which can ruin a pair of scissors. Consider sorting your colors by size: small, medium, and large. You should have more small flowers than large ones. Keep fresh flowers in a bowl of water to keep them fresh while you work."

Memory wire is very strong, and it can damage a more delicate pair of beading or jewelry wire cutters. Do not cut the three coils apart; this will make one napkin ring."
