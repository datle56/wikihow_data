It leaves your skin feeling refreshed and smooth. [5] X Research source Mix up ½ cup of cosmetic clay and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of water to make a thick paste.

Let your nails dry completely between coats to prevent smudging. The best method for painting your nails neatly is to paint one stroke on either side, then fill in the middle. If you want to paint a design on your nails, do it after the color coat, then add the top coat last to seal it in."
