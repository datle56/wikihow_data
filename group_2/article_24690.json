      "content": "Karmic debt is accrued, negative karma. Accrued karma results from past actions in this life or a previous one. [1] X Research source Karmic debt is essentially the belief that misdeeds and mistakes made by your spiritual being in past lives are carried into the next life. Like any debt, this karmic energy that you’ve accrued in past lives, will eventually come due and must be repaid. Repayment of this debt can be understood as an opportunity for your spiritual being to correct the past mistakes or misdeeds. This is accomplished by growing or evolving yourself so that you can learn the lesson that you missed out on previously, and break the cycle of karmic debt."

      "content": "Karma is rooted in Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Karma is generally understood as the concept that your life experiences, whether good or bad, are a direct reflection of your actions, thoughts, and words in this life or a past one. This spiritual boomerang effect means that the energy you throw out into the world, ultimately and always, finds its way back to you. [2] X Research source Karma is a Sanskrit word that means “action.” And while the emphasis is on your actions (the things you’re saying, doing, and thinking), it is really the intent behind your actions that represents your karma. Good deeds and kind words that are carried out for morally bankrupt reasons, like trying to manipulate or exploit someone, will generate the karma of manipulation or exploitation, not the karma of a good deed or a kind word. [3] X Research source A slightly nuanced concept of karma sees it more as a recognition that our words and thoughts shape our actions. Are you persistently thinking and talking about how awful you are at romantic relationships or how difficult they are? Your actions within those relationships will reflect your words and beliefs. The boomerang still returns, but in a way that shapes the actions of your life as it actually unfolds. [4] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Of course, feeling these things every now and again is just a part of life. But if you look at your life through an honest lens and you can spot a cyclical pattern of returning to these intense emotional states across time, this may be a signal that you have karmic debt. [7] X Research source Repaying karmic debt through emotional turmoil is also seen as an opportunity to grow your level of compassion and empathy. Leaning into the latter could help guide you out of the cycle. [8] X Research source"

If one of the karmic debt numbers is present in any of the areas, then you carry karmic debt.

For example, if your full name is Mickey The Mouse, the calculation would be 4+9+3+2+5+7 (Mickey) + 2+8+5 (The) + 4+6+3+1+4 (Mouse) = 63. 63 simplifies to 6+3 = 9.

Each of the four karmic debt numbers (13, 14, 16, or 19) have a single-digit equivalence: 4, 5, 7, and 1. [21] X Research source This means that if you end up with a 4, 5, 7, or 1 in a key area, then you have karmic debt. You can try to understand why this is, or you can just accept it, and use this handy chart: 4 is equivalent to 13. If you have a 4, it is the same as having a 13. 5 is equivalent to 14. If you have a 5, it is the same as having a 14. 7 is equivalent to 16. If you have a 7, it is the same as having a 16. 1 is equivalent to 19. If you have a 1, it is the same as having a 19."

As a general rule, clearing karmic debt should also always include embracing gratitude, love, and forgiveness in the broadest sense, even when those things might be challenging. Forgiveness is thought to be especially balancing because of how difficult it can be to truly do. Bring a grateful awareness to every experience, whether good or bad. Treat others with love and make sure that your own actions are coming from a place of love. Cultivate a positive attitude. Since negative thoughts, feelings, and actions only fuel the negative karma boomerang, this definitely can’t hurt!"
