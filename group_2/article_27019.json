While you can change the flames' color to a variety of shades, it's important to identify which you are most interested in so you know the right chemicals to use. You can change the fire's color to blue, turquoise, red, pink, green, orange, purple, yellow, or white. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify the proper chemicals based on the color they produce. To color the flames in your desired shade(s), you must choose the appropriate chemical(s). You should use them in powdered form, and don't substitute chlorates, nitrates, or permanganates, which produce harmful byproducts when they're burned. [2] X Research source To create blue flames, use copper chloride or calcium chloride. To create turquoise flames, use copper sulfate. To create red flames, use strontium chloride To create pink flames, use lithium chloride. To create light green flames, use borax. To create green flames, use alum. To create orange flames, use sodium chloride. To create purple flames, use potassium chloride. To create yellow flames, use sodium carbonate. To create white flames, use magnesium sulfate."

      "content": "Purchase the chemicals you need. Some of the fire-coloring chemicals are common ingredients in household products, so you can find them in grocery, hardware, or garden supply stores. You can buy other chemicals at chemical supply stores, fireplace shops, fireworks suppliers, or from online stores. [3] X Research source Copper sulfate is used as a tree root killer for plumbers, so you can find it at most hardware or home improvement stores. Sodium chloride is table salt, so you can purchase it at any grocery store. Potassium chloride is used as a water softener salt, so you can purchase it at many hardware stores. Borax is often used to wash clothing, so you can find it in the laundry section of most grocery stores. Magnesium sulfate is found in epsom salts, so you can purchase it at most drugstores and pharmacies. Copper chloride, calcium chloride, strontium chloride, lithium chloride, sodium carbonate, and alum must be purchased from chemical supply stores, fireplace shops, fireworks suppliers, or online retailers."

Add several pieces of paraffin wax and allow them to heat until they're completely melted. [4] X Research source You can use blocks of canning wax from the grocery store or stubs from old candles for the wax. Don't melt the wax over an open flame or near any open flames or you may start a fire. Do not heat the container with the paraffin directly with a heat source, this can cause the paraffin to spontaneously ignite or explode! Using a double boiler keeps the temperature at a safe level.

Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 g) of the chemical, and mix well until it is fully incorporated into the wax.

The wax cakes work well in a campfire or a fireplace."

Allow your fire to burn until there is a bed of red embers beneath it and the flames have died down a bit. [10] X Research source For the best results, the flames should be approximately 1 foot (30 cm) high."

Be sure to stand back a bit as you add the powder to the fire to protect yourself. [11] X Research source Sprinkle the chemical on the edge of the fire rather than just tossing it into the middle. This will decrease the chance of a large and dangerous flare-up. Wear safety glasses and fire-resistant gloves when you add the chemicals to the fire. The smoke produced by many of these chemicals can be a serious irritant, especially for people with breathing problems. Wear a protective breathing mask while adding chemicals to the fire, and be mindful of which way the smoke is going."

The first sprinkle of the chemical will likely not change the flames' color, so you should keep adding more until you notice a change.

      "content": "Dissolve the chemical in water. Mix 1 pound (454 g) of your chosen chemical per every gallon (3.78 liter) of water in a plastic container. Stir well to help the powder dissolve more quickly. For the best results, use a single chemical per container of water. [14] X Research source You can use a glass container, but avoid metal containers, which may react with the chemicals. Take care not to drop or break any glass containers in your campsite or near the firepit or fireplace. Be sure to wear safety glasses, rubber gloves, and a protective mask or respirator when mixing the chemical solution. It's best to mix the chemical solution outdoors because some of the chemicals may stain your work area or create hazardous fumes."

[16] X Research source Be sure to wear protective gloves when lifting the wood out of the chemical solution.
