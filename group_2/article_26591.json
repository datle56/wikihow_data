      "content": "Hot or Iced Coffee (0g Net Carbs) For keto-friendly Starbucks drinks, a plain coffee, hot or iced, is a simple and carb-free option. A 12-ounce (tall) cup contains less than 1 gram of carbs. You can customize it further by adding half-and-half, almond milk, or cream to your liking. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cold Brew Coffee (0g Net Carbs)",
      "content": "Cold Brew Coffee (0g Net Carbs) Similar to drip or iced coffee, cold brew is virtually carb, calorie, and sugar-free. The key difference is that it's brewed using cold water, which allows it to retain more caffeine. This results in a more potent energy boost, whether you add cream and sugar-free syrup or drink it black. [2] X Research source For an even richer, creamier experience, try nitro cold brew—it's infused with nitrogen to provide natural sweetness without extra sugar and a delightfully velvety texture.

      "title": "Espresso Shot (1g Net Carbs)",
      "content": "Espresso Shot (1g Net Carbs) Espresso, like black coffee, is virtually carb-free, containing only about half a gram per shot.

      "content": "Espresso con Panna (2g Net Carbs) For keto dieters, a plain espresso may be too bitter, but a 12-ounce milk-based drink is too heavy first thing in the morning. Instead, try a modest mix of espresso and Starbucks' vanilla-infused whipped cream. As the cream melts into the robust espresso shots, it will naturally sweeten and smooth out the harshness, creating a balanced and enjoyable beverage.
