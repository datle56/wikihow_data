      "title": "A hopeless romantic is someone who idealizes love.",
      "content": "A hopeless romantic is someone who idealizes love. These sensitive, sentimental people believe in love at first sight and fairy tale endings. They long to experience a cinematic, epic love story, and they’re constantly searching for “The One.” Due to their idealism, hopeless romantics may develop an unrealistic view of relationships, and they tend to ignore red flags in potential partners. [1] X Research source For example, a hopeless romantic might meet someone and immediately get swept up in a whirlwind romance, without waiting to see if they’re actually compatible with this person. In a matter of weeks, the hopeless romantic may believe that they’ve found their soulmate, and that the two of them are destined to be together. On the other hand, someone who is not a hopeless romantic would likely take a more cautious approach and move at a slower pace when dating someone new. This might involve taking a few months to get to know the other person before taking major steps like saying “I love you” or becoming “official.”"

      "title": "You idealize your partner and ignore red flags.",
      "content": "You idealize your partner and ignore red flags. Hopeless romantics may create a fantasy version of their partner in their mind, rather than seeing them for who they truly are. [7] X Research source Unfortunately, this idealized view may cause the hopeless romantic to only pay attention to their partner’s positive traits and ignore red flags. This often leads to relationship difficulties down the road. [8] X Research source For instance, a hopeless romantic may focus on how attractive the other person is, or how much physical chemistry there is, even if this person is a terrible match for them. The partner could be unfaithful, unkind, or completely incompatible with them, but it wouldn’t matter. The hopeless romantic excuses these faults, claiming that true love will conquer all."

      "content": "Your relationships tend to be short-lived. Hopeless romantics dream of long-lasting relationships, but their idealized view of love often has the opposite effect. When a relationship inevitably falls short of the fairy tale vision they’ve created, the hopeless romantic may take this as a sign that their partner isn’t actually their one true love. They then jump ship in order to search for their “real” soulmate, rather than sticking it out and working through things. [12] X Research source As a result, hopeless romantics may have a string of intense but brief relationships in their dating history. As soon as they break-up with one person, they find themselves in love with someone else. When this happens, they assure themselves that they’ve found “The One” this time, but then the whole cycle repeats itself."

      "content": "There are good and bad sides to being a hopeless romantic. A hopeless romantic is someone who has an incredibly optimistic view of love.

Watching rom-coms or scrolling through social media posts of happy couples may reinforce the idea that you need a partner to be happy. Try avoiding these things for a while.
