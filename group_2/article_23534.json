Choosing a great display picture (called DP in WhatsApp slang) is the first step to impressing a girl on WhatsApp. Use your best selfie, such as a photo of yourself doing something exciting or one from an interesting place you visited. For example, if you love to play the guitar, use a picture of yourself jamming for your DP. When in doubt, just show off your pearly whites and use a selfie head shot with your best smile.
