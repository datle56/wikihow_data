You may want to have a back-up room if your parents need the space unexpectedly. Keep them contained within this space.

Make sure that you still provide food, toys, and bedding for the pet. Promise your friend that you will find the pet a new home if your parents do not eventually let you move the pet into their house. This is a better option for larger animals, such as cats and dogs."

Make sure that the pet’s room is constantly cleaned. Use air fresheners to combat the smell. Do not leave lit scented candles in the room as this is a fire risk."

      "content": "Soundproof the room. It will be important to make sure your parents cannot hear your pet. Dogs bark; cats yowl; hamsters run endlessly on creaking wheels. While you cannot perfectly soundproof a room, you can minimize the noise. Try hanging cork boards or foam squares on your wall. (You can buy both at a craft store). [1] X Research source You can decorate these so that it does not look suspicious. Place a rug under your door to prevent sound from going through the crack. You can also cover up the noise by leaving a stereo or TV on while you're out. Keep it on a medium volume. If it is too loud, your parents may enter the room to turn it off."

      "content": "Buy the necessities for your pet. You won’t be able to ask your parents to buy your pet a bed or to supply you with pet food. Save up some money so you can buy everything your pet needs yourself. Pets generally need food, a water bowl or bottle, toys, and bedding. Some may require a cage. Dogs will need a bed, blankets, chew toys, treats, dry kibble, dishes for food and water, and a leash.

Reptiles and snakes will need a glass terrarium, UVB basking lights, food (which may include pellets or live bait), rocks, and plants. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean up after your pet. Animals shed, and they can leave their fur on carpet, chairs, couches, and clothes. Use a lint roller to pick up stray fur. Vacuum to remove loose fur, wood shavings, or food pellets. Clean the room at least once a week, making sure to dust and disinfect the room. If you don’t have a lint roller, masking tape can also work. Unroll a few inches of tape, and press the sticky side down on the furry surface. Lift it to remove fur. Do not use disinfectants containing ammonia. Dogs and cats do not like the smell, and this can cause them to pee around the room!"

If you think your parents are ready to negotiate, introduce them to your new pet and explain to them how well you took care of it. If all else fails, make sure you have a good home for your pet to go to if your parents say no."

Dogs are very difficult to hide for this reason; do not think that you can just keep the dog inside. Wait until your parents are out of the house to walk them. You can also wake up early before they are awake to take your dog outside. They may see your dog as you bring him in or out of the house, so be careful. Use a backdoor if possible."

At first, you will have to walk your dog every two hours. Encourage them to go in the same spot every time. Give them a treat when they have gone. This will encourage them to only go outside. If the dog leaves a mess in the house, you should be sure to pick it up right away. Use scented disinfectants to mask the smell."

If you can, take your dog outside for a bath. Use a garden hose, or fill up a tub of water and bring it outside. Comb your dog’s hair before washing, and use dog shampoo. Make sure the dog is dry before you bring him back inside. You should probably try this while your parents are not home."

Place the box upside down over the litter box. The hole should form a little cat door. Drape a blanket over the box, making sure that the side with the cat door is left open. You can also stick the litter box behind other furniture. Just make sure that your cat can go in and out with ease."

      "title": "Invest in a proper cage.",
      "content": "Invest in a proper cage. Certain animals—such as hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, lizards, and snakes—require a cage to live in. You may be tempted to let your animal friend run freely around the room, or you may try to make a shelter out of a drawer or cupboard. Do not do this. Your pet may get loose, or there may not be enough air for your pet to breathe. If your parent sees them running loose in the house, they may think it is a wild animal and get rid of it. Always get a proper pet cage, hutch, or tank. Guinea pigs and rabbits can have hutches or cube and coroplast cages. Hamsters and mice can live in wire cages. Fish live in tanks or aquariums. Some fish will require aquarium lights. Reptiles live in glass terrariums. They will need a basking lamp with a UVB lightbulb. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Hide the cage in a corner or closet. You can place the cage in a corner and arrange your furniture around it so that it cannot be seen. Similarly, if your closet is big enough, you can try fitting it there. Be sure to leave your closet door slightly open so there is plenty of air getting to your pets. Some pets do not like being in the dark constantly. Leave a closet light on, or make sure that there is a small light attached to your cage."

Make sure you that you can easily reach the cage without trouble. Use books and other items to hide the cage on the shelf. This works best for smaller cages, such as hamster cages, reptile terrariums, or small fish bowls."

      "content": "Cover the cage with a blanket. If you have a guinea pig cage or rabbit hutch, you can drape a blanket over the cage to hide most of it. Make sure that there is at least one wire/mesh wall free so your pets can breathe and look out. If the cage can support it, place light objects, such as notebooks or jewelry boxes, on top to disguise it. If you have a fish tank, a wire hamster cage, or a reptile terrarium, this is not a good idea, as the top may need to be left open for oxygen, lamp wires, or exercise."

Scoop out the hay or litter into a plastic garbage bag. Take it to the curb immediately. Wash the cage down with dish soap and water or a mixture of vinegar and water. Let it dry, refill with shavings, and put your pet back in. If you have a reptile in a terrarium, be sure to spray down the glass with a disinfectant. If you have a fish, take the fish out to another bowl or a cooler full of water. Scoop out any debris, and replace the water with fresh before returning the fish to the bowl."

Most reptiles need sunlight during the day but complete darkness during the night. [9] X Research source The same goes for most types of fish. You can give them a few hours of light at night before shutting off their aquarium light. [10] X Research source This is convenient for you as it ensures that your parents will not be alerted by any lights at night time. Always double check the guidelines for the specific breeds or species you own. Some need more light than others, and some may require light at night."

      "content": "Tell them. Be honest and straightforward. Let them know how well you have taken care of the pet. If they haven't noticed, point out that the pet is not as noisy or smelly as they may have thought. Acknowledge that you broke the rules, and apologize for it. Ask them if you can keep the pet. Promise to take care of the pet yourself. For example, you can say, \"I found a cat that needed a home. For the last two weeks, I have cared for the cat in my bedroom. She is very sweet, and I have taken care of her all by myself. I hope to continue caring for her. I know I have broken your trust, but please, can I keep her?\" If your parents say no, you have to live with consequences. Give the pet to another home along with all of their bedding, toys, and food. You may be grounded or punished."
