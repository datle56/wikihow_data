Delicate fabrics, such as a polyester and silk blend, may require a delicate wash cycle with cool or warm water. [1] X Research source If you’re unsure, wash the item with cold or warm water on the permanent press cycle. [2] X Expert Source Kamel Almani Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 9 April 2021. Never use hot water to wash a polyester item as it can damage the fabric.

Then, set the heat to low and turn the dial to 20 minutes max. This should be enough heat and time to get the item dry. You can dry the item for longer if needed, but make sure to check it every 5 minutes after it's been in for 20 minutes.
