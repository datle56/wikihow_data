      "content": "Put 2 cups (250 g) of cornflour and 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 mL) of water into a bowl. Pour the cornflour into the large mixing bowl first. Since cornflour has a very lightweight, powdery consistency, make sure not to dump it into the bowl. Otherwise, it may poof up in your face and make a mess of your workstation. Then, slowly pour the water on top of the cornflour. [1] X Research source This slime is perfect for someone who has sensitive skin."

Press the back of the spoon against the side of the bowl to help break up any lumps of cornflour that form. Continue mixing until the ingredients are blended to form the slime. When finished, the slime should settle on the bottom of the bowl and have a slightly tacky texture. [2] X Research source If your slime seems dry, add more water in 1 tsp (4.9 mL) increments until the slime becomes moist. If your slime is too runny or sticky, add more cornflour in 1 tsp (3.13 g) increments until the slime reaches a consistency you are satisfied with."

Then, use your hands to knead the slime until it feels smooth between your fingers.

      "content": "Put your cornflour and liquid dish soap into a large mixing bowl. Start by pouring 1/2 cup (62.5 g) of cornflour into a large mixing bowl. Cornflour has a powdery consistency, so pour it gently into the bowl to keep it from poofing up into your face. Then, add in 4 US tbsp (59 mL) of liquid dish soap. [6] X Research source Instead of dish soap, you can also use equal amounts of body wash or shampoo. [7] X Research source Substitute the liquid dish soap with an equal amount of washable, liquid glue to make the slime more slippery rather than stretchy. [8] X Research source If you pick a liquid agent that has a pleasant smell, it will make your slime have that fragrance."

[14] X Research source Add another 1–2 tsp (4.9–9.9 mL) of laundry detergent if needed to thicken the slime. Stir in a few drops at a time to avoid making your slime too hard.

As you mix the wet and dry ingredients, add more drops of food coloring to make the color of the slime more vibrant if desired. [20] X Research source Don’t worry if you have already finished kneading your slime. You can still add food coloring to it. Simply slip on a pair of disposable gloves to keep your hands from being stained. Then, in a bowl, squeeze 3-4 drops of food coloring into the center of your slime. Knead the food coloring into the slime until it is evenly distributed."

Continue stirring until the glitter is fully blended, and then add your liquid components. [21] X Research source Fine glitter will blend into the slime better, but feel free to use a chunkier glitter or even sequins to make your slime more textured. If you already kneaded your slime and want to add glitter to it, simply form a well in the center of your slime, add the glitter, and then knead the glitter into the slime until it is fully blended. If you add glitter to edible slime, know that the decorative glitter is not edible and will, therefore, make your slime not edible."

Gently, knead the beads into the slim until they are dispersed throughout the slime. Enjoy squeezing and stretching the textured slime! [22] X Research source This method works best with slime that is more on the sticky side, as the tackiness of the slime will grip the styrofoam beads. For example, the stretchy slime or the basic slime recipes would work well for the this. Feel free to add more styrofoam beads to your slime to make it even more textured and crackly. You can purchase styrofoam beads at a local craft store or online with major retailers. Refrain from adding styrofoam beads to edible slime, as they will make the slime no longer safe to consume."
