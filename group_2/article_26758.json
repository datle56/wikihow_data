      "content": "Adjust their facial structure. The default Pollination Technician NPC, as well as Pollination Technician #9 Smith from Strangetown and Pollination Technician #7 in the Caliente family tree, have very exaggerated facial features. You can make your alien Sims have wild facial structures, or you can choose to make them look like typical Sims. If you want to create really wild facial structures, open the tab of a random facial feature (for instance, the mouth). Drag at least one slider all the way over to the left or the right. Go to another tab (e.g. eyes), click on one of the preset options at the top of the window, and then return to the tab of the first feature you edited. The slider should have reset itself, meaning you can continue editing the feature to an outrageous extent."

      "content": "Edit their other features as you like. Aside from their skin tone and eye color, alien Sims are essentially just like non-alien Sims, so you can give them whatever name, clothes, aspiration, and personality you want. Once you're finished making alien Sims, you can turn off debugging mode by pressing ⇧ Shift + M and then disable testingcheats with boolprop testingcheatsenabled false ."
