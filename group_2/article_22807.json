      "content": "Tense your butt cheek muscles to hold the urge off. Flex your pelvic floor and glute muscles to activate them. Tighten your sphincter. Keep these muscles tense until any intense urges to go dissipate. You can even remain flexed for a longer period of time if the need to go is that urgent. [1] X Research source This not only makes it physically impossible to poop, but it sends some key signals to your body. Your body isn’t used to defecating when all of the nearby muscles are flexed, so your gut should listen to your brain and hold everything in. It’s harder to hold in poop if the muscles around your rectum are weak. If your nerves are damaged in that area, you might not even know a stool has come out. See a doctor if this happens.

      "content": "Stand up or lie down to minimize the need to go. The worst possible position to be in if you are trying to hold your poop is to squat. Sitting isn’t as good for holding your poop in as standing or lying down is, either. [3] X Research source Squatting and sitting down are the natural positions for taking a bowel movement. Your brain is less likely to tell your body it’s time to go if you lie down or stand. It’s also a lot less natural for your muscles to loosen for a bowel movement if you’re not sitting or squatting. Standing will also remove some of the pressure from the abdomen. So will lying down. Even just shifting your position a bit can also help you keep the poop where you want it to stay inside your body until you have a chance to get to the toilet. If you must sit , shift your position in the chair. Pressing your buttocks against a hard area - like a metal chair bottom - might help."

      "content": "Try to poop before leaving your home. Basically, it’s best to poop before you end up at the place where it will be hard for you to poop. Give yourself plenty of time before you leave your home to use the bathroom. Think ahead! [4] X Research source For example, many long-distance runners face this issue. They feel like they have to poop during the race. Another way to avoid this embarrassing problem is to simply avoid foods high in fiber before the race or event because that causes the need to poop. [5] X Research source Gas-producing foods like beans, bran, fruit, and salad could also cause the need to have a bowel movement. Try to avoid eating any food within two hours of the event, though, or you will have another bowel movement."

      "content": "Relax, take a deep breath, and don’t overthink it. If you're thinking about your bowel movements all the time, then it's just going to make it harder. Relax , and try to think about something else. Anxiety and stress make the need to poop worse, so do your best to slow down emotionally by taking a deep breath and calming your body . The need to go won’t be so bad. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to stay as still as possible. Although standing up will help, if you start making abrupt movements or doing something that requires exertion (such as running), it’s going to be a lot tougher. Above all, keep your dignity and stay calm . Make sure not to panic or hold your hand against your behind. It's all about applying mental will to the situation."

You’re going to be more likely to feel the need to poop if you’re fixating on the problem, so don’t! Go to your happy place , repeat a positive mantra , or just talk to someone about the local sports team . Anything that distracts you will help you hold it in. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Find a phrase, and repeat it over and over again in your mind to focus your mind on something else. Another way to distract yourself is by striking up a conversation with someone. Watch TV, read a book or listen to music. Do anything to move your mind onto other thoughts for the time being. A mental task that requires concentration is best, such as playing a word game or writing down a to-do list . [10] X Research source"

If there’s a bathroom nearby, and you’re just too embarrassed to use it at that moment (say, if you’re on a date), shake it off! Pooping is a natural part of life, and everyone does it. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might feel better about it if you camouflage the smell. Spray a little perfume in the air of the bathroom after pooping, for example. Be prepared and carry a mini air freshener with you. [12] X Research source"
