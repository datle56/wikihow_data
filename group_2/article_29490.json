    {
      "title": "Choose the right t-shirts.",
      "content": "Choose the right t-shirts. What you choose to make your carrier from should depend on personal tastes and what you have available. Obviously a very old t-shirt might be a bit too stretched out to be safe, but one that has been worn a few times should still be perfectly fine. Cotton tees are a good choice because they are soft against the baby's skin and they tend to be more breathable. Be aware of your baby's skin, especially if it is very sensitive. Try to avoid using the hems of the t-shirts if possible. If you buy new tees be sure to wash them first, especially if they are dark or brightly colored as the dye can transfer."

    {
      "title": "Pick out your yarn.",
      "content": "Pick out your yarn. The yarn that you use should be strong enough to securely hold the loops together, plus support the weight of the baby. A yarn that will not stretch or pill is important for added security. You have the option of using other materials such as twine here, but do cover it with something to prevent scratching or irritating the baby's skin. You can use an extra scrap of the discarded t-shirt parts to make a cover by simply snipping off a piece, folding it in half so that the raw edges are not showing and then tying it around the yarn or twine. This also can be done for pure aesthetic purposes as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. All that you will need for this project are: three t-shirts, one piece of yarn and a pair of scissors. The t-shirts should be pre-washed if they are new and should be in your regular size or perhaps, one size up. Do not think that you need to make the carrier too big, because the material will relax slightly and this will make the carrier too large for safety."

    {
      "title": "Cut all three t-shirts armpit to armpit, directly across.",
      "content": "Cut all three t-shirts armpit to armpit, directly across. This will give you three fabric tubes. Save the top portions for other projects if you are so inclined."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take two of the tubes and tie them together in one spot, end to end.",
      "content": "Take two of the tubes and tie them together in one spot, end to end. If you are standing over top of your workspace you should be looking at two oval (or circular) shapes very close together. This is the step where the yarn will come in - gather the yarn around both tubes, going up and through the middle so that when they are tied the two form what will look like a figure eight. Tie the yarn several times so that it is very secure and then cut off the excess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay the third fabric tube out flat.",
      "content": "Lay the third fabric tube out flat. With your scissors cut from the top, left hand corner and then diagonally to the bottom right hand corner, but only through the top part of the tube. What you will end up with is a wide piece with two narrow flaps in front. This may sound confusing at first, but it is really quite simple. With the tube laid flat you have a top and a bottom part. The bottom part will be the part which is laying on the surface you are working from. Only cut the top part diagonally across, cutting from top to bottom."

    {
      "title": "Take the tied loops and put them both over your head.",
      "content": "Take the tied loops and put them both over your head. Let them fall to your waist. The tied section should form an X and this part will be on your back to help distribute weight and make the carrier more stable and more comfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take one loop and place it over your arm and up to your shoulder and then repeat with the other loop to the other side.",
      "content": "Take one loop and place it over your arm and up to your shoulder and then repeat with the other loop to the other side. This is one of the reasons that using different colored t-shirts is suggested - this way, you know that you have the blue loop (for instance) on your left shoulder and the red one on the right shoulder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your baby in the carrier.",
      "content": "Place your baby in the carrier. Take the baby and slide him down your chest and then place one leg into each loop. Make sure that both legs are not in the same loop. Once his legs are in the proper place you should spread out the material to give him support and to prevent painful bunching."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position your baby correctly.",
      "content": "Position your baby correctly. While the carrier is a great way to carry your baby, you'll need to be sure that you have positioned him correctly. Until he is six months old or so, you will want the baby to face inward rather than outward to prevent problems with the hip. Follow these positioning tips: The baby should appear to be “seated” with his knees coming just above his bottom and comfortably bent. You can tell if the baby is in the proper position on your chest if you can bend and kiss his head without strain. The baby’s knees should be wide apart instead of forced inward. A good carrier keeps the hips and knees spread and supports the thighs. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use the third t-shirt piece to secure your baby’s bottom.",
      "content": "Use the third t-shirt piece to secure your baby’s bottom. Take the third t-shirt piece and wrap the widest part (the back side of the tube) around the baby’s bottom and lower back area. Wrap the two flaps around your own waist and tie them securely to help support the baby. This will also provide some additional support for your own lower back and should make the carrier much more comfortable to wear. Again, spread out the material to prevent bunching. Now you are ready to go with your easy, no-sew baby wrap carrier."
