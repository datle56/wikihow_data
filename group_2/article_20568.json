      "content": "Check your email for your shipping confirmation. Whenever you make an online purchase , getting a tracking number is as easy as keeping an eye on your inbox. In most cases, you'll receive an email saying that your package has been shipped within 1-3 days. If you haven’t received a shipping confirmation within 3 days, message the seller and ask them to confirm that it's been scheduled for delivery. Be sure to dig through your spam and trash folders, as well. Shipping confirmations from unknown senders can sometimes end up in one of these mailboxes by mistake. [1] X Research source Once you get your shipping confirmation, save it to your archives. It's useful to have your transaction history on file in case your package never arrives, or a dispute arises between you and the seller."

Most tracking numbers are between 10 and 30 digits long, and each one is uniquely generated for a specific order. You’ll use your tracking number to keep up with the status of your shipment. [2] X Research source Your tracking number may be listed under a heading that says something like “Track This Order” or “Track Your Package.” Be aware that you won’t receive a tracking number until the order has actually shipped. If your order is still being processed or there’s a separate handling period, you won’t be able to track it until it’s in the mail. [3] X Research source"

There, you’ll find all the information you need on your package’s shipping status and current location. [4] X Research source If you’re having trouble locating your tracking number, look for the tell-tale blue underlined text. One of these links is most likely your tracking info.
