They should be happy to help you confirm whether another cat is or is not an Oriental. Run an internet search for breeders of Orientals or Siamese cats in your area. Call them and ask if they’ll help you identify a cat. If you have trouble finding a breeder in your area, you may be able to contact one in another region who will look at photos and give you their assessment.
