      "content": "Decide on the right size for the kit. Consider how and when the kit will most likely be used and where it will be stored. Also, consider the age of your child and what they can carry. A manageable size for a container that would still be able to contain the necessary items for your kid is a case the size of a shoebox. For example, you might use an old lunchbox for the kit. If you're making a first aid kit for your child to bring on school trips, make sure it's small enough to fit in their backpack or gear bag. If you are making a kit to keep at home, be sure it won’t be too big or cumbersome for your child to pull the kit from wherever it is stored. Only teach your child to use the kit if you think they're responsible enough to understand.

      "content": "Choose the appropriate container material. First aid kits can come in a variety of sizes and are built from a variety of materials. Choosing the right material for your first aid kit should again be based on how the kit will be used by your child. For example, lightweight plastic might work well for kits that your child travels with, but a sturdy metal tin might be great for a home kit. Some additional considerations: [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Consider using a container that has a handle to make it easier for the child to transport it from one place to another. Make sure the container is not made of anything that will be too heavy for the child to lift once it is full of first aid items. Translucent containers will make it easier to keep track of items that need to be replaced. Look for a waterproof container so that none of the items inside get damaged."

      "title": "Make sure the container can be locked.",
      "content": "Make sure the container can be locked. When not in use, you want to make sure that the contents of the first aid kit are unable to be tampered with by any younger children in the house who aren't mature enough to use the kit. A clasp or lock will also ensure that the kit does not open easily during transportation. You want to be sure that the clasp is one that the child can open quickly in case of an emergency. [3] X Research source Try to find a container that has the same type of clasp found on children’s lunch boxes. Since the kit will probably not be used very often, it is also a good idea to practice opening this lock with your child so they remember how to open it in an emergency. Don't teach your child to use the kit until you think they're ready to use it responsibly."

      "title": "Label the box as a children’s first-aid kit.",
      "content": "Label the box as a children’s first-aid kit. The kit should be labeled clearly as a first aid kit for kids. Using a bright label, such as in red, will make the kit stand out within a crowded locker or cabinet. You should also paint or affix a symbol to show that it should be used for first aid, which is typically designated by a medical emblem or a cross (usually in white against a red background or vice versa). [4] X Research source It is important to label the children’s kit so it is distinct from an adults’ first aid kit. For example, also label the kit with the child’s name (e.g., KATIE’S FIRST AID KIT). Consider keeping the adult first aid kit high up where it can’t be accessed by the children in the house, and be sure it has a more advanced lock or clasp on it so it is childproof. This is because your adult first aid kit will likely contain supplies that aren't appropriate for a child, such as medicated ointments. Teach your child to only use their first aid kit."

      "title": "Affix emergency numbers to the kit.",
      "content": "Affix emergency numbers to the kit. In addition to stocking the kit with first aid items, it is also a great idea to include any emergency numbers your child might need in an emergency. Collect the telephone numbers for the local emergency room, 9-1-1, Poison Control, your contact information, and the number for a trusted neighbor, family member, or friend. Each number should be clearly printed underneath the name of the location or person. Consider including a small icon or picture for each location or person. This will help your child easily locate the number they need in a stressful emergency situation. Review the icons and the list of numbers with the children who will use the kit so that they are aware of which contact is which, and how to dial the numbers, and who to call in certain situations. Although it's unlikely your child will need the information, it's best to teach them how to use it in case of emergency. In most cases, your child will use their kit to find a bandaid, but it's best to be prepared."

This list will not only help you stock the new kit initially, it will also help you keep track of what items have been used and need to be replaced, expiration dates, and whether or not any items or medications are missing. You should also review this list with your child as you stock the first aid kit, explaining to them what each item is, what is for, and how to use it. Consider the age of your child. For example, a kit for a child who's 5-10 years-old might include mostly bandaids, antiseptic towelettes, and possibly instant cold packs. However, a kit for a pre-teen or teen might also be stocked with medicated ointment, sterile gauze, medical tape, an ACE bandage, a thermometer, eye wash, calamine lotion, aloe vera gel, and cough drops. If your child takes a medication and knows how to administer it themselves, you might include it in the kit."

If your kit does not already have dividers built in, put all of the bandages in a clear plastic bag labeled “BANDAGES” with permanent marker. You can also purchase smaller plastic containers to stack within the first aid kit, also labeling the container for bandages with permanent marker. The Red Cross recommends including the following types of bandages and dressings in first aid kits: [5] X Research source 2 absorbent compress dressings (5 x 9 inches) 25 adhesive bandages of various sizes 5 sterile gauze pads (3 x 3”) 5 sterile gauze pads (4 x 4”) Gauze roll Roll of cloth adhesive tape One 3” wide and one 4” wide roller bandages (“ACE bandage”) for wrapping wrist, elbow, ankle, and knee injuries 2 triangular bandages Sterile cotton balls and cotton-tipped swabs"

Again, keep these tools in the same area within your kit, keeping them within a separate, labeled clear plastic bag or container for ease of use. Some suggested medical tools to include: [6] X Research source Small, sharp scissors with rounded, child-safe tips Tweezers, for removing splinters and such 2 pairs of non-latex gloves Non-mercury oral thermometer CPR breathing barrier mask (with one-way valve), if they're trained in CPR Instant cold compress Instant hot pack Hand sanitizer 5 antiseptic wipe packets or antiseptic spray (for external cleaning only) Zip-close plastic bags (to dispose of medical waste)"

You should also include a measuring cup for any liquid medication, and consider labeling each medicine with the required dosages.

A pictogram can be printed out from images found online to show how each item in the kit should be used, in picture form. Go through each pictogram with your child in detail before putting it in the first aid kit.
