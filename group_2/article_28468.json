You can use your house phone or borrow a phone from another person. Make sure to ask for permission when using someone elseâ€™s phone If the call immediately fails or goes to a mailbox to leave a message, the signal may have failed, and you may need to try again, or the phone is turned off and will not make a sound. If the phone is ringing but you do not hear a ringtone, a phone that is set to silent may be set to vibrate. Listen for a faint hum from your phone while moving around the house or area to make the device more audible. If placed in vibration mode, you may hear it vibrating against other surfaces, such as a table. Try to look around areas you use frequently. The phone may have fallen behind a table or furniture or is buried under other objects, which could make it difficult to hear the device."
