      "title": "Measure the slope, or pitch, of your roof.",
      "content": "Measure the slope, or pitch, of your roof. Most skylights are manufactured with specific roof pitches in mind. It is important to measure the pitch of your roof before purchasing your skylight. Use a level with a ruler on the side to measure the roof run and height to calculate the pitch of your roof. From the side of the house measure from the corner along the wall 12 inches (30.5 cm) and mark the spot with a pencil. Make sure that this line is level using the bubble on your level. Then use a tape measure to measure the distance between the mark and the underside of the roof. Your roof ratio will be this vertical length divided by 12 (for 12 inches). Some skylights are also designed specifically for use on corrugated metal roofs."

      "content": "Mark the location for the skylight from the inside. While inside your house mark the location of choice in the wall. [1] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. Use a hammer to make a small hole in the ceiling in the chosen location. This way you can check if there is any special plumbing or electrical wires at this location. If there is anything in the way, it is usually easier to simply choose a new place for the skylight. Otherwise, it is possible to re-route plumbing and wires around the location. The opening should fit in between 2 rafters to prevent structural damage. If you are installing a skylight on a corrugated metal roof then it should be positioned just below the lap of the roofing and aligned with the grooves on the skylight fins."

      "title": "Cut through the ceiling from inside.",
      "content": "Cut through the ceiling from inside. If you have significant space between the ceiling and roof or have an attic to push through then you will have to cut the ceiling from the inside. Otherwise you should be able to make one cut from the top of the roof through all the layers. Remove any drywall and insulation you cut through."

      "title": "Drive four screws from the inside through the roof.",
      "content": "Drive four screws from the inside through the roof. After you make sure there is no plumbing or wires in the way and cut a hole in the ceiling you should drive four deck screws through the roof at each corner. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go up to the roof and remove shingles from the area.",
      "content": "Go up to the roof and remove shingles from the area. Strip the shingles from the rectangle plus at least 7 inches (18 cm) on each side. This way you won’t cut through and damage the shingles and therefore can use them again later after installing the skylight.

    {
      "title": "Mark the sides of your skylight and make the cuts.",
      "content": "Mark the sides of your skylight and make the cuts. Use chalk line between each of the four screws to mark a rectangle where you will cut through the roof. Use a circular saw to cut through three of the sides of your rectangle. Be careful not to put weight on the cutout. These roof cuts are not reversible so make sure they are accurate. If making cuts on a corrugated metal roof you will need a special blade to cut metal."

      "title": "Cut through the fourth edge of your cutout.",
      "content": "Cut through the fourth edge of your cutout. Have someone hold the cutout up from the inside while you make the fourth cut. This prevents the cutout from falling and damaging your floor or furniture."

      "title": "Prepare the opening.",
      "content": "Prepare the opening. There are two types of skylight: those that have a frame in place and those that are mounted on a curb. For those that have a frame in place, the sheathing is a layer that will fit beneath your skylight to help prevent water leaks. For curb-mounted skylights you will need to secure two by sixes (5 cm by 15 cm) along the edges of the opening. To attach the sheathing for frame in place skylights, nail it down around the perimeter of the opening on top of the roof. [4] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. Then attach a strip of self-adhesive membrane along the bottom edge of the opening. One inch (2.5 cm) of this adhesive should be folded over the edge into the opening of the roof. To create the curb for curb-mounted skylights you must measure the sides of the opening and cut four 2x6s (5 cm by 15 cm) to fit along the upper edges. Nail the four pieces together into the shape of a rectangle. Make sure this box is square and then toenail it into place around the roof opening. Toenailing involves driving the nails in at an angle to securely attach the curb to the roof."

      "title": "Pass the skylight's frame through the rough opening to get it onto the roof.",
      "content": "Pass the skylight's frame through the rough opening to get it onto the roof. Ask someone to hold the frame from the inside of the opening and bring it through the opening onto the roof. This way the skylight is secure and reduces the chance of dropping it or causing damage to the window. Be careful when working with the skylight at this point so that you do not damage it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower the skylight into place.",
      "content": "Lower the skylight into place. Rest the skylight against the bottom edge of the opening first and then lower the light onto the roof. If the skylight is curb-mounted then you will need to lift window over the curbs and rest it on top of the sills. Skylights for corrugated metal must be slid under the upper flap of the roof. To slide it under the top flap of roof you will need to make two cuts in the roofing so that the skylight can be slid into location. This protects the roof from water leakage."

      "title": "Secure the skylight to the roof.",
      "content": "Secure the skylight to the roof. Put 2-inch (5 cm) screws through the metal brackets on the frame's sides. Drive the screws through the skylight's neighboring rafters for frame in place skylights. Curb-mounted skylights will be attached directly to the curb. Skylights in corrugated metal roofs will be secured with 1 ¼ inch (31 mm) self-tapping sheet metal screws at 3 inch (7.5 cm) intervals."

      "content": "Staple roofing felt onto the roof all around the skylight's edges. Staple 18 inch (46 cm) wide roofing felt onto the roof up close to the edges of the skylight. Make sure it surrounds the entire perimeter of the skylight."

      "title": "Add the membrane around the edges of the skylight.",
      "content": "Add the membrane around the edges of the skylight. Some skylights will recommend a membrane around the edges of the skylight frame or curb that extends 6 inches (15 cm) past the skylight’s sides. This membrane will act a little like tape and will provide another barrier against leaks. Start at the bottom edge when applying the membrane. Allow the ends of the membrane to extend past the corners. Then cut the membrane at a 45 degree angle from both corners to create two points. Secure the bottom point to the roof and the top point around the corner of the skylight frame. After applying the membrane on the bottom, put it on the sides and then last on the top edge of the skylight. Skylights in corrugated roofs should be sealed using roofing-grade silicone sealant. Apply a generous amount of sealant around the opening 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edges. [5] X Research source"

Nail it to the side edges of the frame or curb of the skylight. The roofing felt and step flashing helps keep water from leaking around the skylight. The bottom sill flashing for skylights with a frame in place will be nailed directly to the roof at the top outside corners of the sill. The flashing of curb-mounted skylights will never be nailed to the roof. These flashings should only be nailed to the sides of the curb."

Nail it in on the top outside counter and cover with a shingle. Continue with the rest of the step flashing. For the next piece, overlap the next step flashing piece on top of the shingle, again securing with a nail on the top outside corner. Place another shingle on top of that step flashing piece. Continue alternating step flashing pieces and shingles on both sides of the skylight."

This is essential for preventing water leaks through your skylight so be careful to install the counterflashing correctly. The counterflashing should simply snap into place. Counter-flashing is essential for protecting against wind-blown rain and snow."

These four 2x4 (5x10 cm) pieces of wood will form the basic frame for the light shaft.
