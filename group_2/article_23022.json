      "content": "A standard pallet usually holds 65-70 average-size bags of mulch. Unfortunately there isn’t a universal size for either pallets or mulch bags, but the most common pallet is 40 in × 48 in (100 cm × 120 cm) and the most common volume for a bag of mulch is 2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 ) . Using these common parameters, 65-70 bags per pallet is a good estimate. That said, always ask the retailer before buying , because one company might define a “full pallet” as containing nearly 80 bags, [1] X Research source while another sets it at just 35 bags. [2] X Research source To add another complication here, not all mulch bags have a 2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 ) volume—you may be dealing with 1.5 cu ft (0.042 m 3 ), 2.8 cu ft (0.079 m 3 ), or 3 cu ft (0.085 m 3 ) bags. So check carefully before buying!"

      "content": "You’ll need to buy 14 standard bags of mulch to get 1 cu yd (0.76 m 3 ). When people talk about a “yard” of mulch, they mean a volume of 1 cu yd (0.76 m 3 ). Here’s a quick rundown of the math used to get the answer of 14 bags: [3] X Research source The most common mulch bag volume is 2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 ). 27 cu ft (0.76 m 3 ) equals 1 cu yd (0.76 m 3 ). 27 cu ft (0.76 m 3 ) / 2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 ) = 13.5 (So technically you only need 13 + 1/2 bags of mulch—but good luck buying a half bag!)"

      "content": "Use an online mulch calculator to simplify the process. If you’d rather do more mulching and less math, find a good online mulch calculator . Simply input the area you plan to cover (in square feet or square meters) and your intended mulch depth (in inches or centimeters), then let the calculator determine how many bags you’ll need. For example, if you input 210 sq ft (20 m 2 ) at 3 in (7.6 cm), a mulch calculator will tell you to buy 26.3 [2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 )] bags. (But buy 27 or, better yet, 28 to be sure you have enough mulch!) If you’re dealing with an irregularly-shaped space that makes it hard to measure the area , do your best to estimate the area to be covered. An educational site that helps students estimate the area of irregular shapes can be a really helpful resource."

      "content": "Estimate 13.5 bags per 100 sq ft (9.3 m 2 ) to do the calculations yourself. The landscaper’s rule of thumb is to estimate 1 cu yd (0.76 m 3 ) of mulch—or 13.5 [2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 )] bags—for every 100 sq ft (9.3 m 2 ) at a depth of 3 in (7.6 cm). So use that as the baseline for your calculations. [4] X Research source For example, a 6 ft × 8 ft (1.8 m × 2.4 m) planting bed equals 48 sq ft (4.5 m 2 ). So you’ll need 0.48 cu yd (0.37 m 3 ) of mulch, or about 7 standard bags (0.48 x 13.5 = 6.48), to cover it. For a deeper layer than the typical 3 in (7.6 cm), measure all three elements (length, width, and depth) in feet to get a cubic footage estimate, then convert it to cubic yards by dividing by 27 (or multiply by 0.000001 to convert from cubic centimeters to cubic meters). For example: 8 ft (L) x 6 ft (W) x 0.5 ft (D) = 24 cubic feet; 24 / 27 = 0.89 cubic yards; 13.5 x 0.89 = 12 standard bags of mulch. What if you want to mulch a circular area, like around a tree? Measure the radius (half the diameter), then use the formula A = π r 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}} to get the area: If r = 4 ft (1.2 m), A = 3.14 x 16 = 50.24 sq ft (4.667 m 2 )"

      "content": "It varies greatly, but you can very roughly estimate 2,300 lb (1,000 kg). A bone-dry 2 cu ft (0.057 m 3 ) bag of mulch usually weighs around 20 lb (9.1 kg), but it can weigh 50 lb (23 kg) if the mulch is soaking wet from rain seeping into the bag. So here’s a very general estimate of the weight of a mulch pallet: 1 bag = 35 lb (16 kg) 65 bags per pallet = 65 x 35 = 2,275 lb (1,032 kg) Standard wood pallet = 40 lb (18 kg) Total = 2,315 lb (1,050 kg) Safety Note: While wood pallets are usually rated to hold up to 4,600 lb (2,100 kg), some organizations set lower limits, such as 2,200 lb (1,000 kg).

      "content": "Mulch in late spring to add nutrients and in late fall to protect plants. Mulching doesn’t just limit weeds and hold in moisture—it also adds nutrients to the soil as it decomposes. Additionally, when the weather turns cold, mulch serves as a sort of blanket to moderate rapid temperature changes, which can be harmful to your plants. [6] X Research source To get the most out of the nutrients mulch provides, add a 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) layer when your plants are just beginning their robust growth period—usually in late spring or early summer. Add about 4–6 in (10–15 cm) of mulch after the growing season is over and the cold weather begins to arrive to provide your plants with a blanket."

      "content": "Refresh your mulch beds 1-2 times per year. Any type of mulch made of organic material—wood, straw, leaves, etc.—naturally decomposes over time, so you’ll just end up with more dirt if you don’t refresh the mulch bed. Annual mulching is usually sufficient to keep the bed looking good year-round. Alternatively, add mulch in late spring for nutrients and late fall for temperature regulation. [7] X Research source You don’t need to remove the old mulch—just add a layer of new mulch on top. Mulches made of non-organic materials—like rubber mulch—will last much longer, as will landscaping alternatives like stone and gravel."

      "content": "Leave a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) gap when mulching around a tree trunk. Avoid the “mulch volcano” of built-up mulch right against the base of a tree, shrub, or other plant. Instead, when mulching around a tree or other plant, maintain a small ring of open air around the base to allow for proper drainage and airflow. Your plants will thank you! [8] X Research source A “mulch volcano” holds moisture right up against the base of the plant, which invites fungal growth and attracts destructive insects. It also inhibits oxygen flow to the root system."

Buying bagged mulch is definitely convenient, but making your own mulch is a great way to save some money and repurpose yard waste. For the best of both worlds, blend together bagged mulch with some of your homemade stuff. To make leaf mulch, shred up a pile of leaves by running your lawnmower over it. If desired, sift out any larger pieces through a piece of wire fencing. Add grass clippings or even finely-shredded paper to your leaf mulch. Rent a wood chipper to turn yard waste like twigs and small branches into mulch. [9] X Research source"
