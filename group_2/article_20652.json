      "title": "You must be at least 18 and a United States citizen.",
      "content": "You must be at least 18 and a United States citizen. Before beginning the application process, make sure you qualify to compete on the show. You also must not be running for political office, or be affiliated with anyone involved with the production of the program. You must be willing and available to spend 2 weeks in Los Angeles to film the show. And, of course, you must love to bake—but be terrible at it. [1] X Research source \"Anyone involved with the production\" includes anyone who has worked in the last 2 years as an employee, officer, director, or agent of the producer, the network, sponsors, or anyone supplying goods or services to the program.

      "content": "Fill out the online application. If you think you’ve got what it takes to be the next Nailed It! champ, you can apply online via Magical Elves , Nailed It! ’s production company. The application process is a bit intensive and asks that you submit photos and answer questions regarding your education, baking history, reasons for trying out, and more. [3] X Research source Answer the application questions in a Word or Google document. This way, in case you can’t fill out the whole application in one sitting, or your internet crashes, you don’t lose any of your progress. If you don’t have a lot of time on your hands, or if you want to apply to multiple reality TV shows at once, Netflix , Nailed It! ’s network, offers an online application that’s much less intensive.

      "title": "Line up 2 references.",
      "content": "Line up 2 references. Though Nailed It! is about people who aren't good at baking, they still ask that you be somewhat familiar with the ins and outs of a kitchen. To that end, Magical Elves requests that you provide the names and contact info of 2 references who can vouch for your ability to at least kind of make a cake. [5] X Research source Pick 2 people who not only know you as a baker, but know your personality and can vouch for your ability to perform well under pressure and be an engaging reality TV presence."

    {
      "title": "Film and submit your audition tape.",
      "content": "Film and submit your audition tape. The audition tape must not exceed 10 minutes, and it must show you following a baking recipe, including decorating. Restate your name, age, and location in the video, and explain why you love baking and want to get better at it. [6] X Research source This video is where you get to show off your facility in the kitchen as well as your fun and unique personality. Show the casting director you have the pep and showmanship necessary to thrive on reality TV. A selfie video on your phone won’t suffice. Consider enlisting a friend to film you. [7] X Research source Make sure your video is shot in landscape mode, not portrait mode, and is an .mp4, .mov, or QuickTime. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "As a contestant, you will compete against 2 other amateur bakers.",
      "content": "As a contestant, you will compete against 2 other amateur bakers. All 3 contestants will participate in 3 timed baking contests. The baker who serves up the least terrible cake wins (and yes, the judges try every cake, no matter how disgusting). While it's all fun and games when you're watching the show at home, baking under pressure—not to mention on television—can be overwhelming even for talented bakers. [9] X Research source The recipes provided to contestants are intentionally simplistic, but some may involve a little guesswork from players. [10] X Research source While timers are a staple for any baker, the Nailed It! kitchen purportedly contains no timers—only clocks, meaning contestants must be very aware of just how long that cake has been in the oven.

      "title": "It's unclear whether you'll be paid simply to participate.",
      "content": "It's unclear whether you'll be paid simply to participate. The show doesn't state whether they pay for your time or accommodations during filming. While some game shows and reality shows offer a (usually quite small) stipend just to appear on the program, many, unfortunately, do not pay contestants unless they win, and many do not pay for contestants' travel and lodging. The Great British Bake Off purportedly does not pay contestants anything to participate, while Love Island offers contestants a modest weekly stipend during their run on the show.

      "content": "The champion baker takes home $10,000 and a hideous trophy. That's right, by simply making and decorating a cake that looks and tastes slightly less sad than your competitors' creations, you win $10,000 and a droopy trophy designed to look as if it's falling apart. [13] X Research source Of course, that $10,000 is pre-tax. Still, 10 grand to make a few depressing cakes and be made fun of by Nicole Byer? Not a bad way to earn a couple bucks."
