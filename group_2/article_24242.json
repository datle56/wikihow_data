      "content": "Ensure that the electrical supply for the steam shower unit is GFCI protected, due to the proximity of electricity and water in the unit. The size of the line will depend mostly on the size of your steam generator. Typical sizes of steam generators range from 3000 Watt to 6000 Watt. These would require 240 Volt, 40 Amp line, or 30 Amp for smaller steam generators. Electrician services may be needed in this step, in order to prevent electric shocks."

      "content": "Connect a hot water supply and a cold water supply to the steam shower unit. Steam shower units will require a hot water supply and a cold water supply to feed the shower heads and jets as well as the steam generator. The steam generator uses cold water to generate steam. These connections will be 1/2\" flexible line connections in most cases. These flexible connections allow you to slide the steam shower to access the components and also for servicing.
