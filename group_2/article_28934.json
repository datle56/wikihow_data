You can buy it in rolls, which you will have to cut yourself, or you can buy it in pre-cut strips. [2] X Research source Eyelid tape is a specialty product and may be difficult to find in some stores, depending on where you live. However, you can always buy it online. An alternative to buying specialty eyelid tape is to buy athletic tape and cut it yourself. To cut your own eyelid tape, cut strips of athletic tape into small rectangles and round the corners off. You should now have small ovals of tape. Cut the ovals in half and round off any sharp edges. [3] X Research source"

[8] X Research source You should be able to bend the eyelid tape in an arch by squeezing the applicator together.
