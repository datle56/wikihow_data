      "content": "Cut away the top third of a clean 2-liter soda bottle. Remove the cap. Use a utility knife to cut off the top of the bottle slightly below where the neck straightens. To cut an even line, wrap a piece of masking tape around the bottle to mark where you'll cut. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Invert the bottle top to nest it in the bottle bottom.",
      "content": "Invert the bottle top to nest it in the bottle bottom. Hold the bottle top so the capless end is facing downward. Insert this into the bottle bottom. Hold the bottle top in place at the top of the bottle bottom with your fingers. Staple the top to the bottom on four opposing sides. If you don't have a stapler, tape the seam between the inverted bottle top and the bottle bottom instead. [3] X Research source If you want to reuse your traps, fasten the bottle top and bottom with clothespins. You only need to unfasten the clothespins to clean, empty, and refill your 2-liter bottle trap. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Drill holes and add cord to make a hanging trap. Drill two holes an inch (2.5 cm) below the top of the trap, with each hole on opposite sides of the bottle. Use a drill bit large enough to allow your cord to pass through. Feed one end apiece of a length of cord into the two holes holes. Knot the ends of the cord and it's ready to hang.

      "title": "Use honey or sugar water as bait.",
      "content": "Use honey or sugar water as bait. Pour honey or sugar water directly into the bottom of the trap. You don't need much; a thin layer will be enough to attract bees. Bees will be attracted to the sweetness and won't be able to escape, eventually dying in the trap. [6] X Research source Save the lives of bees by only using honey or sugar water. When you see a bee trapped inside, take it away from your home and carefully release it. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Poison bees with laundry soap.",
      "content": "Poison bees with laundry soap. To ensure bees that enter your trap don't make it out alive, add a tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid laundry soap to your bait. Distribute the soap throughout the bait by stirring it with a utensil. The soap will poison and kill all bees that ingest it. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Position your traps near bee access points.",
      "content": "Position your traps near bee access points. Placing your traps too close to bee access points may actually draw more indoors. Prioritize locations in the sun. Sunlight will make the bait more effective and also cause bees to die in the trap faster. Hanging traps tend to attract bees better than ground traps. Ground traps, however, can be effective guarding window access points. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Check traps every two weeks.",
      "content": "Check traps every two weeks. If you've fastened your bottle top and bottom with staples, you'll either need to remove the staples to clean and refill the trap or make a new one. Otherwise, remove the tape or clothespins, dump the contents of the trap, rinse it, and refill it with honey or sugar water. These traps will attract many kinds of insects, including ants. Use natural methods to prevent and remove ants. [10] X Research source"

The angle, when cut, will form two edges about 7 in (17.8 cm) long and two that are about 4 in (10.2 cm) long.

For example, you might clamp the unmarked edge to a workbench or scrap wood so you can cut the marked edge more easily. Cut the post along the marked angle with your circular saw . [12] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Use caution when operating a saw. Improper usage can result in serious injury. Always wear safety glasses and a face mask. Substitute a hand saw for a circular saw.

In this situation, turn the post over and mark the same angle on the opposite side. Cut the angle on the opposite side to finish the incomplete cut."

Use a tape measure and a pencil to mark the center of the flat bottom of the post. Use a 7/8-inch bit to drill a 4-inch (10.2 cm) deep hole at this center mark. [14] X Research source Drill the hole on a straight up and down angle with respect to the flat bottom of the carpenter bee trap. If you're a poor estimator of distance, measure the length of your drill bit and note the point it is about 4 in (10.2 cm) long. Drill to this point. [15] X Research source"

[17] X Research source Hold your square beside the hole to help you judge the angle. 45° is halfway between horizontal (flat) and vertical (up and down). Position your drill parallel to this angle and drill upward until the hole connects with the hole drilled in the bottom. [18] X Research source Drill holes in this fashion at each of the marked points on the four sides of your post. All holes should connect with the straight hole drilled in the center of the post's flat bottom. The angle for your side entry holes doesn't have to be perfect. For quick, easy, and accurate angled holes, use a pocket jig as a guide. Pocket jigs can be bought at hardware stores. [19] X Research source"

However, the 45° angle of the entry tunnels will confuse the bees, drawing them into the glass jar where they can't escape. Close up carpenter bee holes while they're away with caulk, wooden dowels, or specialized carpenter bee killing foam. Closed nesting holes will force carpenter bees to look for the most convenient new home, like your carpenter bee trap. [25] X Research source"
