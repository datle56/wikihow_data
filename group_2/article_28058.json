      "content": "Trim off any excess plastic. First, transfer the soft plastic lure to a cookie sheet or baking pan. Trim the excess with a craft knife, scissors, or a pizza cutter. As you trim the excess, gather it together. You can melt it down and add it to your next soft plastic lure, or you can add the shavings at the very end to add highlights to lures of a contrasting color."
