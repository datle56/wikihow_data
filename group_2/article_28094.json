      "content": "Pinch the middle of the pipe cleaners and twist the long ends 2 or 3 times. To make the spider's head, leave your index finger between the folded pipe cleaners and use your other hand to twist the pipe cleaners around your finger at least 2 or 3 times. Then, slide your index finger away so you can see the spider's head. [4] X Research source It's important to twist it around a few times so the pipe cleaners don't come undone or fall apart later."

      "content": "Spread the ends apart on each side to make legs on the body. Your pipe cleaners don't look like a spider yet, but a few simple movements make the legs easier to see. Since you folded the pipe cleaners, you'll have 8 short pipe cleaners sticking out from the head. Pull 4 of the pipe cleaners apart on 1 side of the body. Then, do this on the other side, but a few inches of space the sets of legs. [5] X Research source If you want to display your spider on a vertical surface, you could put a piece of double-sided tape under the head and stick the spider in place now."

Take a leg and bend it up, then down in down in the middle so it's shaped like an upside-down V. Do this for each leg so your spider stands up. [6] X Research source To make a creepier spider, push the head down low so the points of the bent legs are higher."

To make a more realistic looking spider, take an extra black pipe cleaner and wrap it around your finger to make a tight corkscrew shape. Then, stick it behind the head of your spider so it looks like an abdomen. [7] X Research source If you're having trouble twisting the pipe cleaner around your finger, wrap it around a pen or pencil instead. To make a spider that's also a sweet treat, slide a tootsie pop or sucker stem through the twisted pipe cleaner. The tootsie pop or sucker will look like an abdomen."

[9] X Research source For classic Halloween colors, use black, or orange beads. Check that the beads aren't too big for the pipe cleaners or they might slide off."

Hold it in place for a few seconds and let it dry. [10] X Research source Want to make your spider colorful? Use any color pompom you like.

It's easy to twist and secure the spiders onto things like railings or webs, but you can also suspend the spider from the ceiling or a web. Just tie a length of clear wire or a black piece of yarn around the center of the pipe cleaners when you twist the spider. Then, hang it wherever you like. [11] X Research source This effect looks really cool when you hang lots of spiders."
