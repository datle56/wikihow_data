      "content": "Hippogriffs are part horse and eagle, while griffins are part lion and eagle. The main difference between these two mythological creatures is that one is partially lion while the other is part horse. Both griffins and hippogriffs have the head and wings of an eagle, but their bottom halves are very different. [1] X Research source Hippogriffs have the hind legs of a horse, so they have hoove’s and a tail of long hair. Griffins have the backside of a lion, which gives them paws and a long tail with a puff of hair."

      "content": "Griffins have an eagle's head and wings and a lion's body. These mythological creatures are a force to be reckoned with, and their image has dated all the way back to the 2nd millennium BCE. [2] X Research source Griffins are symbols of leadership, power, and wealth, making them the perfect motif for kings. Griffin is also known as “griffon” or “gryphon.” [3] X Research source The “griffin” derives from the Latin word grīphus , which means “an intricate or puzzling question or riddle.” [4] X Research source Over the years, creatives have formed the “reverse griffin,” which has a lion's head and an eagle's body. This twist on the traditional griffin can be seen in video games like Calico ."

      "content": "Hippogriffs have the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a horse. These mythological beings are the offspring of a griffin and horse and were first introduced in Ludovico Ariosto’s poem Orlando Furioso . Their miraculous creation is a symbol of impossibility, confusion, and hope. [5] X Research source Hippogriff can also be spelled as “hippogryph.” The name is a blend of the ancient Greek word for horse ( hippos ) and the Latin word for lord or prince ( griffin )."

      "content": "Griffins are prevalent in Greek mythology, while hippogriffs are not. Believe it or not, hippogriffs aren’t as widely known as griffins, despite being descended from them. Griffins have guarded Greek treasures, pulled Apollo’s carriage, and appeared in art dated to BCE. [6] X Research source Hippogriffs, however, are more of an obscure legend that first appeared in 1516 in Ariosto’s Italian poem Orlando Furioso . You may be familiar with griffins from the Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound or Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland . The most famous hippogriff today is Buckbeak from the Harry Potter franchise."

      "content": "Hippogriffs and griffins are often confused with other legendary creatures. In mythology, there are many beasts with similar symbolism that also combine more than one animal. They’re all equally as epic but have a few differences. Chimera has a head of a lion, the body and additional head of a goat, and the tail of a snake. [7] X Research source Lamassu is a winged bull with the head of a human. [8] X Research source Manticore has the head of a human, body of a lion, and scorpion’s tail. Sphinx is a female monster with a human’s head and chest, lion’s body, eagle’s wings, and snake’s tail. Pegasus is a winged horse that’s typically white in color."
