First, if the printer is already on the network and you just want to add it to your Windows PC, skip to step 3. If it's your first time adding this printer to the network, you'll often need software to get it online. Check the instruction manual that came with your printer to find out for sure. If software is needed, you'll usually find it on the printer manufacturer's website in a section called Support or Software . Any computer on the network should be able to get the printer online the first time. Once it's online, others on the network can add it.

For a wired printer, insert one end of an ethernet cable into the printer's LAN or network port, and the other into a network port on the router. If the printer has a built-in display menu, you may need to run an initial network setup on it to get it online. You might need to connect the printer to a PC with a USB cable to get it onto the network for the first time. This is usually true for printers without built-in display menus. If the printer doesn't have a display (or the instructions tell you to do so), connect it to your PC with a USB cable, and then use the software you downloaded from the manufacturer's website to get the printer online. Once online, you can disconnect the USB cable. You (or your network administrator) may need to change your router's settings to allow other computers on the network to add the printer."
