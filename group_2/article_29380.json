      "title": "Choose a material.",
      "content": "Choose a material. You can make an effective megaphone out of sturdy construction paper. For a more durable version, you can shape it from a cardboard or posterboard. Either way, you can decorate your megaphone when you are finished to make it aesthetically pleasing. [1] X Research source Whatever your material, you will need a 30 inches (76 cm) by 30 inches (76 cm) square of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the center point of one side.",
      "content": "Find the center point of one side. Choose one side of the square and mark the center of it. This will allow you to measure your megaphone proportionally. You can mark the spot with a marker, or push a pin in the center point. [2] X Research source Use a ruler along one edge to measure 15 inches (38 cm) This is the center point for that edge. Since all of the edges are the same, it doesnâ€™t matter which one you use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a short arc.",
      "content": "Make a short arc. Make an arc with a 5 inches (13 cm) radius from the center point. This arc will form the narrow end of your megaphone. If done correctly, your arc will start on one side of the center point and end on the other side. [3] X Research source You can use a 5 inches (13 cm) string stuck to the center point to make your arc. Put a pencil on the far end of the string and swoop it around the surface of your material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a long arc.",
      "content": "Make a long arc. Your second arc should have a radius of 29 inches (74 cm). You can use a piece of string that is 29 inches (74 cm) long to make the arc. Tape or pin one end of the string to the center point, and attach the other end to a pencil. Swoop the string along the surface of your material to make your long arc. [4] X Research source The long arc will make the wide end of your megaphone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the megaphone from the material.",
      "content": "Cut the megaphone from the material. Draw a line from both ends of the long arc back the center point. The lines should meet at the center point and make a cone shape. Cut along these lines with scissors. Next, cut along the both arcs. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Roll the megaphone.",
      "content": "Roll the megaphone. Once the megaphone template has been cut, it is time to shape the template. Start by taking one end of the template and rolling it over the other end. Do not fold or crease the template."
    },
    {
      "title": "Overlap one side.",
      "content": "Overlap one side. One side of the megaphone should overlap the other side. Create a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overlap to ensure that the megaphone stays together. Without the overlap, the megaphone could easily pull apart. [6] X Research source The narrow end of the megaphone will be between 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue or fasten the overlap.",
      "content": "Glue or fasten the overlap. Use super glue or hot glue to glue down the overlapping side. If you are using a sturdy material, like cardboard, you can use metal fasteners in place of glue. Either way, make sure that the megaphone cannot unravel."

      "title": "Decorate your megaphone, if desired.",
      "content": "Decorate your megaphone, if desired. Once your megaphone has been cut and shaped, you can make it look good. Use markers or paint to color the megaphone. You can also cut out or draw designs to put on your megaphone. [7] X Research source Do not cut the megaphone to make designs."

      "title": "Add a handle.",
      "content": "Add a handle. A megaphone handle will help you hold the megaphone, making it more effective. Cut a cardboard roll to roughly 6 inches (15 cm). Tape the role to the bottom of your megaphone. If you have decorated your megaphone, you can decorate the roll to match. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Add a mouthpiece. You can cut a tapered mouthpiece from wood or cardboard. Cut or sand the material into the shape and size that you want. The mouthpiece is not necessary, but it can make speaking into the megaphone easier. Once you have finished your megaphone, try it out by speaking into the mouthpiece and hearing your voice amplified. [9] X Research source Measure the circumference of the narrow end of your megaphone. You want the mouthpiece to fit inside that circle. For example, if the circumference is 4 inches (10 cm), then you want to make a mouthpiece with a circumference slightly less than 4 inches (10 cm)."
