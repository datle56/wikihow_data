[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Carbohydrates break down quickly in our bodies, leaving us feeling hungry again after only a short period of time. They also signal our bodies to store fat. Both of these are counterproductive to weight loss. It's hard to completely eliminate carbs, so try reducing them rather than not eating any. Avoid excessive amounts of bread. Consume only one serving a day of cereal. Limit potatoes, rice, and corn. Be careful. A low-carb diet can be harmful to people with certain health problems.

Choose simple cocktails - mixed drinks made with juices and liqueurs will have more calories than say, a vodka tonic. Make a spritzer with white wine and club soda.

People who plan for healthy eating are more successful at staying on track. Here are some ways you can do it: Make a meal plan each week that includes healthy meals and snacks, and stick to it. At the beginning of the week, shop for the foods you need for those meals, so you have no excuses for not eating according to your plan. Sit down and eat properly. Studies show that people who sit down at the table to eat from a plate will consume fewer calories than those who eat standing up or grazing from the package. Keep healthy and nutritious snacks with you. Bring them with you in your purse or bag, so you will always be able to make good choices."
