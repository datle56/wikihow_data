      "content": "Yes, Scribd is safe to use and isn't a scam or a virus. Scribd is a legitimate company and a perfectly legal business. However, many former subscribers who reviewed Scribd online say they didn't enjoy their experience with the service and felt scammed or deceived. This is because Scribd has a confusing way of handling subscription cancellations and restricting how much content they'll allow users access to in a month. Scribd currently has a 1.5 out of 5-star rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and isn't BBB-accredited. To achieve that honor, Scribd would have to hold to BBB's accreditation standards , such as building trust with their customers, telling the truth, advertising honestly, honoring promises, etc. Trustpilot , where consumers can leave business reviews and rate their trustworthiness, shows a 1.4 out of 5-star rating for Scribd. 79% of the more than 3800 reviews are 1-star only."

      "content": "Yes, although some subscribers say Scribd charged them after canceling. Scribd provides simple, step-by-step instructions for canceling your subscription, whether you signed up through Scribd or Everand. They also explain how to stop a subscription if you signed up through an app store, like Apple's App Store or Google Play. Several Scribd reviewers on Trustpilot complained that Scribd continued to charge their bank account every month for their service, even after the customer canceled. With that in mind, monitor your bank account after you cancel Scribd or Everand to make sure they stop charging you. If they don't, use Scribd's chat support feature on their website to ask for a refund and have them completely remove you from their subscription list. After you cancel your subscription, your Scribd or Everand account will be converted into the free version. This means you'll still have limited access to all 3 products."

      "content": "Scribd is a subscription service with a library of over 195 million documents. Anyone subscribed to Scribd can read, save, and download these documents (and even upload their own), which include academic papers, legal documents, manuals, and more. The subscription costs $11.99 per month and also comes with access to 2 separate products: Everand and Slideshare. In addition to documents, Scribd used to offer users \"unlimited access\" to e-books and audiobooks. In November 2023, however, they split up into 3 separate products: Scribd; Everand (their e-book and audiobook subscription); and SlideShare (similar to Scribd but for slideshow presentations instead of documents).

You also get access to Everand's e-book and audiobook library, plus SlideShare and millions of presentations uploaded by Scribd community members. What’s Everand? Everand is a service where users use credits to unlock \"premium\" book titles. Everand launched its credit system in 2024, making their subscribers use it the same way they use Audible , Amazon's popular audiobook subscription service. [2] X Research source Before that, an Everand subscription would give you access to all their titles, even the popular ones (or so they claimed). Many longtime users resented the shift to credits, saying it changed what made Everand unique and useful."

      "content": "Scribd and Everand subscriptions can be frustrating to cancel. Some former subscribers claim they canceled their subscription only to be charged again the next month or a few months later. Others say they canceled and immediately lost titles they saved, which they planned to read during their remaining days of service. They also either couldn't find or add the titles that were in their save list back. [3] X Research source The users whose service was restricted after they canceled Scribd or Everand feel like they didn't get their money's worth. When they asked for refunds for the partial service, Scribd denied their request. It's currently Scribd's policy to only offer refunds for unused subscription time if the subscriber didn't use their Scribd or Everand account at all. [4] X Research source Scribd requires subscribers to contact them within 30 days after a charge they want to dispute goes through their bank account."

      "content": "Everand's \"unlimited access to a select catalog\" claim is potentially misleading. People interested in using Everand may be drawn in by the words \"unlimited access.\" But if they read carefully, they discover that their unlimited access is restricted to a pool of only 20,000 books – none of which include premium titles, which are always published more recently and are the most popular. Users can only read those titles if they unlock them with monthly credits. Before they rolled out a new subscription structure for Everand in 2024, Scribd claimed they were \"Netflix for books,\" giving subscribers the impression that they would be able to access Scribd's full e-book and audiobook library for a monthly fee. Many subscribers soon realized, however, that Scribd controlled which books they had \"unlimited access\" to read. [5] X Research source This led some of them to think of Scribd (and later Everand) as a scam. Everand's 2024 subscription structure introduced the credits system and set more specific guidelines about what kind of \"unlimited access\" users would get with their plan."

Many past subscribers of first Scribd and then Everand are dissatisfied with how few e-book and audiobook titles they had access to.

If you're not happy with Scribd or if it just doesn't sound like it's for you, you can also try Audible or check if your local library offers books on Libby or Hoopla for free."
