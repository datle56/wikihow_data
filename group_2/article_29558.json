      "title": "Cut a long strip of paper.",
      "content": "Cut a long strip of paper. Cut the paper as wide as you want; a wider strip means both more drawing surface and a bigger figure to draw. If you wish to be really precise, try folding the paper and then cutting the strips on the creases. If you have a ruler, you can measure to be exact."

      "title": "Fold the paper accordion-style to make a rectangle.",
      "content": "Fold the paper accordion-style to make a rectangle. Make the folds as even as possible. [1] X Research source A good trick is to first fold the strip in half multiple times. When the desired rectangle size is met, unfold the paper. Using the creases made from the folding, fold it accordion-style."

      "title": "Draw the outline of a person in the middle of the rectangle.",
      "content": "Draw the outline of a person in the middle of the rectangle. For this step, you can draw it free-hand or use a stencil. Draw the person with the head, feet, and hands touching all the edges. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut out the person.",
      "content": "Cut out the person. As you cut, you can trim out any imperfections from the drawing. Cut carefully in order to keep the chain intact. If you do not want to cut with scissors, you can use an Exacto knife to cut paper."

      "title": "Work with the finished product.",
      "content": "Work with the finished product. Paper-people chains are neat in and of themselves, but with some markers, crayons, or color pencils, you can draw details on the people. Be creative and pick themes, draw different clothing, add stickers, or glue some glitter. If you are putting it on a bulletin board, be careful about the thickness of the corkboard. Ensure that the thumbtacks do not go through the board and into the wall."

      "title": "Cut a long strip of paper.",
      "content": "Cut a long strip of paper. The strip can be wider than the first method because you'll need more drawing surface."

    {
      "title": "Draw half a person on one edge of the rectangle.",
      "content": "Draw half a person on one edge of the rectangle. The person's torso and head will be on the edge. The arm will extend out to exactly the middle of the paper. Be sure to be precise. You can use a ruler to measure the middle and draw a line, or use a stencil. The drawing will be the main difference for this type of paper-people chain; it'll allow more creativity be giving you the option to use more than one figure for the chain."

    {
      "title": "Draw the second person on the opposite edge.",
      "content": "Draw the second person on the opposite edge. The second person can be different. Try drawing a girl with a dress. Her head and torso will be on the edge. Her arm will extend out to the middle with her hand meeting the other person's. The hands must be touching. You can be a bit creative with where the hands meet. The hands can hold different symmetrical figures such as a heart, a star, a small child, etc."

      "content": "Unfold to reveal a boy and a girl holding hands. The chain should be boy-girl, boy-girl. This approach gives you the chance to mix different figures and explore the space on the rectangle. As long as the figures you draw connect, the final product will be a unique chain."

      "content": "Draw and cut a large circle in the middle of the paper. Place a bowl with its rim down on the middle of the paper. Trace it lightly with a pencil, and cut out the circle as perfectly as possible. The bigger the circle, the better. The final product will be like a wreath of people."
