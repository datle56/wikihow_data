      "content": "Switch to drinking only water . Water flushes out your system, removing unneeded toxins, making it easier to lose weight. Moreover, water is free of calories, making it a much better choice than sugary drinks. In fact, if you can limit yourself to only water, your odds of losing the weight will increase. If you need something flavored from time to time, choose unsweetened tea. This should be 24/7, apart from right before a workout. Then you can feel free to chug a cup of black coffee (or with a splash of skim milk). The caffeine blast is reported to give you a kick, making you work out a little bit harder. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It turns out drinking water can up your metabolism , too, in addition to making you feel full. Recent studies show that drinking two glasses of cold water can up your metabolism about 40% for 15-20 minutes. Participants in these weight loss studies reportedly lost 15 pounds in three months, largely by drinking only water.

Someone following a standard diet can usually afford to fall off the junk food wagon once or twice without suffering major repercussions. For more extreme, short-term weight loss goals (like this one), however, junk food must be completely avoided. Stay away from greasy, fatty foods as well as those with a high sugar content. Anything battered, fried, covered in chocolate, packaged, or loaded up and preserved with sugar is a no-go. [3] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. Be sure to read your labels. Even things like yogurt and granola bars can be powerhouses of sugar. While many people think of these as healthy, they're actually not."

      "content": "Cut out the white carbs. Everything from pasta to cookies is full of simple carbohydrates that are actually sugars in disguise. These little villains spike our insulin levels, upping our fat stores, and ultimately increase our body weight. To lower the spike, cut out the processed carbs – that means white rice, bread, and potatoes, in addition to cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream. [4] X Research source You may be better off cutting out carbs in general. Let's face it: 20 pounds in 2 weeks is a tall order. To put your body in ketosis , where it's feeding off your fat stores and not your glycogen stores (because those have been depleted), you'll have to go completely low or no carb. In addition to no sweets, you'll have to cut out starchy vegetables (potatoes, squash, carrots), whole grains (including quinoa and brown rice) and sugary fruits, like bananas, oranges, and apples. What's more, being hungry makes the temptation to cave to your old habits all the more powerful. Consistently eating good-for-you, healthy foods keeps the other cravings at bay. When you're more full, you make better decisions."

As the theory goes, some foods take so much energy to digest that eating them actually burns more calories than the foods contain. Even if you do not burn calories eating these foods, though, you will not gain many calories from them, either. In the way of vegetables, eat more asparagus, beet root, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini. As for fruits, gravitate toward blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon."

If you're looking to lose weight very quickly and don't care if you gain it back, then a fad diet could be okay for you in this situation. Just realize that, in general, they're not healthy and their effects do not last for long. One of the most common fad diets right now is juicing. Another contender is the Master Cleanse diet – both of which are liquid-based diets. These offer quick results, but are hard to adhere to and are not wise to stay on for long.

Prolonged fasting can cause muscle loss and other health problems, but it can also make it more difficult for your body to lose weight. When the human body does not receive enough nutrition, it automatically starts conserving calories by burning them at a slower rate. You may experience significant weight loss after the first few days, but by the end of the two weeks, you will probably gain a good portion of it back. [8] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. The exception to this is if you're on a highly-regimented intermittent fasting plan. This is where you don't eat anywhere from eight to twenty-four hours and then eat planned amounts of calories (often more) thereafter. While this can be effective, do this only with the approval of your physician. If you don't do it correctly, you could actually increase your body's tendency to store fat.

That is, they decide that they won't eat after a certain time, usually somewhere around 7 to 8 pm. Nighttime eating is generally the worst for most people, as the TV is on and friends are habitually munching, too. This can be emotionally difficult, but it can pay off. You may need to be reasonable with yourself. Have this rule for only five or six days out of the week. Give yourself some wiggle room to go out with friends – but that doesn't mean you can go crazy. Stick to a glass of red wine and a few bites – don't eat the entire buffet."

The fact of the matter is that everybody's body is different and not all calories are made the same. What's more, counting calories sucks. That being said, they're a good general guideline. For the purposes of this diet, budget your calories throughout the day. [10] X Research source If you've done really, really great, have that piece of dark chocolate or that extra half a chicken breast. Don't go overboard, but keep yourself from feeling deprived. You'll want to balance the calories you burn with the calories you consume. In other words, the more you work out, the more you can eat. Weight loss generally occurs when you burn more calories than you consume. On average (again, on average ), a person needs to burn 3,500 calories more than he or she consumes to lose 1 lb (450 g). [11] X Research source To lose 20 pounds (9 kg) in two weeks, you will need to lose a little under 1.5 lbs (675 g) every day.

Think of it this way: if you only have 5 pieces of celery you can eat in a day (not recommended; just an example), you don't want to eat them all for breakfast. You want to space them out to keep from being hungry. Along the same lines, you're likely not eating a lot in these two weeks. So eat less, but eat less more often. It'll keep your stomach from thinking it's hungry. Many healthy diets advocate snacking and for good reason – it keeps your metabolism up and it prevents you from gorging yourself later. Make your meals smaller so you can fit in a few extra calories for snack time. In two weeks, your body and your motivation will thank you for it."

Though every restaurant nowadays tends to have healthier options, you can never be sure what's in that salad dressing or what type of oil they use for their vegetables. You'll be better off cooking for yourself and being able to exercise complete control over every bite you intake. This way you can use healthier oils, like olive oil, less butter, less sugar, less salt (a big culprit when it comes to bloating) and control your portion sizes, too. And what's even better?

This is especially important for a short-term diet like this. You cannot afford to have an “off” day when you slack on your diet or exercise regimen. Once you decide to go this route, you must be committed to seeing it through. It'll be easier if you tell other people about your plan, or if you have other people to do it with you. They can hold you accountable, you can eat healthy and exercise together, and you can complain about it together, too."

[15] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The best way to burn calories is through exercise. If your body is already familiar with moderate physical activity, you might be able to take things up a notch by alternating moderate and vigorous activity throughout your day. On the other hand, if you are unaccustomed to much physical activity, you should only stick to moderate exercise. Either way, make sure to take plenty of breaks and to re-hydrate yourself with plenty of water consistently. Vigorous activity burns between 400 and 600 calories per hour, and examples include running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, basketball, and heavy weightlifting or yard work. Moderate activity burns between 200 and 400 calories per hour and includes hiking, light yard work, dancing, golf, slow bicycling, and slow walking .
