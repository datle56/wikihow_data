      "content": "Obtain your uniform only from your branch of the armed services. It is illegal to wear a uniform or any uniform part that is not issued by the branch of the armed forces in which you serve. Under most circumstances, members of the armed services can be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for wearing anything that is unauthorized. Even wearing awards or insignia that you have not earned is prohibited. For example, a member of the Navy may not wear the uniform of the Army. [1] X Research source In general, the majority of your authorized and required uniform items will be issued during your first weeks of training. Your military instructor will let you know how to obtain any additional needed items for your uniforms (like hats, badges, etc.) as needed."

Some parts are not considered distinctive (like an undershirt or shoes) and can be worn at any time, on- or off-duty. However, it is important to double check the regulations of your service to make sure that you are allowed to wear those items off-duty."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with other policies. In addition to your issued uniform, there are other policies regarding personal appearance and grooming including hairstyle, tattoos, and jewelry guidelines that are all considered part of the military uniform (because they keep everyone looking uniform in appearance). These differ within each branch of the military, so be sure to look through your handbook for specific instructions. For example, in the Army, all Soldiers must follow Army Regulation or AR 670-1 specifically to make sure that they wear their uniform properly and are groomed according to the set standards. Soldiers may not wear any jewelry except a watch, ID bracelet, and two wedding rings. Female soldiers may additionally wear a single pair of round, stud-style earrings. Tattoos are permitted, but must not represent any extremist philosophy or group (including, but not limited to, recognized hate groups) or that are sexist, racist, or indecent. Additionally, soldiers may not have any tattoos on the face, neck, hands, or wrists. Be sure to talk with your commander before getting any new tattoos after joining the military."

      "content": "Understand accommodations for religious observation. For the most part, wearing religious apparel in uniform is frowned on, but recent rulings by the United States government have made it possible for exceptions to be made to accommodate practices that are central to your religious observance. For example, a Muslim or Sikh serviceman can petition his squadron leader to wear a beard or turban while in uniform. Accommodations such as these are made on a case-by-case basis. If you require an accommodation, you have to apply to be an exceptions to the rules. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Know how to behave while in uniform. Even if you are not currently serving, there are certain laws and regulations that apply to your behavior while in a uniform that represents the United States government. In general, you should behave in a respectful and becoming way. More specifically: Any time you are in uniform, you represent the United States government. You are expected to maintain the grooming standards of the military even if you are retired, if you plan to appear in uniform. This includes being clean-shaven, keeping your hair neatly under your headgear, and not having facial piercings or tattoos. While saying the Pledge of Allegiance, [10] X Research source or while passing, lowering, or raising the United States flag, anyone in military uniform (active, inactive, or discharged) should stand at attention, face the flag, and perform a military salute, rather than placing his or her hand over the heart.

      "title": "Do not wear a military uniform if you are a civilian.",
      "content": "Do not wear a military uniform if you are a civilian. If you have never served in the armed forces, you are prohibited by the United States government from wearing the uniform of the Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marines. [12] X Research source You are also prohibited from wearing a uniform that is similar to that worn by the armed forces in any public place or in public view. Doing so is a Class A Misdemeanor. The law is up for interpretation regarding how \"similar\" a replica uniform can be without being prohibited. This includes wearing any \"distinctive piece\" of a military uniform, such as a beret , jacket, or insignia. This includes the military uniforms of other countries, and the uniforms of past enemy regimes such as the Nazis, not just United States uniforms. For example, you are prohibited from wearing a Nazi uniform in public. There are several reasons for these prohibitions. The first is for security reasons; in one instance, a woman tried to gain access to a secure military base using someone else's uniform. Another reason is because civilians need to know that people in uniform are trustworthy in cases of emergency. Finally, it is considered disrespectful to those who have served, since they put their lives on the line for the privilege of wearing the uniform."

      "content": "Obtain costumes for dramatic roles from the production house. If you portray a member of the armed forces in a theatrical, television or movie role, you must use a uniform given to you by the production which they have created or purchased for the production. You cannot wear any uniforms you or others may have that were issued by the military. Unlike costumes worn in public or for Halloween or costume parties, replica uniforms for productions may be made to look exactly like real military uniforms, but can only be worn while working on the production. So if you have worn, for example, an exact replica uniform for a play, you cannot later wear it for Halloween."

Under the United States Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is against the law to claim that you have served in the military or that you have received medals or awards for your service if you have not. This includes making fraudulent statements in order to obtain money, property, or other benefits (although simply claiming it is considered protected speech), and also includes simply wearing a medal that you did not earn. [15] X Research source Even if a medal was earned by a relative or has sentimental value, it is illegal for someone else to wear it. This includes medals such as the Purple Heart, the Navy or Air Force cross, a Congressional Medal of Honor, or any other medal or award, or replica of a medal or award. [16] X Research source"
