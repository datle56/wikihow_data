      "title": "Position your arms to draw your torsos together.",
      "content": "Position your arms to draw your torsos together. In a romantic hug, your torsos—your shoulders, chests, and stomachs—touch. This is a wonderfully warm and intimate position that emphasizes closeness. [1] X Research source Generally, when hugging someone shorter , the taller person puts their arms around the waist of the shorter person. To hug someone taller , the shorter hugger usually puts their arms around the neck or shoulders of the taller person. The opposite can also happen, especially if there's a big height difference: the taller person places their arms around the other person's shoulders (and draws them into their chest), while the other person wraps their arms around the waist."

      "title": "Lean your head against the person you’re hugging.",
      "content": "Lean your head against the person you’re hugging. Leaning your head on or against someone builds physical intimacy . Move your head to the side as you lean in to give a romantic hug (in the US, most people will automatically move to their right.) Don't go too far to the side, though! To give a good hug , get close enough to brush your cheek against the other person's face. To add an extra romantic touch, nuzzle your head or even your face into the head or neck of the other person (or chest, if you're much shorter than the person you're hugging). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Squeeze the person you’re hugging and hold them tightly.",
      "content": "Squeeze the person you’re hugging and hold them tightly. A romantic hug lasts longer than a platonic hug. Gently clutch a little tighter for two or three seconds. Take a deep breath and exhale. Then, relax into the hug and enjoy it. Make sure your squeeze is strong enough to be noticeable but not so tight it prevents the other person from breathing normally. Causing your hugging partner to pass out from lack of oxygen is not considered romantic in most circles. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your hands to caress the other person.",
      "content": "Use your hands to caress the other person. Rub one of your hands on their back or arm a few times. Or if your hand is by the person's head, gently stroke their hair or the back of their neck. A slow caress is romantic and pleasant for the other person. A brisk caress is comical unless it's freezing outside and you're warming up your hugging partner."

      "title": "Let go of the hug slowly.",
      "content": "Let go of the hug slowly. Wait a few seconds before letting go. As you pull away, keep your hands on the other person so you're still touching each other after you hug. This is a good time to look into each other's eyes, smile , and say “I love you” from the heart. A romantic hug can last as long as you and your partner like, so you don’t have to let go after a few seconds if you’re both enjoying the hug!"

      "title": "Approach the person you’re hugging from behind.",
      "content": "Approach the person you’re hugging from behind. Hugging someone from behind is usually a pleasant and spontaneous way to give your love a sweet surprise. Just make sure they aren’t doing anything too important when you wrap your arms around their waist and rest your head against theirs. Be careful not to scare the person you’re hugging. Barrett says, “You always want the move you're going to make to be well received, wanted, and not surprising. You don't want to get the awkward, ‘Why are you making that move? get away!’” Plus, they may react by lashing out before they realize you’re the one who grabbed them from behind…which is the opposite of romantic. It’s important to know if it’s okay to hug someone as a given time."

      "title": "Press against the person’s back and wrap your arms around them.",
      "content": "Press against the person’s back and wrap your arms around them. When you’re hugging from behind , it doesn't matter as much if you’re taller or shorter than the other person. Just be aware of where your hands end up. Generally, a taller hugger relaxes their upper arms and reaches around to hug the shorter person with their lower arms. When a shorter person hugs someone taller, they usually hold their arms straight out to reach around the other person comfortably. \"Stack\" one arm on top of the other, one arm in front of the other, or even reach up over the chest and hold the shoulders of the person you are hugging. The best place for your arms depends on their size and the size of the person you’re hugging."

      "content": "Squeeze them with your arms and hold them tightly. A romantic hug usually lasts at least a few seconds longer than a platonic hug. Gently hold your special someone a little tighter for an extra two or three seconds. Then, take a deep breath and exhale. Relax your body and really enjoy the closeness of the hug."

      "title": "Angle your neck so your head touches them.",
      "content": "Angle your neck so your head touches them. Like the front-facing hug, leaning your head on or against someone signals intimacy. If you’re as tall or taller than the hugged one, nuzzle against the side of their face or neck. If you’re shorter, rest your head sideways on their back."

      "title": "Use your hands to stroke the other person gently.",
      "content": "Use your hands to stroke the other person gently. For the person being hugged, caressing your hugger's arms is natural and pleasant for both of you. Or reach back and caress their face or hair. For the hugger, though, caressing can become fairly intimate without much effort. If you're at that level with the person you’re hugging, it’s a delightful way to initiate sex. If not, proceed with caution. A slow caress is romantic. Going too fast breaks the mood. Once you’ve hugged the other person from behind, make it a front-facing hug by gently turning them around to face you. Then, enjoy the closeness of a face-to-face hug…and maybe a kiss !"

      "title": "Romantic hugs involve more emotional intimacy and physical touch.",
      "content": "Romantic hugs involve more emotional intimacy and physical touch. If a hug involves a person pressing their entire torso against you, it’s more romantic than one where only the shoulders are making contact. A romantic hug feels like you’re melting into each other and includes a tighter squeeze than a friendship hug. Gentle caresses on your back usually point to a more romantic hug than light pats, which are more friendly. In general, romantic hugs last longer and are tighter than hugs between friends. Jbara says, “There are always hugs that are a little bit longer than others. You can just feel the chemistry right away. And you feel like it's just more natural. That’s a more intimate hug.” However, friends who haven’t seen each other for a while or who are offering support may hug for longer and hold their friend tighter. Romantic huggers often use both of their arms to embrace the other person. A one-armed hug is usually friendly."

      "title": "Some hugs are generally more romantic than others.",
      "content": "Some hugs are generally more romantic than others. There are many different types of hugs, ranging from super casual to extremely romantic. Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell which is which. Here’s a list of different types of hugs and whether they signal more romantic or friendly feelings. Triangle Hug: The triangle hug is when you both lean in and hug with your shoulders or the top of your chest, keeping your pelvises apart. It’s used mostly when you feel obligated to hug someone but don’t feel completely comfortable with it. Opposite-sex friends often use it to avoid “taboo zones.” [4] X Research source Side Hug: This is a casual, less personal hug that usually involves one arm casually placed around the arm or neck of the other person. It’s often used when greeting a friendly acquaintance. [5] X Research source Group Hug: This hug involves multiple people and signifies warmth and togetherness. Close friends or families share these types of hugs to celebrate a happy event, offer support, or strengthen bonds during a farewell. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Waist Hug: Hugging around the waist involves both people wrapping their arms around the other person’s waist. It’s romantic and shows the couple loves and trusts each other. [7] X Research source Eye-to-Eye Hug: This hug is when a couple gazes deeply into each other’s eyes while hugging. It’s extremely romantic and even increases your romantic feelings toward each other. [8] X Research source"
