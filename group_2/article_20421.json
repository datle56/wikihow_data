      "content": "Use online job postings to find out what's available in your area. Websites, such as Indeed, pull a lot of job listings for different companies and post them in one place. This allows you to run a search based on your interests and get multiple results. Many sites also allow you to create profiles and upload your résumé, which makes the application process quicker and easier. [1] X Trustworthy Source CareerOneStop Online resource sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor providing information on job training, employment opportunities, and careers Go to source For example, if you want to work in a movie theater, you could search for movie theater jobs within a certain distance of your address and the website would bring up the listings for all the movie theaters in that area that were hiring. Some employers also post job openings on social media. LinkedIn, in particular, is helpful for job searches. Create a free profile and start looking for jobs that match your skills and interests. You can also connect your profile with adults you know who also have accounts. Your school also might have job listings available. If they do, look through those first—those are employers that are actively looking for teens who go to your school. Looking for other jobs you can get as a teen?

      "content": "Knowing what activities you enjoy helps you focus your job search. Even though you might be thinking you'd take any job, you don't want to do something that you're going to hate. Making a list of your skills and things you enjoy can help you decide where you want to apply. Here are some examples to get you started: [2] X Trustworthy Source CareerOneStop Online resource sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor providing information on job training, employment opportunities, and careers Go to source Like spending time outdoors? Look for work with landscaping or lawn care companies, plant nurseries, animal shelters, or construction companies. Want to be active? Focus on jobs at car washes, child care companies, moving companies, or residential/commercial cleaning companies. Enjoy helping people? Try working at a restaurant or café, retail store, movie theater, or amusement park. Don't forget you often get an employee discount at retail stores! For example, if you enjoy playing video games, you might try to get a job at a video game store."

      "content": "Some cities and states require work permits for minors. You're more likely to need a permit if you're under the age of 16, but some places require them for anyone under 18. The permit is typically issued by your local labor department, but your school can tell you what you need to do. Sometimes, you need to find a job before you can get your permit. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Labor Federal department responsible for promoting the wellbeing of workers Go to source Some labor departments need a letter from your school before they'll issue a work permit. The letter just certifies that you're enrolled at the school and not failing any of your classes. If you're supposed to get a permit after you get a job, that permit is typically only valid for that employer. That means you'll need a new permit if you switch to a different job before you turn 18."

      "content": "Talk to people who have knowledge of your work ethic. Teachers, coaches, and other group leaders all make excellent references. When you ask if they're willing to let you list them as a reference, be prepared to talk about the types of jobs you're looking for and the work you want to do. [4] X Research source Adults you've worked for (even for no pay!) are often the best references. For example, if you babysat or mowed your neighbor's lawn, ask them for a reference."

      "content": "Tell everyone you're looking for a job and ask if they know of anything. Did you know that a lot of places never even post when they have job openings? These employers don't care to sift through hundreds of cold applications—they'd rather wait until one of their employees or friends recommends someone. Even at places that do advertise openings, being referred by someone who knows you can give you an advantage over other applicants. [5] X Research source If someone does have a possibility for you, make sure you mention their name when you ask about a job. For example, you might introduce yourself to the employer, then say, \"John Schmidt goes to my family's church. When I mentioned I was looking for work, he said you might be looking for someone like me. Can I fill out an application?\""

From there, just enter information about your school, your GPA, and any jobs you've had (whether paid or volunteer work). [6] X Research source Since, as a teen, you likely don't have a lot of work experience, include information about extra-curricular activities as well. For example, if you play on your school's soccer team, list that on your résumé. It shows employers you have discipline and work well with a team. Many entry-level jobs won't ask for a résumé. Instead, they'll have a pre-printed application for you to fill out. Regardless, having a basic résumé means you have all the information in one place so you don't have to hunt around for it every time you fill out an application."

For example, if you want to work at McDonald's, you might apply at 2 different McDonald's restaurants within 10 miles of your home. If you submit your application online, call the location and ask to speak to the hiring manager. Introduce yourself and let them know that you've submitted an application online.

If you haven't heard back from the business after you submit your application, wait a few days—hiring managers are busy people! Then, give a quick call just to check in and find out the status of your application. [8] X Research source When you call, ask to speak to the hiring manager. Introduce yourself, then say something like: \"I submitted an application last week, and I was just wondering if you've had a chance to look at it yet.\" If they haven't, tell them you'll follow up in a few days. Keep a spreadsheet with a column for the name and phone number of each place you apply. In a second column, put the date you submitted your application. Add the date to follow up in a third column.

The interviewer will likely ask why you want to work there, so your research gives you some ideas for how to answer that question. You also want to have a few questions in mind to ask. Here are some to get you started: What kind of person are you looking for? Why do you enjoy working for this company? What would I do on a typical shift? What kind of people would I be working with? Do a lot of teenagers work here?"

You don't necessarily have to wear a business suit, but it's a good idea to dress as you would for a religious event or school ceremony. If you know how the employees dress, you could also try to dress like that to show that you're ready for the position. For example, if the employees all wear khaki pants and a blue polo shirt, you might wear khaki pants and a blue polo shirt to the interview. You'll look like you already work there! If you're interviewing at a clothing store, it's always a good idea to wear clothes that you bought at that store. If you don't have anything suitable from that store, you can't go wrong with classic style—just avoid wearing clothes that obviously came from a competing store."

Write something like: \"Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to sit and talk to me. I really appreciated learning more about your business. I'm excited to hear back from you and take the next step!\" Your \"thank you\" note shows the interviewer that you appreciate their time and puts your name back in front of them again.

When you call, mention your name and the date of your interview, then ask if they've made a decision. Ask to speak directly to the person who interviewed you. When you talk to them, say hello and tell them your name. Then you might say, \"we spoke on Monday about me working for you as a cashier. Just calling to see if you've made a decision on that position yet.\" If the interviewer doesn't give you any kind of timeline, wait about 3 days before you call back."

Anything you can do well you can probably get paid to do for others. [9] X Research source Do you know your way around social media? You might start a business to set up and manage social media accounts for individuals and small businesses. Good at organizing? You might start a business cleaning out garages and closets. The possibilities are virtually endless. Keep in mind that there's a lot of work that goes into this.
