      "title": "Try to wait at least 1 year before moving in with your partner.",
      "content": "Try to wait at least 1 year before moving in with your partner. While this timeline varies for every couple, experts note that dating someone for 1 year is a good timetable to stick to. When you’ve dated for a year, you’ve probably exited the honeymoon phase, and you’ve learned a lot about each other that you wouldn’t know early-on. [1] X Research source On average, most heterosexual couples move in together after dating for 2 years. For homosexual couples, that average is closer to 6 months."

      "title": "You’ve spent a lot of time alone together.",
      "content": "You’ve spent a lot of time alone together. Do you and your partner spend weekends together? Have you gone on a romantic vacation, just the two of you? If you enjoy each other’s company and you’ve spent a significant amount of time one-on-one together, that’s a good sign. [2] X Research source On the flip side, if you and your partner don’t get alone time very often, this is a good time to try it out before moving in together. Plan a weekend away where you two can bond and spend time together as a “practice” for moving in."

      "title": "You can argue in a healthy way.",
      "content": "You can argue in a healthy way. When you and your partner get into fights, can you talk through things calmly and reach a conclusion together? If so, that’s a sign that your communication is on point, and you may be ready to move in with each other. [3] X Research source If you and your partner aren’t great at fighting respectfully, try working on that together before moving in. Make it a habit to talk about issues as you and your partner vs. the problem, not you vs. your partner. Maybe you and your partner haven’t gotten into any arguments yet. That’s likely a sign that your relationship is still fresh, and you may want to hold off on moving in just yet."

    {
      "title": "You’ve met each other’s friends and family.",
      "content": "You’ve met each other’s friends and family. You know things are getting serious when you and your partner are ingrained in each other’s lives. If you’ve met the people closest to your partner and vice versa, it’s a good sign that you two are ready to take the next step in your relationship. [4] X Research source If you haven’t met your partner’s family yet, talk to them about why that is and ask if you can do that soon. This is a good step to take before moving in together, since it shows that the relationship is serious and on the right track."

      "title": "You can be your honest, authentic self around your partner.",
      "content": "You can be your honest, authentic self around your partner. Before moving in together, you should feel totally comfortable around your partner no matter what. When you live together, it’s much harder to hide silly habits or funny quirks, so be prepared to share most of your private moments with someone else. [5] X Research source If the idea of sharing your full, authentic self with your partner sounds daunting, that’s okay! It might be a sign that you two need to get to know each other more before taking the next step in your relationship. Being able to be yourself around your partner is a sure sign that you two share a strong emotional bond and a deep understanding of who the other person is—two crucial hallmarks of a relationship that’s ready for full commitment.

      "content": "You’ve maintained your independence throughout the relationship. You and your partner should still have your own friends, hobbies, and activities outside of each other. Make sure you’re staying independent, especially if you two do end up moving in together. [6] X Research source It’s easy to fall into the trap of only spending time with your partner, especially in a new relationship. Talk to your partner about how much time you’ve been spending together, and stress the importance of living your own lives, too."

When you think about the move, are you excited (and maybe a little nervous)? If so, that’s a good sign that you’re going in the right direction. [7] X Research source If your anxiety or dread outweighs the excitement, it might be a sign that you need more time before moving in."

      "content": "You don’t know your partner well yet. Have you seen your partner at their best and their worst? Do you know who their best friend is, what their dream job is, and what they were like as a child? It’s okay if you don’t know absolutely everything about your partner, but before moving in together, you should have a pretty solid understanding of who they are and what they want in life. [8] X Research source The opposite is true, too: your partner should have a good idea of who you are as a person."

Are you okay with your partner waking up next to you before you’ve brushed your teeth? What about your partner seeing you when you’re sick? If you feel like you have to hide parts of yourself from your partner, it may be too soon to move in together. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "You can’t have tough conversations with your partner. When you move in with someone, you’re going to have to talk about some uncomfortable things. Dividing chores and deciding on finances are big parts of living together, and you should be able to discuss these things freely. If the idea of talking openly with your partner makes you feel weird, then take some time before moving in with them. [10] X Research source You may also have to talk to them about things they do around the house, like making messes or leaving dirty dishes in the sink. If you feel like that might blow up into a huge argument, take some time to think before moving in together."

If you have doubts about their honesty or authenticity, put the brakes on moving in together for now. [11] X Research source In many cases, the best way to build trust is just to spend more time together. If you feel like you don’t trust your partner quite yet, maybe it’s because you haven’t known them long enough. However, you should always trust your gut. If you feel like your partner is hiding something from you, bring it up so you two can talk about it."

If you and your partner don’t communicate well or have problems with jealousy, address these issues first. [12] X Research source Problems like these can be tough to tackle on your own. Consider talking to a couple’s counselor to get an outside perspective on your relationship."

Talk to your partner about how serious you two are, and how you both fit into each other’s plans. During this conversation, you should also talk about where you want to live in the future. If you’re content with staying in your current city but your partner wants to move across the country eventually, that could cause conflict."

If there are some chores you absolutely hate doing, see if your partner will take those on (and vice versa). In terms of chores, moving in with a partner is a lot like moving in with roommates.
