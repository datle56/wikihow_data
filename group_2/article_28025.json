      "content": "Mix two 4 oz (118 mL) bottles of washable glue and 1 tsp (5 g) of baking soda. The color of the glue is completely up to you. Use colored glue, glitter glue, or plain school glue (as long as it’s washable, it’s perfect for slime). Mix the glue and baking soda in a large bowl with a spoon or popsicle stick until they’re smooth. [1] X Research source Elmer’s School Glue is a popular brand for making slime. Only have white glue on hand? No worries! Try spicing it up by dying it with food coloring or adding chunky or fine glitter."

      "content": "Add 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of contact solution into the mixture. Saline or contact solution activates the slime, giving it that stretchy and stringy texture. Mix everything slowly until the contact solution is well incorporated and the mixture starts to solidify and form a ball. [2] X Research source Double check that your contact solution contains boric acid (most brands do). Otherwise, the slime may not form the correct \"slimy\" consistency."

      "content": "Knead the slime until it’s your preferred texture. Pick up the slime ball and squeeze it between your hands until it becomes smooth. For a slimier texture, add another 1 ⁄ 2 US tbsp (7.4 mL) of contact solution. If your slime is too slimy, sprinkle more baking soda over it. [3] X Research source Store your finished slime in an airtight container at room temperature until it dries out or hardens."

If you want the color to be brighter, add a few more drops. Just keep in mind that the more color you add, the greater the chance the slime will dye your hands. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Combine the borax mixture and glue mixture. Dump the borax mixture into the glue mixture slowly, stirring occasionally. If you add too much too fast, the slime could harden and lose its elasticity. Keep mixing until the slime starts pulling away from the side of the bowl. [7] X Research source Start kneading the slime with your hands at this point. It might be sticky, but keep mixing. Add more activator (borax) if the slime doesn’t thicken. If you make smaller amounts of slime in separate containers, evenly divide the borax solution among the containers."

If the slime doesn’t stretch but rips while you play with it, you may need to begin the process over. If the slime is too sticky and doesn’t form a ball, try adding more borax and water.

The cold temperature will help the slime solidify and reach the ideal consistency.

The static electricity will cause the slime to stop flowing and appear to take on a life of its own. [12] X Research source Try moving or wiggling the styrofoam around the slime—the slime will follow it! Rub the styrofoam back on your hair or carpet to give it more charge as you play."

Don’t be alarmed if the mixture starts to froth up as you stir—this is normal. Store your slime in an airtight container away from direct sunlight and heat, and make a new batch when it hardens."
