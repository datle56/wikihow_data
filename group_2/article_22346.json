      "content": "Apply gentle pressure to stop any bleeding. If you have a minor cut, this may not be necessary. For deeper cuts, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or towel for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the bleeding stops. Try to keep the wound elevated until the bleeding stops as well.

      "title": "Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment. Wash your hands after cleansing the wound and before applying antibiotic ointment. You can use Neosporin or petroleum jelly. Spread the ointment over the entire wound using your clean index finger or a cotton swab. The ointment will keep your wound moist, which promotes healing. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Essential oils like myrrh, lavender, and rosemary have healing properties that may speed up the healing process as well. Mix 1 to 2 drops of oil with petroleum jelly. Apply the ointment with your clean index finger or a cotton swab. Manuka honey is another alternative that may help prevent infection and aid in the healing process."

      "title": "Use a Band-Aid or nonstick gauze to cover the wound.",
      "content": "Use a Band-Aid or nonstick gauze to cover the wound. Use a Band-Aid that covers the entire wound. Wrap gauze around the wound if it is near a joint or another area on your body that a Band-Aid cannot cover properly. Covering your wound will protect it from germs and dirt that may cause an infection, which will inhibit healing. [7] X Research source Take care not to get fibers from the cut gauze on your wound. Alternatively, cut a piece of gauze. Place the gauze on the wound and use medical tape to secure it in place."

      "content": "Change the dressing quickly. Wounds heal faster if they are kept moist and warm. Whenever you are changing the dressing, change it quickly to prevent drying, temperature loss, and exposure to bacteria. If you leave the wound exposed, this may cause its temperature to drop, slowing the healing process. [9] X Research source Keep bandages in your pocket, purse, or backpack just in case you need to change the dressing while you are out of the house."
