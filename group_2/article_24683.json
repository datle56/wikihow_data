      "content": "Kabedon is the act of pushing someone against a wall. While this act can be done to intimidate someone, it is mostly viewed as a flirty action because it is often performed during romantic confessions in various anime and manga. The kabedon is typically performed by a man to a woman, though it can be performed to and by any gender. [1] X Research source In general, the person doing the kabedon will slam one hand against the wall and lean into the other person to intimidate or fluster them. The word “kabedon” comes from the Japanese “kabe,” meaning wall, and “don,” meaning “bang.” Slapping the wall produces the “don” sound. Many believe the kabedon became so popular in anime and manga because it appeals to women’s romantic fantasies, in which men sweep them off their feet with their assertiveness. This could be because Asian men are rarely depicted as assertive or masculine in media. When a woman is the one performing the kabedon, it is sometimes called a reverse kabedon."

      "content": "The kabedon was popularized by the shojo manga LDK . LDK by Ayu Watanabe, which ran from 2009 to 2017, follows high school girl Aoi Nishimori as she must share an apartment with Shusei Kugayama, the “prince” of her school who has a reputation for turning down girls. Kugayama eventually performs the kabedon on Watanabe. [2] X Research source Shojo anime and manga cater toward girls and young women, so the kabedon is typically used as a romantic gesture. The term “kabedon” may have been coined by voice actor Ryoko Shintani in 2008, in which she referred to it as “a lovely situation.” The kabedon has since been seen in various anime and manga, including Say I Love You , Snow White with the Red Hair , and Junjou Romantica ."

      "content": "Fans soon turned the kabedon into a meme. While the kabedon may be romantic in anime, fans quickly realized it would probably be creepy, or at least awkward, in real life, and began poking fun of the trope online. Fans began posting humorous fan art on sites like Tumblr, with seemingly random characters performing the act. [3] X Research source For example, one popular piece of kabedon fan art comes from Tumblr user yokoshimako, who drew Sans from the video game Undertale performing the kabedon on the much taller character Papyrus. Artists also began to draw characters performing humorous variations of the kabedon, like pinning the other person to the wall with their leg rather than their arm. Anime and manga series also began poking fun at the trope."

Girls often had their boyfriends push them against the wall to see if the act was actually flirtatious in real life, though some users performed the act as a joke with their friends. Some Kabedon videos have surpassed millions of views. The exact origins of this challenge are hard to pinpoint, but it seems to have gained popularity between 2020 and 2022."

      "content": "Back a consenting partner against a wall. Before performing the kabedon, make sure your partner is okay with it. Then, face them with their back toward the wall. Slowly approach them so they’re forced to back up until their back hits the wall. Don’t rush toward them, as the kabedon would then seem too aggressive rather than flirtatious. [4] X Research source Even if you’re poking fun at the kabedon or doing it ironically, you’re still invading someone’s personal space. Make sure they’re okay with you doing so before continuing."

Again, don’t do this too forcefully or the kabedon may seem too aggressive. Lean into your partner, getting as close as you’re both comfortable with. Offer them a flirty smile and make eye contact to fluster them. [5] X Research source If you’re not trying to do a serious kabedon and are just joking around with a friend, try putting your foot against the wall instead."

If they seem flustered, gently tease them and lift their chin so they look you in the eye. Say something flirty if you wish, then pull them in for a kiss. [6] X Research source Remember, there’s a difference between your partner being flustered and being uncomfortable. If your partner seems intimidated, ask if they want you to continue. If they don’t, stop immediately. You can also play with their glasses or jewelry, or whisper in their ear. If you’re not romantically involved with your kabedon partner or you want to lighten the mood, try telling them a joke or making a funny face."

While the standard kabedon refers to pushing someone against the wall with one arm, other types of kabedon use both arms or even your legs. Many of these kabedons have their own unique names, as well. Here are some common ones: Ashidon: pinning someone to the wall with your legs Yukadon: pinning someone to the floor Semidon: pinning someone to the wall with both arms and both legs (also called the Cicada Block)"

      "content": "The Japanese government once encouraged doing the kabedon. In 2022, because of Japan’s declining marriage and birthrates, the Japanese Cabinet Office released a document called “Research Document on Love,” which was intended to help shy people find love. One of the things encouraged in the document was the kabedon. However, the public did not approve of the idea, as it could easily turn into a scary situation. [7] X Research source Some Japanese actors and TV personalities even commented on the document, explaining how some things are only romantic on TV. If someone you don’t like tries to kabedon you, you’d likely feel scared and intimidated rather than attracted to them. The public worried that this document would cause people to assume women enjoyed being on the receiving end of a kabedon, which could lead to an increase of sexual harassment."

While some may think the kabedon is creepy or awkward in real life, others may enjoy it. However, never do the kabedon without asking permission, and stop if the person you’re pinning seems uncomfortable. [9] X Research source If unwanted, the kabedon may be considered sexual harassment. Many people discourage doing the kabedon in real life because it often comes off as creepy or intimidating rather than flirtatious. Even if you mean no harm, you’re getting extremely close to someone and restricting their movement. That being said, it is unlikely that most people, especially in Japan, consider the kabedon appropriate to do in real life. In general, it is best left to fiction."
