      "content": "Open your windows to increase airflow in your home. One of the simplest and fastest ways to increase the oxygen in your home—and in your body—is to open a few windows around the house. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Open 2-3 windows to give the air someplace to enter and exit and create some steady airflow . Leave them open for 5-10 minutes at a time, and open them again when the house starts to feel stuffy. If you live in a cold or polluted area, consider cracking your windows instead, to let air in without overwhelming your home with cool temperatures or pollution. If you have outdoor allergies, consider installing clean air window screens that filter out birch pollen, grass pollen, and ragweed to help you enjoy fresh air without giving yourself an allergic reaction. [3] X Research source Also, close doors to your closets, pantries, and other areas that don’t lead anywhere to help air move throughout your house without it getting trapped."

[4] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source When selecting an air filter, take the following into consideration: How much money you want to spend—it may be worth it to spend more on a quality filter. The MERV rating (minimum efficiency reporting value) – the higher the MERV rating, the better quality the air filter.

Houseplants are useful in converting carbon dioxide to oxygen, and are a natural and aesthetically pleasing way to freshen up the air in your home. For the most effective setup, aim to have 1 houseplant per 100 sq ft (9.3 m 2 ) of space. [6] X Research source If you have limited room, put plants in the rooms you use the most, like your bedroom and kitchen. The following plants may be especially efficient: [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Areca palm Lady palm Bamboo palm Rubber plant Dracaena English ivy Dwarf date palm Ficus Boston fern Peace lily If you have pets, make sure your selected plants are non-toxic and pet-safe."

      "content": "Install extractor fans and have your home’s HVAC inspected. If you don’t have them, contact an HVAC contractor to install an extractor fan over your stove and in your bathroom. These suck moist and bad-smelling air out of your house, helping to improve ventilation and keeping the air in your home fresh. In addition, ask a contractor to inspect your home’s built-in ventilation system, which may not be working as it should if your home is constantly stuffy or hard to breathe in. Make sure you clean the fans every few months with warm water and a degreasing solution, especially in the kitchen. Clean them as often as suggested in the user guide that comes with your fan."

If you can perform some light exercises and get your blood pumping and lungs working, all the better. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Aim to walk or sit outside for at least 10 minutes a day, or whenever you feel you need more air, to keep your body healthy and happy. If you’re unable to go outside, sit by an open window to enjoy some fresh air indoors."

      "content": "Practice simple breathing exercises to take in more oxygen. Performing breathing exercises helps to make each breath more effective. For example, to perform pursed lip breathing, first relax your shoulders and neck muscles. Then inhale through your nose for 2 seconds. Purse your lips like you’re about to blow a kiss, then exhale for 4 seconds. Perform this exercise 5 times a day for 5-10 minutes at a time.

Carry a bottle and sip some water throughout the day to stay properly hydrated and oxygenated. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Beware beverages like “oxygenated water” that claim to offer more oxygen to your cells.

      "content": "Lie on your belly to help your body take in more oxygen. Lying prone and face-down prevents your heart and stomach from putting pressure on your lungs, and allows your lungs to fully expand. For a quick solution, try lying on your stomach, placing pillows under your head, chest, knees, or feet to get comfy. Keep that position for 1-2 hours, or as long as is comfortable. This position may also help you intake more oxygen throughout the night."
