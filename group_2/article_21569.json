      "content": "“Habibi” means “my love” in the Arabic language. The Arabic term \"Habibi\" is a multifaceted expression that encompasses both affection and respect. It directly translates to “my love” or my “my dear” and it’s used in a similar fashion. [1] X Research source It can be directed towards the opposite sex, or it can be used between the same gender. For example, two male platonic friends may call one another “Habibi,” while a boyfriend/girlfriend couple may refer to each other as “Habibi” as well. [2] X Research source “Habibi” stems from the Arabic word “habib,” which means “beloved” or “dear.” “Habib” is widely used in Arabic poetry and literature to express feelings of love and affection. [3] X Research source It has also been shaped by the diverse cultures and languages that have interacted with Arabic-speaking communities over time. For instance, the Arabic term \"habib\" is similar to the Hebrew word \"habibi\", both of which convey the meaning \"beloved\" or \"dear.\" [4] X Research source"

      "content": "To address a romantic partner In the rosy-hued lovers department, the word \"Habibi\" evokes a sense of tender affection, like the whispered promise of a lover's embrace. In English, common terms to call your significant other are “baby,” “honey,” “sweetie,” or “dear,” so think of “Habibi” along those same lines. [5] X Research source Traditionally, “Habibi” was used to address a male, while “Habibti” was used to refer to females; however, nowadays, using “Habibi” for both genders is widely accepted. This depends heavily on the culture, so do some research to understand what is and isn’t acceptable in the specific culture you are speaking in. [6] X Research source Example: “I thought about you all day, Habibi.”"

Likewise, you could refer to your sibling, cousin, aunts, uncles, etc., as “Habibi.” [7] X Research source Example: “Can I help you with your homework tonight, Habibi?”"

      "content": "To convey love between friends If your relationship with someone is strictly platonic, “Habibi” works well here, too! You can call your friends “Habibi” to express your general admiration for them or signify that the two of you have a strong bond. Think of it in the same way two friends might call each other “dude.” It’s the “You got this, Habibi” in a text message, or the “Looking good, Habibi!” comment on a new profile photo. [8] X Research source If you are addressing someone of the opposite gender in Arabic culture, even if they are just a friend, make sure this person has an understanding of the context you’re using the word in. This avoids any unnecessary romantic confusion or signs of disrespect. Example: “How have you been, Habibi? We need to get together soon!”"

      "content": "In casual conversations “Habibi” can be used in casual conversation as a greeting or as a way of showing someone you appreciate, care, or are worried about them. Simply put, it’s a way of spreading some warmth, comfort, and surprise in an otherwise mundane conversation. After all, why not make someone’s day by showing them a little affection? [9] X Research source On the same note, refrain from using the term on someone you’ve just met or don’t know well enough to express affection towards. You wouldn’t call someone you just met “my love,” so you wouldn’t call them “Habibi,” either! Although it’s fine to use in casual conversations with people you know well, it’s not the best idea to use “Habibi” in a professional setting, such as with casually acquainted coworkers or your boss. Example: “Have a safe trip home, Habibi! Let us know when you’ve landed.”"
