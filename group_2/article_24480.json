It's especially common among people who spend a lot of time alone, and it can serve different purposes. A lot of experts recommend self-talk as a healthy way to solve problems, regulate your emotions, focus on important tasks, and motivate yourself. [1] X Research source You can talk to yourself silently or even out loud – either is acceptable! But if you choose to self-talk out loud, wait until you're alone so other people won't hear your inner dialogue."

But you can often do the same thing and get similar results by simply talking to yourself! If you want to try this, refer to yourself in the second or third person (i.e., say \"you\" or your name instead of \"I\" or \"me\"). This helps distance you from your problems so you can approach them with less emotion and find more logical solutions.

When you're feeling a strong emotion, like anger or joy, talking to yourself about it and the circumstances that caused it can help you feel less stressed about it. This is especially helpful when we're at work, school, or even at home and want to avoid \"blowing up.\" Talking to ourselves is a quick and easy way we can deal with our feelings, good or bad, in the moment. It's also much healthier than taking them out on other people or through physical aggression (like hitting or throwing things). [3] X Research source"

That way, you'll have an easier time completing the task and can move on to something else. [4] X Research source"

For example, one common negative thinking pattern is catastrophizing, where we assume the worst possible outcome is always the most likely. Another is personalizing, where we believe every bad event is our fault. We might also filter out all the positive thoughts and focus only on the negative, when it should be the other way around. Finally, we might polarize, meaning we believe we're either totally good or totally bad.

If you tend to say negative things to yourself like \"I'm no good,\" \"I'm a terrible human being,\" or \"I can't do anything right,\" redirect your self-talk to positive mantras like, \"You're a good person\" and \"You can't do everything, but that's okay.\" It's okay if you don't believe the positive things you're saying about yourself at first.

Some great places to talk to yourself are your house (or your bedroom if you don't live alone), a private bathroom, in your car, on solitary walks, or anywhere else where you're completely by yourself. Avoid voicing your internal dialogue on the bus, the subway, public restrooms, in the store, or anywhere else where other people can hear you. The reason you should avoid talking out loud to yourself around other people is that strangers (or even friends and family) don't need to know all your private thoughts. More than that, though, they probably don't want to know. Instead, talk to yourself in your head while you're out in public. It's more considerate and will help you avoid a lot of funny looks!"

You certainly don't expect any voice other than your own to answer you. Even if you've made up a fictional persona to talk to (which some people find helpful), you don't actually believe they're real. If you lose that self-awareness, though, that's a sign that your self-talk has morphed into an unhealthy habit. The good news is this isn't likely to happen unless you're undergoing some kind of mental health crisis or are suffering a mental disorder. In either case, talking to a trusted friend or family member or even seeing a therapist about it may help you come back to reality."

[9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you believe these hallucinations are real, you might talk about them or even speak to them, but a casual observer might think you're just talking to yourself.

      "content": "Write your thoughts down. If the fact that you talk to yourself bothers you, try writing in a journal instead. Make it a part of your daily routine and write as often and as long as you want (or have time for). There are no rules for journaling, so you can write in the first, second, or third person – whichever perspective is most comfortable, choose that. According to Possing, this is also a helpful strategy for getting negative thoughts out of your mind. She also suggests writing down things you could think of instead that are more positive and helpful. For example, if you frequently tell yourself, \"You'll never achieve your dreams,\" write that down and then write a better thought, like, \"Even if I never achieve my dreams, I can still be happy.\""

      "content": "Talk to someone else instead. Giving yourself advice can be fun, but sometimes you need to stop talking to yourself and get an outsider's perspective – especially when you're wrestling with serious problems and feel depressed or anxious. Choose someone you trust, like a parent, a sibling, or your best friend, and tell them you need to talk to them about something. Wait for a moment when you can be alone together, then pour your heart out. If you're religious, you may also want to express your troubles in prayer. You may not get an answer right away, but it may help you feel better. If you feel depressed or anxious all the time, talk to a professional therapist . They can help you get to the root of your negative emotions and start on a path to better mental health. While talking to others is always a great idea when you're dealing with a big problem, avoid falling into the habit of dumping all your problems – big and small – on someone else (unless they're your therapist). For as much time as you talk about yourself, spend at least the same amount of time being an active listener and staying present for your loved ones."

If talking to yourself isn't helping you solve a problem or accomplish a positive goal, channel your energy into a different activity. For example, every time you get the urge to talk to yourself and rehash the same old issue (i.e., \"My parents just don't understand me\" or \"How can I get better at algebra?\"), do 10 squats or jumping jacks; perform breathing exercises ; put on some music or a podcast; or clean a room in your home. You can also try doing something that will actively help you with whatever you're ruminating about (like actually studying your algebra textbook instead of just thinking about it)."

Conversing with yourself in your head or out loud can help you solve problems, process your emotions, focus, stay motivated, and create positive beliefs about yourself and the world around you. It only becomes an unhealthy habit if all your self-talk is negative; if you talk out loud to yourself around other people; or if you're no longer aware that you're only talking to yourself. Otherwise, enjoy speaking to one of the most interesting people you know: you ! Speak to a medical professional if you experience hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech and thoughts, all of which can be symptoms of a mental disorder or a physical illness."
