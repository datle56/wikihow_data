Their eyes comprise three rows; the first row has four small eyes; the second row has two larger eyes and the third row has two medium-sized eyes. The two eyes in the center of their faces are distinctively larger than the other six eyes."

      "title": "Look at the arrangement of the fangs.",
      "content": "Look at the arrangement of the fangs. Wolf spiders have fangs that resemble pincers, with a side-to-side orientation. However, this is true of all species within the infraorder Araneomorphae, of which the wolf spider is a member. The infraorder Araneomorphae contains a vast number of species that as a group are known as \"true spiders\", so the fang orientation is not exclusive to wolf spiders. [3] X Research source However, this may be helpful in distinguishing a wolf spider from a small tarantula, because tarantulas are a member of infra-order Mygalomorphae and have vertically-oriented fangs."

      "content": "Don’t confuse the wolf spider with a brown recluse spider. The wolf spider has the same brownish-grey coloration, but does not have the violin-shaped marking behind its head that a brown recluse has. Also, the wolf spider has shorter legs than the brown recluse or any other web dwelling spider."

      "content": "Check if the spider retreats to a burrow. Examine the areas around your doors and windows, both around your house and any outbuildings you may have. If, you find one moving towards a burrow or crevice, instead of a web, that's further evidence that it's a wolf spider. However, the tarantulas and the trap doors also burrow, though they are usually quite a bit larger than the wolf spider."
