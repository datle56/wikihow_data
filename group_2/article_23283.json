      "content": "Look for a 5 to 20 ft (1.5 to 6.1 m) shrub or tree. Poison sumac typically grows into a shrub or tree about 5–20 ft (1.5–6 m) in height, but may occasionally grow even taller. While some poison tree varieties look more like shrubs, poison sumac looks fairly sparse. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Large poison sumac trees, like other species of sumac, often grow long, thin branches that sag or tilt downward with age."

      "title": "Look for double rows of leaves on each stem.",
      "content": "Look for double rows of leaves on each stem. On poison sumac plants, each stem has 2 parallel rows of leaves growing along its length. Each stem usually has between 6 and 12 leaves, plus an additional single leaf at the end. Young stems are typically red or red-brown, but this color may fade to brown or grey as the plant ages. [2] X Research source Technically, the leaves of a pinnate leaf are called “leaflets.”"

      "title": "Pick out the oblong shape of the poison sumac’s leaves.",
      "content": "Pick out the oblong shape of the poison sumac’s leaves. The leaves of this plant have an oval or oblong shape, tapering to a wedge or point on each end. [3] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. The sides of the leaf may appear wavy or smooth, but will not have the jagged \"tooth\" appearance of some non-poisonous sumac trees. If you aren’t sure if it’s poisonous or not, don’t touch it! Poison sumac leaves change color throughout the year, just like other deciduous plants. They may range from orange to green to red."

      "title": "Look for pale yellow or green flowers in the spring or summer.",
      "content": "Look for pale yellow or green flowers in the spring or summer. During the spring and summer, poison sumac may have pale yellow or green flowers. These small flowers grow in clusters along their own, green stems, separate from the red leafy stems. [4] X Research source The flowers are extremely tiny, and they can be hard to see at first glance."

      "content": "Find green or yellow berries during the fall. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source During summer or early fall, poison sumac replaces its flowers with berries. They can be pale-yellow, glossy, or cream-colored, and they often hang down low on the plant. [6] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. The berries may be eaten by animals or fall off naturally during the winter, so it’s not a surefire way to identify poison sumac."

      "content": "Be cautious if you live in the eastern United States or Canada. Unlike its relatives, poison ivy and poison oak, poison sumac is restricted to a fairly small area of the world. If you are outside the following areas, your chance of encountering poison sumac is almost zero: [7] X Research source Ontario, Quebec, and other eastern provinces of Canada. Minnesota, Wisconsin, and all U.S. states east of them, including all of New England. Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and all U.S. states east of them, including all of the South. Texas, and all states east of it along the southern U.S. border, including Florida."

[8] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. If the surrounding area is dry throughout the year, there is little chance that poison sumac is present. [9] X Research source During dry weather, keep an eye out for empty riverbeds or dried mud that indicate the area may usually be wet. These spots that are often flooded are also called wetlands."

      "title": "Be wary of poison sumac if you’re at a low elevation.",
      "content": "Be wary of poison sumac if you’re at a low elevation. Poison sumac has trouble growing at 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above sea level or above. If you are above 5,000 ft (1,500 m), there is almost no chance of exposure to poison sumac. Its relatives, poison ivy and poison oak, are also constrained to low elevations, meaning you’re pretty much safe if you’re up high."

      "content": "Wash your affected skin with soap and water. As soon as you know you’ve been exposed, wash your skin off with water right away. Do not use warm water because it will open your pores and make the exposure worse. You may also use soap, detergent, or specialized products such as Tecnu, but wash these off frequently so they do not dry on your skin along with any toxin they have picked up.

Wear a long sleeve shirt, pants that cover your legs completely, and socks and shoes that cover your feet. Put on safety glasses to protect your eyes, and wear gloves to cover your hands. This will help to reduce your chances of exposure. Wear cotton or leather gloves, not latex ones. Latex is not thick enough to protect you from the poison sumac oil."

      "content": "Use an herbicide that is absorbed through the leaves. Cut the tree or bush down to about 1 ft (0.30 m) above ground level, then apply the plant spray immediately. Make sure to spray all areas of the plant including the roots, vines, and leaves. You may have to do several treatments. Continue to spray the plants until no new growth appears.
