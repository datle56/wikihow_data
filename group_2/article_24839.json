      "content": "Clean your aluminum piece with warm water. Wet your aluminum piece with warm water and use a towel to clean off any dirt or debris that is stuck on the aluminum. Try to handle the aluminum as little as possible so that you don’t leave fingerprints. Make sure you clean your aluminum well so that the sealant works properly. Aluminium should only be cleaned with gentle, non-aggressive substances. You can mix water with some dishwashing soap, but remember to rinse it carefully. You can also use a detailer spray for a more in-depth clean on wheels and boats."

Find a large piece of lead that can sit in your bucket during this process that is at least as tall as your bucket. Set it into the battery acid mixture so that the top parts sticks out just slightly. This will be your cathode, or the negatively charged part of your electrical current. [9] X Research source If you don’t have a piece of lead, you can also use a large piece of aluminum. However, you will not be able to reuse the aluminum piece since it will react to the anodizing process as well. You can find scrap metal at most reuse stores."

Wrap your aluminum or titanium wire around your aluminum piece tightly so that there are multiple contact points between the wire and your aluminum piece. Make sure that the wire will not come off during the anodization process. [10] X Research source If you use aluminum wire, you will not be able to reuse it for another anodization process. Titanium wire is reusable. The wire will act as your positive charge during the electrical current. You can anodize 2 pieces of small aluminum at a time if they can fit on either side of the wire."
