      "title": "Condition your hair.",
      "content": "Condition your hair. While in the shower, make sure to condition your hair. Conditioner not only promotes healthy hair, but also helps repel water. Conditioners include coatings that stick to your hair and help the water slide off instead of being absorbed. If you have curly hair, smooth leave-in conditioner over your hair. This helps fight frizz during the air drying process. If you have fine hair, put some oil onto any dry ends. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove water before getting out of the shower.",
      "content": "Remove water before getting out of the shower. You can start the drying process before you even step out of the shower. Gently squeeze the excess water from your hair. After you squeeze as much water out of your hair as you can, take your fingers and comb through the strands. Fluff your hair so the strands separate. This helps your hair dry faster. Try not to get your hair wet again after you rinse your hair. Pin it up as you finish your shower, or keep it out of the spray. This decreases the water in your hair."

      "title": "Shake your hair out.",
      "content": "Shake your hair out. After you get out of the shower, flip your head upside-down. Shake your head around for a few minutes. Use your fingers to lift the roots to speed up the drying time. [2] X Research source Shaking your hair gets air flowing between the strands. This helps it dry faster than letting the strands stick together."

      "title": "Blot your hair with a towel.",
      "content": "Blot your hair with a towel. Use a towel to remove water from your hair. Make sure to use a microfiber or other super absorbent towel instead of a regular towel. A regular towel can make your hair frizzy and cause breakage. [3] X Research source Use an absorbent towel to soak up moisture. Try to remove as much water as possible. [4] X Research source Place your hair in sections. Squeeze the hair in the towel for a few seconds. Release and move on to the next section. Go over your hair and blot again as many times as needed. Use a different section of towel each time you dry a new section. This ensures you are not placing water back onto your hair. Don't rub your hair too vigorously with the towel. You can cause damage to the cuticle even with a microfiber towel. Instead of a towel, try using a soft cotton shirt or a pillowcase. The cotton will absorb the moisture and protect your hair. You can also try blotting with paper towels, but you will need to use several if you have long and/or thick hair. This helps reduce frizz."

      "title": "Focus on the roots.",
      "content": "Focus on the roots. While drying your hair, focus on the roots instead of the ends. The ends will dry faster than your roots. To make your hair dry faster, remove as much water from the roots as possible. Blot or gently squeeze the roots multiple times with your towel. Use a smaller towel to get closer to the roots as a large towel will not work. Fluff the roots of your hair continuously. Turn your head upside down and run your fingers through the roots. You want to get as much airflow to the roots as possible to make it dry faster."

      "title": "Comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb.",
      "content": "Comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb. Hair experts say you should never use a brush on wet hair. Instead, untangle your hair starting at the ends and working up to the roots using a wide-tooth comb. [5] X Research source This helps keep frizz down and reduces damage done to your wet hair. After combing, make sure to use your fingers to separate the hair strands or shake your head. Keep the strands loose to promote airflow. Add hair care products either before or after you comb your hair. Your hair needs products in it so you can style it when it is dry. Depending on what you want, try curling lotion, anti-frizz serum, or sea-salt spray. Use the comb to set your part. Then try not to touch with your hands. This can lead to frizz.

      "title": "Let your hair finish air drying.",
      "content": "Let your hair finish air drying. After blotting all the water and loosening the strands, let your hair air dry. The time it will take to dry completely will depend on the thickness of your hair, how much water you removed, and the weather. If it is taking a long time to dry, flip your head upside down every few minutes. This gives the air access to more surfaces of your hair, allowing for a faster drying time. Another option is to run your fingers or a comb through your hair every 10-15 minutes."

      "content": "Wrap your hair in a towel turban. Use a microfiber towel turban to wrap your hair in after your shower. Leave the hair in the turban while you get ready, eat breakfast, or do other tasks. Check in about 10-15 minutes, and your hair should be on its way to being dry. [7] X Research source Make sure to remove excess water before putting it up in the turban. Gently squeeze the water from the strands, then blot the excess moisture from your hair. Then wrap it in the turban. Instead of buying a special turban, just wrap your hair in a microfiber towel."

      "title": "Try plopping your hair.",
      "content": "Try plopping your hair. Plopping is a great way to air dry curly hair. Start by applying a curl enhancing cream or mousse to your hair. Wrap a soft cotton t-shirt around your head. Instead of wrapping the shirt like a turban on top of your hair, twist the shirt so it curls around your ears. Each side will look like sausage rolls. Secure the ends at the base of your neck. Keep the towel on your hair for 20-30 minutes before removing. Make sure to remove excess water and blot your hair before twisting it in the t-shirt."

      "content": "Use a microfiber brush. A microfiber brush is a brush that has microfiber bristles. These sponges soak up extra moisture in your hair. Keep running the brush through your hair to help remove water. Try brushing your hair a few times with the microfiber brush. Shake your hair to help the airflow around the strands. Then about 5-10 minutes later, repeat."

      "content": "Shake your hair dry. Remove the excess moisture and blot your hair. Then, turn your head upside down and shake it. Use your fingers to separate and fluff the roots of your hair. Hold your hair and gently shake it up and down. Bend over and shake your head around. The shaking motion helps air circulate around the strands. It also breaks up clumps of hair that contain and hold water. Use caution when you shake your head because you may get dizzy after only a minute or 2."

      "content": "Sit in the sun. The heat from direct sunlight will help dry your hair. If you have the time, sit outside or take a walk as your hair dries. Make sure to remove excess moisture and blot your hair before you walk outside. Shake your hair and fluff it at the roots. This will help it dry faster. If you do this on a windy day, you will be able to dry your hair even faster."
