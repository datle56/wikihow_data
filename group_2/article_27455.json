      "title": "Rinse the urud dal and fenugreek seeds until the water runs clear.",
      "content": "Rinse the urud dal and fenugreek seeds until the water runs clear. Place ½ cup (100 g) of urud dal (black gram) and ½ tablespoon of fenugreek seeds into a pot. Fill the pot with water, then use your hand to swish the urud dal and seeds around. Drain the water from the pot, then repeat the process 1 to 2 more times. [1] X Research source You can use whole or split urud dal. Alternatively, place the urud dal and fenugreek seeds into a strainer, then hold them under running water. Sift them until the water runs clear."

      "content": "Soak the urud dal, seeds, and poha in water for 4 to 5 hours. Drain the urud dal and fenugreek seeds 1 last time. Keep them in the pot, then add ¼ cup (37g ) of poha and 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Set the pot aside for 4 to 5 hours. [2] X Research source Poha is also called “flattened rice.” The urud dal, fenugreek seeds, and poha will expand as they soak, so make sure the pot is big enough to hold twice the amount. Get started on rinsing the rice while the urud dal, seeds, and poha are soaking. This way, they will both be ready at the same time."

      "content": "Rinse the parboiled rice and basmati rice until the water runs clear. Place 1 cup (225 g) of parboiled rice and 1 cup (225 g) of bastami rice into a pot. Fill the pot with water, then swish the rice around. Drain the water, then repeat the process 2 to 3 more times. [3] X Research source For the parboiled rice, use either idli-dosa or short-grain rice. Use a separate pot for this. Do not use the same pot that the urud dal, fenugreek seeds, and poha are soaking in. You could also rinse the rice in a strainer under running water. Sift the rice with your fingers until the water runs clear."

Pulse the grinder for a few seconds, then add another 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of drained urud dal water. Keep grinding and adding water until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. [6] X Research source You probably won’t end up using all of the drained water, which is fine. How much water you end up using will vary a little each time. Plan on using about 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 mL) of water for every ½ cup (100 g) of urud dal."

Set the strainer over a pitcher, then pour the rice through it. Put the rice into the grinder and save the rice water. You don’t need to clean out the grinder, but you can if you want to. Everything will get mixed together in the end anyway."

If your home is below room temperature, stick the pot into an oven, then turn the oven light on. Leave the batter covered and undisturbed for 8 to 10 hours while it ferments. [10] X Research source If your pot or container doesn’t have a lid, use a large plate instead. Cover the pot or container with a blanket, if needed, to ensure that no air gets in. If you’re using an oven, don’t actually turn the oven on. The light will generate just enough heat for the batter to ferment."

If it isn’t, stir in a pinch of baking soda. This will help make it bubbly again, which is key to creating perfect idli. [11] X Research source At this point, you can add some salt if you don’t think the batter is salty enough."

[13] X Research source If you stand the pans with the wells positioned directly above one another, the idli won’t have room to expand as they cook. They will get squashed!"
