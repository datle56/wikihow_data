Let them know that these are your own boundaries, and while it has nothing to do with them, your partner needs to respect them. Try saying something like: [20] X Research source “Before we get too serious, I wanted to talk about my boundaries about sex. I’ve decided to wait until marriage before having sex, and I need you to respect that. But I’m comfortable kissing you and cuddling with you.” “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you these past few weeks. Is it okay if we wait to have sex until we’re in a committed relationship? I’m fine doing other things with you, but I’d like to wait and have sex until we know each other a little bit better.” You two are on the same team: make sure they know this.

In a healthy relationship , you’ll be able to discuss your thoughts, feelings, and needs with your partner without it turning into a fight. If your partner gets upset at you, try to stay calm.

Try not to let the talk go on for longer than an hour if possible. When you’re both exhausted, you’re more likely to say things you don't mean and to make decisions you regret. If your discussion isn’t done but you’re both tired, make a date to continue the discussion later. You don’t even have to leave each other’s presence if you don't want to; you can just agree to put the discussion on hold until you both have more energy to return to it."

[22] X Research source Your partner could need anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to think about what you’ve said.
