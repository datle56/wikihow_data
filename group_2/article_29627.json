      "content": "Know where to build your fort on a hot day. Try to build your fort near a fan or air conditioning unit. You can build your fort near an open window, but only if the window is shady and there is no sun coming in through it. An open window may bring in a cool, fresh breeze, but it can also let the hot sun in! If you can build your fort in a basement, then even better! Basements are nice and cold during the summer, and the floor will keep you cool."

The edge of the cushion should be touching the backrest of the sofa. If you are using regular pillows instead, put two pillows on each armrest. You want the pillows to reach the top of the sofa, so you may need more pillows. Keep stacking pillows until they are even with the top of the sofa.

Tug on the ends so that the blanket is stretched across the top of your fort. Something light, such as a bed sheet will work the best because it will be less likely to make your fort cave in. Blankets and comforters are thick and will make your fort nice and dark inside because they block out light. [2] X Research source They are also heavy, however, and may cause your fort to cave in."
