Even if you’re planning to be a professional athlete or a singer, you need to think critically and communicate well. No one will take you seriously if can't communicate effectively. [2] X Research source If you speak and write well, you’re more likely to be hired. Communicating as a part of a team is essential. Take your work and life seriously.

      "content": "Look into job prospects. While you’re planning out your long-term future, remember that getting to that point will take many small steps in the job market first. You may think you’re better than working at McDonalds, or being a pizza delivery guy, but everyone starts somewhere. Consider these ways to look for jobs: Go into local businesses where you think you'd be a good fit. Ask them if they are hiring. Fill out an application. Talk with family and friends about jobs in the area. Network with people you know about job openings and qualifications. Go to a career center, or see a guidance counselor. There may be people at your school who can help find out about local jobs for teens. Most cities have employment centers with people that can help you find a job or get training. Go online, and see about jobs available through job search engines. Look at what the qualifications are to do the work. Think about ways to meet those qualifications if you don't have them already."

      "content": "Get your own transportation. Unless you live in a major city with easy access to public transit, having your own transportation will open doors to more jobs and opportunities outside of your immediate neighborhood. Find out if your family can assist with getting a car. If not, think about ways to get a job that will be focused on saving for a car. Don’t waste your money on buying a fancy car. When you’re starting out, it’s about looking at your future long-term, not just what looks good today. Your car should be a gateway to freedom, not a gateway to debt. Be careful and choose wisely. If you have limited access to public transportation and cannot yet afford your own car, look into carpooling in your area or using something like ZipCar, Uber, or Lyft to get where you need to go."

      "content": "Find housing. When you’re heading out on your own, it can be tough. Moving out of your family’s home and finding a place of your own takes some time, thought, and money. Before you start looking for a place, consider this: If you’re trying to get an apartment and you’re under 18, a parent or legal guardian may be required to be on the lease. If you’re over 18 and looking for a place for yourself, many apartments require that you show employment or income that is at least 3x the rent. If you do not have a current job, you may be required to pay several months of rent upfront or have a co-signer on your lease. Avoid choosing housing that has a lot of unnecessary perks that may drive up costs. Keep costs affordable. There may be online tools in your state or area to find more affordable housing. Consider finding a room for rent rather than an entire apartment. You may be able to share utility costs and save on rent. Be cautious of moving in with friends or family if you think they may not be responsible with money. Everyone on the lease is responsible if rent is not paid."

But the hard truth is that those things are often unnecessary luxuries that can be expensive, and if you’re not careful, you’ll run into debt. Debt is one of the biggest deterrents to independence and getting your life started. With any money you earn, make sure to save more than 20% in a savings account. Open a bank account. Make sure to put some of your money into savings. [3] X Research source Think before you spend. While it’s nice to have nice things, it’s important to pick your nice things wisely. Ask yourself if you really need it and if it's going to give you long-lasting enjoyment. Save up for the big things, rather than buying something with credit. Bad credit can hurt your future. You will end up paying more for things like cars, furniture, electronics, and homes. Bad credit can even hurt you when you're looking for an apartment, or trying to get a job. Potential landlords and employers can legally use bad credit as a factor in their decisions. [4] X Research source"

Think about your personality, and what you think might be a good match. Write down the steps you may need to take to get from point A (the present) to point B (the goal). Learn to organize your thoughts into clear, doable actions. See your five-year plan as a series of small steps and goals. Break down how long you think it might take to complete each step. For example, if you want to be head chef at a restaurant in five years, find out if you need to go to a culinary school or if you can simply start as a dishwasher and learn skills on the job as you move up. Find out what it take to go from being a line cook to a head chef. Think about if you want to start your own business, and how to get training in this."

Things may change unexpectedly — you may find that you're not that interested in being a doctor after shadowing at a hospital, or you might decide that you want to focus on travel more than a career. As you change and grow, so will your interests and priorities. Be flexible enough to realize that's ok and to accommodate those changes. It's okay if you don't have everything figured out. Just try to identify a starting point and go from there."

Learn the difference between people who annoy or hurt you versus people who may come across as negative because they are telling you to be cautious. Not all criticism is bad, so think before you discredit someone's point. Trust your own judgment if negativity seems to dominate a conversation. Some people may want you to fail because it makes their life easier, or because they are struggling and want things to be difficult for other people, too. Be strong and be positive ."

Older generations may be able to give some honest answers about the good and bad of being independent, and what directions to take. You may be surprised to learn what older family members have been through or overcome, and they probably have a lot of solid, hard-won advice.
