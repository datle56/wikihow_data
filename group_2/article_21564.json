Be aware that rivers with naturally reproducing trout populations sometimes have stricter tackle and bait restrictions. [1] X Research source Get fishing bait. Check the bait restrictions wherever you plan to fish. Use one of the following: worms, crickets, grasshoppers, salon roe or corn kernels. Find a spot upstream to increase your chances of catching a trout. Look for an easily accessible clearing on the shoreline. Try to find a spot with slow moving patches of deep water or converging currents. Bait your hook and cast your rod. Find out how to catch a trout here: How to Catch a Brown Trout in the Winter. Set the hook in the trout by quickly jerking the rod tip up. Reel in slowly and keep the rod tip above your head. Scoop the fish up with your net once you’ve brought the fish to the shore.
