      "title": "Wash your hands",
      "content": "Wash your hands before and after treating the cut. Wash up with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds before touching your cut to avoid contaminating it further. Since it’s easy to spread germs that cause infection, wash your hands again after touching the cut. Avoid touching the cut unless you’re cleaning it or changing the bandage. Scratching or playing with it can spread germs and worsen the infection."

    {
      "title": "Clean the infected cut.",
      "content": "Clean the infected cut. Wash the cut thoroughly, using gentle soap and warm water. This will rinse away bacteria and other infectious microbes. After washing the cut, rinse it with warm water for about 5 minutes, then gently blot it dry with a clean towel. Do not clean or rinse the cut with iodine, rubbing alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide, as these can irritate the injured tissue and slow down the healing process."

    {
      "title": "Apply an antiseptic or antibacterial solution.",
      "content": "Apply an antiseptic or antibacterial solution. Use a clean gauze pad, cotton swab, or paper towel to wipe the cut with an antibacterial ointment. Throw the pad or swab away after it touches your cut. Don’t add more ointment to the swab or set it down on a countertop. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Apply antibacterial ointment 3 times a day or whenever you change the dressing."

    {
      "title": "Cover the cut with a sterile bandage.",
      "content": "Cover the cut with a sterile bandage. Dress the cut with an adhesive bandage or gauze to keep out dirt and prevent spreading the infection. Change the dressing at least 3 times a day, or whenever it gets wet or soiled. [2] X Research source Don’t let the sticky part of an adhesive bandage touch the cut. Additionally, avoid touching the part of the bandage that comes into contact with your cut."

      "title": "See a doctor promptly if the cut was due to a bite or rusty object.",
      "content": "See a doctor promptly if the cut was due to a bite or rusty object. Seek medical attention as soon as possible after getting bitten or cutting yourself on something dirty. Human or animal bites are more likely to cause a serious infection than other types of cuts. Cuts or punctures from rusty, dirty objects can lead to a tetanus infection or other serious illness.

      "title": "Consult your doctor if you have a condition that interferes with healing.",
      "content": "Consult your doctor if you have a condition that interferes with healing. A medical professional should examine an infected cut if you have diabetes, an immune disorder, cancer, kidney, liver or lung conditions, or any other medical conditions that interfere with proper healing. There could be serious complications due to the underlying condition. [4] X Research source If you just have a minor paper cut that’s healing well, you probably don’t need medical attention. However, a deeper cut that’s red, swollen, and isn’t healing is a cause for concern."

      "title": "Call your doctor if pain or tenderness worsen after 1 to 2 days.",
      "content": "Call your doctor if pain or tenderness worsen after 1 to 2 days. Within a couple of days, signs of infection should go away and your cut should start to heal. If it doesn’t get better, or if it becomes more painful, has an odor, or develops drainage or discharge, schedule an appointment or visit a health clinic. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Have a doctor examine pus, cloudy discharge, or an abscess.",
      "content": "Have a doctor examine pus, cloudy discharge, or an abscess. An abscess is a pus-filled lesion that looks like a red, warm lump. It’s usually painful to touch and feels like it’s filled with liquid. Your doctor should take a culture for pus or discharge, and might have to drain an abscess. [6] X Research source Never try to drain an abscess on your own."

      "content": "Seek emergency care if you have severe symptoms. Severe symptoms could indicate tissue damage, or that the infection has spread to other parts of your body. While uncommon, a serious infection from a cut can be life-threatening.

      "content": "Tell your doctor where you got the cut when they examine you. If you have serious symptoms and need to see a doctor, they’ll start by performing a physical exam. Let them know how and when you got cut, when your symptoms appeared or started worsening, and any antibiotics or other medications you’ve recently taken. [8] X Research source This information will help your doctor determine the best course of treatment."

      "title": "Get a skin culture.",
      "content": "Get a skin culture. Your doctor will most likely take a sample of any pus or discharge, cut a small tissue sample, or wipe the infected cut with a swab. They’ll then have the sample tested for specific germs. The results will let them know whether you need antibiotics and, if necessary, which type to prescribe.

Don’t stop taking it even if your cut heals. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you stop taking an antibiotic prematurely, the infection might come back and get worse.
