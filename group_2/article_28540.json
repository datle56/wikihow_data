      "content": "Find the right hairstyle or hair color for you. Not everybody can pull off bangs or bleach blonde hair. It might require some experimentation, and years of trial-and-error to find your ideal hairstyle. Choose a hair color that is within one or two shades of your natural color so that it is easy to maintain, and won't look ridiculous once your roots grow in. If you want to go lighter, consider adding subtle highlights rather than a new overall color. Take your face shape into account when finding the right haircut. The idea is to play up your natural features and avoid exaggerating the face shape. Consider the following hairstyle suggestions: Women with round faces look good with asymmetrical hairstyles with a side part. Women with square faces should try angled bobs, long or medium-length layered cuts, or side-swept bangs. Women with long, thin faces look good with short or medium-length hair with subtle waves, and should avoid getting blunt, straight-across bangs.

Trends come and go, and not all of them are figure-flattering. Show off your best assets, and cover up your worst ones. For example, if you have an hourglass figure, wear form-fitting dresses that show off your curves and avoid bulky or boxy clothes. Ignore the size on the label. Many women go out of their way to squeeze into a pair of jeans that are too small for them out of fear of \"going up a size.\" In reality, how you look in the clothes matters more than the number on the tag.
