      "content": "Add fabric paint . Use a fabric paint in your chosen color. Add three tablespoons of the paint to your spray bottle. [2] X Research source If you want a less vibrant color, however, experiment with adding less paint. Only adding one to two tablespoons of fabric paint will create a pastel shade."

      "title": "Shake the bottle vigorously.",
      "content": "Shake the bottle vigorously. Give the bottle a good shake. For about 30 to 60 seconds, shake the bottle to mix the paint and water. Keep shaking until you have a uniform mixture that's one solid color. [3] X Research source Make sure the cap is on tight before you begin shaking. You do not want to end up getting dye on your clothing or hands."

      "content": "Wear gloves and goggles. When handling chemical water, it's important that you take safety precautions. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Wear thick gloves, such as gardening gloves, the entire time to protect your hands. For added protection, wear long-sleeved clothing as well."

      "title": "Prepare your chemical water.",
      "content": "Prepare your chemical water. You will need urea, ludigol, and water softener to make chemical water. Buy these products at a hardware store or online. To make the chemical water, add a quart of warm water to a bucket. From there, add three fourths a cup of urea, two teaspoons of ludigol, and one teaspoon of water softener. If you need more dye, expand the recipe as needed. You will need three fourths a cup of urea, two teaspoons of ludigol, and a teaspoon of water softener per quart of water."

    {
      "title": "Add the dyes.",
      "content": "Add the dyes . Remove your chemical water from the bucket where you mixed it. Store the dye in bottles, smaller buckets, or cups. You will then add your chosen colors of dye to these containers to add color to the chemical water. There is no precise amount of dye to add. It depends on how dark you want your colors. More dye will yield darker colors and less dye will make pastel shades. For example, add three cups of red dye for a dark red while one cup should make a lighter shade. The color that shows up on the fabric should be similar to the dye's color."
