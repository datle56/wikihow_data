Select “Share” and choose “Save” to save the GIF to your Photos. [2] X Research source The “resolution” sets the size and quality of your image. Choose Small, Medium, Lage, or XL. The “slide range” refers to the slides included in your GIF. Use the number wheel to set the beginning and ending slides, then tap “Back”. The frame rate indicates how fast the slideshow will play. For example, a framerate of 1 frame per 5 seconds will make the slideshow progress to the next image every 5 seconds. Select your desired framerate, then tap “Back”. The “Auto-advance” lets you decide how much a user can skip ahead in the slideshow by tapping the image. Choose a lower setting to cause a tap to advance the slideshow by just a few frames, or a higher setting to make the slideshow advance by many frames."
