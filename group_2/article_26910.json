      "content": "Grease the inside of a large, microwave-safe mug. Choose a large mug that is about 12 to 16 ounces (350 to 475 mL). If it's any smaller, the cake may overflow and make a mess. Lightly grease the inside of the mug; this will make the cake easier to remove. You can use cooking spray, butter, or a cooking oil."

Stir everything together with a fork or spoon. If you want a slightly less-sweet cake, add a pinch of salt."

Stir everything together with a spoon until the color and texture are consistent. Scrape the bottom and sides of the mug often so that everything mixes in. To enhance the flavor of the cake, add in a little bit of vanilla extract. You could also add in some chocolate chips for extra flavor and a gooey texture. You can stir them in, or leave them sprinkled on top. Chocolate chips come in different flavors, such as mint, white, milk, and dark. Choose a flavor that you like best! For a vegan version, use a non-dairy milk instead."
