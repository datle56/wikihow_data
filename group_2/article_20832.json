      "title": "Fill a shallow bowl with lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Fill a shallow bowl with lukewarm water. Water should only be an inch or two deep. It shouldn't be too cold, as budgies are susceptible to cold. You can also find baths that attach to the side of your bird's cage. If you find your bird doesn't like the bowl of water, you can also try wet grass or greens at the bottom of a (clean) cage. Your bird will enjoy rolling in them as a way of bathing. You don't need to use soap. Regular soap can harm and irritate the budgie’s skin. Bird soap is only used to clean the cage, and not the budgie itself."

      "content": "Put a towel under the cage. If you're worried about water splashing out, set a towel under the cage. It is recommended to put another one around the cage if the cage is on the ground to prevent the floor from being wet. It will help catch the splashing."

Take the budgie in there, and close the door so it can't fly away. However, make sure your sink is clean first."

      "content": "Let the budgie play. Budgies will splash and flutter in the water. The splashing is the budgie giving themself a bath. Most budgies enjoy the process immensely. If you're budgie doesn't jump in immediately, give it a chance to get used to it.

You can also often find them in the gardening section of a home improvement store. An alternative to a spray bottle is a perch you can place in your own shower, which you can usually find at pet stores. Just place your shower head on a gentle spray, and turn the water on lukewarm.

      "content": "Spray the water over your bird. You want to create a gentle mist that showers down over your bird. Don't spray them right in the face, as most birds will not like that. If they move or fly away from the mist, stop it as they might not want to shower or just hate showering in general.
