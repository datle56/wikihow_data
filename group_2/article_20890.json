      "title": "Offer to write a positive letter.",
      "content": "Offer to write a positive letter. If someone approaches you about providing them a reference, first consider their request. If you have had a good experience with the person and can positively support their candidacy for a position, then offer to write them a positive letter. However, it’s important that you are honest, as your reputation could be damaged if the person doesn’t act in the manner you described at their new job. Don’t offer to write a letter if you cannot write anything truthfully positive. You don’t want to hurt the person’s chances of getting a job. [1] X Research source If you feel you cannot write a positive employee reference, you would typically decline and tell the employee that you don’t feel able to write a strong letter. Only accept providing a reference if you’ve worked with the person for a longer period of time. It’s hard to get a sense of someone’s capabilities and working style in a few months. [2] X Research source Make sure that you are the appropriate person to provide the reference. This may require checking your company’s policies on references."

      "content": "Find out the position and details for the job. Ask the person to give you information on the job for which they’re applying and any other relevant data you should know including her resume. [3] X Research source You should also collect any information pertinent to the person’s job for you such as performance reviews. [4] X Research source Ask the person for whom you will write a reference letter to tell you about the job for which you will be recommending her, an updated resume, and other information such as how she thinks she contributed to your company or projects and how she could benefit her new workplace. [5] X Research source Consider reading through your correspondence with the person to get an assessment of their professionalism and how they work. You can also use performance reviews for this purpose. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Draft a preliminary letter.",
      "content": "Draft a preliminary letter. Before you provide the person a positive reference for your former employee or colleague, use the information you gathered to draft a preliminary letter. This will help you ensure that your reference is positive and comprehensive. A reference letter should be between one and two pages in length. If you write anything longer, the potential employer may not read the entire text and could miss vital information about the candidate. [7] X Research source A brief introduction should state the person’s name, the job for which they’re applying, and if you recommend them for the position. [8] X Research source For example, you could write “It is with pleasure that I recommend Christopher Smith for the position of brand manager. Christopher has made a significant contribution to my work/ this company, and I think he could be a great asset to your team.” The body of the letter can be 1-3 paragraphs and should discuss how long you’ve known the person, in what capacity you’ve worked together, discuss and highlight their skills, and address how the person could benefit the potential employer. [9] X Research source You want to provide actionable evidence of why the person is the best candidate for the job. You can also discuss the person’s character in the main body of the letter, though you should be careful to not include personal information, which may not only prejudice a potential employer, but could also be illegal. You should close with a brief summary paragraph noting that you highly recommend the person, and offering to make yourself available should the potential employer have questions. For example, “Based on my experiences with Christopher Smith, I would recommend him for the position of brand manager with Brand Management, Inc. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me via email or by telephone.”"

      "content": "Use positive and actionable words. When you’re drafting and later revising your reference letter, you want to make sure to use both positive and actionable language when describing the candidate. This can help the potential employer get a better sense of the candidate and may also present a more positive image of her. [10] X Research source Use verbs such as collaborate, cooperate, and promote. Use nouns such as team-player, asset, and responsibility. Use adjectives such as reliable, intelligent, good-natured, diligent. You can put these words together in phrases such as “Christopher and I collaborated on a marketing project and he was a significant asset in our gaining several new clients. He is a responsible and friendly team-player who will make a positive impact on your company.”"

      "title": "Be honest and don’t exaggerate.",
      "content": "Be honest and don’t exaggerate. You want to sell the candidate as best as possible while being honest about their qualifications. There is a fine line between honesty and exaggeration and you want to avoid this so that potential employers don’t find your letter disingenuous. [11] X Research source You don’t necessarily need to say the person is the best or the greatest unless they actually are. Instead, consider writing something like “Christopher is one of the most responsible and collegial co-workers with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work.” When assessing someone’s technical skills and abilities, you can write something along the lines of “Christopher is among the top 5% of brand managers with whom I have worked.”"

This can help ensure that you don’t forget important information about the candidate’s skills or behavior during the conversation. Since you will not know what questions the potential employer may ask, make sure to write notes on various aspects of the candidate including how you know them and for how long, in what capacity you worked together, and an assessment of their skills. Be prepared to answer questions about the candidate’s strengths on both a professional and personal level and give specifics with regard to how and when you’ve witnessed these strengths on display.
