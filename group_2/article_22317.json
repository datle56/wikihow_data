      "content": "Apply pressure to the wound for 15 minutes. If rinsing your mouth doesn’t stop the bleeding, you can apply pressure to the cut with a piece of gauze. Gently press the gauze against the cut for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. [10] X Research source Don’t peek under the gauze before 15 minutes is up, since this could disturb the clot that’s forming and make the bleeding start up again. If the gauze gets soaked through, just put a fresh piece on top of it. If the bleeding is severe or doesn’t stop after 15 minutes, get medical help. If you have bleeding inside your lip, you can also apply pressure by gently pressing the wound against your teeth or gums from the outside."
