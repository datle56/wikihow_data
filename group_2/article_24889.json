      "content": "Create a tracking system that works for you. The most important part of keeping track of your finances is consistency. Regardless of which way you log your transactions, you must be able to refer back to them easily and reliably. Be sure to include important information like the date, the amount spent or gained, and the expense category with each entry. Also, make recordings consistently, so your log stays up to date. Expense categories are an easy way to determine what you spend the most money on. These categories may include things like housing, utilities, groceries, health care, and entertainment. Aim to log your expenses daily, weekly, or biweekly. Consider color-coding your tracking system, so it’s easier to find information. For instance, you may have food expenses marked with green pen and travel expenses in gray. [1] X Research source"

If you don’t want to make your own logbook , try finding one online. Simply search “finance logbook template” and find a design that works best for you."

Regardless of which method you choose to track your finances, reviewing your earnings and spending habits at the end of each month can help you budget for the future. Where did you spend the most money? Did you earn less or save more? Use the information you learn to make adjustments to your budget and spending habits for the next month. Start by totaling your expenses and comparing the sum to your monthly income. If you're spending more than you're making, identify the source of your overspending. Total your spending by category to identify where your money is going. That is, combine the totals spent in each expense category and compare them to each other, or divide the total of each category by the total of all of your monthly expenses to get a percentage of total category expenses."
