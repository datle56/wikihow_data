      "content": "Provide 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for each guppy. Though guppies are small fish, they still require plenty of space for swimming. Your tank should be large enough to provide 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for each guppy, so if you have 4 guppies, for example, you’ll need a 4 gallon (15 L) tank. If your tank becomes overcrowded, the guppies may get sick or die. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a 1:2 male to female ratio for guppies. You can choose to keep all male or all female guppies. Alternatively, if you want both sexes, choose twice as many females as males. If you have more males than females, the males may chase and harass the females, which can kill them. [3] X Research source In order to breed guppies , you’ll need to set up a separate breeding tank to protect the fry from other fish."

      "content": "Turn off the lights for at least 8 hours per day. Guppies need light to thrive during the day, but constant light can actually kill them. Set your tank light on a timer so that it goes out and night and provides the guppies with time to rest and recharge. [4] X Research source"

Hiding spots, like caves, tubes, logs, and plants, give guppies somewhere to rest and relax. Ensure there are enough hiding spots for all the fish in the tank.

Fully clean the tank, including the gravel or substrate and the equipment (such as a filter), once per month to remove parasites that could harm your guppies. Be sure to test and adjust the temperature and pH of new water before adding it to the tank.

Water temperature above or below the recommended levels can cause your guppies to perish. Use a tank thermometer to ensure the water temperature remains consistent. [14] X Research source Add a small amount of hot or cold water (such as ¼ cup (59 m) at a time) to the tank to adjust the temperature.

The best solution is to keep them in a separate tank for at least 1 month to see whether they are carrying any pathogens. Sick fish should also be quarantined until they recover so they don’t infect their tank mates. [18] X Expert Source Doug Ludemann Aquarium Care Professional Expert Interview. 27 August 2019."
