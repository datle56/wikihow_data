      "content": "Gather your supplies. You will need several ingredients, plus a few tools to make this mascara recipe. Before you get started, you will need: [1] X Research source 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil 1 teaspoon of coconut oil 1/2 teaspoon of beeswax 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel 3 activated charcoal capsules 1/4 teaspoon of bentonite clay (optional) a small glass bowl some hot water a medium glass bowl a spoon"

      "content": "Put vitamin E oil, coconut oil, and beeswax into the small bowl. Measure out one teaspoon of vitamin E oil, one teaspoon of coconut oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of beeswax and put them into your small glass bowl. Stir them together with your spoon. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Melt the ingredients.",
      "content": "Melt the ingredients. Fill the medium sized bowl about ¼ of the way full with hot or boiling water. Then take your small bowl and place it over the water so that it is nesting inside of the medium sized bowl. The small bowl should just float on top of the water. If the water level is too high, then pour some out. [3] X Research source Let the small bowl sit on top of the water until the ingredients in the small bowl have melted. Then, carefully remove the small bowl from the water. Be careful because the glass may get hot from the hot water."

    {
      "title": "Add the aloe vera gel to the small bowl.",
      "content": "Add the aloe vera gel to the small bowl. Next, measure out three teaspoons of aloe vera gel and add the aloe vera to the bowl along with the ingredients. Then, use the spoon to mix the aloe vera in with the other ingredients until they are well combined. [4] X Research source To make a preservative-free mascara, use aloe vera gel straight from the plant, as bottled aloe often contains preservatives. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Break open the activated charcoal capsules over the bowl.",
      "content": "Break open the activated charcoal capsules over the bowl. Take your three activated charcoal capsules and break them open over the bowl one at a time. Then, mix the charcoal in with the other ingredients. Keep stirring until the mixture looks uniform. This may take a few minutes of vigorous stirring. [6] X Research source Be aware that activated charcoal is not an approved colorant for eye cosmetics. [7] X Research source If you are concerned about using activated charcoal, then you can replace the charcoal with equal quantities of an eye-safe black (or other color) mineral powder or mica.

      "title": "Add 1/4 teaspoon of bentonite clay if desired.",
      "content": "Add 1/4 teaspoon of bentonite clay if desired. Bentonite clay is optional for this recipe, but it may help to prevent smudging. Coconut oil melts at 76 degrees Fahrenheit, so it is not ideal for warm weather. However, bentonite clay can help your mascara to dry faster and stay on your lashes. [9] X Research source If you decide to add the bentonite clay, then add 1/4 of a teaspoon to the mascara mixture and stir until the ingredients are well combined."

      "content": "Get your supplies. Making mascara out of clay is quick and only requires a few ingredients and tools. To make your own homemade mascara from clay, you will need: 5 teaspoons (25 g) clay (of your color choice) 1 ¾ teaspoon (10.5 ml) water 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 ml) vegetable glycerin 1 pinch guar gum a small bowl a spoon"

    {
      "title": "Stir together the clay and guar gum.",
      "content": "Stir together the clay and guar gum. Take a pinch of guar gum and put it into the bowl. The guar gum will act as a thickener and stabilizer for the mascara. Then, measure out five teaspoons of the clay of your choice. You can also mix the colors to create your own unique shade. The clay will provide the color, and will help the mascara to dry easily. Choose a clay that has the color you are looking for n a mascara. Popular clay choices include: [10] X Research source Bentonite clay mixed with cocoa powder for color (for more of a brown mascara) Australian red reef clay (for a reddish brown mascara) Australian black clay (for a black mascara)"

      "content": "Add the water and glycerin. When you have mixed the two powders together, add in the liquid ingredients. Measure out 1 ¾ teaspoons of water and 1/4 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. Stir the ingredients until they are well combined. If you're having trouble stirring the ingredients together, add more water in small increments, such as a drop or two at a time, until you get a thick, smooth liquid. It's important that you don't add too much water, or the mascara will be runny and you won't be able to apply it. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a new batch regularly.",
      "content": "Make a new batch regularly. Since this mascara doesn't really have any preservatives, it's important that you replace it every four to six months. This will prevent bacteria from growing and spreading onto your lashes. Always wash and disinfect your mascara tube and wand before reuse. Don't use your mascara if it starts to smell. Get rid of it and make a new batch right away."

      "title": "Clean and disinfect your mascara tube and brush.",
      "content": "Clean and disinfect your mascara tube and brush. Before you transfer your mascara to the tube, make sure that the tube and brush are clean. If the tube and brush are new, then you don't have to do anything. However, if you are reusing an old mascara tube and brush, you will need to wash the brush and tube thoroughly with warm water and some castile soap or baby shampoo. [12] X Research source Remove the plug from the top of the tube and place it in a small bowl of warm, soapy water. Apply soap to the bristles and use your fingers to work the soap into the brush bristles. Then, put some soap into the tube as well. Use the brush to move the soap around in the tube. Continue to add soap and rinse the tube and brush until the water runs clear and all of the suds have been rinsed away. Then, take the plug out of the bowl of water and rinse it as well."

      "title": "Use a syringe.",
      "content": "Use a syringe. One option for transferring mascara to a tube is to use an oral syringe. Oral syringes can be found in most pharmacies and drug stores, and they make excellent injectors for filling mascara tubes. When your mascara is ready, simply insert the nose of the syringe into the mixture, pull up the plunger to suck up the mascara, and then inject the mascara into the tube. Repeat until your tube is full, or until all the mascara is gone. Wash the syringe with soap and water immediately after you finish using it to prevent the mascara from caking on."

[13] X Research source Scoop your mascara mixture into a plastic bag, such as a resealable sandwich bag or a clean plastic bulk bag. Work the mixture to one of the bottom corners of the bag. Then, cut a small hole in the corner of the bag. Insert the corner into the top of the mascara tube and gently squeeze the bag to push the mascara into the tube."

      "content": "Pour in small dollops. Use tape to secure your mascara tube to a flat surface. With the end of a knife, scoop up a small amount of mascara. Dangle the knife vertically over the mascara tube hole and allow the dollop of mascara to drop into it. If necessary, use a toothpick to make an air bubble in the dollop of mascara so that it drains into the tube. Repeat until you have filled the tube."

      "title": "Reinsert the plug.",
      "content": "Reinsert the plug. When you have filled your mascara tube, replace the makeup plug before returning the wand to the tube. The plug disperses the makeup evenly and removes excess mascara from the wand as you pull it out of the tube."

      "content": "Store the mascara in a jar as an alternative. Instead of trying to fill a mascara tube, consider storing the mixture in a sealable, airtight container that you can still dip the mascara wand into. [14] X Research source To prevent mascara from drying onto the wand between uses, wash the wand with soap and water after every use."
