      "content": "Add face oil to your foundation for a glowy look. Place 1 or 2 drops of a lightweight face oil into your palm. Then, add a dime-sized amount of your normal foundation, and blend them together in your hand. Use the fingers of your opposite hand to pat the foundation onto your face.

[3] X Research source If your skin tends to get a little oily throughout the day, go over your face with a light dusting of translucent face powder. However, don't use too much, or your makeup will look heavy. You can use a makeup sponge or foundation brush instead of your fingers, if you like. However, using your fingers may give your skin a dewier appearance."

      "content": "Apply highlighter to your cheekbones and the high points of your face. There's no easier way to fake a sunkissed glow than with highlighter. Gently tap a little highlighter across the tops of your cheekbones. If you'd like, you can also add some anywhere the light would naturally hit your face, like the center of your forehead, the bridge of your nose, the V on top of your lips, and the center of your chin. [4] X Research source Cream highlighter may give you the most natural appearance, but you can also use a shimmery powder highlighter if you prefer. If you're using a cream highlighter, tap it onto your skin with your fingertips. If you're using powder, use a fan brush to lightly pat the highlighter onto your skin wherever you want a glow."

      "content": "Use cream blush or stain to give your skin a natural flush. Cream blush is a great way to add a little color to your cheeks while still looking perfectly natural and glowing. Just graze your finger across the top of the pot, then tap the color where you want it until it's blended in. [5] X Research source If you use powder with your foundation, apply cream blush or stain before your powder. Cream products don't layer well over powders. If you already applied the powder, use a powder blush that mimics the color of your cheeks when you get flushed. Try using your cheek color on your lips and even your eyelids to brighten up your whole face."

      "content": "Massage your face to brighten your skin quickly. Place one of your thumbs right between your eyebrows, then roll it in a gentle circular motion for about 10 seconds. Then, use your ring fingers to trace 2 or 3 circles from the inside corners of your eyes, up over your eyebrows, and back under your eyes. [6] X Research source This can boost circulation in your face, and it can also help reduce excess fluid that can make your face look puffy and tired."

      "content": "Try a brightening mask if you have an extra few minutes. Drape a hydrating or brightening sheet mask over your skin, or smooth on your favorite moisturizing mask, then sit back and relax. [7] X Research source This will allow the mask to penetrate into your skin, leaving you with a refreshing glow that will last all day. However, avoid letting the mask dry out completely—otherwise, it could actually strip moisture from your skin when you remove it. [8] X Research source Look for a mask that includes ingredients like vitamin C, niacinamide, and arbutin. [9] X Research source Some hydrating masks are meant to be worn overnight. In that case, you don't have to worry about whether it dries out. You can even make your own hydrating mask by mixing up nourishing ingredients like avocado, coconut oil, honey, yogurt, and aloe vera gel. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash your face with a gentle cleanser. If you want to look radiant, it's essential to start with fresh, clean skin. First, wet your face, then dispense a dime-sized amount of face wash onto your fingers. Use your fingertips to gently massage the cleanser over your entire face, except for your eye area. Then, use clean water to rinse the cleanser away from your skin.

For instance, if you have dry skin, you might opt for a gentle moisturizing cleanser. If you're prone to breakouts, you might use a cleanser with acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. If you want the skin on your body to glow, be sure to wash all over with a gentle soap or body wash when you take a shower."

      "content": "Exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin cells. Exfoliants help get rid of old skin cells that might be leaving your skin looking dull and rough. You can use either a physical exfoliant, like a scrub or a brush, or a chemical exfoliant that will gently dissolve away the dead skin. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Although chemical exfoliants might sound intense, many of them are much gentler than using physical exfoliants. If you have sensitive skin or you use a stronger exfoliating method, you'll need to exfoliate less often—maybe only once a week or so. If you use a gentler method, you can exfoliate up to 2-3 times a week, but cut back if you notice your skin seems red, irritated, or especially sensitive, or if you notice dark spots forming on your face. Be sure to only use one exfoliating method at a time. For instance, if you're using a scrub on your body in the shower, you wouldn't also use a brush, as that would likely be too intense."

      "content": "Blot your skin dry with a soft towel. Now that you've gently cleansed and exfoliated your skin, it's time to dry off. Take a little extra time to carefully pat your skin dry, rather than just rubbing it roughly, as that will help protect it from becoming irritated and dry. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Use a soft, fluffy towel when you're drying off, as well. It's okay if your skin is still a little damp after you dry off. If you moisturize while your skin is still a little damp, you'll help trap in moisture that will leave your skin looking hydrated and healthy."

The skin on your face is thinner than the skin on your body, so body lotion will be too thick for your face, and it could clog your pores.

      "content": "Replace your regular moisturizer with a brightening product. Moisturizing will go a long way toward giving you beautiful, glowing skin—but some skincare ingredients are more effective than others at giving you a radiant look. To get an extra glow, moisturize after you wash, just like normal. However, instead of a plain moisturizer, use a product that's labeled with something like \"brightening\" or \"radiance.\" These products are generally designed to give your skin a fresh, dewy look. [23] X Research source Some brightening products might have a little bit of a shimmer to give your skin an extra glow. If a brightening product uses chemical exfoliants like vitamin C, AHAs (including glycolic and lactic acids), and BHAS (like salicylic acid), avoid using other exfoliating products at the same time. This could cause your skin to become sensitive or irritated. Unless it's directed by a doctor, avoid products that contain hydroquinone—this skin lightener can sometimes have serious side effects and is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer."
