      "content": "Do bridges for a rounder and firmer butt. Bridges are specifically designed to strengthen and build your glutes , contributing to a bigger bum. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, and extend your arms beside your body for stability. Press through your heels to lift your hips off the ground until your body forms a straight, bridge-like pose. Squeeze your abs and glutes, then hold this position for 30 seconds (or as long as possible) before lowering back down. [1] X Research source To do a bridge properly, keep your weight evenly distributed between your feet, shoulders, and upper arm area, and lift your chest to help stretch out your back. Incorporate bridges into your workout routine at least 3 times a week, and aim for 5 sets of 10-24 reps to build your butt. If you’re a beginner, start with 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps. [2] X Research source If you want to increase the intensity of your workout, place a weighted bar across your hip for 3 sets of 8-12 reps."

Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, with your toes facing forward. Push your hips back and bend your knees, making sure your knees don’t go over your toes. Once you reach parallel (with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle), press into your heels and straighten your legs to return to a standing position.

Stand with your feet hip-width apart with your hands on your hips. Take a big step forward with your right foot to enter a staggered stance, and lower your body until your right knee is at a 90-degree angle. To maintain proper form, do not move your right knee past your toes, and keep your left leg parallel to the ground.

To build your butt, aim for 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps on each leg. [6] X Research source To increase the difficulty of this exercise and tone your butt, do explosive lunges instead: stand with your feet together with your hands on your hips, and lunge forward with your right leg. As you come up from the lunge, jump, switching your legs in midair and landing a forward lunch with your left leg in front. [7] X Research source"

When your waist gets smaller, your butt looks bigger because of the size difference between your waist and hips, so work your core for a juicier booty: [8] X Research source Planking is an effective exercise to strengthen your core and hit your glutes at the same time. Lie on your stomach with your forearms underneath you, and engage your abs to rise onto your toes. Keep your elbows directly beneath your shoulders, and keep your body in a straight line.

      "content": "Prioritize strength training to build your glutes. While you don’t have to lift weights to get a bigger butt, it can accelerate muscle development for faster results. Cardio that lasts over 75 minutes can reduce muscle, so focus on building your lower body strength for a juicier backside. [15] X Research source If you’re a beginner, add weights to any of the exercises above by holding dumbbells, then gradually increase the weight by 0.5 pounds (0.23 kg) as you get stronger. When it comes to choosing the right dumbbell weight , start with a weight you can lift comfortably 12-15 times. Remember, proper form will give you better results and decrease the likelihood of injury. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You’ll likely see a noticeable difference about 3 weeks after you start lifting, while other people will notice your results about 6 weeks into working out. If you want to do some cardio, perform circuits with intervals of body weight exercises. Or, have fun playing glute-building sports like football, volleyball, cycling, tennis, rock climbing, soccer, rollerblading, and cross-country skiing. [17] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 157 wikiHow readers if they found cardio effective for losing weight, and 73% of them said yes.

Belting the narrowest part of your waist can create the illusion of a bigger butt because it accentuates the difference between your waist, hips, and butt. To create this effect, place your belt over any shirt or dress, then tighten it along your natural waistline. This draws attention to the smallest part of your waist, giving you a curvy, hourglass figure. [19] X Research source If you’re slim, try a thin or medium-sized belt to compliment your frame. If you’re curvier, play around with a thicker belt to give you an extra snatched waistline."

The right pair of jeans can make your butt look even perkier and rounder, so try on a few pairs to see which one looks the best on you. Pick fitted jeans with pockets that angle slightly inward, and make sure the pockets are located on the fullest part of your butt. Wide-set pockets draw the eye outward, giving you the illusion of a juicier booty. [20] X Research source If you want to add more volume to your backside, look for jeans with pocket flaps or embellishments. Opt for high-waisted jeans to highlight your waist, and pair them with a cropped, fitted, or tucked-in top. Avoid low-waisted jeans, which make your waist look larger and your butt look smaller.

Clothing that has a horizontal divide makes you look more curvaceous, especially if the color change is located directly underneath your butt. This pattern draws the eye down from the waist to the butt, giving you instant volume. It also helps balance your figure if you have a large chest with narrower hips and a small butt.

      "content": "Wear high heels to enhance your figure. Heels naturally change the curve of your spine, making your legs look longer and your butt slightly larger. They also flex your calves to give you the illusion of toned legs, which may trick people into believing you have a strong butt. Choose heels that feel comfortable and allow you to walk normally (but still give you an extra pep in your step). [22] X Research source If you’re not used to walking in heels, start with a small heel of about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), then work your way up. Wider, closed-toe heels provide more balance and ankle support, and they still look incredibly stylish."

Body shapers are a great way to fake it until you make it, and they can help emphasize (or de-emphasize) different parts of your body. To look like you have a sexier butt, choose shapewear designed to compress your thighs and stomach while still lifting and separating your butt cheeks. Alternatively, wear a waist trainer to cinch in your waist and make your butt look larger. Before buying one, measure your bare waist with a flexible tape measure, directly between your ribs and hips. [23] X Research source Try on shapewear before purchasing it to ensure you pick the right size. Wearing shapewear that is too tight can lead to health problems, such as compressing organs or nerves."
