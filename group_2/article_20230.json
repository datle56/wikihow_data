      "content": "Put a warm compress on the boil for 10-15 minutes 3-4 times daily. Soak a clean washcloth in warm water, then wring it out so it remains damp. Place the washcloth over your boil for 10-15 minutes at a time. Repeat the treatment 3-4 times a day until your boil heals. The heat will increase your blood circulation and help bring the pus to the surface. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t reuse the washcloth after you use it as a warm compress. Put the washcloth in your dirty laundry and get a new one each time. This will help control the infection. A warm compress is the best way to bring your boil to a head. If you want to try multiple treatments, use the warm compress first. Avoid pressing, squeezing, or pricking your boil. If your boil pops or is pricked before it’s ready, the released pus and fluid may spread infection to other parts of your skin. A boil will break and drain on its own over time and, if it doesn’t, you should visit a doctor for further treatment."

      "content": "Wrap an onion slice in gauze and put it over the boil for 1 hour every day. Some studies show that onions have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may help to soothe or heal a boil. [2] X Research source Putting an onion on top of your boil might help draw out the pus—although there’s no definitive evidence to support this method. If you’d like to try it, however, cut a small slice off of a raw onion and wrap thin gauze around the onion slice. Place the onion directly over your boil and leave it there for up to 1 hour. Do this once a day until your boil heals. Any type of onion will work. For instance, you could use a yellow onion, white onion, or red onion."

      "content": "Press fresh garlic and apply it to your boil once a day for 10-30 minutes. Garlic is largely believed to have antimicrobial properties, and some studies suggest that it can help with skin conditions involving wound healing and fungal infections. [3] X Research source As a result, garlic may also help draw the boil to a head, but keep in mind that this remedy is not based in medical fact. Run the garlic through a press or put it in a food processor. Then, apply the juice or garlic paste over your boil. Let it sit for 10-30 minutes, then wash it off with warm water. Pat the area dry before reapplying your bandage. You can use this treatment once a day until your boil drains."

      "content": "Apply a turmeric and ginger paste to the boil for 5-10 minutes daily. Turmeric contains curcumin, which has been shown to have powerful antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties may help a boil to surface and heal faster. [4] X Research source Ginger, likewise, has been found in some studies to have a general antimicrobial effect, although there’s no direct evidence to show that ginger (or turmeric) will cure a boil.

Combine 1 part turmeric and 1 part ginger. Then, add just enough water to make a paste. Dab the paste onto your boil, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Finally, rinse away the paste with warm water and pat your boil dry Use this treatment once a day until your boil drains."

Some essential oils have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may help skin conditions such as boils. However, no essential oil has been directly proven to cure boils, so it’s best to follow the advice of a healthcare professional before applying oils. If you’ve been given the go ahead to use essential oils on a boil, use an eyedropper to apply 1-3 drops of essential oil onto your closed boil before replacing your bandages 2 to 3 times per day. As another option, dab the essential oil onto the un-popped boil using a cotton swab. Here are some of the essential oils that’ve been shown in certain studies to have antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory properties: [6] X Research source Tea tree oil Roman chamomile Caraway Bergamot Lemon Eucalyptus"

      "content": "Avoid squeezing or pricking your boil, which can cause the infection to spread. While it might seem like a quick way to bring your boil to a head, squeezing it actually pushes the pus deeper. This will make it take longer for your boil to heal, and it may cause an infection deep under your skin. Similarly, popping or picking at the boil may spread the infection. Don’t squeeze your boil for any reason. [8] X Research source When your boil comes to a head, it’s still not safe to squeeze it. The pus can still go back down. Also, you’re more likely to have a scar if you squeeze it."

Since the pus could spread the infection, it’s important that it soaks into gauze or a bandage. To change your bandage, remove the old bandage, then clean the boil. If you want, add a topical treatment, such as essential oil. Finally, apply a new bandage. [14] X Research source Look for gauze or bandages that are labeled as non-stick. These won’t stick to your skin, which means they’ll come off without damaging your skin.
