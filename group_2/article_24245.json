The main disconnect switch is usually at the very top or very bottom of most electrical service panels, but not always. The main disconnect switch should be the largest value circuit breaker in the panel. This switch will probably be a double (or in some cases a quadruple) wide switch and be rated at 100, 200 or more amps. Leave the remaining circuit breakers in the ON position. All lights and power at outlets should now be off."

Otherwise, inspect the panel and assess your ability to move breakers up and / or down to create a space large enough for the breaker to fit. Some older services have two \"single- wide\" circuit breakers installed adjacent to each other that provide power to a single \"three wire\" cable (a three wire cable has a bare or green wire and three insulated wires: white, black and red). The red wire is the indicator of a three wire cable. If there is a red wire connected to a single circuit breaker, trace it back to the cable from which it originates. Once located, trace the black wire from that same cable to the point it connects to a circuit breaker. Most likely, this is the breaker directly above or below the breaker that has the red wire. Be sure to move these two single breakers as a pair. Do not create a space between these two circuit breakers to install the new circuit breaker. Do not move just one breaker to the opposite side of the panel, they must be considered as a \"matched pair\" only."

      "content": "Unroll the cable on the floor to reduce kinking during installation. The cable size and type, like the circuit breaker value, is determined by the appliance's or device's electrical requirements. A quick rule of thumb (there are variables in the Code that adjust these values up and down) is a #14 wire will supply a 12 amp load. A #12 is good for 16 amps, a #10 for 24 amps, #8 for 32 amps and #6 for 40 amps when copper cables are used. Aluminum cables can be used instead but often have additional requirements and slightly lower capacities. If installing a circuit to supply a typical 220 Volt / 30 Amp electric dryer, a cable with #10 copper conductors is required; a 220 Volt / 40 Amp electric stove would require use a cable with #6 aluminum conductors (a cable with copper conductors of this size tends to be very expensive). Local electrical code, conditions, etc. supersedes wire sizes mentioned above."

The bottom installation allows the cable to be easily passed into the outlet and wired without having to bend the conductors 90 degrees. Either way will work, one is just a little harder to work than the other. Lay the cable into the outlet by first lining up the jacket so that it will just be visible into the outlet body. Arrange the conductors to lay into the terminals. The black and red conductors will land in the gold terminals (it does not matter which of these two conductors land in the left or right gold terminals), the white conductor will land into the silver terminal and the uninsulated conductor will land in the green terminal.

[4] X Research source Use extreme care to not nick any of the conductors. A nicked conductor must be cut back and redone. Since the working area in the outlet is so small, all the conductors will have to be re-cut to length and stripped over again."

If the electric service panel is a sub-panel, there should be separate bars for neutral and ground terminations. It is easy to determine, but very important to connect correctly. ONE BAR If there is one bar in the electric service panel, and both the bare AND white insulated wires are connected to it, bring each of the bare and white insulated range conductors into separate unused terminals. TWO BARS If there are two bars AND one bar has all bare and/or green wires connected AND the other bar has all white wires connected, be sure to do the same - bring the range white insulated conductor to the bar with existing white conductors and the range bare to the bar with existing bare / green conductors. BAR AND LUGS The last configuration (and least likely to be found) is one bar with only white insulated conductors and one or more \"lugs\" secured to the panel back or side that have all the bare and green conductors connected. If this is the case, the range white insulated conductor will connect to the bar into an unused terminal as above, and a new lug for the range bare will be needed. This lug will have to be secured with a machine screw into a tapped hole. Sheet metal screws are not permitted to secure lugs. Notice in the pictures below that there is only one wire per terminal screw. Never terminate multiple conductors under a single terminal."
