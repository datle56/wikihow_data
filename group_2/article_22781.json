      "content": "Grasp the mug by the rim when you're walking. There’s nothing worse than spilling your hot coffee down your shirt as you head from the break room to your desk. To transport your drink, make your hand into a claw-like shape over the top of the mug and grip the rim with your fingers. Experts say this is the most stable way to get your coffee where you want it.

      "content": "Hold a cold beverage by the mug handle. If you're drinking a chilled beverage that's served in a mug—like a Moscow mule—don't wrap your palms around the mug. The heat from your hand will warm up your drink and melt the ice. However, holding the mug by the handle will help keep your chilly treat nice and cold. Try using the etiquette-friendly approach here—loop your index finger through the handle and tuck your other 3 fingers into your palm."

[5] X Research source Even if you aren't wearing lipstick, it's considered good manners to drink from the same place on your mug with every sip.

      "content": "Point the decal or design on the mug away from you. Rule of thumb is that other people should be able to enjoy your mug. If your mug has a witty saying or a beautiful picture, let others take in the view. When you’re around other people, always hold your mug so that the decorated part is facing away from you. [8] X Research source Most mugs are made for right-handed people, so this is a little tricky for lefties. If you’re left-handed, you can either hold the mug in your right hand (which might feel awkward) or buy a few mugs that you can design yourself. There are tons of options for this in online shops!"

      "content": "Stir your coffee in a straight line. Whether you are holding your mug while you stir or it is resting on the table, etiquette dictates that you should draw a straight line down the center of your coffee cup to mix in your milk or sugar. Imagine your mug is a clock face. Start at 12 and draw the spoon down to 6. [9] X Research source This will help reduce any splashing as you stir, and it may also help your sugar dissolve faster. Be sure not to let your spoon clink loudly against your mug if you're in polite company—it's considered rude."

      "content": "Serve coffee by placing it on a saucer. Don't hand a mug directly to your guest—the position of the handle on the mug makes it a little awkward. Instead, serve a beverage in a mug by placing a saucer on the table and then placing the mug on the saucer. [10] X Research source If you are serving a mug in a coffee shop, place the mug on the counter for your customer to take rather than handing it directly to them."
