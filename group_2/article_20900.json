      "content": "Dim the lights and play mellow music to help your partner relax. You could be giving your partner the best massage in the world, but if the lights are on full-blast and the music is blaring, it might not be as relaxing as it could be. Light a few candles , burn some incense , and play sensual, quiet music as you invite your partner to lay down. [1] X Research source Giving a massage in the bedroom is typically the easiest, since you already have a soft, comfy spot for your partner to lie down. If you’re worried about getting oil on your sheets, put a few towels down before you start. You could also set up a diffuser with a soothing essential oil, like lavender or bergamot.

      "content": "Make the massage more intimate by giving the massage in the nude. You’re not giving a professional massage here, so there’s no need to uphold any sort of professionalism. Ask your partner to strip down, then do the same yourself—it will make your partner feel more comfortable and make the massage that much more exciting. [3] X Research source If you don’t want to strip down all the way, try wearing a robe with something special underneath. A new set of lingerie or underwear is the perfect way to get your partner excited."

      "content": "Lotion or oil helps your hands glide smoothly over your partner’s body. While it's possible to give a halfway decent massage without any oil, your partner will be missing out big time. Use an oil made specifically for a massage, or try out a lotion that you both like, and warm it up in your hands before you start. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Since massage oils soak into the skin, always purchase high-quality oils. Jojoba and almond oil are some good options. [5] X Research source [v161216_b01]. 10 December 2019. While it may sound weird, cooking oils like olive, coconut , or cocoa butter can make excellent massage oils. [6] X Expert Source Marty Morales Professional Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Many masseurs prefer using a basic cooking oil on the skin. You can also make your own massage oil by submerging lavender, calendula, rosemary, or other fragrant herbs or essential oils in a natural oil yourself."

      "content": "The shoulders and neck hold a ton of tension, so begin the massage there. Go slowly and gently with your thumbs down the side of the spine on the back of the neck. Work down the back of the neck in little circles, paying close attention to your partner's response. [7] X Research source The spot where your neck meets your shoulder is another great area to hit, paying particular attention to the point at which the shoulder blade starts. Always work along the bone, not running across it. The base of the skull is another nice place to massage since there's a lot of tension there. Don't overdo it with the pressure, but carefully work that area with your fingers and your thumb. [8] X Research source [v161216_b01]. 10 December 2019."

      "content": "The palms of your hands ease tension and muscle aches easily. Massage techniques can vary widely, but there's no big secret to making your partner feel good. Use a firm but gentle touch, rubbing long strokes along your partner's muscles. Use the base of your palm to do the bulk of the pushing, and use other parts of your hand to get at the sensitive spots. [9] X Research source It's important to massage along muscles, not push on bones. It doesn't really feel good to push hard onto the point of someone's elbow, but it does feel good to massage the inside of the forearm. You can use your thumbs to massage too, but only sparingly. Save your thumbs on any large, very tense muscles, like the legs, glutes, or shoulders."

This can be the difference between a good massage and a great one. Work your thumbs up and along both tendons in the back of the thigh, as well, to work the parts that can get sore.

Work each toe individually, using the oil liberally, and use both thumbs in small circles along the ball of the foot. It's good to use firm pressure on the foot, or it can feel somewhat tickly. [11] X Research source If you always give your massages from head to toe, vary it up sometimes. Start with the feet and work your way up."

But diving straight to these areas can make for a somewhat crude or hurried massage. Take your time and, as long as your partner is comfortable (communicate!), explore the neglected areas of the body for the most sensual and careful massage you can give.

Once you've worked your way down your partner's body and added a lot of oil, do some long, full-body strokes with the palms of your hands. Go extremely slowly and revisit all the spots you've just massaged. This can be a very nice way to end the massage. It can also feel good to use your forearm, or your knuckles, to vary the sensation from the last time those areas were massaged. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Go slowly and work your way over your partner’s entire body. A massage isn't a quick prologue to sex. Let the massage linger on for a while, spending your time treating your partner to these sensual touches for their own sake, because they feel good, not because they might lead to more. The slower the massage, the more you can really feel what you're doing. [16] X Research source [v161216_b01]. 10 December 2019. It's also good to avoid distractions during a sensual massage. A massage is a lot less sensual if you're watching Sportscenter at the same time. Switch off the TV and devote your attention to your partner's body. If your partner wants to massage you as well, that’s great! But don’t expect (or demand) a massage in return. Focus on making your partner happy. Keep in mind that although your massage may be sensual, it doesn’t necessarily have to lead to sex. If you or your partner aren’t feeling like getting intimate, you can just enjoy a nice massage session instead."
