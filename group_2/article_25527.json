      "content": "Tissue, fluid, or clumps of blood from vagina Call your physician or go to the emergency room if tissue, fluid, or what appears to be clumps of blood come out of your vagina. This could mean that you are miscarrying. Depending on how far along you are, and how heavy you are bleeding, your doctor may recommend you go to the emergency room, or that you wait to be seen during office hours. If you do pass tissue that you think might be fetal tissue, put it in a clean, sealed container and take it with you to the doctor. Taking the tissue with you may seem strange, but the doctor will be able to test it to confirm whether it was fetal tissue."

However, it is safest to call your doctor immediately to see if you need to visit the ER. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source You may also experience cramping. Sometimes it may feel like a strong tugging-like sensation inside, as if something is being pulled. If you have strong cramping, it is another sign that you should see a doctor quickly. Vaginal bleeding can also be a sign of ectopic pregnancy—but only when combined with other symptoms like severe abdominal pain, shoulder pain, and lightheadedness. If you’re experiencing these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. Reader Poll: We asked 275 wikiHow readers and 59% of them agreed that they would immediately seek emergency medical care if they suspected an ectopic pregnancy. [Take Poll]"

[6] X Research source The doctor will likely do an ultrasound to see if the fetus is visible in your womb. If so, the ultrasound will also let the doctor see if it is developing properly. If the fetus is old enough, it may be possible to check the heartbeat. Your doctor may do a pelvic exam to see if your cervix is opening. Blood tests will allow the doctor to measure your hormones. If you have passed tissue and brought it with you, your doctor can test it to confirm whether it is fetal tissue."

There several possibilities: [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source [8] X Research source A threatened miscarriage is when you are showing signs that you may be about to miscarry. Not all threatened miscarriages actually miscarry. If you have cramps, or you are bleeding, but your cervix is not opening, then you may be diagnosed with a threatened miscarriage. If there is nothing the doctor can do to prevent a miscarriage, you will be diagnosed with an inevitable miscarriage. This diagnosis is likely if your cervix has opened, and your uterus is contracting to expel the fetus. A complete miscarriage occurs when all of the fetal and pregnancy tissues are expelled. An incomplete miscarriage is when you miscarry but some of the fetus or placenta is not passed out through your vagina. Missed miscarriage occurs when you do not pass the fetus or placenta even though the fetus has died."

You can wait to see if your body passes the remaining tissue on its own. This could take up to a month. You can take medication to induce your body to expel the tissue. This usually works quickly, sometimes within a day. The medication can be taken by mouth or by putting it directly into your vagina.

It is extremely important you give yourself time to grieve and surround yourself with supportive people to talk to. Get support from friends and family members that you trust. Seek out a support group. Most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies afterwards. A miscarriage probably does not mean that you won’t be able to have a baby."
