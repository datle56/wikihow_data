      "content": "Take a deep breath. It’s impossible to laugh while you’re inhaling. If you’re afraid you can’t keep a straight face, take a deep breath in, and let it out slowly. Repeat this as many times as you need to until you feel like you don’t need to laugh anymore. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't take a huge deep breath with your mouth open - it might be obvious what you're trying to do. Instead, take a deep breath through your nose since that should make your breath quieter. To get a good, deep breath, you should inhale for 2 to 3 seconds and exhale for 3 to 4."

      "title": "Purse your lips.",
      "content": "Purse your lips. Pursing your lips together can help prevent a smile from spreading across your face. Clench your jaw and press your lips together. With your jaw clenched and your lips together, you won't be able to laugh out loud. [2] X Research source If you're worried pursing your lips will be obvious, clench your jaw tighter. Doing both will keep you from losing your straight face, but clenching your jaw will make it less obvious what you're doing."

      "title": "Bite the inside of your cheek.",
      "content": "Bite the inside of your cheek. If you feel liking pursing your lips isn't working, try biting the inside of your cheek. It's easier to keep your face straight when your cheek is sucked in. And if all else fails, the pain should help you keep your feelings to yourself. If you're worried about looking obvious when you're biting the inside of your cheek, use your hand to pretend to wipe across your mouth. As you're doing that, bite the inside of your cheek."

    {
      "title": "Cover your mouth.",
      "content": "Cover your mouth. If you’re really afraid you can’t stop yourself from smiling, cover your mouth with your hand. Try not to be super obvious when you do it, though. Cover the corner of your mouth with your fingers or pinch your lips together."

    {
      "title": "Pretend to cough or sneeze.",
      "content": "Pretend to cough or sneeze. If you really can't keep a straight face, pretend to cough or sneeze. That gives you a chance to hide your face when you cover your mouth and contort your face if you can't keep it straight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look elsewhere.",
      "content": "Look elsewhere. If you see something funny and you’re afraid you won’t be able to keep it together, look away. Focus on something just above or to the side of whatever is funny to you. This way, it looks like you’re still paying attention and you don’t come across as rude. [3] X Research source If you're in a situation where looking away might seem rude - in class or a meeting, for example - you can take a look at your notes. That still seems appropriate and helps you cover."

    {
      "title": "Look at your feet.",
      "content": "Look at your feet. If you really can’t look away – maybe you’re having a conversation with someone or playing a game – try looking at your feet. It’s a pretty normal thing for people to do, and it might buy you just enough time to get your facial expressions back under control."

      "title": "Think about something else.",
      "content": "Think about something else. If you’re worried, you’ll laugh, think about something sad. This will almost always relax your face. It keeps you from laughing if you’re worried about that, and it will also make your face hard to read. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, think about a sad commercial you saw recently. If you're worried about your reaction to thinking about something sad, try thinking about something else - you can count backward from a very high number, or try to remember something complex, like a math formula."

    {
      "title": "Ask questions",
      "content": "Ask questions . If you’re trying to keep a straight face while you’re talking to someone, invest yourself more in the conversation. One way to do this is to ask the person questions. It’s also a good way to steer the conversation away from something you find funny. [5] X Research source For example, if the person you're speaking to has been telling you about their job, but then they veer off into a topic you find funny, try to ask them questions that get them back onto talk about their job. You can say things like \"Tell me more about what sort of schooling you needed for your job,\" or \"How did you get started in that field.\""

      "title": "Practice what you'll say.",
      "content": "Practice what you'll say. If you have a hard time keeping a straight face when you're telling a joke or playing a game, practice ahead of time. Practice the joke over and over so you can keep your face straight when you tell it. You can also practice things to talk about during a game to distract yourself and keep a good poker face . If you're trying to distract yourself during a game, talk about something completely unrelated to it. For example, if you're playing poker, don't talk about other poker games you've played. Instead, you can talk about what's going on at work or something that happened while you were at the store."

[6] X Expert Source Sabrina Grover, LMSW Licensed Master Social Worker Expert Interview. 3 December 2021. Thinking about your own past gets your mind off the present and helps you control your face. For example, if someone is telling you an embarrassing story that you can tell hurts them a bit, share your own embarrassing story. It not only stops you from laughing, but it can also help the other person feel better about their own experience. Validate what they are saying.
