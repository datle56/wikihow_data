      "content": "This depends on your lifestyle and the products you use. Your scalp produces an oil called sebum. Since your hair's short, that sebum can make your hair look oily pretty quickly. Shampooing your hair every day, though, might end up stripping the oil from your scalp. This can dry it out. You might try shampooing your hair every other day to retain moisture and prevent this from happening.

If you have coarse or dry hair, go for a hydrating, moisturizing shampoo. If you've got fine hair, look for a gentle shampoo that won't leave a lot of product to weigh down your hair. If you get your hair colored, choose a shampoo and conditioner specifically for color-treated hair since it prevents product buildup without making your color turn dull. If you have natural or curly hair, your hair is probably pretty dry so choose a moisturizing or hydrating shampoo."
