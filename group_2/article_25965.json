Strength workouts put a lot of stress on your muscles, joints, and heart, so always get approval from your doctor before starting a workout regimen.

      "content": "Schedule a strength-training workout at least twice a week. If you work out less than this, you won’t build much muscle mass. Plan out which muscle groups you’ll work on each day. Alternate between training different muscle groups on different days. Stick with your schedule to see the best results. [2] X Research source Schedule in at least 24 hours of rest for each muscle group. For example, if you work your back and biceps one day, work your chest and triceps the next day. Staying consistent with your workout schedule also helps prevent injuries. If you remain sedentary and workout infrequently, your muscles will be shocked when you start exercising. This can cause pulls and tears. Reader Poll: We asked 590 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy the most during arm workouts, and 72% said weightlifting. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Plan at least 1 workout for each major muscle group.",
      "content": "Plan at least 1 workout for each major muscle group. All the muscle groups in your body work together, so only training one leaves your body unbalanced. Imbalances can cause injuries because the weaker muscle groups have to work harder to compensate. Avoid imbalances by training all your major muscle groups. Schedule at least 1 workout for each muscle group per week. Then target other muscles after setting this baseline. [3] X Research source Pay special attention to your back and core. These muscles support your whole body. Even if you only want bigger arms, you need the core to support the weight you’re lifting. You can still focus on building mass in individual muscle groups, as long as you don’t neglect the other muscle groups. If you want bigger biceps, for example, do 3 bicep workouts per week but also include 1 workout for your back, core, triceps, and legs during the schedule too."

      "content": "Keep track of your progress. Write down the date of your workout, each exercise you did, and how much weight you used. Also note if a certain weight was hard or too easy and adjust accordingly. Refer back to this log to plan your future workouts. Some people like to carry a notebook at the gym and record their exercises as they do them. There are also apps and programs that track your workouts. Check some of these out to help measure your progress. If you ever get discouraged that you’re not making enough progress, turn your log back to the first page to see where you started. If you’ve been exercising consistently for several months, you’ll almost certainly be lifting a lot more weight than you were at the beginning. Use this for motivation whenever you’re frustrated."

      "content": "Keep your back straight while doing squats or deadlifts. If you do a heavy, weight-bearing exercise like a squat or deadlift , keep your back straight to avoid injuries. Bend down by pulling your hips backward, not by bending your back. Use this principle whenever you lift weights. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do a few squats in a mirror and watch the way your back moves. Keep it bent at its natural curve and don't bend over. Use this as your reference position for lifting weights."

Start by using the machine with no weight on it to see how it feels. Then slowly add weight in 25 lb (11 kg) increments until it feels comfortable for you. [5] X Research source Avoid fully extending your knees so you don't stress your joints. Remember to set the safety bar at a comfortable height. Leg press machines have built-in bars that stop the weight from falling past a certain point. If the default setting is too low for you, adjust it higher."

Gyms usually have assisted pull up machines. On these devices, you place your knees on a platform that partially supports your weight while you pull up. Try these machines out to build your back and bicep muscles safely. [6] X Research source Start with the assistance level high at first to see how the machine feels.

Inhale as you release or lower the weight, then exhale as you lift it. This keeps your circulation up and your muscles loose.

      "content": "Increase the weight when your body is used to it. Let your body tell you when it’s time to scale up. When you’ve been using a certain weight with good form and it feels easy, then it’s time to increase the weight. Work up in small increments. Add 5–10 pounds (2.3–4.5 kg) at a time until you find a new comfortable weight. Then stick with that weight until you can lift it easily. If you can do 10-12 reps with a weight easily, then increase it. Refer back t your log to see what weights you were using for each workout. This prevents you from scaling up too much. Don’t set a time limit on increasing your weight. Committing to increasing once a month might sound good, but a certain weight might still feel heavy for you. Scaling up would be dangerous in this case. Let your body tell you when you’re ready to scale up instead."

If you don’t know how to do certain workouts, ask a trainer for help. With just one session, a personal trainer can show you the right form for several different exercises, plan a workout schedule, help develop your goals, and make suggestions for your diet.

During bicep curls, for instance, pushing your elbows away from your body makes your back work at an odd angle. This could lead to strains and pulled muscles. Keep your elbows tucked to your body for a safer motion. [11] X Research source As an added bonus, keeping your elbows tucked isolates your biceps more and gives them a better workout. Use this principle during other strength workouts as well. Keep the weight close to your body to prevent straining your back."

These offer less resistance than weights, and are less likely to injure you. If you're just starting out or are worried about getting injured, convert your favorite workouts to use resistance bands instead. [13] X Research source For most workouts, wrap the band around a pole or step on it with one foot. Then use your arms to pull and release them.

Instead, start small and focus on your form. As a general rule, use a light enough weight to do 15 reps comfortably when you start a new workout. Then scale up when you get used to the weight. If you’re doing a workout and you can’t use the proper form, then the weight is probably too heavy. Cut the weight in half and try again. Then work up to a comfortable weight where your form stays clean. For barbell activities like squats and deadlifts, do a few reps with the bar empty to get used to the form.
