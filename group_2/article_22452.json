You just place a little bit on your cat's paw, and it will lick it off. [2] X Research source Use a small strip of the paste on the cat's fur. If your cat shakes it off its front paw, try smearing it lightly underneath the front elbow. [3] X Research source Hairball pastes come in fun flavors your cat will likely enjoy, such as salmon. You may be able to just put some on a plate for your cat to lick. In most cases, you'll need to give your cat multiple applications of the hairball paste.
