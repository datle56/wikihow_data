      "content": "For weightlifting, a productive session can last for 20 to 60 minutes. Weightlifting , bodyweight strength exercises, and strength training are about repetition and control. These exercises follow a set-rest-repeat pattern where an exercise is done for a set amount of repetitions before you rest and move on to another exercise. So, the length of your workout depends on the number of exercises, sets, and reps you do, plus your rest time in between. It’s recommended that 1 set of exercises is 6 to 12 repetitions. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Typically, the number of reps you do and how long you rest between sets depends on what you hope to gain. For instance: [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Muscle strength: Perform shorter sets with heavier weights and long rests in between (2 to 5 minutes). Hypertrophy (increasing the size of muscles) : Do sets in the mid-upper range of exhaustion, progressively increasing the weight week-by-week, with 60 to 90 seconds of rest between. Muscle endurance: Perform longer sets at the top of your rep ability with shorter rests (20 to 120 seconds). If you’re easily bored or fatigued, focus on smaller muscle groups per session to cut back on your time in the gym. For example, work arms for 20 minutes one day and legs for 20 minutes another day. With all this in mind, a weightlifting session can last from 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the number of exercises and repetitions you do within the session."

Cardiovascular health is incredibly important, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of intense aerobic exercise a week. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source How you divvy this up depends on your schedule, endurance, and goals: For example, you might go for brisk 30-minute walks 5 times a week, or 25-minute runs 3 times a week to meet the 150 or 75 minute goal. Keep in mind that if you're training for something like a marathon, your cardio sessions will be much longer and more intense than if you were prepping for a 5K, for example. As a rule of thumb, workout longer if you’re doing low-intensity exercise, and workout less if you’re doing high-intensity exercise."

Calisthenics are often used in high intensity interval training (HIIT) and focus on increasing strength with resistance and cardio training. Experts recommend only doing 40-minute calisthenics or HIIT workouts 2 times a week to give your body time to rest and recover. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep in mind that you want to workout less if you’re doing high-intensity training and workout more if you’re doing lower-intensity exercise. Some very intense HIIT workouts can be as short as 5-10 minutes!"

The exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous—do something that’s fun or you enjoy! Go for a morning or evening walk with the dog, dance around to your favorite album, or go for a bike ride with a friend. Exercise releases endorphins or happy hormones that can help alleviate stress and help you feel energized.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source As Ismail reiterates, “Everyone's schedule is different. And everyone's time demands are different. You have to figure out the time of day that works best for you.” For instance, personal trainer and sports nutritionist Katie Dunlop recommends starting with a small goal and reward to keep yourself motivated: “For me, that might mean, ‘If I workout 10 minutes before work 4 days this week, I’ll treat myself to a coffee on Friday!’”"

The full set will be 1 minute. But, if you do a set of 8 reps that takes 5 seconds, you’ll only have to do a 40-second set. Work on increasing your weight when doing fewer reps and shorter sets.
