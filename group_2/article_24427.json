      "title": "Blind bet",
      "content": "Blind bet In poker, the “blind” is the buy-in for each hand, which puts money on the table before players even see their cards. [2] X Research source The player to the left of the dealer places a “small blind,” which is a small bet, and the player to their left places a “big blind” which is usually twice that amount. These blinds are only made by the 2 players to the left of the dealer each round. After, the minimum bets each round must be equal to or greater than the big blind. In casinos, blinds are often predetermined amounts. If you’re playing at home, agree on these amounts with other players before the game."

      "title": "First bet",
      "content": "First bet Look at your starting hand. The player left of the dealer places the initial bet into the pot, and betting moves clockwise around the table. You may either call the bet (bet the same amount as the last player), raise it, or fold (exit the round). [3] X Research source Betting ends once all players still in the game “call” the most recent raise. Strategy tip: At this point, all you have to go on is the 4 cards in your hand. Look for hands with lots of possibilities or high values, like pairs of face cards, same suits, or near-straights."

In Irish poker, your final hand consists of 2 cards from your private hand and any 3 cards from the flop. A card is added to the flop after each round of betting. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Discard Here’s the big twist in Irish Poker! In other poker games, you keep all the cards in your hand. But in Irish Poker, after the flop, choose only 2 cards to keep, and discard the other 2. [5] X Research source This raises the stakes and narrows your options for building a hand early in the game. Take note of the cards in the flop and the cards in your hand, and see if any possible hands reveal themselves. Strategy tip: Just like with your initial bet, look for card combinations that are both high and allow some flexibility, like pairs, same suits, or cards near each other in value that may create a straight."

Place your bets clockwise around the table until all players “call” the most recent raise. [6] X Research source Strategy tip: At this point, it’s not unusual for most players at the table to fold.

From best to worst, the hands are: [9] X Research source Royal flush: 10, J, Q, K, and A of the same suit. Straight flush: 5 cards in ascending order of the same suit, like 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of hearts. Four of a kind: 4 cards of the same value. Full house: 3 cards of the same value plus 2 cards of the same value. Flush: any 5 cards of the same suit. Straight: 5 cards in ascending order. Three of a kind: 3 cards of the same value.

If they’re correct, they choose any other player to take 2 drinks. If they’re wrong, they take 2 drinks themself. [11] X Research source Drinks assigned to other players can be split up however you like. Choose 2 players to each take 1 drink, or 1 player to take 2 drinks.

If they’re right, they choose a player to take 4 drinks. If they’re wrong, they take 4 drinks themself. [12] X Research source For example, if a player’s first card is a 3 of clubs, they’d likely guess that their second card is higher, since a 3 is fairly low. For reference, the card order from low to high is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace."

[13] X Research source Each player chooses another to take 6 drinks if they’re correct, or take 6 drinks themself if they’re wrong. For example, if the first 2 cards are a Jack and an Ace, the player might say “outside,” since there are only 2 cards between a Jack and an Ace—the Queen and King.
