      "content": "Extend a ladder at least 3 ft (0.91 m) past the edge of your roof. Use an extension ladder for the easiest way to get up to your roof. Lay the ladder on the ground so one end is against your home. Once the ladder is vertical, grab a rung at thigh-height and pull the rope in the middle of the ladder to extend it. When the ladder is 3 ft (0.91 m) taller than your roof, release the rope so the rungs lock in place. [1] X Research source Extension ladders can be purchased from your local hardware store. Have a partner help you support the ladder while you’re extending it so it doesn’t fall over. You can also use a step ladder as long as it’s still 3 ft (0.91 m) taller than your roof."

      "title": "Lean the ladder against your home.",
      "content": "Lean the ladder against your home. Keep your ladder at an angle to your home so the base is 1 ft (0.30 m) away from your home for every 4 ft (1.2 m) in height. Make sure the ladder’s feet are on even ground so it doesn’t rock back and forth while you climb it. If the feet aren’t even, dig some of the ground out from underneath the higher side. [2] X Research source For example, if your ladder is 16 ft (4.9 m) tall, place the bottom 4 ft (1.2 m) away from your home. Never keep your ladder on icy, muddy, or snow-covered ground since it could slip. Don’t use wooden blocks or supports underneath uneven legs since they could fall out and cause you to lose your balance."

      "content": "Carry all of your supplies in a tool belt or a bag. Always keep your hands free while you’re climbing your ladder so you have the best support. Keep your Christmas lights and shingle clips in the pockets of a tool belt or a bag that you can carry over your shoulder. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Climb up the ladder while always maintaining 3 points of contact.",
      "content": "Climb up the ladder while always maintaining 3 points of contact. Look straight ahead as you climb the ladder. Hold onto the rungs in front of you rather than the side rails. Always make sure you’re holding onto the ladder in 3 places while you’re climbing. This could mean holding on with both hands and 1 foot, or using both feet and holding on with 1 hand. [4] X Research source Have a partner support the ladder while you’re climbing so it doesn’t accidentally fall over."

      "title": "Step around the ladder onto the roof.",
      "content": "Step around the ladder onto the roof. As you reach the edge of your roof, hold onto the top rails of the ladder with both of your hands. Slowly swing 1 leg around one side of the ladder until you’re on your roof. [5] X Research source Don’t climb past the 4th rung of an extension ladder or stand on the paint shelf on a step ladder. Never try to get on a roof with a pitch or angle more than 30-degrees. If you absolutely need to put lights on the peak of a steep roof, look for a heavy machinery company where you can rent a boom lift."

      "content": "Simply take the clip and slide it over the shingle allowing the tabs at both ends to grasp the shingle. There is no reason to pry up the shingle as it could damage your roof. Plastic shingle clips can be purchased at hardware stores, but some stores may carry them around the holiday season. Clips are available for many different surfaces, like clay tile, asphalt, gutters, and brick . Avoid using nails or staples to secure your lights since they could damage your roof and cause moisture to leak inside."

      "content": "Slide 1 bulb on the strand into the ring on the ridge clip. Push the base of your bulb into the clip so it’s held securely in place. Make sure the bulb is tight in the clip so it doesn’t move around during harsh weather. [6] X Research source If the base is loose in the ring and the bulb is larger, you can slide the clip onto the bulb instead."

      "content": "Climb higher along the peak to attach the next lights on the strand. Go slightly higher on your roof, and pull the light strand tight so it forms a straight line rather than bowing in between the clips. Slide clips underneath your shingles and set the bulbs in the rings until you’ve gone to the top of the peak. [7] X Research source You may have to use multiple strands of lights depending on how long the peak of your roof is."

Be careful as you work your way down the other side of your roof while attaching the lights. Continue working down the peak until you reach the bottom. [8] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable climbing over the top of your roof, you may climb down your ladder and move it to the other side of your home."

When you’ve finished running lights across the peak of your roof, plug the end of the last strand into an outdoor extension cord. Run the cord along the edge of your roof or down the side of your home to the nearest outside outlet. Plug the cord into the outlet to turn on your lights. [9] X Research source"
