If you're nice to everybody, even the kids who aren't popular, you'll radiate positive energy which makes a great first impression. [2] X Research source Not an outgoing person? Just do your best to be compassionate and empathetic. Give out compliments, too! These make classmates feel good about themselves and they'll have a good impression of you. You could even jumpstart a conversation by saying something like, “I love your shoes! Where’d you get them?” or, “I like your necklace. I wish I had something like that!” Don't force anyone into conversation. If you think someone looks like they don't want to be bothered, play it safe and just give them a polite wave. This way, you're acknowledging them, and letting them know that you're a nice person, without overstepping any possible boundaries."

Consider packing multiple copies of your schedule so that you always have one easily accessible, especially for the beginning of the year. It's very useful so that you aren't late. You can also write your schedule on a sticky note, and keep the sticky note in your pocket, so you can easily glance at it when needed."
