Always make sure you stay balanced, if you do not stay on balance you could end up tripping yourself over. When you dribble, the ball should be bouncing no higher than your waist. Also when dribbling always move your wrist to keep the ball in good control. In a defensive crouch, the ball should come no higher than your mid-thigh. [1] X Research source"

It's also a good idea to exercise with each hand by itself to get comfortable going to the right and to the left. Alternate bouncing it quite hard and quite softly. [2] X Research source A good dribbling exercise to start with is to dribble twenty times in a row with your right hand and then switch and dribble twenty times in a row with your left hand. Do three sets of this when you start a basketball routine and three sets of this at the end. Stay still at first, but keep your knees bent and bounce on your toes to stay moving. When you get comfortable dribbling from a stationary position, do this same exercise while walking. When you get comfortable walking, start running."

When you're first starting out, your biggest concern is making sure the ball comes back close to your hand, but eventually you need to make sure the ball comes back to your hand as quickly and with as much force and control as possible. It's all in the wrist. To develop your power dribble, alternate bouncing the ball as you normally do and then with a few degrees more power. Don't bounce it so hard you lose control: bounce it firmly several times in a row without letting your arm come way up when you dribble it back down, then alternate back to a casual dribble. Try dribbling in the dirt. [7] X Research source You'll have to bounce the ball extra-hard to get it to come back at the same speed you're used to. When you get used to that, move inside and dribble like you've been dribbling before."

A quick crossover makes it harder for a defender to steal the ball or force you out of your movement. In the late 90s, Allen Iverson was known for his extremely fast and powerful crossovers. Start by power dribbling four times with your right hand and make the fifth dribble a hard crossover to your left hand. Do the same thing with your left. Then, make it three before the crossover, then two, eventually switching between your hands a few times with your power dribble, then build it back up."

If you're right handed, the purpose of your left hand is to stabilize the ball as you prepare to shoot. It's only there to make sure the ball doesn't slip out of your right hand. Although you need to make sure you don't use this technique while playing a match; it will most certainly lead to a faulty shot, and has very less chances of actually going in. Use the pads of your fingers and hold the ball so you see light through all of your fingers. As you shoot, push the ball toward your target while rolling it back toward you. This is called \"English\" or \"spin.\" Practice this while lying down. Shoot your basketball straight into the air so it comes back down onto your hand. You can do this for hours, while listening to music, or when you're having trouble sleeping. The ball should feel like part of your arm, extending into the hoop."

Practicing lay-ups especially with your non-writing hand is a great way to make you a more versatile player. Dribble toward the basket from the three-point line at a diagonal. When you get to the lane line, you'll have two more steps to the hoop. If you're on your right, dribble one last dribble when you step on the lane line with your right foot, then plant and jump from with your left. If you're on the left, do the opposite. On your right side, bring your right hand up with the ball in it and your right knee up at the same time. Imagine your elbow was attached to your knee with a string. Lay the ball off the backboard by aiming at the top right corner of the box behind the rim. Don't try to bounce it off with any force--your momentum coming in and up should do most of the work."

You have to make each shot before you move to the next position on the court. Do it as quickly and with as few shots as possible. [11] X Research source Start by shooting a lay-up. Run immediately to the baseline at a point in between the lane line and the three-point line. Have your friend pass you the ball and keep shooting from there until you make it. From there, run to a point in between the corner of the lane and the baseline and shoot again. Then move to the corner, then the free-throw line.

If you've been practicing by yourself and making all kinds of shots from all distances, it can be quite a shock to get in the game and hit nothing but bricks. A defender hurries you, gets in your face, and will try to steal or block your shot. A quick turn-around or fade-away shot will require you to over-correct with your arm for going backwards.

[15] X Research source To be an all-around good basketball player, you'll not only need to be able to make the clutch three-pointer, but to get back on defense and block a shot. The first step in developing your defensive game is in your stance. Keep a wide base with your body weight on the balls of your feet. Keep your butt down and your hips back. Your arms should be always up and out. Don't reach in or touch the offensive player too much or you'll be called for fouls. Use them to distract the player and try to block passes and shots. Focus your eyes on the player's waist and chest, not the ball. This will give you more of an idea where he will try to go.

While it may be fun to drop back for a three-pointer every time your hand touches the ball, it's typically not the job of the center to do that. Talk to your teammates and your coach to find out where you need to be on particular plays. The point guard is the court general. At this position, you need to see the court and set up the offense. You need to be a selfless passer and good shooter. You also need to have a good handle of the ball and court vision. The shooting guard is the back-up to the point guard. Usually, this is the best shooter or offensive player on the team. The small forward is the most versatile. You need to be a good shooter with the ability to go up for rebounds on offense or defense, and good vision to be able to kick the ball back out to the guards to set up the offense again. The power forward is a good defensive player, shot blocker, and an excellent player in the lane. This is maybe the most physical player on the team. The center is (among other things) probably the tallest player on the team. You should also be an excellent rebounder and passer, with the ability to control the lane game on offense. Use other players for inspiration. When you watch an NBA or college game, specifically watch the players who play the same position you do. Where is the power forward while the shooting guard takes a three-point shot? What does the guard do while the center goes up for a rebound on offense?"

It requires a great deal of communication with your teammate, who should drive the defensive player into your pick, instead of you driving yourself into the player.

On a court, start on one baseline and run to the nearest free-throw line. Drop and do 5 push ups on your fingertips, then stand and run back to the original baseline, then run to the three-point line, drop and do 10 push ups and continue on that same idea for every line on the court, back and forth, until you reach the first line again. Shoot at least 10 free throws after the drill while you are tired. \"Kill Drill\": this is a full court, down and back timed drill. If you're really out of shape just start with maybe 4-6 \"down and backs\" in 1 minute 8 seconds (starting at 1 baseline running to the other and returning to the original). Sounds like a sufficient amount of time until you run the 160 feet (48.8 m). After you build up some stamina, try 13 down and backs in 68 seconds.
