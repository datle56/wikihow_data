For larger areas, submerge the wound in a bowl or tub of water. When finished, gently blot the wound with a fresh towel to dry off.

      "title": "Apply a non-adhesive bandage to open wounds.",
      "content": "Apply a non-adhesive bandage to open wounds. For some burns, in particular those that have blistered over, a bandage will not be necessary. However, for burns with open wounds, cover the affected area in sterile non-stick gauze that's designed specifically for burns wounds. Make sure the material is loosely wrapped to avoid cutting off circulation to the area or further damaging the skin. If you're dealing with a large wound, or you don't have non-stick gauze, visit a doctor to have the burn professionally dressed."

      "content": "Take pain relievers if necessary. [6] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. If your burn is causing a significant amount of pain, over-the-counter medications may be a good solution. Standard drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen should relieve pain without affecting the healing process. Avoid sprays and creams that have to be applied to the wound itself. [7] X Research source Before taking pain relievers, read all label warnings thoroughly. If necessary, consult with your doctor prior to use."

      "title": "Wear clothing that compresses the skin.",
      "content": "Wear clothing that compresses the skin. To prevent scarring after severe burns, medical providers often order tight, form-fitting clothes to compress the skin. For the less severe cigarette burn, general-purpose clothes can lead to similar results. Wear tight-fitting gloves, shapewear, or similar items over the affected area, serving as a top layer of skin while your body heals itself. [9] X Research source The right kind of clothing to wear depends on how big your wound is. Talk to your doctor to find out what kind of clothing you should be wearing."

      "content": "Keep the burned area out of direct sunlight. When the skin over your burn initially heals, it will be a different color than the rest of your body. Until it has time to redevelop its natural pigmentation, keep it out of direct sunlight to avoid any color scarring. This is best accomplished by hiding the area behind thick, dark clothing. If exposure is unavoidable, cover the area with sunscreen ranked SPF-30 or higher. [10] X Research source"
