      "content": "Determine if the window adapter kit will work with your window. Almost all portable air conditioners come with a window adaptor kit that will work, however in some cases the kit is missing or not right for the window, and you will have to improvise a bit. [3] X Research source For the unit to function well, the gaps between the window adapter for the vent hose and the sides of the window must be sealed off. Measure your window opening to determine if the window adapter kit can be expanded or trimmed to fit correctly. If the window adapter kit that came with your portable unit is missing or does not adequately fit your window, take careful measurements of the opening you need to accommodate and have a piece of Plexiglas cut to size at your local hardware store. You can also use a piece of plywood, or even cardboard, to fill the gap. These options are less attractive, but will work in a pinch."

      "content": "Connect the exhaust hose that came with the portable air conditioner to the air conditioning unit. This may be a single hose with connectors already attached, or you may have to first attach an exhaust connector to the unit, and then attach the hose to the connector. Follow the directions that came with your unit. Connect the window connection bracket or adapter to the other end of the exhaust hose, if it is not already attached. Run the exhaust hose to the window, and place the window connection bracket or adapter into the open window."

      "content": "Secure the exhaust hose window connection in place. Adjust the included window kit sliders or panels until they completely fill the gap between the window connection bracket and the sides of the window. If you are using a piece of Plexiglas, simply slide it in the windowsill next to (or above) the exhaust hose window connection, and hold it in place until the window is closed. Close the window so that it fits snugly against the exhaust hose window connection, and holds everything firmly in place. In some cases, it may be necessary to use duct tape to seal the gaps around the exhaust hose window connection, and hold the window kit firmly in place."

[5] X Research source In office environments where outside windows are not present or accessible, portable air conditioners can be vented through a drop ceiling. Commercial ceiling vent kits can be purchased online or from your local HVAC retailer. There are a number of potential risks and inefficiencies involved with this procedure, so be sure to check with your building's maintenance personnel before proceeding. It is also possible to vent a portable air conditioner into an attic, however to avoid property damage or inadvertently heating up other parts of the house, it is advisable to get professional advice from an HVAC specialist before proceeding."
