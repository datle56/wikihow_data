      "content": "A Jezebel spirit is a demonic influence that uses deception and seduction to control people. This spirit is cunning and intelligent, and when it inhabits a person, it influences them to be driven by sexual appetites. A Jezebel spirit's behavior is seductive, unrepentant, and destructive, and the spirit's main goal is to seek power and cause division and strife among Christians. [1] X Research source Many people believe that the Jezebel spirit is one of the smartest and most cunning soldiers in Satan's army. The Jezebel spirit is never mentioned in the Bible, but “Jezebel” is a reference to the biblical story of Queen Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab. Jezebel encouraged King Ahab to allow the public worship of the deity Baal, persuaded him to kill innocent people, and committed many other atrocities. She was able to achieve all of this with lies, sexual behavior, and manipulative tactics."

      "content": "Seduction A person being possessed by a Jezebel spirit will use sexual power as a way to infiltrate and cause division among groups of Christians. Sexually immoral behavior, promiscuity, and adultery are usually the first signs of a Jezebel spirit at work. [2] X Research source A Jezebel spirit wants to wreak havoc among marriages, friendships, groups, and institutions, especially churches. To accomplish this, it tries to tempt Christians to live a hedonistic or promiscuous lifestyle, which distracts them from their faith."

      "title": "Manipulation",
      "content": "Manipulation A Jezebel spirit is cold and calculating, and it uses clever deceptions to manipulate others so that it can get what it wants. A person being influenced by a Jezebel spirit will attempt to influence others to gain power over them. Since the spirit is highly intelligent, it can be very subtle and some of its tactics may be unexpected at first. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Blasphemy",
      "content": "Blasphemy A person possessed by a Jezebel spirit will openly mock Church authority, Christians, and Christianity in general. It will do what it can to force a Christian person to question their religious beliefs and faith. The goal is to create doubt and anxiety within a person or group of people, and if this behavior is called out, the person will usually be completely unrepentant. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Control",
      "content": "Control A Jezebel spirit desperately craves complete control over people, institutions, and situations, and it will use the power of control to hasten whatever their endgame is. A person afflicted with a Jezebel spirit will always seek to be the center of attention, and it will use this platform to control other people and coerce them to do its bidding.

      "title": "Envy",
      "content": "Envy A Jezebel spirit wants what others have—wealth, power, influence, etc. It feels entitled to these things, and everything it does will be motivated by obtaining those desires. When a person is overcome with a Jezebel spirit that wants power, they'll will often befriend the current leader or ask to be their top assistant, making it difficult to spot them at first.

      "content": "Pray and ask God for his guidance. When you pray , tell God what you’re dealing with and ask Him to help you figure out the best course of action. You can also pray for the person being influenced by the Jezebel spirit and ask the Lord to soothe the jealousy, rage, and anger that they're feeling. [7] X Research source If you suspect you’re being influenced by a Jezebel spirit, pray for yourself. You might say, “Heavenly Father, please help me battle against the powers that attack me. In Jesus’ name, I ask you to break the power of confusion, torment, fear, control, and manipulation in my life. I submit my will, thoughts, and life to Jesus Christ and plead for stability and order to prevail in my soul. I ask you for freedom and deliverance from dark powers and the Jezebel spirit.” [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Confront the person who’s displaying Jezebel spirit behavior.",
      "content": "Confront the person who’s displaying Jezebel spirit behavior. If you’re close to the person and feel sure that the symptoms you’re seeing are caused by the Jezebel spirit, take them aside privately and tell them what you’ve been noticing. Encourage the person to repent and ask God for deliverance from evil; you can even offer to pray with them. It’s hard to predict how a person will respond to this, but at least you’re letting them know you’re aware of what’s going on and offering your help. This usually isn't an effective tactic if you aren't close to the person being afflicted by the evil spirit."

      "title": "Distance yourself from the person if they don't change or seek help.",
      "content": "Distance yourself from the person if they don't change or seek help. If you’re unable to confront the person directly, it’s better to remove yourself from the situation so you don’t become a target. If the person is a member of your church, tell your pastor what you’ve noticed before the spirit gets an opportunity to destroy the congregation. If this person refuses to acknowledge their behavior or repent, your pastor may want to ask them to leave the church. If a Jezebel spirit is moving within you, go to your pastor or another trusted authority in your church. Tell them what you’re going through and ask them to pray with you."
