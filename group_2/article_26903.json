      "content": "Add the vinegar to 1-cup measuring cup. Place 1.5 tablespoons of white vinegar in a measuring cup. Buttermilk is actually a soured form of milk. You're achieving the same effect at home by adding acid to the milk. The acid curdles the milk slightly, thickening it. The acid is also what helps the baked goods to rise through a chemical reaction. When it mixes with baking soda (a base), the two of them together produce carbon dioxide, creating bubbles in your baked goods. This process achieves an airy texture. [4] X Research source In place of the white vinegar, you can substitute lemon juice. You can also use other types of vinegar, but that can affect the flavor of your finished product. You can double this recipe, but you'll need to use double the amount of vinegar or lemon juice, too."
