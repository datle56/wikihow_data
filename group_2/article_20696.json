    {
      "title": "Complete all strike force missions when given the opportunity.",
      "content": "Complete all strike force missions when given the opportunity. To get the best ending, you must complete ALL strike force missions, no matter what. Completing all the missions leads to the SDC joining NATO to oppose Menendez in the mission \"Judgment Day,\" which is crucial to get the best ending. [1] X Research source If you fail all strike force missions, you won't get any Chinese support during \"Judgment Day,\" and everyone, including Karma (Chloe), can die. The strike force missions you'll get include FOB Spectre, Shipwreck, I.E.D., and Dispatch (as well as Second Chance if you can't save Chloe Lynch during \"Karma\")."

      "title": "Rescue Woods in \"Pyrrhic Victory.\"",
      "content": "Rescue Woods in \"Pyrrhic Victory.\" During this mission, it's established that Woods disappeared while helping rebels fight against Angola's Marxist government. Thus, your mission is to successfully rescue Woods. There are no special instructions to follow here; play through this chapter as usual, and you'll be fine!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Play through \"Celerium\" as usual and find the Celerium Worm.",
      "content": "Play through \"Celerium\" as usual and find the Celerium Worm. There's nothing specific you need to do in this chapter, either; just play it through and recover the Celerium Worm, then go on to the next mission."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spare Kravchenko in \"Old Wounds.\"",
      "content": "Spare Kravchenko in \"Old Wounds.\" In the mission \"Old Wounds,\" you have to resist shooting Kravchenko while you interrogate him. Spam the \"Use\" button (press it repeatedly) to resist the urge and continue interrogating him; that way, you'll learn there's a mole in the CIA and that Kravchenko was associated with Menendez. [2] X Research source To spam the \"Use\" key, you'll need to press F on the computer, X on the Xbox 360, or Square on the PlayStation 3."

      "title": "Find the intel file about the CIA's mole in \"Time and Fate.\"",
      "content": "Find the intel file about the CIA's mole in \"Time and Fate.\" During the mission, you have to find an intel file labeled \"CIA Memo\" which is located behind your objective, right by the burning files. Find it fast because the file can burn! Obtaining the file lets you learn more about the CIA mole."

    {
      "title": "Record Raul Menendez during \"Fallen Angel.\"",
      "content": "Record Raul Menendez during \"Fallen Angel.\" In the mission, you have to keep recording info about Zhao's secret meeting—if successful, you'll get 3 \"Intel Recordings.\" Don't look away from Menendez to ensure you get as much intel as possible! That will unlock the other strike force missions mentioned above, which are needed to get the best ending. [3] X Research source You'll also have to protect Harper during this mission. To do this, don't drive too close to the flaming pipe once you get close to the flare; that'll prevent his face from getting burned. Don't sweat it too much if Harper gets burned, though. It'll only change some of the dialogue in the next mission—nothing else."

      "content": "Kill DeFalco and rescue Karma (Chloe) during \"Karma.\" In the mission \"Karma,\" you must successfully save Karma by killing DeFalco before he escapes with her. However, if you fail this mission, don't panic yet; you have a second chance to save Karma by doing the strike force mission \"Second Chance.\" [4] X Research source It's a good idea to have a sniper for this mission! That may make it a little easier to catch DeFalco."

So, do not kill him. Instead, shoot him in the leg. You'll be ordered to shoot Mason again after that; shoot him in the leg again, not the head. [5] X Research source Doing this will cause Menendez to shoot both of Woods' legs, crippling him."

      "content": "Kill Harper during the \"Achilles Veil\" mission. While you're playing as Farid, Menendez will capture Harper at the Citadel and order you to kill him. You must kill Harper so Farid's cover won't be blown. Karma's survival depends on Farid's survival, so it's essential that he survives this mission! [6] X Research source If you attack Menendez instead of shooting Harper, Menendez will kill Farid; Harper will escape, but this will result in Karma/Chloe dying later on."

      "content": "Shoot Admiral Briggs in the leg during the \"Odysseus\" mission. You'll be playing as Menendez during this mission, and you have to shoot Admiral Briggs in the leg. He'll survive—and this will lead to Briggs successfully reactivating the USS Obama's defenses. [7] X Research source If the SDC and JSOC are allied, the SDC assists in defending Briggs's ship, the USS Obama, by sending their drones—depending on whether you completed all the strike force missions."
