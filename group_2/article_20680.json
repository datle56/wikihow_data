      "content": "Think about the implications of a relationship not working out. Even if you feel like you want to act on a crush, it is worth thinking about all possible outcomes, for better or worse. It is possible that the relationship could work out long-term, but if it does not: The relationship might succeed at first, but then fall apart. If the relationship does not succeed, or eventually falls apart, you will have to deal with seeing the crush at work, possibly being promoted, etc. This can create a great deal of stress. If the relationship does not work out, and you or the crush feels pressure to resign from your workplace, this will create many more problems."

[7] X Research source [8] X Research source You may have developed a crush at work if you haven’t had enough opportunities to find romantic interests outside of work.

      "title": "Focus on positive distractions.",
      "content": "Focus on positive distractions. Crushes often hold our attention because we let it happen. If you turn your mind to other things, however, it will be easier to get over the crush and move on. At work, focus your mind on your tasks, and having professional interactions with your coworkers. Even some things as simple as taking time to decorate your office, caring for a potted plant at your desk, or listening to your favorite music while you work can provide positive distractions from your crush. Outside of work, you can keep yourself from dwelling on your crush by focusing on other things you’ve been meaning to getting around to. Working out more at the gym, spending more time with a hobby, even cleaning your home (if you’ve been putting it off) can serve as positive distractions."

If you are sure that you can keep your work life and love life separated, you might be able to deal with having a crush on a coworker by admitting the reality of your feelings while also declaring to yourself that you won’t act on them. Sometimes, having a workplace crush can even be beneficial. For instance, it might make you dress better, work harder, or participate more in your company."

      "content": "Remember that the grass isn’t always greener. [11] X Research source Sometimes, having a crush is mostly fantasy. Maybe it seems like you would love to act on a crush, but in reality, it is only that the crush is unavailable or forbidden that causes the allure.
