      "content": "Cut your flannel to the same dimensions as the microfiber towels. Lay one of your microfiber towels over your flannel fabric and then cut the flannel so that it is the same size as your microfiber towel. You will need two pieces of flannel material to go on the outside of the microfiber towels, so cut out two pieces of flannel. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Layer the materials. Next, lay down a piece of flannel material pattern side down. Then, lay down three microfiber towels over this piece of flannel. Then, complete the fabric sandwich by placing another piece of flannel pattern side up on top of the microfiber towels. [3] X Research source Pin the materials together in several places to keep them in place when you sew them. Make sure that the pins go through all of the layers of material."

      "content": "Sew across the layers. Next, sew across the layers of fabric that you just pinned together. Sew several parallel lines across the fabric to keep it in place. Sew slowly to ensure that you do not end up with any bumps or uneven spots. [4] X Research source Make sure to avoid the serged edges of the microfiber towels. They may break your needle if you try to sew through them. Remove the pins as you sew."

To avoid breaking your needle on the serged edges of the microfiber towels, you will need to cut off the outer edges of your microfiber and flannel material square.

      "content": "Measure and cut the squares into four-inch wide strips. Use a ruler to measure the squares into four-inch wide strips. Then, cut the pieces into these strips.

      "content": "Serge across outer edges of the strips. It is important to serge or zigzag stitch the edges of the strips to prevent them from fraying and to make them last longer. Take your strips one at a time and serge across the edges or use a zigzag stitch if you do not have a serger. [7] X Research source If you have cloth diapers and just needed some inserts, then your project is finished! However, if you need the outer cloth part of the diapers, then you will need to make these next."

    {
      "title": "Choose your fabrics.",
      "content": "Choose your fabrics. Flannel cloth diapers are popular because the fabric is soft, but you can also choose terry, twill or a soft jersey or cotton blend. You will need a fabric for the outside and a fabric for the inside, so buy at least a yard (0.9 m) of each. To save money, you can also use old flannel sheets or shirts instead of buying fabric by the yard."

If you do not want the raw edges of your material visible, then you can fold over the edges as you sew, but it is not necessary. A little extra fabric on the outer edge of the seam is okay and may even offer some extra leak protection."

The elastic should pull the fabric in when you are done. As you sew on the elastic, make sure to stretch it slightly to ensure that it will pull in the fabric around the legs and back of the diaper. Elastic around the baby's legs and bottom will help keep in leaks."

Then, cut two small squares of the opposite side of the Velcro, also known as the hook side. It is best to make the hook side of the Velcro your long piece because this piece can be irritating to your baby's skin.
