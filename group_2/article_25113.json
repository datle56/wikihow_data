Get out your vacuum, plug it in if necessary, and set up a long-handled attachment if you’d like to put as much space as possible between you and the spider. Stand as far away from the spider as you can while still managing to reach it with the vacuum. Turn the machine on and place the end of the attachment over the spider. Take a moment to vacuum up any lingering web filaments while you’re at it! [1] X Research source The force of the suction should kill any spider you vacuum, as well as its egg sacs. However, you should still immediately empty the vacuum canister in an outside trash bin (just to be safe)."

If you’d like to instantly kill a spider from a distance, take a long-handled broom and push the bristled end up against the spider while swiping downward. If the spider falls before you manage to smash it, smack it a few times with the broom to kill it. [2] X Research source This method might be a little more panic-inducing because there is a chance you’ll simply knock the spider down but not kill it right away. You can also simply squish the spider with a tissue, shoe, or other solid object. However, this method will require you to get within an arm’s length of the spider."

[3] X Expert Source Hussam Bin Break Pest Control Professional Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. There many options for commercial insecticides that are specifically designed to immediately kill spiders on contact. The potent chemicals in these products can quickly get rid of spiders—just spray the product directly on a spider to kill it. Be sure to carefully read and follow the instructions on any insecticide spray that you want to use, especially if you have young kids or pets in the home. The one downside to “these over-the-counter products is that they don’t have any residual effects. So, they kill on contact when you spray it…and [the spiders] die. But after a while, the spray won’t cause that residual effect” to keep more spiders away, says Break. [4] X Expert Source Hussam Bin Break Pest Control Professional Expert Interview. 28 June 2019."

Test how far the spray bottle reaches so you know how close you need to get. Then, spray the spider repeatedly until it stops moving. In theory, the acetic acid in the vinegar can burn and kill the spider if applied in large quantities. [5] X Research source Once the spider is dead, use a vacuum or dustpan and brush to sweep it up and throw it out. Wipe down the wall or area with a damp cloth to clean away the vinegar. However, be aware that many sources claim that vinegar is not significantly effective at killing spiders. While the acetic acid content in vinegar can be harmful in spiders, the acidity of household vinegar is not typically high enough to do so unless the arachnids are practically drowned in the liquid."

Actual house spiders don’t pose a threat to humans and they can help keep your home free of other pests, like flies, moths, and earwigs. Either leave the spider alone, or place a container over it and carry it outside. Gently lower a glass cup or other transparent container over the spider, making sure that it’s trapped inside. [7] X Research source Then, slide a piece of paper or cardboard under the mouth of the container. Lift the container and paper together, then move the spider to a safe outdoor location.

Check the traps every few days and throw them out once they’ve caught the spider or spiders—keep in mind that glue boards are unlikely to be as effective against larger infestations. Alternatively, regularly spray a residual spider pesticide along doorways, windows, and baseboards, under furniture, and in corners where you’ve seen spiders. [8] X Research source Over-the-counter spider traps and spider sprays are low-priced and effective options for keeping spiders away from your home. However, it’s important to take safety precautions when using these methods. Spider poison used in spray repellents is often toxic to humans, children, and pets. Avoid spraying insecticides anywhere where children or pets play or sleep, and follow the package directions for any specific safety steps. [9] X Research source Sticky traps are less toxic, but the glue on some of them can still be harmful. If you have children or pets, place the traps somewhere where they won’t come into contact with them. Also, spider traps can be problematic as spiders may release distress signals when stuck. This distress may trigger other creatures to attack them, bringing more dangerous pests into your home."

Keeping your home clean of clutter, cobwebs, and other small bugs will provide less incentive for spiders to make their webs inside.

      "content": "Minimize outdoor lights and hang curtains on interior windows. Spiders are attracted to light, especially at nighttime. They like to spin their webs in front of light sources so it’s easier for them to catch bugs that fly toward the light. Even just remembering to turn off outside lights when the sun starts to go down can help reduce the number of spiders on the outside of your home, making it less likely that they’ll find their way indoors. [17] X Research source Using yellow or sodium vapor lights as an alternative to normal light bulbs can also help to attract fewer bugs (and, consequently, spiders). Similarly, it’s important to place curtains or shades on your windows, especially at night. “At night, the light from your house shines out through your windows, which attracts insects,” explains Chris Parker, founder of Parker Eco Pest Control. “Spiders eat insects, so they learn that your windows are a place where they can build webs and hang out and catch food.” [18] X Expert Source Chris Parker Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 21 April 2021. “By putting curtains up and blocking light from leaving your home, you’ll actually really reduce the spider activity,” asserts Parker.

However, if these solutions begin to lose effectiveness, a professional exterminator may be able to help you find a more permanent and effective solution. You see a venomous spider.

Most spiders are harmless and can actually be an asset to have in your home, as they help to control other insect populations that are more harmful and annoying.

So, for the most part, having a spider in your home is a benefit.” [27] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. However, there are some cases where you absolutely should exterminate a spider living in your home—specifically, if you see a dangerously venomous spider or have signs of an infestation. If you have reason to believe that a brown recluse, black widow, or other venomous spider is in your home, contact an exterminator immediately to take care of them. If you begin to notice a large amount of spiders in your home, you may also want to get rid of them. Large numbers of spiders can attract more spider-killing pests to your home, including centipedes, scorpions, and larger spiders. In the long run, these new pests can cause more problems, so it may be worth killing or removing the common spiders you see in your home. In other cases, consider letting the spiders in your house live or humanely removing them and placing them outside. If you have arachnophobia or are otherwise extremely uncomfortable sharing your space with spiders, however, killing them may be the only effective option for you."
