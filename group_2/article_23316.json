      "content": "These are the most common (and most aggressive) wasps out there. These are social wasps, so you may seem many of them in one location. These bugs are usually 3 ⁄ 8 – 5 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95–1.59 cm) in length, and they have distinctive yellow and black patterns. They create small nests with honeycombs all over them, often in trees, shrubs, attics, and lawns. Yellowjackets are the most common North American wasp, but they’re pretty aggressive, so stay away! [1] X Research source Yellowjackets tend to be extremely assertive when it comes to defending their hive, so don’t walk underneath a hive to take a closer look if you’re trying to identify them. Generally, they tend to be the most aggressive in the late summer and fall. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Yellowjackets are foragers, and they’ll eat just about anything. As a result, they tend to harass people when they’re eating outside, and they can swarm a trashcan if you leave the lid off outside. When many people use the word “wasp,” they’re picturing a yellowjacket."

      "title": "European paper wasps are social wasps, but they aren’t very aggressive.",
      "content": "European paper wasps are social wasps, but they aren’t very aggressive. They look very similar to yellowjackets, since they have nearly-identical black and yellow markings. They’re often around 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) in size, and they’re social wasps so you’ll see a bunch of them hanging around the hive. The best way to spot a paper wasp is to look at the hive. They build bulky paper-like structures, usually high up on buildings or in trees. [3] X Research source Yellowjackets and European paper wasps look basically the same; you’ll need to find the hive to differentiate them. Unlike yellowjackets, European paper wasps are fairly calm. They can sting if they feel threatened, but they won’t blindly attack out of nowhere the way yellowjackets can. While they’re known as the European paper wasp, they’re actually extremely common in North America. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "These wasps are mostly dark brown, with very subdued yellow markings. Like the European paper wasp, they’re social and they build paper-like structures high up on buildings and in trees. They’re a little bit bigger than their European cousins though, and are usually 3 ⁄ 4 – 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (1.9–3.2 cm) long. [5] X Research source They also tend to be less aggressive than many wasp species, and the male Northern paper wasp won’t even sting! Usually, these wasps won’t present much of a problem. [6] X Research source Northern paper wasps are most common in the eastern half of the United States and Canada."

      "title": "These intimidating wasps are large, solitary hunters.",
      "content": "These intimidating wasps are large, solitary hunters. As their name suggests, these wasps survive by hunting cicadas and laying their larvae inside. As a result, if you see a flying insect grappling or attacking a cicada, it’s probably a cicada killer. These wasps are larger, and grow up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length. They’re black and dark brown, with yellowish markings and reddish wings. [7] X Trustworthy Source The Smithsonian Institution Leading group of museums and research institution funded by the U.S. government Go to source If you’re wondering why there are a bunch of cicada carcasses in your yard, one of these wasps may be to blame. These wasps burrow in the ground and live totally alone, so you may not even know it’s there!

      "content": "European hornets look like big yellowjackets but with a reddish head. These bugs grow up to 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm), making it the largest native hornet in the United States. They’re social, but they typically hide their nests by building them inside of hollow trees, attics, or abandoned structures so you may not know where they’re coming from. The best way to spot one of these is by their behavior; they’re one of the only wasps that are active at night and attracted to light. [9] X Research source If you spot a wasp flying against your window late at night when the lights are on, there’s a good chance it’s a European hornet. [10] X Research source These wasps will aggressively attack anyone who comes near their nest. Unfortunately, since their hives are rarely visible, you may find them swarming you out of nowhere. If you think you’ve got a hive nearby, hire an expert to handle this problem.

      "content": "There are many mud daubers out there, but they all look and behave similarly. Mud daubers are solitary, and they’re rarely aggressive towards people. These are some of the easier wasps to identify because they look fairly odd compared to other wasps. They’re usually 3 ⁄ 4 –1 in (1.9–2.5 cm) in length, but they’re incredibly thin. They also have a pronounced “waistline” (called a petiole), so their abdomen and stinger almost look like disconnected from their upper body. They may look kind of freaky, but they’re mostly harmless. [12] X Research source Mud daubers build their nests out of mud and dirt. Their nests tend to be on the smaller side since these wasps are solitary. Some mud daubers will build organ-shaped nests that look like a sequence of parallel tubes."

      "content": "These hornets are almost entirely black, with whiteish-yellow accents. These white/yellow markings only appear on their upper bodies, so a black abdomen is usually a giveaway. These wasps are often 1 ⁄ 2 – 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.3–1.9 cm) in length, and they’re social so you may see a lot of them swarming around their nest. They often build their nests high up in trees, and their hives look like football-shaped structures of paper. These wasps actively attack other aggressive wasp species, and they won’t attack people unless you get within a few steps of their nest. Since their nests are often high up off of the ground, these are usually helpful insects to have around.

They’re the world’s largest hornet, and they tend to freak people out when they come across them. With distinctive orange and black markings, these hornets are pretty hard to miss. Their stings are very painful, but they won’t attack you unless they feel threatened. [14] X Research source These wasps are social and live in nests, but they build them underground in secluded areas. [15] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source In North America, these wasps are currently only found in Washington and Northwest Canada. They’re extremely common in Asia, though. [16] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source This species is invasive, meaning that they’re actively harmful to the ecosystem. If you stumble across Asian giant hornets, call a professional to eradicate them. If you live outside of Washington state, Asia, or British Columbia and you see these wasps, contact your state’s agricultural department and reach out to the nearest university extension program.

There are a few different digger wasp species, but they’re generally darker with bright yellow or orange markings on their abdomens. They’re solitary, so you won’t see a bunch of them—unless you’ve got a healthy garden! These wasps hunt grubs that feed on healthy plants, so if you see them, don’t kill them.

There are a few subspecies, but the odd bundle of grass they use to make their nests is a telltale sign you’re looking at a grass-carrying wasp. They’re usually around 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) in length, and they’re shiny black. They won’t attack people, and they’re generally considered beneficial bugs since they help spread pollen. [20] X Research source Grass-carrying wasps tend to build their nests in odd locations. You may find them in your gutter, storm drain, or windowsill. Some of them even build their nests on the ground, out in the open for anyone to see!"
