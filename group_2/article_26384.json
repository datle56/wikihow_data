      "content": "Find scarves in colors you love. You can still maintain propriety in avoiding drab shades of gray and black and choosing more prismatic hues. Choose shades that fit your personality and style. If you are bold and outgoing, try brighter hues. If you have a quieter nature, muted tones will work wonderfully. Collect scarves in colors that match the rest of your closet – you will wear them more and can mix-and-match them with multiple outfits. Recognize which colors suit your complexion and eyes, as well as your outfit."

Green Eyes: Vibrant green eyes coordinate well with pretty shades of red, pink, and peach. These complimentary colors add cheer and interest to any ensemble. Blue Eyes: Baby blue's can be balanced beautifully with a headscarf in gold, bronze, orange, or brown. The richness of these warm tones flatters the cool notes found in your eyes."

      "content": "Accentuate the undertones in your skin with the hues of your hijab. Fair Skin: Ivory undertones in skin are easy to flatter with colors on the warm-end of the color spectrum. That means choosing shades of red, orange, yellow, and brown. Golden Skin: Pretty beige and sun-kissed gold skin looks best with blue and green hues, to balance out your natural warmth. Chocolate Skin: Deep coffee-hued skin pairs wonderfully with shades of plum, coral, and peach. The bold warmth in both your headscarf and skin tone will give you a soft, welcoming look."

      "content": "Add interest to you scarf by choosing one with a subtle pattern woven in. Small prints are easy to work with and match most outfits.

Try to find these small prints with a limited color palette."

      "content": "Avoid too much matching. Your scarf is meant to compliment your clothing, but choosing colors and patterns that are too \"matchy-matchy\" can make a pretty outfit look forced. You don’t have to wear the same colors. A blue shirt doesn’t have to be paired with a blue hijab; try a contrasting hue or tinted variation. Prints and colors do not have to “match” to “go”"

      "content": "Don’t overwhelm your outfit with the addition of your scarf. If your outfit is brightly hued or busy, then try wearing a light or dark colored scarf to avoid gaudiness Wearing a simple or monochromatic ensemble can be spruced up with the addition of a busier or brighter hijab. Solid colors can be juxtaposed nicely next to each other, but do so in moderation."
