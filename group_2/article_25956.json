You can also break the process up by reducing the numbers of your birthday, month, and year separately, then adding those three numbers together. For example: Day (14): Add 1+4 to get 5. Month (4): Single digit, so no addition needed. Year: (1998): Add 1+9+9+8=27, add 2+7 to get 9. Life Path Number: Add the reduced day (5), the reduced month (4), and the reduced year (9). 5+4+9=18. Then, reduce this number. 1+8=9, which means your life path is 9."
