Binding enough sparklers together can result in a blast as strong as dynamite. Sparkler bombs can hurt or severely harm individuals who do not take the proper precautions set by their local authorities. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy a set of sparklers. Depending on the time of year, sparklers can be bought in many locations. Sparklers can be found in various sizes with the larger sizes lasting longer and giving off more effect. Sparkler bombs are usually made from the 10 inch sparklers. Sparklers are wires that are coated in pyrotechnic material and iron fillings. Once lit, they emit a tiny amount of sparks that move down the wire for about 20 seconds. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Tape some sparklers using electrical tape. As you increase the number of sparklers you tape together, you will create a greater effect; however, each sparkler you add increases your risk for harm and danger. Do not exceed an amount that you have already seen tested by a professional or tested yourself. Supervise your children so that they do not exceed a safe limit. 72 sparklers are enough to make a dangerous bomb blast. Read the labels and keep well below 50 milligrams of flash powder, the explosive content in firecrackers that is illegal under the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives. [4] X Research source Arrange them so that they are all facing the same way and tape them at the bottom where the is no longer any pyrotechnic material. Wrap the bundle in tape 2-3 times, leaving an inch or so of the coated end exposed. It should now look like a cone."
