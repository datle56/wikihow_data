      "content": "Check your oil regularly. Oil is the lifeblood of your car's engine, so it's important to keep it clean and topped off. Check your oil level at least once a month, or more often if you drive frequently. To check your oil level, park your car on level ground and turn off the engine. Wait a few minutes for the oil to settle, then pull out the dipstick, wipe it clean, reinsert it, and pull it out again. The oil level should be between the \"full\" and \"add\" marks on the dipstick. If it's low, add more oil as needed."

      "content": "Check the fluid reservoirs in the engine bay and add more fluid when needed. Your engine bay has plastic reservoirs for brake fluid, engine coolant, windshield washer fluid, and power steering fluid. The lower line on the reservoir is the “fill” point. Any time you see the fluid drop below that line, add more until it’s back up to the higher line, which is the “full” point. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Some vehicles have specific requirements for the type of coolant or brake fluid you use. Refer to your owner’s manual or an application specific repair manual to see what kind is right for your specific car. To fill each reservoir, unscrew the cap and pour the fluid in until it reaches the “full” point as indicated on the side. Then screw the cap back on."

      "title": "Use the right octane fuel for your engine.",
      "content": "Use the right octane fuel for your engine. The octane rating of fuel is a measurement of the fuel’s stability under pressure. High compression or forced induction engines (turbocharged or supercharged engines) require a higher octane fuel than most other vehicles. Using a lower octane fuel could cause damage to the engine and create real problems in the future. Most cars that require “premium” fuel will say so on the instrument cluster of the dashboard and over the fuel filler cap. Check your owner’s manual or the manufacturer’s website if you’re still unsure what octane level of fuel your vehicle needs."

      "content": "Install a new fuel filter every 40,000 miles. The fuel filter blocks the passage of dirt and sediment from your fuel tank to the engine itself. To replace the filter, locate it along the fuel line running from the gas tank to the front of the car. It will look like a cylinder with a nozzle coming out of the front and back. Place a container beneath it to catch any leaking fuel, then use a flat head screwdriver to pop off the clips holding the fuel lines on the nozzles. [4] X Research source Loosen the bracket holding the old fuel filter in place and slide it out. Slide the new one into the bracket and tighten it down. Attach the fuel lines to each nozzle and reinsert the clips to hold them in place. If you break the clips, you can buy new ones at your local hardware store."

      "content": "Replace your brake pads every 20,000 miles. Failing brakes can be extremely dangerous. If you think your brakes may be failing, have them serviced immediately. To do it yourself, loosen the car’s lug nuts and then jack the vehicle up. Support the car with jack stands then remove the lug nuts the rest of the way. Locate the brake caliper (it looks like a vice clamped onto the circular rotor) and remove the 2 bolts that hold it in place. Slide it off the rotor and use a C-clamp to compress the piston back into the caliper. [6] X Research source At that point, you can install the new brake pads into the caliper by sliding them into place where the old ones were. Remove the C-clamp, place the caliper back on the rotor, then reinsert the 2 bolts that hold it in place. Repeat that process on the other side, then put the wheels back on and lower the car."
