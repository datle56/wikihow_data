      "content": "Dissolve active dry yeast in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water. If you're not using instant yeast, put 2 teaspoons (6 g) of active dry yeast into a small bowl. Add a pinch of sugar and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the lukewarm water. Stir until the yeast is dissolved and let it sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. [1] X Research source The yeast should bubble and foam up once it's activated. If you're using instant yeast, you don't need to dissolve it or add sugar."

      "title": "Put the yeast into a bowl with oil, flour, salt, and 7⁄8 cup (210 ml) of water.",
      "content": "Put the yeast into a bowl with oil, flour, salt, and 7 ⁄ 8 cup (210 ml) of water. If you're using the activated yeast, pour it into a large mixing bowl. If you're using instant yeast, measure 2 teaspoons (6 g) into the mixing bowl. Add 3 cups (361 g) of unbleached all-purpose flour to the bowl along with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil, 1 1/4 teaspoons (7 g) of salt, and 7 ⁄ 8 cup (210 ml) of lukewarm water. [2] X Research source Avoid putting the salt directly onto the instant yeast because it will kill the yeast. You can add the remaining water later if the dough looks dry, but start with the smaller amount."

      "content": "Stir the ingredients to make a sticky dough. Use a sturdy spoon, stand mixer, or bread machine to mix the dough ingredients. Stir until they're completely combined and you don't see pockets of flour. [3] X Research source If the dough seems too dry, you can stir in the remaining 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of lukewarm water, a spoonful at a time. If you're using a stand mixer, use the dough hook attachment. Don't use a hand mixer to make this dough because it's not powerful enough to mix the dough."

      "title": "Knead the pizza dough",
      "content": "Knead the pizza dough until it's soft, smooth, and stretchy. To knead the dough by hand, coat your hands with flour and sprinkle your work surface with a little flour. Use the palms of your hand to push the dough away from you so it stretches. Then turn the dough 45 degrees and fold it in half. Push the dough away again and continue to turn and fold the dough. Knead until the dough becomes soft and elastic. [4] X Research source To knead the dough using a stand mixer, choose the second lowest speed and beat the dough for 4 to 5 minutes. To knead the dough using a bread machine, set the machine to run a dough cycle."

      "title": "Put the dough in a bowl and prove it for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
      "content": "Put the dough in a bowl and prove it for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. To prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl, lightly grease it before you put the dough in it. Then cover the bowl and leave the dough to rest at room temperature until the yeast causes it to rise. The dough should nearly double in size and become puffy once it's ready to shape. [5] X Research source If you used instant yeast, begin checking the dough after 1 hour of proving. If you used active dry yeast, begin checking it after 1 1/2 to 2 hours."

      "content": "Decide what size and thickness of pizza you want. Since you have control over how many pizzas to make with the dough, you can also choose how thick you want them. This batch of dough will make one of these options: Two 1/2 in (1.3 cm) thick round pizzas that are 14 inches (36 cm) in diameter Two 3/4 in (1.9 cm) thick round pizzas that are 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter One 3/4 to 1 in (1.9 to 2.5 cm) thick rectangular pizza that's 13 by 18 inches (33 cm × 46 cm) One 1 1/2 in (3.8 cm) thick rectangular pizza that's 9 by 13 inches (23 cm × 33 cm) One 1 in (2.5 cm) thick round pizza that's 14 inches (36 cm) in diameter"

      "content": "Divide the dough if you're making 2 pizzas. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and scoop the dough onto it. Then use a knife or bench scraper to divide the dough into 2 equal portions. [6] X Research source If you're making 1 large round or rectangular pizza, you don't need to divide the dough."

      "title": "Stretch the dough into circles or a rectangle.",
      "content": "Stretch the dough into circles or a rectangle. Once you've decided the size and thickness of the pizza you want, use your hands to gently stretch the dough. To make a rectangular pizza, start by stretching the entire ball of dough into an oval. Then tug on the corners a little to make a rough rectangle. If you're making round pizzas, stretch each dough half (or the whole ball) into a rough circle. [7] X Research source Making 1 large rectangle is the classic Italian way to shape pizza dough and it will fit your baking pan better than if you try to make 2 smaller rectangles or squares. If you're finding it hard to stretch the dough, you can use a rolling pin to spread the dough a little."

      "content": "Cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes. If you made round pizzas, take bowls that are larger than the diameter of the pizza and turn them over. Place the overturned bowls over the dough. If you made a rectangular pizza, spray a large sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray and lay it over the dough. Leave the pizza dough to rest for 15 minutes. [8] X Research source The dough may puff a little as it rests, but it doesn't need to double in volume."

      "content": "Spray the pizza pans with cooking spray and lay the dough in the pans. If you don't have cooking spray, spread a little olive oil across your pizza pan. Carefully lay the rolled dough in the pan and stretch the edges so they come close to the sides of the pan. The olive oil will improve the flavor of the crust and prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan."

Then remove the bowls or plastic wrap and use your fingers to finish stretching the edges of the dough to the corners of the pizza pan. [9] X Research source You should be able to fill the entire pizza pan with the stretched dough."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 500 °F (260 °C) and adjust the oven racks. Place a rack on the lowest rung of your oven so the pizzas will bake closest to the heating element. This will give you the crispiest crust. [11] X Research source If you're using a pizza stone, place it on the lowest rack."

      "content": "Bake just the dough in the pan for 8 to 14 minutes. Uncover the pans and put the pizza dough into the preheated oven. Bake the dough until it's just starting to set and become brown around the edges. If you're making thin crust pizza, take it out after 8 minutes. For thicker crust pizza, remove it after 12 to 14 minutes. The dough won't be finished baking at this point. Pre-baking the dough will make the dough chewier."

      "content": "Remove the pizza and let it cool for 5 minutes. Turn off the oven and transfer the pizza to a rack or cutting board. Let the pizza cool so the cheese firms up a little and it's easier to slice. If the pizza sticks when you try to remove it, slide a firm metal spatula under the crust to loosen it."

Serve the pieces of pizza while they're still hot and set out grated Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. If you don't have a pizza cutter or knife, use clean kitchen shears to cut pieces of pizza. Refrigerate leftover pizza in an airtight container for up to 3 or 4 days."
