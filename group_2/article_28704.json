      "title": "Start with a square piece of paper.",
      "content": "Start with a square piece of paper. If you are using origami paper, there is one side that is shiny and/or decorated â€“ this is the right side. Lay the paper right-side down. A 6 x 6 inch (15 x 15 cm) square is a good size for beginners. If you want to create larger or smaller butterflies, adjust your paper size accordingly."

      "content": "Make a horizontal valley crease. Match the paper's lower edge to the upper edge and smooth the crease with your fingers, starting from the center and working your way out. Unfold the paper so the crease remains. In the valley fold, you fold the paper over the crease, so that the sides of the paper that were facing up are now folded in on each other. The resulting crease is \"under\" the folded sides, hence the name \"valley.\""
