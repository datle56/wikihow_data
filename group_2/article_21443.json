      "content": "Use a pot that's at least 8.5 inches (22 cm) in diameter with drainage holes. Your pot should be anywhere from 6.5–18 inches (17–46 cm) deep. It's important that the pot you get has drainage holes in it. Larger pots will be able to hold more tulip bulbs, which will create a fuller pot of flowers. You can purchase plastic, ceramic, or terracotta pots to plant tulips. [1] X Research source A 8.5 inch (22 cm) pot can hold anywhere from 2-9 tulip bulbs. A pot that is 22 inches (56 cm) in diameter will be able to hold approximately 25 medium-sized tulip bulbs. Drainage holes are important so that water doesn’t pool on the bottom of the pot and rot the bulbs."

      "content": "Fill the pot halfway with a perlite and vermiculite potting mix. Purchase a porous, fast-draining soil from a home and gardening store or online. Perlite and vermiculite potting mixtures are great mediums for tulips. Work outside and carefully pour the bag of potting mix into the pot. [2] X Research source Potting soil is often better than the soil you can get in your yard or garden because it will retain moisture better, it’s filled with nutrients that promote growth, and it will have better drainage."

      "content": "Push the bulbs into the soil, spacing the bulbs 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Place the bulbs up against the inside edge of the pot first, then move your way towards the center of the pot. Push the flat side of the bulbs deep enough into the soil to hold them in place. [3] X Research source The pointed end of the bulb should be facing up. Planting more bulbs will result in more flowers, but it will increase the competition for nutrients and water. If you’re crowding the bulbs, be sure to water and apply fertilizer regularly."

      "content": "Cover the bulbs with 5–8 inches (13–20 cm) of soil. Use the same potting soil that you used before to completely cover the bulbs. If you are putting the pots in an area that may be open to animals like squirrels, you can attach a wire grid over the top of the pots to prevent them from eating the bulbs before the tulips bloom.

      "title": "Consider adding additional bulbs for a layered effect.",
      "content": "Consider adding additional bulbs for a layered effect. If you want your tulips to be different heights, or just want more tulips in your pots, you can layer bulbs on top of each other. To do this, simply cover the top layer of bulbs with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of soil, then plant another layer of bulbs above the first layer before covering them with potting soil. When the bulbs bloom, they will fill up the entire pot. Cover the top layer of bulbs with 5–8 inches (13–20 cm) of soil. You can plant the second layer of bulbs directly over the first layer."

      "title": "Water the soil once the bulbs are planted.",
      "content": "Water the soil once the bulbs are planted. Water the soil thoroughly once you have planted the bulbs. Excess water should drain out of the drainage holes on the bottom of your pot. [5] X Research source If you are keeping the bulbs inside you’ll have to water them approximately 2-3 times per week. If you are keeping the bulbs outside and there is regular rainfall, you don't have to water them. If there is a drought, water them 2-3 times per week."

Tulips need to go through their dormancy phase in order to bloom in the spring. In order for this to happen, they must be exposed to colder temperatures. [6] X Research source"

If you are keeping the pots outside, it’s best to plant the bulbs when the temperature outside is 45–55 °F (7–13 °C). If you purchased bulbs that are pre-chilled, you can skip this step."

If you're keeping the tulips inside, move them next to a window or another area that gets sunlight. If you're moving the pots outside, make sure that the temperature has warmed up to at least 60–70 °F (16–21 °C).

Different species of tulips bloom at different times a year, so read the packaging on the bulbs you’ve purchased so you can plant them accordingly. Double early, fosteriana, kaufmanniana, greigii, and single early tulips will typically bloom earlier in the year. Darwin hybrid, fringed, triumph, and lily flowered tulips are mid-season bloomers. Parrot, single Late, viridiflora and double late bloom later in the season. [8] X Research source"

To check this, occasionally poke your finger 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the soil and water the soil if it’s dry. [9] X Research source If you are keeping the pots outside, only water the bulbs if it doesn’t rain for over a week. Continue watering the bulbs during the dormancy phase."

If the tulips are stunted in growth or exhibit brown or yellow patches over them, it's likely they have a disease or may be infested with pests like nematodes. To prevent the disease from spreading, dig up the bulbs of any tulips that exhibit these signs of sickness and throw them away. [12] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Prevent squirrels and other animals from eating your tulips by keeping them indoors, putting a wire mesh over the soil, or fencing them in. Common tulip diseases include basal rot, root rot, and tulip fire, a fungal disease. Do not plant tulip bulbs that have white fungus on them, because it can spread and hurt the rest of the tulips in your pot."

Then, empty out your pots and replace the old potting soil with new soil. This will give bulbs nutrients, will promote growth, and increase the chances of the tulips reblooming the next growing season. [14] X Research source If you are removing your bulbs off-season, store them in a cool and dark place, like a refrigerator, until you're ready to plant them. Use a quality potting mix with compost and fertilize it throughout the year if you don’t want to replace the soil every year. All you have to do is top dress the soil with compost just before the growing season."
