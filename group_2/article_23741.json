If they says there is nothing, ask if there's something they have never done but haven't particularly fantasized about. A simple starting point can be being intimate in a room in your home other than your bedroom, if this is practical. If you are afraid to raise the subject directly, begin with indirect hints. \"What did you think of the scene in that movie we watched? Would you ever try that?\" Be cautious when discussing fantasies. It can be hurtful to suggest that you are thinking of something other than your partner when you're being intimate. Emphasize that you want to experience something new with the person you're with. Sharing fantasies can build trust, be prepared to talk about things you'd like to try too. If you're not comfortable talking about your fantasies, it's not fair to expect your partner to be.

If you are uncomfortable lingering on the issue, mention it casually, possibly as part of a list of ailments.
