      "content": "Place the poles into the ground. Lift the pole up and insert it into the hole, holding it upright as you do so. As you lower the pole into the ground, it should click into place and stay upright without holding it. [2] X Research source Repeat this process with both poles. If the pole does not secure into the ground, the hole may be dirty or blocked. Remove the post and check for obstructions, removing any dust or debris as needed."

If you need to make the poles higher than they can naturally go or your poles don't have adjustable feet, insert volleyball pole spacers at the bottom. [3] X Research source The regulated net height for the following volleyball teams are: Co-ed, standing disabled, or men's volleyball: 7 ft 11 inches (2.41 meters). Women's volleyball: 7 ft 4 inches (2.23 meters) Sitting or wheelchair volleyball: 4 ft 11 inches (1.5 meters) Senior volleyball: 7 ft 2 inches (2.1 meters) Children's volleyball: 6 ft 6 inches (1.98 meters) -7 ft 4 inches (2.23 meters)"

The center height should be match the regulation requirement for men's, women's, co-ed, or other volleyball groups.

      "content": "Tie the ropes off to the end posts. If you notice any excess rope from the net straps or net rope, loop it over the ropes and tie it in place. This will prevent tripping and injuries caused by the ropes while you play volleyball. Hold the ropes in place with loose knots to make removing the ropes simpler later on."

Mark the spot for a volleyball pole on both sides of the court with stakes or another small object. If you're playing on an open field, the length should be about 60 feet (18 m) and the width should be 30 feet (9.1 m). Place the volleyball poles in the middle on each side.
