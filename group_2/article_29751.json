      "content": "Ask yourself if reptiles are the right pet for you. Most people who buy reptiles are inexperienced and don't realize that owning reptiles takes a lot of time and effort. Reptiles are sometimes very cautious and uncomfortable with loud noises (sans snakes, which are deaf) or sudden movements. If you're looking for an animal to play with, you may want a dog or a cat. Reptiles aren't the type of animals who will want to play fetch with you or any games, although some reptiles such as bearded dragons and blue-tongue skinks can be quite friendly and affectionate. You also need a lot of patience owning a reptile; especially when you buy one for the first time; they might not trust you immediately and back further into the cage when you approach it. It takes some time to get a reptile to trust you. You must set aside time to clean their enclosures, feed and water them, take them to the vet, etc. Realize that owning a reptile takes a lot of time and effort & think very hard about it before you decide to buy one."

      "content": "Research the reptile you're thinking of buying. All species of reptiles are different from one another; just like other animals, like birds and mammals, are different. Think about the types of reptiles you want for your zoo. You'll want to start with one reptile before you develop the zoo. Baby reptiles are recommended because they can grow up getting used to you and trusting you, whereas adults might be more cautious and could potentially bite or attack you. If you're a beginner reptile owner, these are some reptile species that are perfect for first-timers; Green Anoles Leopard geckos . Crested geckos Bearded dragons . If you're a first-timer, do not buy a Green Iguana or any venomous snake. These reptiles need extensive care and they grow big and fast. Most beginners buy an iguana and realize too late, and either abandon the animal or don't care for it properly, sometimes making it ill. Corn snakes . Ball pythons."

As a minimum, you'll need a nice big enclosure, a water source, and a food source, proper lighting fixtures , some powdered vitamins and calcium you can sprinkle on their food, and a good place for your reptile to hide to feel safe (A hollow log or rock it can climb in, etc.). You might need to buy other things depending on your choice of reptile. You'll need to set this up where there isn't a lot of noise, other animals can't get to it, and its environment is controllable."

You can buy another separate enclosure or use a giant one to keep the same reptile species, based on the species. Some species are best kept separately and not in a communal situation. Remember to buy everything you'll need before purchasing each new exhibit for your reptile zoo."
