      "title": "Your man wants to feel useful.",
      "content": "Your man wants to feel useful. He knows that you‚Äôre independent and perfectly capable of doing things on your own. Still, he wants to feel like he‚Äôs making a positive contribution in your life‚Äîthat‚Äôs a totally natural desire. Instead of doing everything yourself, remember that you have a teammate who wants to help you and reach out to him. Even asking for assistance with something simple, like a household task or project, will do the trick. You might say, ‚ÄúHoney, can you help me change this light bulb?‚Äù He knows you can do it yourself, but you want his help. And he loves that feeling. Text him something like, \"My car is making a really weird noise and I'm worried. üòì I'd feel a lot better if you looked at it. Can you come over?\" Similarly, try asking for his advice. You might say, \"I can't decide if I want to go back to school for my nursing degree or not. Can you give me your honest opinion? Do you think it'll be worth it?\" Use a gentle tone and pose your request as a question. For instance, ‚ÄúPick that up‚Äù and ‚ÄúWould you mind picking that up for me?‚Äù sound a lot different."

      "content": "He wants to feel special and know that you adore him. To really make an impact, it‚Äôs important to be specific with your praise and not lay it on too thick (since he‚Äôll see right through that). Genuine, heartfelt compliments will go a long way toward making your guy feel truly loved and treasured. [1] X Research source Aim for variety so he feels like a true Renaissance man. Some examples: \"You‚Äôre such an amazing cook‚Äîdinner was delicious and that was the best steak I‚Äôve had in ages. I‚Äôm so lucky to have you.\" \"That shirt looks perfect on you. It really brings out the green in your eyes and defines your arms. All those hours at the gym have paid off!\" \"It blows me away that you taught yourself how to play the guitar. You‚Äôre so talented.\" You could text him something like, \"Just wanted to say you looked hot last night on our date üòò\""

      "content": "A simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù means the world to him. Everyone wants to be acknowledged and appreciated‚Äîit‚Äôs human nature. When your man does something nice for you, make it a point to thank him. And you don‚Äôt have to make a fuss to make an impact! Briefly stop what you‚Äôre doing, lock eyes with him, and tell him you appreciate him. You could also leave him a note or send him a text out of the blue to thank him for all the little things he does. He‚Äôll feel like the king of the world. [2] X Research source \"Thank you so much for helping me with the errands. We got them done in half the time it normally takes. Can I treat you to lunch to show my appreciation?‚Äù \"I appreciate your offer to pick up the kids for the next few months. I‚Äôm swamped with work and that‚Äôs one less thing I have to worry about.

      "content": "Boost his ego in front of his peers and he‚Äôll beam with pride. Praising him behind closed doors is important, of course, but bragging on your man in front of his buddies or coworkers is next-level! It‚Äôs a major confidence booster and lets him know that you‚Äôre truly crazy about him‚Äîand you want everyone within earshot to know it. When you‚Äôre hanging out with his buddies, you might say, \"Patrick has the best sense of style. He‚Äôs the most well-dressed man I know. All my friends agree and think it‚Äôs super hot. You guys might want to step up your game!\" If you‚Äôre chatting with his coworkers at a company gathering, you could say, \"Michael showed me the team project you've been working on and I was blown away. I‚Äôm so proud of him! He always says he can‚Äôt do it without his awesome team by his side.\""

      "content": "Your encouragement makes him want to be his best self. When he shares a goal or talks about his passion project, tell him you have zero doubts he can achieve whatever he puts his mind to. Asking questions and taking an interest can be a big boost, too. Be sure to stress that you have his back no matter what and ask what you can do to help. [3] X Research source You might say: \"I love that you‚Äôre prioritizing fitness in your life.

Be sure to put in effort when you‚Äôre having sex and make sure he knows you‚Äôre having a good time. And if you aren't in the mood occasionally, that‚Äôs normal and perfectly fine! Don't force it. You can be intimate in other ways. [4] X Research source Here are a few ideas: Flirt with your guy. Give him a sultry look when you pass him in the hall, give him a wink, and touch him on the arm as he tells you about his day. Get in some cuddle time. Yes, guys like to snuggle, too! Affection like kisses, hugs, and hand-holding are great ways to foster intimacy and closeness.

      "content": "He needs to know that it's okay to be vulnerable around you. Traditionally, men have been encouraged to stifle their emotions, which is very unhealthy. Deep down, your guy wants a partner who nurtures and respects all parts of him, and that includes his emotions. If you encourage him to open up and support him when emotions are running high, he‚Äôll know that you really love all of him. [6] X Research source For example, if he's grieving a family member, remind him that it‚Äôs okay to cry. Reassure him that you‚Äôre here for him and would never judge him. He needs a shoulder to cry on (literally), so offer it up freely to him."

      "content": "Make an effort to think it through before speaking harsh words. It‚Äôs easy to criticize and be condescending in the heat of the moment, especially if you‚Äôre really upset about something. Everyone does this on occasion. But before saying something negative, take a step back and ask yourself: do I really need to say this? Is this constructive, or am I just angry? You've done a lot of work to boost your man‚Äôs ego at this point, and unnecessary criticism can undo all of your work in the blink of an eye."
