      "title": "Choose/prepare your clay pot.",
      "content": "Choose/prepare your clay pot. Identify the pot you’d like to use and make sure its cleaned and ready to receive the glass tiles. Wash the inside and outside of the pot using warm water and soap. Use a clean washrag to scrub the pot (even if you purchase a new pot) and then rinse with warm water. Allow the pot to dry in the sun before adding tiles. You’ll want to make sure all the moisture is gone so that your tiles adhere to the pot."

      "title": "Select your tile.",
      "content": "Select your tile. Tile selection is extremely important as it will create the look and feel of your mosaic clay pot. Choose tile that is sturdy but can be broken down into smaller pieces. You may want to browse a variety of tile at the local hardware or tile store for the best selection. Consider accent pieces for your project. Don’t go with just one or two colored tiles but instead look for a variety of colors and textures to add interest to your piece. Consider adding a bright splash of color or sparkle (such as purchasing a glittery bronzed tile) in the middle of your pot for that extra “pop.” Ask if tile can be broken down when in doubt. If you are unsure if you can break tile down into smaller pieces ask an employee if anyone has used that particular tile to create mosaic artwork. Not all tile works well in a mosaic so ask an expert if you are unsure. Visualize how the particular tile will work on the pot. You may want to draw a map or design sketch before you break the tile so you know how you’d like the flower pot to look in the end."

      "title": "Create your mosaic tile.",
      "content": "Create your mosaic tile. You will need work gloves, protective eyewear, a small hammer, a clear workspace and a heavy cloth or towel. Lay tile on a flat surface and place towel or heavy cloth over the tile. This way you will have something to keep tile in one area when you break it. Gently tap the tile with your hammer until you feel pieces breaking. Don’t smash the tile as it may disintegrate. Remove tile to reveal what you’ve broken. Use a nipper to re-shape pieces if necessary or to complete the breaking process (for tile that may not have broken all the way)."

      "title": "Prepare the mortar in order to adhere the tile to the flower pot.",
      "content": "Prepare the mortar in order to adhere the tile to the flower pot. You’ll want to pick up polymer-fortified, thin-set mortar for best results. Add water to mortar powder until it becomes the same consistency as peanut butter. Mix constantly so that the powder is fully integrated into the mixture. Use mortar immediately so that it does not dry or change consistency over time. Only prepare the mortar when you are ready to create your mosaic design."

      "content": "Create your mosaic design by spreading a thin layer of mortar on the back of each tile piece and affixing the piece to the flower pot. Refer to your map or sketch if you created one before you started the project. Press the piece of tile firmly against the flower pot and hold for several seconds or until you know it has adhered to the pot. Leave ¼ inch space between pieces of tile to make room for the grout. Go back and re-size tile if pieces are too large or are not fitting properly. Add any other design elements such as stones or beads to generate additional interest. You don’t have to add other elements but if do, now is the time to integrate them into your design. Complete the design and then allow the pot to set and dry overnight. The mortar will need up to 24 hours to fully set and dry so leave the pot in a cool, dry area until its fully set."

      "content": "Make the grout once the mortar is completely set. If you’d like to add interest to the grey grout, mix with acrylic paint to create colored grout. You’ll need your work gloves for this project as you’ll be placing the grout on your pot with your hands. Combine water to the grout to create a mixture of peanut butter consistency. You’ll want the general same type of consistency you achieved with the mortar. Scoop a handful of grout and slather it all over the pot. Be sure you take care to fill in every section between the tiles. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe excess grout from the pot, taking extra care to remove grout that was smoothed over tile/stones. Take a thin wire brush and brush over the entire pot when you’ve finished grouting to ensure all excess grout falls off the tiles. Go over the pot with a clean cloth to remove brush marks."
