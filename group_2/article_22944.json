      "title": "A Virgo’s indifference can get the best of them.",
      "content": "A Virgo’s indifference can get the best of them. They have trouble expressing their emotions, and they may pretend you ignoring them doesn’t bother them. A Virgo would rather pretend conflict isn’t there then face it. [3] X Research source Try opening up with them instead of ignoring them. This may help them open up too. Do they cross their arms when they’re around you, or actually shrug their shoulders? They may be closing themselves off.

Ignoring a Virgo could backfire because they simply may not care. [6] X Research source They’ll reach out to you in their own time, not because you ignored them, but because they’ve finished whatever they were doing.

So caught up in their projects and busy schedules, they may not realize you’re ignoring them. But when they do, their response may be to just do the same, as long as they can avoid their emotions.

In the end, no harm can come from being honest."
