      "content": "Dress to Impress. You don’t have to be in a ball gown all the time, but do put some thought and effort into what you wear. Impress him with cool, flattering outfits even when you’re just lounging around at home. Wear his favorite colors or his favorite fragrance to catch both his eye and nose. If you know he’s a sucker for a particular outfit in your closet, be sure to wear it on your next big night out. If you know he has a favorite band or sports team, casually work a jersey or band t-shirt into your everyday wardrobe. You'll catch his attention for sure, and seem like someone who shares his tastes."

Even if you’re not really into some of the things your boyfriend is into, try to at least show some interest in the type of music, movies, books, sports, or other things that he cares about. It'll give you something to talk about and bond over when together. [5] X Research source Get up to speed by reading the same books or listening to the same bands. Ask him to pick your next movie or concert outing rather than preferring your own. If your boyfriend is big on sports, try to stay current with his favorite team and known when they are playing. You can score some big impression point by offering to turn on the game without him even having to bring it up himself. Knowing which sports or hobbies he’s into is also a big help for gift ideas. Impress him with a little gift themed around his favorite pastime or biggest passion. Pay attention to what songs he likes and make him a mixed CD or playlist around all of his favorites. [6] X Research source Throw a couple of new songs in there too, that are similar to his favorites. You’ll impress him doubly for your attention to his tastes, and for your audiophile knowledge."

Show your boyfriend that you can appreciate, respect, and even like his friends, even if they are not your friends. [7] X Research source If you’re all out together, offer to pick up the first round of drinks for your BF's friends, or offer to have them over for a party at your place. Laugh at their jokes, talk about their hobbies, anything that shows his friends you dig them. They'll dig you back and your boyfriend will be much more impressed and into you if you get the thumbs-up from his bros. Remember, your boyfriend wants his friends to like you, but to fall in love with you. If any of his friends start to get a bit flirty, keep your distance. Be open and accepting of any opposite-sex friends that your boyfriend might have. Being overly jealous of his platonic friends will make him untrusted. You’ll impress him more by being supportive of his friendships rather than suspicious of them."
