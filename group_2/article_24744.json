      "content": "Use wire covers and sheaths. Wire covers and sheaths obscure your cords and chargers with tubing, which prevents your cat from having easy access. All you have to do is wrap the cover around the cord to provide easy, cat-proof coverage. If you have a pretty massive cord setup, a cord reel might help with this."

      "content": "Apply double-sided tape to the wires. Cats aren’t known to love the feeling of sticky tape, and may avoid surfaces that are covered in it. Wrapping up an entire length of cord in double-sided tape may help prevent your cat from sinking their teeth into it again. Duct tape can also be an effective way to cover up your cords.

Give your wires a good spray-down to help your kitty get the message. [3] X Research source You can also use a product like Chewsafe Cord Cover , a safe but foul-tasting clear cover for your cables. Dish soap is another possible option—just make sure to add more periodically. Steer clear of using substances like garlic to coat your wires, which is poisonous to cats.

      "content": "Remove unnecessary electronics from your space. Take a look at all the cords, chargers, and their respective electronics in your living space. Do you use all of these devices regularly, or can some of them (and their wires) be put away? Clearing away some cords will definitely stop your cat from chewing them. For instance, you might retire your old VHS player, or a lamp that you barely use."

      "content": "Block off the wires so your cat can’t get to them. See if there are any clever ways you can totally hide your cords so your cat doesn’t have easy access. For example, you might plug your TV into an outlet behind the dresser it’s perched on, rather than using an extension cord. [5] X Research source Cord cover kits can be an effective way to hide and block away cords from your cats."

      "content": "Tape all dangling cords down so that they don't dangle. It's the dangling that often attracts the cat; once taped firmly to a table leg or wall, the cord blends in and ceases to provide the same attraction. You can also purchase Velcro attachments or special cord clips to keep cords attached flatly to another item."
