      "content": "Preheat the oven to 250 °F (121 °C) and get out a rimmed baking sheet. Set 1 to 2 rimmed baking sheets on your work surface. It's important to use a rimmed sheet so the breadcrumbs won't slide off of the sheet when you put them in and take them out of the oven. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut a crustless loaf of bread into 3 to 4 strips. If you don't have crustless bread, use a sharp serrated knife to trim off and discard the crusts. Place your crustless bread on a cutting board, cut it into slices, and cut each slice into 3 to 4 strips. You can cut them lengthwise or horizontally. [2] X Research source While white panko is traditionally made with crustless bread, you can leave the crust on to create tan panko."

      "content": "Shred the bread in a food processor to make large flakes. Put the shredding disc on your food processor and turn the machine on. Slowly put the strips of crustless bread into the machine. This should make big flakes of breadcrumbs. [3] X Research source If you don't have a food processor, grate the bread against the coarse side of a box grater or pulse it 1 to 2 times in a blender."

      "content": "Spread the breadcrumbs on the rimmed baking sheet. If it looks as though the breadcrumbs will be more than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick on 1 sheet, divide them between 2 sheets. [4] X Research source Keeping the breadcrumbs in an even layer will ensure that the panko becomes crispy as it bakes."

      "content": "Bake the panko breadcrumbs for 20 to 30 minutes. Put the rimmed baking sheet in the preheated oven and cook it until the panko becomes crispy. Use a spoon or spatula to stir the breadcrumbs every 5 minutes as they bake. [5] X Research source Stirring the panko frequently will prevent it from browning. The panko should become crunchy, but remain pale in color."

      "title": "Cool the panko breadcrumbs.",
      "content": "Cool the panko breadcrumbs. Remove the rimmed baking sheet from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Let the panko cool completely before you use it or store it. If you store the panko before it's finished cooling, the moisture in the breadcrumbs will cause them to spoil faster. [6] X Research source It will probably take at least 1 hour for the breadcrumbs to cool. They'll continue to dry as they cool."

      "content": "Keep the panko in a container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. Put the cooled panko breadcrumbs into a storage container with a lid. Store the container in the pantry and use the breadcrumbs within 2 weeks. [7] X Research source If you prefer, freeze the panko breadcrumbs for up to 2 months. There's no need to thaw panko breadcrumbs when you are ready to use them."

The panko will brown and become crispy as it bakes. Try topping scalloped potatoes, tuna noodle casserole, or cauliflower gratin.

Substitute panko breadcrumbs for standard breadcrumbs in any recipe that calls for coating food before frying, baking or sautéing. For example, make fried fish, pork chops, chicken cutlets, or onion rings with panko. [9] X Research source You can also use panko breadcrumbs in any recipe that calls for breadcrumbs in stuffing. For example, stuff mushrooms with a flavored panko mixture before baking them."

Use an equal amount of panko breadcrumbs to act as a binder. They won't change the flavor of the meal, but they'll bind the mixture together. [10] X Research source Use panko breadcrumbs in any recipe that calls for breadcrumbs to bind ingredients. For example, mix panko into crab cakes before forming them into patties."

Instead of dipping your favorite appetizers in beaten eggs and coating them with breadcrumbs, use panko breadcrumbs for an extra-crispy exterior. The panko will also stay crispy longer than standard breadcrumbs.
