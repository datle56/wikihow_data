      "content": "Add some glitter and food coloring, if desired. How much you use is completely up to you, but 10 to 15 drops of food coloring and 1 tablespoon (15 g) of glitter is a good place to start if you’re unsure. Be sure to stir these into the glue really well, so that everything is completely combined and the color is evenly distributed. [2] X Research source If you use colored glitter glue, you usually won't need to add food coloring. You can still add more glitter for some extra sparkle, though! If you don't have food coloring, use 10 to 15 drops of liquid watercolor instead."

The glue will start to thicken, but it won't be slimy just yet. [3] X Research source You can usually find liquid starch in the laundry aisle of a grocery store. This is the magical ingredient that turns glue into slime!"

      "content": "Knead the slime until it firms up, or set it aside for 3 minutes. Take the slime out of the bowl and knead it with your hands until it reaches the perfect slimy consistency. This can take up to 5 minutes, so be patient! Alternatively, you can also let the slime sit and firm up in its bowl for 3 minutes. [4] X Research source If kneading doesn’t work enough on its own, try both! Knead the slime for a couple of minutes, then let it rest and firm up for an additional 3 minutes."

      "content": "Store the slime in an airtight container when you aren't playing with it. This step is very important! If you don't store your slime in a closed container, the slime will dry out. When it’s stored properly, your slime should last at least several weeks, but it could even last up to a few months. [5] X Research source A plastic tupperware container works super well, but make sure that it's clean first. A plastic, zippered bag will also work in a pinch!"

Stir them together with a spoon until the texture is even. You can use white school glue or clear school glue, whichever you prefer! [6] X Research source White school glue will give you a more opaque slime, while clear school glue will give you translucent slime. Glitter school glue is another great option if you want something fancy!"

You can use one or the other, or go all-out and use both. You can even combine different food coloring colors to create your own special blend. Just be sure to stir them into the glue super well, so everything gets fully combined. If you use white school glue, the mixture will usually end up pastel-colored. No food coloring? No problem. Try liquid watercolor instead! You can use up to 15 drops."

Add 1/4 teaspoon (2.2 g) of Borax , then stir the mixture together with a clean spoon. [7] X Research source You can get Borax in the laundry aisle of a grocery store.

Keep kneading until it reaches the right slimy consistency and is no longer stringy. This usually takes up to 5 minutes. [9] X Research source The Borax is what activates the slime, but the kneading is where the real magic happens! Keep in mind, the more you knead the slime, the firmer it will become. So if your slime is still too sticky or loose, try kneading it a bit more."

If you’re having trouble transferring the shaving cream from the measuring cup to the bowl, try using a rubber spatula to scoop it out. [11] X Research source Measure the shaving cream out by volume, even if you are on the metric system. Use a 240-mL cup to do so. Make sure that you are using shaving cream and not shaving gel! This will affect the slime’s consistency. Keep in mind that it’s usually easier to add color to men’s shaving cream because it’s pure white. Women’s shaving cream can be harder to color because it often comes already tinted."

You’ll do that when you add the glue. If you want, you can also add glitter, but it won’t show up as well as it does in other types of slime. It’s completely up to you, though!"

[20] X Research source For a stickier, oozier slime, try 1/2 tablespoon (7.5 mL) of saline solution instead. Avoid using more than 1 tbsp (15 mL) of saline solution, even if the slime feels too sticky. Too much saline solution can cause the slime to turn out too firm.
