      "title": "Consume more fermented foods.",
      "content": "Consume more fermented foods. Eating fermented foods like sauerkraut and pickles can help increase orexin production. Fermented foods contain lactic acid, and the production of lactic acid can block glucose production, which decreases orexin production. So eating more fermented foods can actually help increase orexin production. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Eat less sugar and carbs.",
      "content": "Eat less sugar and carbs. When you eat sugar and carbs, your body converts them into glucose. Research suggests that increased glucose levels actually prevent the production of orexin. By eating less sugar and carbs you give your body the chance to produce more orexin, which can potentially increase your energy or promote weight loss. [2] X Research source You can reduce your carb intake by staying away from starchy foods like potatoes and carrots, as well as bread and pasta. [3] X Research source Stay away from foods that are high in sugar. A lot of processed foods have added sugar, so make sure you check the nutrition facts. Fruit also has a bit of naturally occurring sugar, so you should cut back on those, too."

      "content": "Try intermittent fasting to increase your orexin levels. Intermittent fasting during the day can actually make your body producing more orexin. Start fasting for 16-20 hours per day. Then, at the end of each day, eat a large nutritious meal. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If intermittent fasting makes you feel worse, go back to your normal eating schedule and look for other dietary changes you can make to increase your orexin levels."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor about taking medication. If your doctor determines your orexin levels are low, they may prescribe certain medications to help your body increase its production of orexin. [5] X Research source If your orexin levels are low because of narcolepsy, your doctor might prescribe 400 mg modafinil per day. Follow your doctor's instructions exactly, because modafinil is a controlled substance and overdosing is easy. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your doctor may also prescribe Orexin-A to help increase your orexin levels. How the drug is administered will depend on your levels, but it will likely be through the nose or in the form of an injection your doctor will give you in the office. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider other potential ways to increase orexin levels.",
      "content": "Consider other potential ways to increase orexin levels. Taking omega 3 supplements might help increase orexin levels in people who don't have narcolepsy. You can also try Lactobacillus probiotics, which can increase the production of lactic acid in your body and therefore may increase your orexin levels. [8] X Research source You can find medically uncertain or unproven ways to increase orexin levels all over the internet. Most are harmless, but may also be unhelpful. It's always best to consult your doctor first. If you're considering taking omega 3 supplements, talk to your doctor. They can tell you what dosage you should take."

One of the easiest ways to increase the acidification of your blood is to exercise! Getting 30 minutes of exercise each day is good for your overall health and can also increase orexin levels. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Interval training is a great way to increase orexin in your blood. If you can't commit to interval training, that's okay! As long as you exercise for 30 minutes every day, your orexin levels should increase."

      "title": "Lose weight.",
      "content": "Lose weight. Leptin is a protein that can inhibit the production of orexin. Since leptin comes from fatty tissue in your body, losing weight can decrease the amount of leptin your body produces. Talk to your doctor about the healthiest way for you to lose weight. They can tell you how many calories you should be consuming each day and what sort of exercise is best. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A good way to begin losing weight is through portion control. Instead of eating 2 or 3 helpings of each part of your meal, stick to 1 or 2. A nutritionist can also help you figure out what each portion should look like."
