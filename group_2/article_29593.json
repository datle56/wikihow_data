      "content": "Get two small mirrors that are the same size and fit inside a milk carton. Use any 2 flat mirrors, whether the frame is rectangular, round, or some other shape. The 2 mirrors don't even have to be the same shape, but they do need to be small enough to fit into a milk carton and roughly the same size. [1] X Research source You may be able to find small mirrors at a craft or art supply store. You can make small mirrors out of an old CD or DVD, but wear gloves and eye protection to protect yourself from splinters, and work under adult supervision. Heat the CD first with a hair dryer to make it less brittle, then score lightly and repeatedly with a craft knife until it is cut into the shape you want."

      "content": "Cut the tops off two clean milk cartons. Find two empty milk cartons, each at least one quart (one liter) in size and wide enough to fit your mirrors. Cut off and discard the triangular top of each one, then wash the inside thoroughly to get rid of smells. [2] X Research source A long, sturdy cardboard tube could also work. You could use a large, flat sheet of sturdy cardboard instead. Lightly score it with a craft knife to divide it into four sections, then fold it into a box and tape together. You can use two sturdy paper boxes or shipping paper for these types of crafts, says sustainability specialist Natalie Kay Smith. Smith also recommends sticking several layers of recycled toilet paper together to make a sturdy base."

      "title": "Tape the two cartons together.",
      "content": "Tape the two cartons together. Use packing tape or another strong tape to tape the open ends of the cartons together, making one long box. To fasten the cartons together more securely, try taping the inside of the box together on one side, then taping all four outside surfaces. You can tape two tubes or two homemade cardboard cartons together in the same way, to make a longer periscope. However, the longer the periscope is, the smaller the image will be."

      "title": "Cut a hole on one side just big enough for a mirror.",
      "content": "Cut a hole on one side just big enough for a mirror. Place one of the mirrors on one of the vertical sides of the milk carton, about ¼ of an inch (6 mm) from the end. [3] X Research source Trace the mirror with a pencil, then cut on the pencil marks to create a hole. A craft knife may be the easiest tool for cutting the hole, but should only be used with adult supervision, as it is very sharp. If you are using a cardboard tube instead of a milk carton, flatten it slightly so you can trace the mirror."

      "title": "Insert a mirror facing the hole at a 45º angle.",
      "content": "Insert a mirror facing the hole at a 45º angle. Use sticky putty or double-sided tape to attach the mirror you traced onto the inside wall of the carton, across from the hole you cut. Arrange the mirror so the whole surface can be seen when you look through the hole, but have it point downward toward the opposite end of the carton at a 45º angle. [4] X Research source To test whether it's at a 45º angle, use a ruler to measure the distance from the closest corner of the carton to where the lower edge of the mirror touches the carton's side. Then measure the distance from the same corner to the opposite end of the mirror, where it touches the carton's top. The two distances will be the same if the mirror is angled at 45º. Don't use glue yet, since you might need to make adjustments to the mirror's position."

      "content": "Cut a hole at the other end, facing the opposite direction. To find out where to cut, place the carton in front of you on its short end, with the first hole you cut near the top. Rotate the carton so that the hole is on the opposite side. The second hole will go on the side that is now facing you, right at the bottom of this side. Trace the second mirror and cut as you did before. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert the second mirror facing the second hole.",
      "content": "Insert the second mirror facing the second hole. Just like the first mirror, this should be visible from the hole, and should face the other end of the carton at a 45º angle. At this angle, one mirror will reflect light directly down through the periscope, and the second will reflect it directly through the hole and into your eye. You will see this reflected light as an image of whatever is on the opposite hole of your periscope."

      "content": "Look into one hole and adjust. Do you see a clear image when you look through one of the holes? If it’s blurry or you only see the inside of the periscope, adjust the position of the mirrors. Once both of them are at 45º angles, you should be able to see through the periscope clearly.

      "title": "Attach the mirrors permanently.",
      "content": "Attach the mirrors permanently. If putty or tape isn't enough to keep the mirrors steady, attach them with glue. Once they're permanently stuck in the right position, you can use your periscope to spy on people, or see over the top of a crowd. If too much light is coming through the \"eye\" end of your periscope, making it difficult to see the reflection, tape black construction paper over the outside edges of the hole."

      "content": "Use 1-2 pieces of PVC pipe to make your periscope. Try to find a piece somewhere between 12 inches (30.5 cm) and 20 inches (50.8 cm), but be aware that the longer the pipe is, the smaller the image will be. You may also use two sections of slightly different sizes, so one fits snugly into the other. This lets you rotate the top of your periscope while using it to keep a lookout all around you. You can find PVC pipe at a hardware store or home improvement store."

Find or use a scoring tool to cut 2 mirrors that are 2 ⅜ inches (3.5 cm) wide x 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.

Flip the periscope and attach the second board on the back. [13] X Research source Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) finishing nails to secure the front board to the side boards. Don’t attach the mirror blocks to the side or front boards yet. You’ll need to be able to move them to make adjustments before gluing them into place. The front and back boards are shorter than the side boards to leave a space for you to see the mirrors on each end. Allow the glue to dry overnight. [14] X Research source"

Smear carpenter’s glue on the sides of the blocks and slip them back into position. Pick up the periscope and look through the end. Adjust the mirrors up and down until you have a clear line of sight while looking into the periscope. You may need to place clamps on the sides of the periscope to hold the block in place as you make your adjustments. You’ll have a clear line of sight when you can see a full rectangular view in the mirror."

      "title": "A periscope works by reflecting light at angles.",
      "content": "A periscope works by reflecting light at angles. When the light from an object hits a mirror set at a 45° angle, it bounces off the mirror and travels down the body of the periscope. When it hits a second mirror also set at a 45° angle, it bounces off in the direction of your eye. [15] X Research source The law of reflection says that the angle of a ray of light will bounce off a smooth reflective surface at the same angle in a perpendicular direction. [16] X Research source"

Marié-Davy was a French scientist whose periscope was a vertical tube with small mirrors fixed at each end at 45°. Sir Howard Grubb, an Irish optical engineer, perfected the periscope for use by the British Navy for submarines in WWI. [17] X Research source Thomas H. Doughty of the US Navy invented a prism periscope to use in the American Civil War from 1861–1865."
