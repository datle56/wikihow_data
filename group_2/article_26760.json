      "title": "Take strategic notes in class.",
      "content": "Take strategic notes in class. Don’t worry about writing down everything your teacher says—that would take too much time and not be super helpful when it comes time to study. Instead, write down key phrases, definitions, and points that your teacher brings up. If your teacher emphasizes something while they’re talking, writes it on the board, or brings it up multiple times, that’s a good sign that you should write it down in your notes. [1] X Research source Try out different note-taking methods to find the one that works best for you. For example, you can try the Cornell note-taking method, where you write all of your notes on the right side of your page, any questions you have on the left side, and a summary of that day’s lesson on the bottom of the page. Consider color-coding your notes with different highlighters so they’re easier to read through when you’re studying. You could highlight key terms one color, important events and dates another color, and so on."

      "title": "Participate during all of your classes.",
      "content": "Participate during all of your classes. For certain classes, class participation might make up a percentage of your grade. Even if it doesn’t, participating in class can help you better remember the material, and it will show your teacher that you’re serious about doing a good job. If your teacher asks questions or opens the floor to a class discussion, don’t be afraid to jump in and share your perspective. [2] X Research source If you’re worried you won’t have anything to say out loud during class, come prepared with a few notes from the previous night’s reading or homework. That way, you’ll have a few talking points ready to go."

      "title": "Ask questions during and after class if you’re ever confused.",
      "content": "Ask questions during and after class if you’re ever confused. Asking questions and admitting you don’t understand something can be a little intimidating, but it’s super important if you want to get good grades in all of your classes. Otherwise, if you don’t clear up your confusion, it could come back to hurt you later on when you’re taking a test. Ask your teacher a question if something they’re explaining in class doesn’t make sense to you, or wait until after class and ask if that’s easier. If you have a question about something, there’s a good chance that other students in your class are wondering the same thing. You’ll be doing everyone a favor by asking your teacher."

      "title": "Develop good relationships with your teachers.",
      "content": "Develop good relationships with your teachers. Always be polite and friendly when you’re interacting with your teachers. Avoid chatting or texting in class, and try not to break any of the other rules. Your teachers are there to help you, and the better a relationship you have with them, the easier it will be for you to succeed and get good grades. [3] X Research source Doing your homework on time, participating in class, and asking for help when you need it will all help you develop a better relationship with your teachers."

      "content": "Find a quiet and comfortable space to study in. Choose a space that’s free of distractions, like your bedroom or the library. Make sure you have a desk and comfortable chair to work at, along with any study supplies you might need, like highlighters, pens, and a computer. You’ll be doing a lot of studying throughout high school, so you want an inviting space where you can hunker down and focus. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Study regularly instead of cramming at the last minute. Everyone is different, so it might take some trial and error to find a study schedule that feels right. In general though, set aside some time after school each day to study instead of saving all your studying for the last couple of nights before an exam. Cramming your studying into one or two nights will make it harder to actually learn the material, and you’ll just feel more stressed. [5] X Research source For example, you could spend 15 to 30 minutes after school each day reviewing the material from all of your classes. Or, you could dedicate 1 to 2 hours per week to reviewing everything you learned that week. Studying routinely instead of only when you have a test coming up will make it easier to memorize what you’re learning, and you’ll be much more prepared when a test rolls around.

We asked 316 wikiHow readers to tell us their best tip for tests and exams, and 59% of them agreed that you should start with easy questions and skip difficult ones before returning to them later.

      "title": "Identify your learning style",
      "content": "Identify your learning style so you know the best way to study. There are 4 main learning styles: visual, auditory, linguistic, and kinesthetic. Visual learners learn best using things like images, graphs, and maps. Auditory learners learn best by listening and talking to people. Linguistic learners prefer reading and note taking to help them learn things. Kinesthetic learners like to learn by doing activities and trying things for themselves. If you know which one or two learning styles you prefer, you can use that to make your study sessions more effective. [6] X Research source If you’re a visual learner, color code your notes so they’re easier to study and draw pictures, figures, and diagrams while you’re studying to help you memorize the material. If you’re an auditory learner, try reciting mnemonics and rhymes out loud to help you memorize things. You can also read your notes aloud and ask someone else to quiz you on what you’re studying. If you’re a linguistic learner, reread chapters from your textbook and take notes on them as you’re studying. If you’re a kinesthetic learner, try doing activities related to the material you’re studying, like making flashcards or coming up with a game."

      "content": "Take regular breaks while you’re studying. Study breaks can help your brain recharge and prevent you from getting burnt out. It might feel like taking a break to do something relaxing is a waste of valuable study time, but studying for too long can actually make it harder to concentrate, and your brain won’t retain as much information.

      "content": "Keep track of all your homework in a planner. Keep the planner in your school bag. Then, whenever you get homework, write it down right away in your planner so you don’t forget about it. Keeping track of what homework you have and when it’s due will help you stay organized and prevent you from missing important assignments that can impact your grades. [8] X Research source Everyone forgets about assignments sometimes. It happens! Having a planner is a good backup in case you do forget. If you do end up missing homework for some reason, talk to your teacher about it. Tell them you know you messed up, and ask if you can turn it in late. You might not get full credit, but they still might give you some points, which is better than not turning anything in at all."

      "title": "Do your homework right after school every day.",
      "content": "Do your homework right after school every day. It might be the last thing you want to do after a long day at school, but that way you won’t forget about it or procrastinate too long. Plus, if you have any questions or get confused by something, you’ll have more time to ask for help and figure out a solution. [9] X Research source If you do your homework right after school, you’ll have the whole rest of the evening to just relax. On the other hand, if you keep putting it off until later at night, it will just be weighing on your mind all evening."

      "content": "Plan ahead for bigger assignments. If you have a major project, paper, or other assignment that’s coming up, schedule plenty of time to work on it so you don’t end up scrambling to finish at the last minute. You can even start earlier than you need to and just get it over with so it’s one less thing on your plate. Write the due date for the assignment in your planner, and then write reminders on the days in between now and then so you don’t forget about it. For example, if you have a research paper due in 6 weeks, don’t wait until the last week before it’s due to get started. Instead, start brainstorming and researching right away. The more time you give yourself, the less stressed you’ll feel and the better work you’ll produce."

      "content": "Ask for help if you ever feel stuck on your homework. Turning in incomplete or wrong homework can negatively affect your grade, and it can put you behind for the following day’s class. Instead of risking it, ask your parents or a friend in your class for some advice if you feel stuck. You can also meet with your teacher before class if you have time and let them know that you’re struggling. That way, you’ll clear up any confusion, get a better grade on your assignment, and be more prepared for the classroom discussion and future test. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Get 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night.",
      "content": "Get 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night. The temptation to stay up late on school nights is real, but not getting enough sleep can actually impact your grades and make you feel stressed. If you’re tired in class, you won’t be able to focus and take good notes. If you can’t focus or take good notes, you won’t learn the material, and you’ll have a harder time studying for tests. It’s not always easy, but try your best to go to sleep early and at the same time every night so you feel rested and alert in class. [11] X Research source Avoid eating, exercising, or drinking caffeine before bed since it will make it harder to fall asleep. Try to avoid looking at screens for 1 hour before you go to bed. The light from screens can make your body feel more awake and interfere with your sleep cycle. Instead, try reading a book, taking a bath, or drawing in a sketchbook before bed."
