      "title": "Part your hair in the middle",
      "content": "Part your hair in the middle to give the illusion of having long hair. Use a comb to divide your hair into 2 equal sections down the middle of your head. Although a center parting can elongate your face, it will also make your hair appear longer than if you are using a side parting. [1] X Research source While side partings add volume to your hair, this is done by adding width, which takes away from the length of your hair. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a double ponytail",
      "content": "Try a double ponytail to add length and to keep your hair secured. Split your hair into halves from the top of your ears using a fine tooth comb. Tie the top half of your hair into a medium-high ponytail and then gather the bottom half of your hair, securing this into a ponytail just below the first. The 2 ponytails will blend into 1 to create a seamless look. [3] X Research source Tying your hair into a regular ponytail can make it look shorter than it actually is."

      "title": "Tie your hair into a donut to disguise the length.",
      "content": "Tie your hair into a donut to disguise the length. Tie your hair into a ponytail with a hair tie and place the donut form over the hair tie. Then bring the donut form to the end of your ponytail and wrap the tips of your hair evenly over the donut shape. Roll your ponytail into the donut form to create a bun that sits flat on your head. Use bobby pins to hold it in place. [4] X Research source When all of your hair is tied up, it is difficult to tell how long it really is. This illusion is perfect for helping shorter hair to appear long. Use a donut form or a sock to create this voluminous bun. Alternatively, a regular bun works well too."

      "title": "Choose clothes that make your neck look shorter to add the illusion of length.",
      "content": "Choose clothes that make your neck look shorter to add the illusion of length. Scarves cover your neck, which means that they are great for making your hair look longer than it really is. Similarly, choose tops and dresses that have a round neckline; these also make your neck appear shorter. [5] X Research source Tops and dresses with round necklines, alongside scarves, help to break up your neck area which in turn makes your hair appear to reach longer at the front."

    {
      "title": "Use hair extensions",
      "content": "Use hair extensions to add length to your natural hair. If you are wanting to add extra length to your hair regularly, hair extensions are a great way to do so. You can apply hair extensions to your hair either at home or at a salon. [6] X Research source Hair extensions also give you the added bonus of experimenting with different hair colors. Clip-in hair extensions work especially well because they can be very quickly placed and removed depending on what length you want to try out."

      "title": "Straighten your hair",
      "content": "Straighten your hair to make it look long and sleek. Use either a flat iron or a blow dryer to straighten your hair. Brush your hair with a boar bristle or paddle brush to stretch it out as you straighten it. Try to straighten your hair in sections so that you can concentrate on one part at a time. [7] X Research source Your hair will always look longer when it is straight compared to when it is wavy or curly. [8] X Research source Add a shine serum to your hair after you have straightened it to help it look even longer. This is because shine serum reduces frizz and makes your hair sleeker.

      "title": "Add strategic volume",
      "content": "Add strategic volume to your roots to take weight away from the midshaft. Use volumizing products such as shampoo, conditioner, or mousse to lightly add volume to your hair at the roots. This reduces the weight in the midshaft of your hair and creates a leaner look for your locks. [10] X Research source Although volumizing products can help your hair to appear longer, use these sparingly and avoid weighing your hair down with too much product. This is because using too much product in your hair will make it look too controlled and unnatural."

      "content": "Do a half up top knot to emphasize the bottom layer. Separate the top section of your hair on the crown of your head and tie it up into a ponytail. Then tightly twist your hair around the base of the ponytail and secure the top knot with bobby pins. The length of the bottom layer is emphasized and this hairstyle only takes a few seconds to do.

      "title": "Wear a shirt that is a contrasting color to your hair.",
      "content": "Wear a shirt that is a contrasting color to your hair. Shirts and tops that are either the same or very similar in color to your hair can make your hair blend in. This creates the illusion that your hair is shorter than it really is. Pick tops that are bright and contrasting to your hair, as these will outline your hair and emphasize your true length.

      "title": "Choose an ombre style to highlight the length of your hair.",
      "content": "Choose an ombre style to highlight the length of your hair. Decide where you would like the ombre to start and bleach this section of your hair. Then use the hair dye brush to apply the color according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wash the dye out after the allocated time. [13] X Research source A traditional ombre lightens your hair to make the ends highlighted and longer-looking. You can either do ombre yourself at home or get it done professionally at a salon."

      "title": "Get tapered layers",
      "content": "Get tapered layers to emphasize the length of your hair. Although it may sound counter-intuitive, getting your hair trimmed into layers can actually make it appear longer. Avoid choppy layers, as these will make your hair look short. Instead, opt for long layers as these will make your hair look lustrous and soft. [14] X Research source Avoid getting a blunt cut as this will make your hair look shorter. [15] X Research source"
