      "content": "Place finely-ground coffee on the bottom of the French press . Remove the plunger and lid from the French Press and scoop in 1 to 2 tablespoons (5 to 10 g) of grounds for a single shot of espresso. The more grounds you use, the stronger the flavor of the coffee will be. [2] X Research source French presses can be purchased at your local kitchen supply store. Use ground espresso beans to get the fullest flavors, though any type of coffee grounds will work."

      "content": "Bloom the grounds with 0.5 fl oz (15 ml) of hot water in the press. Heat water in the microwave or over the stove until it is 200 °F (93 °C), or just below a boil. Pour the water onto the coffee grounds in the press. Blooming the coffee will release carbon dioxide and make the coffee more flavorful as it brews. Swirl the French press to mix the water with the blooms to activate the flavors. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the rest of the hot water into the press and stir it.",
      "content": "Pour the rest of the hot water into the press and stir it. The amount of water added will depend on how much espresso you want to add. Add another 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL) of water to make a single shot of espresso. Swirl the French press thoroughly so the grounds mix in the water. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Let it steep for 3 to 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Let it steep for 3 to 4 minutes. Place the lid and plunger back on top of the press, making sure it’s not in contact with your brewing coffee. This helps trap the heat and will keep your coffee at the right temperature. [5] X Research source You can let the coffee steep longer if you want a more flavorful brew, but it may make your espresso taste more bitter."

    {
      "title": "Depress the plunger slowly to separate the grounds from the coffee.",
      "content": "Depress the plunger slowly to separate the grounds from the coffee. Use enough pressure to move the plunger down through the coffee. The mesh of the plunger will filter out any grounds floating in your espresso and push them to the bottom of the press. Once the plunger is at the bottom, you can serve your espresso hot by pouring it from the spout on your French press into a mug . [6] X Research source Do not force the plunger down since it could break your French press or shoot hot coffee out from the top. Add milk or thick cream to the espresso to cut down on the bitter flavor."

      "content": "Fill the bottom reservoir of the moka pot with water. Pour water into the bottom portion until it is just below the round hole located on the inside of the pot. Use at least 5 to 6 fluid ounces (150 to 180 mL) of water so it doesn’t boil off or burn your espresso. [7] X Research source Moka pots can be purchased online or at your local kitchen specialty store. They come in various sizes depending on how much coffee you plan on brewing with them. Choose a smaller size if you want to make only 1 cup or a larger size if you want to make more."

      "content": "Add grounds to the coffee chamber. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons (5 to 10 g) of grounds for every 2 fluid ounces (59 ml) of espresso you want. Don’t pack the coffee grounds too tight in the chamber or else it will be more difficult for the water to pass through it. Make sure the grounds are level with the top of the chamber to give your espresso the most flavor and caffeine. [8] X Research source Use fine grounds to make your espresso. It will take longer than coarse grounds, but more flavor will be added to the water."

Keep the pot at the edge of the burner so the handle doesn’t get too hot when you try to pick it up later. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the coffee brew for 4 to 5 minutes. Make sure the lid of the moka pot is closed while it brews so it retains heat. Once you hear a gurgling sound from your pot, take it off of the heat so you don’t have espresso with a burnt flavor. [10] X Research source As the water heats in the bottom reservoir, the pressure builds up and forces the water into the through the coffee grounds and into the top pot."

Add cream or milk to lessen the bitterness if you want, and sip it slowly to enjoy the full flavors. [11] X Research source Steam or heat the milk in order to make a latte ."
