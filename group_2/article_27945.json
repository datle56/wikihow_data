      "content": "Boil 1 cup (250 mL) of water in a pot on your stove. Measure out 1 cup (250 mL) of water and pour it into a pot, then grab a pinch of salt and toss it into the water. Set the pot on a stovetop burner and turn the heat on to high, then wait for the water to boil. [1] X Research source The ratio of water to rolled oats to make oatmeal is always 2:1, so you can easily scale this recipe up to make more servings. For example, use 1 cup (90 g) of rolled oats and 2 cups (500 mL) of water to make 2 servings. A pinch of salt is about 1/8 tsp (0.75 g) or a little less. The salt is optional, but it helps bring out the flavor of the oats when you cook them on the stovetop. You can substitute milk for some or all of the water to make your oatmeal creamier."

Stir the oats into the water and wait a few seconds until the mixture returns to a boil. [2] X Research source You can also add the oats to the water at the beginning and bring everything to a boil at once. It doesn’t really matter, but it might take a bit longer to boil initially."

      "title": "Reduce the heat to low and simmer the oatmeal for 3-5 minutes until it thickens.",
      "content": "Reduce the heat to low and simmer the oatmeal for 3-5 minutes until it thickens. Turn the burner’s heat down to low, so that there are a few bubbles in the oatmeal every second or two. Use a large spoon to stir the oatmeal occasionally for 3-5 minutes until it’s a thick, even consistency. [3] X Research source You might have to play with the heat on your specific burner to get the oatmeal to simmer perfectly. If it’s not bubbling over low heat, try turning up the heat to medium-low or medium."

      "content": "Remove the oatmeal from the heat and let it cool down for 2-3 minutes. Turn off your stove and transfer the pot to a cool burner or another safe surface. Let it rest for about 2-3 minutes, so it’s not blazing hot when you serve it. [4] X Research source You could use this time to start preparing all your tasty toppings."

Put the oatmeal in a serving bowl, sweeten it if you want and add any desired toppings, then enjoy! [5] X Research source If you scaled the ratio of oats and water up to make more than 1 serving of oatmeal, divide it accordingly among several bowls. For instance, if you doubled the recipe, divide the oatmeal evenly between 2 bowls."

Measure out the oats and the water using a measuring cup and pour the ingredients into a large microwave-safe bowl. Give the oats and water a quick stir using a spoon to mix them together. [6] X Research source You can use milk instead of water or use a mixture of milk and water for creamier oatmeal. Make sure the bowl has a capacity of at least 2 cups (500 mL), so the oatmeal doesn’t spill over the rim when it bubbles up. You can scale up this recipe by keeping the ratio of oats to water the same. For example, you can use 1 cup (90 g) of rolled oats and 2 cups (500 mL) of water to make 2 servings. Just make sure you also scale up the bowl accordingly."
