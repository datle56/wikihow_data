      "content": "Remove any existing nail polish. Take a couple cotton balls, or a washcloth and dip it into a nail polish remover. Gently wipe away the nail polish, being sure to get into the nooks and crannies. Then, wash your hands real quick, just to get rid of the smell. [1] X Expert Source Marta Nagorska Nail Artist Expert Interview. 29 July 2019. It's best to use 100% acetone. It'll smell and leave your friend's hands a little gray, but that comes off easily with soap and water (which you'll do next). 100% acetone makes the job go much, much quicker. Alternatively, you could use a dip-it tub of acetone. It's full of pink, rubbery bristles that do the job for you. Hard-to-get-off nail polish can even be gone in a couple of minutes with this kind of tub."

      "content": "Fill a tray with sudsy liquid. Take a small tray and fill it with warm water (make sure it's not too hot). Add in a gentle soap that smells good and moisturizes the skin. This will help with the acetone odor and graying effect and loosen up the dead skin on the nails and cuticles. If you'd like and have one available, consider using a scrubbing brush with the warm soap and water. This exfoliates the skin and leaves it bright and glowing. A mild face cleanser can work as your soap, too. Even a mild dish detergent can do the job."

      "title": "Soak the person's fingers.",
      "content": "Soak the person's fingers. Most manicure trays are only for one hand at a time. So while one hand is soaking, you can massage and moisturize the other. Use a scented lotion or massage oil and rub the hand for a few minutes to give the other adequate time to soak. After a few minutes, switch hands, placing the newly-moisturized hand into the tray of water. Spend a few minutes massaging the second hand, and then move onto the next step."

      "title": "Trim the person's cuticles.",
      "content": "Trim the person's cuticles. Use a special nail trimmer to trim the skin around the cuticle. But be careful – too rough and you'll cause the cuticle to bleed. You could also use a cuticle remover gel. This is a liquid that should just be left on the skin for a few seconds. It eats away at the dead skin, making it easier to come off. It's good for callouses, too. Be sure to time this right. You don't want to go so fast that you cut their skin and cause injury, but you don't want to go slow the other hand starts wrinkling. After a few minutes you may wish to take the other hand out of the water, pat it dry, and go back to finishing the first hand."

This will make the nails appear longer and cleaner. Make sure all the loose skin is removed and give both hands a once-over. Some people like to moisturize the cuticles after this stage.

Be sure to file in one direction to keep the nail as strong as possible. [4] X Research source Be sure to take your time; get too hasty and you'll end up making it shorter than intended – and then you'll have to shorten the rest, too. An emery board (a nail file) with a grit of 240 is a good place to start if you're unsure."

      "title": "Apply a base coat.",
      "content": "Apply a base coat. It's important to start off with a clear base coat applied thinly, smoothly, and carefully. Some base coats act as adhesives that help to retain the nail color and make it last longer, preventing chipping. Others are nail thickeners, which brittle nails sorely need. Talk to your friend – which is more up their alley? Just one layer is plenty. Base coats also don't take that long to dry, so don't feel the need to take a break. By the time you hit the tenth nail, the first nail should be ready for color."

Start on the same finger as you did with the base coat and work your way over. Take your time, applying evenly and thoroughly. One swipe down the center, and one on the left and right for each finger. [5] X Research source If you wind up getting color on the skin, take a small cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover and very carefully wipe it off, not touching the nail. Alternatively, take your own nail to lightly scrape off the not-yet-dried nail polish as soon as it hits the wrong place. Has your friend requested a French manicure? You can read about it here ."

You could also take a toothpick and make fancy designs. After all, the only way to improve is to practice. If your friend isn't sure if they want nail art, suggest just doing it on one finger. They can try it out, and the one-finger look is actually super trendy if they wish to keep it that way. Need ideas? Try reading wikiHow's article on how to do nail art ."

So if you can, put a fan in front of your nails and keep them there for about 20 minutes. Blow dryers go a little bit faster if you're pressed for time. Turn the heat on medium and move the blow dryer back and forth, making sure the hot bursts of air reach every nail. After about five minutes, check the nails, and keep going if necessary."

Don't let her do much – pop in a movie, grab her a drink, and keep her away from the popcorn if need be. You've put way too much work in for them to be ruined on the spot! Once dry, you may wish to moisturize a bit more, especially if you didn't do so after the cuticle stage.Use a nice scented lotion lightly over the fingers and into the cuticles, keeping them hydrated and healthy."
