      "title": "Unspool your wired ribbon, take one end, and make a small circle with it.",
      "content": "Unspool your wired ribbon, take one end, and make a small circle with it. For making a fluffy bow, use a minimum of 9 feet (2.7 m)—the more ribbon, the fluffier the bow! Make a small circle, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, at one end of the ribbon. [2] X Research source If you're at the store and aren't sure if the ribbon is wired or not, simply pinch a portion of it together—if it keeps its shape, it's wired. Keep in mind as you work that you'll need to stop when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric remaining."

      "title": "Pinch the end of the circle together in your non-dominant hand.",
      "content": "Pinch the end of the circle together in your non-dominant hand. Where the end of the ribbon touches the rest of the ribbon, pinch that seam together and hold it between the fingers of your non-dominant hand. This leaves your dominant hand free to shape the rest of the bow. [3] X Research source You're going to use your non-dominant hand to hold together the fabric the entire time you're making the bow."

      "content": "Create a figure-eight by making loops on either side of the circle. Make a loop on one side of the circle, pinch the fabric in the middle, and then make a loop on the other side of the circle to create the figure-eight image. Continue pinching together the fabric in the middle that meets at your fingers. [4] X Research source When you look at the bow from the side, it'll look like the number “8.”"

      "title": "Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops.",
      "content": "Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops. Make at least 5 or 6 layers of ribboned loops. If you are using a lot of fabric, you may even make closer to 9 or 10! Remember to keep gathering the material in the middle by pinching it between your fingers. [5] X Research source At this stage, your loops will be layered rather than spread out and the bow might look a little strange, but don't worry! You're on the right path."

Take the end of the ribbon and place it between your fingers in your non-dominant hand, forming a large circle. [6] X Research source 12 inches (30 cm) of ribbon will produce bow tails that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long each."

Cinch it tight and twist it several times to make sure it's secure. You can now release that bundle of fabric you've been holding on to! [8] X Research source If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process: thread it around the pinched fabric and twist it off to ensure it'll stay in place."

You could even cut small triangles out of each end to add an additional flourish to the design. [9] X Research source If you want longer tails, leave more fabric at the end when you stop making your loops. If you want shorter tails, you can simply trim them to the length you want."

[10] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Make sure to pull loops upwards and down, and do your best to leave no see-through spaces between the loops. [11] X Research source The great thing about using wire ribbon is that you can reform the loops easily if they get bent out of shape."

Twist the end, leaving about 6 inches (15 cm) of fabric for one of your tail ends.

      "content": "Make multiple loops, twisting the fabric at the end of each loop. Hold the forming bow in your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to make the loops and twists. How large you make the loops depends on how big you want the bow to be—use smaller loops for a more concentrated bow, and use bigger loops for a larger, fluffier bow. [14] X Research source For this bow, you won't be making a figure-eight pattern. Instead, you'll just be making each loop consecutively right next to one another."

If you're worried about matching the sides, just leave extra room so you can trim the ribbon tails to match later on.

Twist off the floral wire several times so that it stays firmly in place. [17] X Research source If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process. You can leave the excess floral wire in place and use it to attach the bow to the wreath later on."

Additionally, cut the 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap in half lengthwise. [19] X Research source These measurements will create a large, rustic bow that will hang down off of your wreath."

Leave about 16 inches (41 cm) of fabric in the center before making your folds, as this will be the main part of your bow. Fold each side down and across so that the end of each one is on the opposite side. [20] X Research source It's usually easier if you do this at a workstation so you can lay the ribbon down flat."

      "content": "Fold the 24 in (61 cm) piece of ribbon so the ends meet in the middle. Place the folded ribbon, seam-side down, over top of and in the middle of the 16 in (41 cm) section from the largest ribbon, layering one on top of the other. [21] X Research source This second piece of fabric helps create depth in your bow by giving it a second dimension, rather than just having a flat, single-layer bow."

Thread it around the middle, and twist it off several times to ensure it's secure and won't come undone. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner. [24] X Research source You can either trim off the excess ends of the wire, or let them stick out to the sides so you can use them to attach the bow to the wreath later on."

If you want, you could also take the other half of that 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap and wrap it around the middle, too. [25] X Research source A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!"

      "content": "Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside. Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire. Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up. Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table. [26] X Research source If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape."

      "content": "Cut out triangles from the ends of the “tails” for an added flourish. Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel. [27] X Research source It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size."
