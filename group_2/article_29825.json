      "content": "Measure the item that you plan to place in the frame. The artwork or objects that you plan to place inside of the shadow box frame needs to fit inside of it. Use a ruler or a tape measure to find the length and width of the item so you can make a shadow box frame that fits it. [1] X Research source Write down your measurements so you can easily remember them. For example, you could have a painting that measures 18 by 24 inches (46 by 61 cm) that you want to install inside of a shadow box frame. If you’re giving the shadow box as a gift, or you don’t know the dimensions of the artwork, choose a common shadow box measurement such as 10 by 10 inches (25 by 25 cm), 11 by 14 inches (28 by 36 cm), or 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm)."

      "content": "Buy a piece of 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) thick plywood for the backing. Purchase a sheet of plywood in good condition that is as close to your measurements as you can. Look for pre-cut sheets of plywood that fit the dimensions, or purchase a larger sheet that you can cut to size. [2] X Research source You can find 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) thick plywood at your local hardware store or online."

      "title": "Cut the plywood to size, if necessary.",
      "content": "Cut the plywood to size, if necessary. Use a ruler and trace the dimensions of the shadow box frame onto the thinner sheet of plywood that will serve as the backing. Then, use a circular saw to cut along the lines and cut out the plywood so it matches the measurements. Use a pencil or marker to mark the dimensions on the board. Use the ruler to draw a straight line so you can cut along it with the saw."

      "content": "Get an 8 ft (2.4 m) board measuring 1 by 4 inches (2.5 by 10.2 cm). Buy a length of thicker plywood that you can measure and cut to size to build your shadow box frame. The thicker board will form the top, sides, and bottom of your frame, so cutting them from the same piece of plywood will ensure that they’re uniform and consistent. [3] X Research source You can purchase plywood boards at hardware stores, at home improvement stores, and online."

      "content": "Cut the top and bottom pieces from the 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) board. Measure the top or bottom of the plywood backing that you cut and then mark the measurements onto the 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) plywood board. Use the circular saw to cut 2 segments from the board to form the top and bottom pieces of the frame. You can also use a table saw or a hand saw to cut the board. You will end up with 1 sheet of thinner plywood and 2 lengths of the thicker plywood."

      "content": "Subtract 1.5 inches (38 mm) from the length and cut the side pieces. Subtract the thickness of the top and bottom boards from the total length of the backing to find the length of your side boards. Then, cut them out of the 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) plywood. [4] X Research source The 2 top pieces will be the same length as the width of the plywood backing of the frame. The 2 sides will be slightly shorter than the length of the backing because of the top and bottom pieces."

      "content": "Sand all of the pieces of wood with 180-grit sandpaper. Use gentle, circular motions to lightly sand all of the pieces of wood to remove splinters and rough patches. Pay extra attention to the edges and the sides that were cut so the boards are even and consistent. [5] X Research source Wipe or blow off any sawdust from the surface of the wood when you’re done sanding. You can use an electric sander as well. Look for sandpaper at hardware stores and online."

Take 1 of the shorter length of 1 by 4 in (2.5 by 10.2 cm) boards that will form either the top or the bottom of the shadow box frame and squeeze a line of wood glue across the bottom edge of it. Use enough glue to form an even and consistent line along the bottom. [6] X Research source Wood glue is available at home improvement stores, at hardware stores, and online."

Press the short board at either short end of the plywood backing so the edges of the board and the backing are flush against each other. Hold the board in place for about 10 seconds so it sticks. [7] X Research source Gently release pressure from the board so the glue holds it in place."

Leave the clamped pieces of wood alone to allow the glue to dry and bond them together. After an hour, release the clamp and gently wiggle the wood to make sure it’s held securely by the glue. [8] X Research source You could also use a jaw clamp or a screw clamp as well. You can find C-clamps at your local hardware store and online. Check the packaging of the wood glue for specific drying times."

You can choose any contrasting color to add depth and dimension to the item in the frame. [11] X Research source Acrylic or latex paints are easy to apply to the wood. You can find paint at paint supply stores, hardware stores, department stores, and online."

Paint the inside, the backing, and 3 of the sides. When the paint dries, paint the last side so you don’t create smudges by holding the frame to paint it. Work to apply an even layer of paint.

Drying times can vary based on the type of paint you’re using as well as the temperature and humidity of the room you’re working in, but you need to wait at least an hour to allow the first coat of paint to dry. Test to see that it’s dry by touching the paint with your finger. [13] X Research source Check the packaging on the paint for specific drying times. Work in a well-ventilated room to avoid breathing in the paint fumes and aim a fan at the frame to speed up the drying time of the paint."

You may notice spots where you can see the wood through the coat of paint, so apply a second coat using the same smooth strokes to create an even and consistent finish.

A simple way to add a front panel to your shadow box is to connect a wooden picture frame that already has the glass connected to it. Choose a frame that fits the dimensions of your shadow box so it fits onto it evenly. [15] X Research source Remove any backing or other materials from the picture frame so that only the front wooden frame and the glass remains. You can buy new frames at craft supply stores and department stores. Look for old picture frames at thrift stores that you can upcycle for your project!"

Use a power drill to attach a small hinge to the outermost edge of one of the sides of the frame near the top. Then, attach another small hinge to the outermost edge of the frame near the bottom so there are 2 hinges on the same side. [16] X Research source Make sure the hinges are aligned with each other and evenly spaced from the top and bottom edges of the frame. Use the small screws that come with the hinges.

Use your drill to drive the screws into the shadow box frame so the hinges connect the picture frame to it.

Allow the paint to dry completely and then add a second coat so none of the original paint or color is visible. [18] X Research source Use as many coats as it takes to cover the panel without any of the original paint visible."
