      "content": "Give and get consent. Before getting into any sexual activity, your partner(s) must consent enthusiastically and not under any influences. Consent is when someone happily agrees to doing something, usually sexual activity. Without consent before performing sexual acts, or forcing someone into sex, this is considered rape, or sexual assault at the least. Explain what acts you would like to do with your partner, and make sure they agree. If they decline, do not pressure them--badgering someone into sex a bad move. [1] X Research source Likewise, don't be pressured to participate in any sexual activity if you're not comfortable doing so. If someone keeps pressuring you to have sex, don't give in. Instead, tell someone else or walk away. What is consent: An enthusiastic \"yes\" or \"sure\". What is not consent: Silence, a shrug, a \"no,\" or \"maybe,\" \"I guess,\" or anything that isn't enthusiastic. If you aren't sure it's consent, it probably isn't."

You must move slowly and carefully, paying attention to your every step. Wherever you touch your partner, pay attention to their response. Take 15-20 minutes of foreplay to get yourselves aroused and comfortable.

You have to spend time with your partner if you want to get to know them. In addition to taking your time, which is the best way to make great love, you need to make sure that you are energetic and well groomed."

      "content": "Communicate with your partner . Ask questions, listen to their answers, pay attention to their body language, especially their involuntary responses. Ask them what they like, where they don't like being touched, specific preferences they have, or ways they are comfortable having sex. For example, you could ask your partner, \"How do you feel about being kissed on your neck? Do you like it, or does it make you feel uncomfortable?\" Talk about sexual experiences and acts before and after sex. [3] X Research source You could also ask ways they would feel more comfortable during sex (i.e, if they don't want you to see their chest during sex, they might choose to wear a t-shirt). Everyone is different, everyone's body is different, and everyone has different preferences."

Try touching yourself in different ways or areas, such as running your hand down your chest, for example. It might take some time to figure yourself out, but it will help you show your partner what you like later on. [4] X Research source"
