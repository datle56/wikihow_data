      "content": "Find a tray big enough to fit your paper. You can also use a baking pan, a rimmed baking sheet, a plastic tub, or even a plastic lid. The tray needs to be deep enough so that you can fill it with coffee and submerge your paper."

      "content": "Submerge your paper into the coffee. Set your paper into the tray and press down on it with your hands. If the coffee is hot, or if you don't want to get your hands dirty, gently paint the paper with a paintbrush until it sinks to the bottom of the tray. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the paper soak for about 5 to 10 minutes. The longer you soak the paper, the darker it will become. [3] X Research source For extra texture, sprinkle some coffee grounds on top of the paper. This will give you some dark, age spots or speckles."

      "title": "Lift the paper out of the coffee.",
      "content": "Lift the paper out of the coffee. Use both hands to lift the paper out of the coffee by one end. Hold the paper over the tray, and let the excess coffee drip out. Be very careful during this step; wet paper is fragile. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the paper.",
      "content": "Dry the paper. There are two ways you can do this: baking it or with a hairdryer. Baking the paper will give you more texture and a darker color. Blow drying it will give you a smoother texture and a lighter color. Here are the two ways you can dry your paper: To bake your paper: set it down on a clean baking sheet, then bake it in a preheated oven at 200°F (94°C) for 5 to 10 minutes. To blow dry you paper: set it down on a waterproof tablecloth, then blow dry it. Flip it over onto a dry part of the tablecloth, then blow dry it some more. Blot any excess coffee with a paper towel."

If you are making instant coffee, plan on using 3 tablespoons of instant coffee to about 6 ounces (cc milliliters) of water.

Sandwich the paper between two thin sheets of fabric, such as tea towels or cotton muslin. [11] X Research source Turn your iron on to the wool setting, and let it get warm.
