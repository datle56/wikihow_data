      "title": "Preheat your oven to 200 to 250°F (100 to 120°C) and open a window.",
      "content": "Preheat your oven to 200 to 250°F (100 to 120°C) and open a window. Move the oven rack to the bottom of the oven. Have a window open or turn a fan on to ensure adequate ventilation. This is very important, as the melting vinyl will give off fumes that are not safe to breathe in."

    {
      "title": "Set a metal or glass heat-safe bowl onto a baking sheet.",
      "content": "Set a metal or glass heat-safe bowl onto a baking sheet. Choose a bowl that is a little smaller than the record, and set it right-side-up onto a baking sheet. To further protect your baking sheet, line it with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Make sure that you are happy with the size of the bowl. The record bowl will end up roughly the same size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the record on top of the bowl.",
      "content": "Place the record on top of the bowl. Make sure that the record is centered and that the label is facing upward. If your record has a label on each side, make sure that the side you like the best is facing up. If the record is dirty, clean it first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a heavy can on top of the record.",
      "content": "Place a heavy can on top of the record. Again, make sure that the can is centered. The can will weigh the record down as it heats up, and help it conform to the shape of the bowl. If you don't have a can, fill a cloth bag with dried beans or rice, and use that instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bake the vinyl until it starts to warp.",
      "content": "Bake the vinyl until it starts to warp. Place the baking sheet into the oven and let it bake. After about 3 to 5 minutes, the vinyl will start to soften and warp. Do not bake it longer than 10 minutes. Adjust the shape while the record is in the oven. Use a metal spatula to poke and prod it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the record out of the oven and let it cool.",
      "content": "Take the record out of the oven and let it cool. Use a pair of oven mits to take the entire baking sheet out of the oven. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface, and let the record cool down. This should only take about 10 to 15 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the record from the bowl.",
      "content": "Remove the record from the bowl. The record will now have a bowl-like shaped with ruffled sides. You can use it to store non-food items, like as jewelry, ornaments, or even remote controls."

      "title": "Preheat your oven to 200 to 250°F (100 to 120°C).",
      "content": "Preheat your oven to 200 to 250°F (100 to 120°C). Open up a window or turn a fan on so that you have good ventilation. Make sure that the oven rack is in the bottom portion of the oven. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Set a glass or metal heat-safe bowl upside down on a baking sheet.",
      "content": "Set a glass or metal heat-safe bowl upside down on a baking sheet. Choose a bowl that is about 8½ to 9 inches (21.59 to 22.86 centimeters) wide. [2] X Research source Place it upside down onto a large baking sheet. If you'd like to further protect your baking sheet, cover it with aluminum foil or parchment paper first. You can also use cans, mugs, or even metal colanders [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bake the record until it becomes soft and malleable.",
      "content": "Bake the record until it becomes soft and malleable. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes, but it would take up to 8 or 10 minutes. Keep an eye on your record, however, so that it does not melt. Once it starts to warp, you are ready for the next step."

      "title": "Take the record out of the oven.",
      "content": "Take the record out of the oven. Use a pair of oven mitts to pull the entire baking sheet out of the oven. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface."

    {
      "title": "Shape the record with your hands.",
      "content": "Shape the record with your hands. You may be able to do this with your bare hands, but you will need to be careful so that you don't burn yourself on the base bowl or the baking sheet. You can also shape the bowl using a metal spoon or spatula instead. The record will start to cool and harden in about 20 to 30 seconds, so work quickly! Alternatively, you can set the record into a smaller bowl (right-side-up) first, then shape it that way. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the record cool before taking it out of the bowl.",
      "content": "Let the record cool before taking it out of the bowl. After about 10 to 15 minutes, the record should be rigid again, and cool to the touch. Once that happens, you can lift it off of the base bowl, and use it to store non-food items, such as remotes, knick-knacks, or accessories."
