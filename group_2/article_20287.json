      "content": "Understand what the position demands. A data entry job requires a wide array of skills and is not limited to a single task or duty. The responsibilities of data entry clerk vary greatly depending on a company's needs and goals. In short, data entry involves translating information into electronic forms.

[2] X Research source Nearly every company at one point or another needs data entry work done. This is part of what makes data entry experience great for employment prospects. As a potential employee, experience in data entry makes you appealing to a variety of companies.

      "content": "Educate yourself. There is no specific educational background required to become a data entry specialist. You only need a high school diploma to qualify for most data entry jobs. However, taking college classes or even community college classes in relevant areas can improve your chance of landing a job. Telecommunications, computer sciences, and software development are areas of study that look impressive on a data entry resume. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Build your software skill set.",
      "content": "Build your software skill set. For data entry, having a diverse background in a variety of softwares can make you a more appealing candidate. Different companies use different softwares for data entry work. The more software skills you have on your resume, the better chance you have of snagging a job. The most commonly used software applications in data entry are Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, Project and Open Office. Be aware that lots of companies hold data on in-house systems that may be MS based or not. Familiarity with a variety of databases with graphic user interfaces is very useful. [5] X Research source Many people find they can successfully teach themselves software skills by following instructions and playing around with the software on their own. There are also online tutorials, many of which are free, that can teach you about basic software. Colleges, community colleges, and even some community centers offer classes in career-related computer skills. See what is available in your area and look into enrolling in a course."

      "title": "Work on typing speed.",
      "content": "Work on typing speed. Typing is one of the most important assets of a good data entry worker. The job requires a lot of clerical duties and is therefore typing heavy. Not that typing is not the same as data entry. Typists are generally required to be accurate at 60 words a minute or more. Data entry should be faster and more accurate since data is often numeric and spell checkers don't work on numbers! Accuracy is very important in the world of data entry. So much information comes in the form of codes, digits, and prices that must be transcribed exactly. As there is such a high level of data that is input, you need to be able to touch type. That means, typing without looking down at the keyboard. Learn to use the number pad for figures, not the top row of the keyboard. [6] X Research source Speed is also important. The minimum words-per-minute most companies expect is 60, although 80 to 90 is preferred. You can find out your typing speed by taking a free test online. [7] X Research source Typing skills are built through time and practice. In order to improve your typing or data entry skills, try transcribing a document, like a book or a poem or a newspaper article, each night before bed. You can also take typing classes through community colleges or community centers. Even practicing typing tests online can improve speed and accuracy. Remember you likely won't be typing sentences in data entry. Names, sales figures, product codes etc are far more commonly added to data bases than news paper articles."

      "title": "Work on your resume.",
      "content": "Work on your resume. A good resume is the first step to successfully finding a job. Work on producing a stellar resume before you begin sending it out to potential employers. Create a one-page resume that highlights your relevant education and experience. Write your resume with your desired job in mind. Put your most relevant experience towards the top of the resume. For a data entry job, this would include relevant computer training, past data entry work, or any clerical work you've done previously. Also, do not include every experience or accomplishment. Someone looking to hire a data entry clerk does not need to know you had a paper route in high school, for example. [8] X Research source Your name and contact information should be at the top of the page. They should be highly visible so your employer can easily figure out how to reach out to you if they like your resume. Use a slightly bigger font and write your name in bold. [9] X Research source Pay attention to the job postings you're applying for. What keywords are used over and over again? Do many data entry job postings ask for a well-organized self-starter? Use that terminology in your resume so you look ideal for the position. Use bullet points. Accomplishments, skills, and job duties should be listed using bullet points. This makes them more reader-friendly, meaning your resume is more likely to get attention. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Look through local listings.",
      "content": "Look through local listings. When you begin compiling jobs to apply for, look at local listings first. As data entry jobs are needed in almost any company, you probably won't need to change locations to get a position. Craig's List is a great online resource to find work, but watch out for scams. Poor grammar, quick response time, and interviews conducted via email or instant messaging all point to a Craig's List scam. [11] X Research source While not as prevalent for job searching as they once were, newspapers still use classified ads. You could try looking in your local newspaper. Local employment agencies may be able to direct you where to apply and even provide you with an application."

      "title": "Try online positions.",
      "content": "Try online positions. The internet provides many opportunities for work in data entry from your own home. Working remotely means you'll save time and money on the commute, and hours are often more flexible. These positions can be slightly harder to gain. Due to the convenience, they are in higher demand than other data entry jobs. Don't be discouraged if the search takes awhile. [12] X Research source Online databases can be used to find work-from-home positions. Simply type \"online\" or \"remote\" in the location bar when searching. You might also stumble upon digital positions while searching for jobs in your area. [13] X Research source Again, watch out for scams. Much like on Craig's List, if you hear back and are hired very quickly, be wary. Bad grammar and broken English might be a sign messages are being sent through a spam bot and not a person."

      "title": "Go through a temp agency.",
      "content": "Go through a temp agency. For short term data entry work, many companies would prefer to hire a temp rather than a full time employee. While not ideal, having some temp work can at least help build your resume. It can be a good foot-in-the-door and an opportunity to find references and make connections. Temp agencies often test your skill set by having you take typing and software tests. This means potential employers can see solid evidence that your resume reflects actual dedication. This can make it easier to get hired than going in cold. Occasionally, temp jobs do turn into long-term positions. If hired, try to make a good impression and stay in touch with any bosses or supervisors."

      "content": "Practice good interview skills. In the event you're called in for an interview, make sure you know good interview skills. This increases your chance of gaining the position. The most important thing is to explain and show the interviewer why you're the right person for the job. Dress for the job or company. You can figure out the dress code through the listing or by asking someone in HR. Suits and ties, or business casual attire, are generally recommended if you're unsure about the dress code. [14] X Research source Show that you are listening during the interview by maintaining eye contact, smiling and nodding, and asking questions when appropriate. Keep interview answers short and concise and avoid talking too much by rambling. [15] X Research source When the interviewer asks you if you have any questions, always respond. You don't want to simply say \"No\" or ask something about logistics, such as when you can expect to hear back. Ask open ended questions, like, \"What does a day of work look like here?\" and \"What is your company culture like?\" [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with average salaries. While data entry is a great resume builder, most people do not stay in the field long-term as salaries are relatively low in comparison to other office positions. Data entry workers make roughly $23,000 to $35,000 a year. Most people fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, pulling in $28,000 a year. [17] X Research source Chance of advancement depends on the company and your relationship with your employers. However, there is no specific career path for a data entry work and advancement is not as likely as it might be with other office jobs. [18] X Research source"

This increases the likelihood that you'll be selected to move up and take on higher paying jobs with more responsibilities in the future."

      "content": "Consider your long-term career goals. Oftentimes, a data entry position can serve as a stepping stone for other work. Consider what you might want to do long-term. Administrative and customer service positions are often given to longtime data entry workers. If you enjoy working with people, you might learn about these kinds of jobs and talk to your supervisors about how to obtain them. [19] X Research source If your data entry is math or science heavy, computer science and other technical positions could open up down the road. Government organizations often provide training programs to help data entry workers up their skill set. This can lead to advanced positions with more responsibilities. Look into programs in your area that cater to your interests and goals. [20] X Research source"
