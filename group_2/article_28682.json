[1] X Research source Texturize your ponytail by pinching your hair at your crown to get some added volume. Brushing and smoothing your hair before you put it into the ponytail will give your bun a sleek look. For a high bun, tie a loose ponytail at the crown of your head."

      "content": "Braid your ponytail. Braid your ponytail in a classic three-strand braid. Braid your hair all the way down to the bottom of your hair. [2] X Research source It’s okay if some pieces of hair pop out while you continue the braid."

      "title": "Make a hole in your hair.",
      "content": "Make a hole in your hair. Use your fingers to create a hole in the area of your hair above the ponytail holder. Reach your thumb and pointer finger up and underneath your ponytail holder so they poke up vertically through the hole you just created. [3] X Research source Keep your fingers poking through; they are going to grab onto your braid."

      "title": "Fold your hair through the hole.",
      "content": "Fold your hair through the hole. Lift your braid up with your free hand and bring it to your two fingers poking out through the hole. Hold onto the braid with your two fingers and pull the braid down through the hole. [4] X Research source The sides of your hair should be twisted since the braid was pulled through the hole."

    {
      "title": "Fold your braid though again.",
      "content": "Fold your braid though again. Fold your braid once more through the hole. This time, don’t pull your braid all the way down through the hole. Flip the braid to pull the bulkiest part to the hole, and let the bottom portion of the braid (the tail) fold over on itself within the hole. [5] X Research source The idea is to have the bulkiest part of the braid be the majority of the braid seen in the bun."

      "title": "Secure the braid.",
      "content": "Secure the braid. Hold your braid with one hand and use your other hand to insert bobby pins into the sides of your bun. Once the braid is secured into place, use your fingers to pull the braided pieces apart a little bit to make the bun look fluffier and to add texture. [6] X Research source It’s okay if the bun looks a little messy and not too perfect."

[7] X Research source You don’t need to brush your hair before putting your hair into the ponytail. This will help create a more relaxed, tousled look. Since you’re making a top knot bun, the ponytail needs to be tied up high on your head."

This will help your braids look bigger and fuller."

[11] X Research source Use a bobby pin to secure that first wrapped braid. Wrap the other braided section going in the opposite direction, until it reaches the back of your head. Try to position this braid underneath the first wrapped around braid. If you hair is longer, and your braided sections wrap around further than to the back of your head, simply secure the end of the braid wherever it happens to end."

Grab a small section of hair behind the first section (again, about a 1-2 inch section), and repeat the teasing and back combing. Flip this back combed section of hair over the first section. Tease and back comb 3-5 sections of hair for some nice volume at the crown of your head. Flip all of your hair back say it lays naturally."
