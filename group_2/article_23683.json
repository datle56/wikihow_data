      "content": "Yeast Yeast promotes bacteria and can help bring healthy enzymes to your septic tank. Once a month, flush a 1/4 oz. packet of yeast down the toilet to boost your bacterial activity. [1] X Research source Yeast is an awesome natural solution, but don’t use it more than once a month. Yeast can make your septic tank frothy if you use too much, which could cause it to back up."

      "content": "Rotten tomatoes Going to toss those old, rotten tomatoes from the back of your pantry? Hold on a minute! Every 4 months, grab those old tomatoes and push them down the garbage disposal. The decaying tomatoes will bring healthy bacteria into the septic tank super fast.

      "content": "Bacteria helps break down solid waste inside of the septic tank. Without any bacteria in your septic tank, all your solid waste would remain, well… solid. Since solids take up more room than liquid waste, too many solids in your septic tank can cause it to fill up faster. Healthy bacteria breaks down those solids to keep your septic tank functioning at an optimal level for longer."

      "content": "Septic tank additives are not necessary for a septic tank system. Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not recommend using any chemical additives in your septic tank. While they are often promoted for domestic septic tank systems, most systems do not need any additives to function properly. Using septic tank additives can decrease the performance of septic drainfields, and the strong chemicals in them pose a threat to the groundwater and soil structure around your home.

      "title": "Use toilet-friendly toilet paper.",
      "content": "Use toilet-friendly toilet paper. Some dyes in toilet paper are tough for bacteria to break down. Make sure you’re buying white toilet paper that breaks down easily so your septic tank doesn’t have to work harder than it needs to. Not sure if your toilet paper is toilet-friendly? Place a square of toilet paper in a jar full of water, then shake the jar up. If the toilet paper breaks down into small bits, then it’s good for your system. If not, it’s time to find a new brand."

If you have old medication that’s expired or you don’t use anymore, dispose of it the right way by taking it to a hazardous waste facility."

Don’t flush things like wipes, menstrual products, or diapers down the toilet; not only will they probably clog your pipes, but they’ll wreck the bacteria in your septic tank, too. Even most “flushable” wipes aren’t made to go into a septic tank system. When in doubt, throw it out."
