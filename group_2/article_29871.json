      "content": "Understand that skateboards are made of 6-9 layers of pressed plywood. In order to withstand stress and damage skateboards are not made of just one piece of wood. Instead, multiple thin layers of plywood and veneer are layered, glued, and then pressed together for several hours to make one deck. The standard is for 7 pieces of plywood, though some boards use 9. Changing the thickness of the sheets or the number of pieces in the board will affect its weight, flexibility, and riding properties. Most decks have a final thickness of roughly 10mm.

      "content": "Purchase 6-7 pieces of 30\"x10\" plywood. It should be roughly 1/17th of an inch thick. This will form the base of a basic deck. However, you can buy different types of wood and stack them appropriately for a more professional board. Most of these specialty woods are tough to find at big-box retailers, so you may need to go to a specialty store to find Baltic Birch or Canadian Maple thin enough to use. Hard Maple is great because of its incredibly thin veneers. [2] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview. 5 June 2020. Buy two hardwood \"face\" pieces for the top or bottom in mahogany or maple for sturdy, gorgeous wood. The thickness should be the same, 1/17th of an inch. You can buy birch or bamboo for the \"core\" wood, as it is more stable than standard plywood. The thickness should be the same. [3] X Research source Crossband Layers are two specific pieces on the inside of the board where the wood grain runs up and down the thickness of the board, not along the face. If you can buy crossband plywood, get two sheets for the center to increase board strength."

      "content": "Attach the boards with evenly spread wood glue. Take each piece of wood and use a paint roller to spread a thin layer of wood glue on the bottom of your face piece and the top of your first core piece of wood. Lightly push the two pieces together. Repeat this to adhere all seven pieces of plywood together. Do not simply coat one side and stick it to the other -- you need evenly-spread glue on both sides of the plywood. If you are building a professional board, you will need to order your wood in the correct way for the best results. The standard order for the wood is: Face sheet (your best wood) Core sheet Crossband sheet Core sheet Crossband sheet Core sheet Face sheet"

If you are using a professional press you can simply lay it in the mold and move on to the next step. Two pieces of tape, wrapped all the way around the board right before it begins to curve upwards, should work fine. If you don't have a Styrofoam mold, fit the wood in between two old skateboard decks to mimic their shape. However, you need to be sure both decks have the same shape. [4] X Research source"

If the valve is right above the wood without mesh you may not be able to get all the air out, as the wood seals up the hole. This bag needs to be perfectly airtight or the board will not mold."

Have a friend nearby to help keep the bag from being accidentally pulled in between the layers of wood or the mold, as this will warp your board. Think of the vacuum as creating a press -- the top of the bag is molding the wood to fit your Styrofoam mold, and anything that gets in the way will mold bumps or cracks into the wood.

If you cannot use an old board, take a large piece of paper and fold it in half. Draw out the shape of half of your board -- curved on the top and bottom, flat along the sides -- starting from the folded edge of the paper. Then cut out the outline -- since you folded the paper in half, unfolding your cut out will lead to a perfectly symmetrical outline. Trace this design onto your wood.

To do this, work with the top of the board face-up, then tilt the edge of the board down as you run it along the sander. Follow up with a hand sander, then some fine sandpaper, to smooth out the edges. Use progressively higher-grit papers, try going up to 400 or more, to smooth the entire edge out into a beautiful, even side."

      "content": "Build a Styrofoam mold to shape your skateboard in a vacuum press. Unless you want a flat skateboard, you need to press the wood together into a mold, allowing you to curve your board professionally. To do this, you will need a large piece of Styrofoam (at least the size of your plywood), a vacuum with hose attachment, and a vacuum bag big enough to fit your mold and skateboard. You will likely need to stack and glue several pieces of Styrofoam to get it 4-5\" inches thick. The Styrofoam should have an R rating of 9 or higher to withstand the pressure of making a board. You can buy Styrofoam at most home-improvement stores in the home insulation section."

Keep it simple for now -- use a ruler to make a straight line through the middle of the board, then curve gently upwards for the last 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm) so that the ends of the board are 1/2-1 inch higher up than the middle. This is the shape of the profile of your board, not the top of it. Take an old skateboard deck and trace its shape on your outline for a professional shape."

To do so: Measure the distance from your outline to the top of the Styrofoam block in 5 places. Mark where you measured and the height you found at each spot. Say the first mark you make, at the beginning of the curve, is 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the top of the foam to your outline. Draw a line with a ruler from the 1/2-inch mark on one side of the foam to the 1/2-inch mark on the other side. Set the blade of your utility knife to this exact distance, so that the blade is only 1/2 inch long. Cut horizontally across the your line, making a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) deep incision across the foam. Cut diagonally up the foam to remove a large, rectangular, 1/2-inch chunk from the entire width of the foam. Repeat until you have the entire curve of the board roughly outlined."

Sandpaper will quickly remove the foam, so you can use it to make sure the foam perfectly fits the outline you have drawn on the side of the foam. The outline on the side of the foam should now outline the top of your whole foam mold. The final product will look like the inverse of a skateboard, where a finished deck would fit snugly on top of the mold."

Simply place an old deck over the new board and use a pencil to mark the location of the holes. Using a straight-drill, drill each hole straight through the board. You will have 8 holes -- two sets of four on each end. If you cannot use an old board, you'll need to make sure you trucks are centered. To do so, use a ruler to measure at least 5 center points in the board. If the board is 10 inches (25.4 cm) thick, these center points will be 5\" from each edge. Use your ruler to connect each of these points to draw your center line. From there, line your trucks up with the midline so that the holes are equal distance from the line, mark them, and drill from here. You want your trucks to be on the flat part of the board, starting right after the curve of the nose and tail. [9] X Research source"

Deck: This is the wooden board. It has griptape on it, which resembles sandpaper. Trucks: These are the large metal pieces on the board that house the axel and attach the wheels. Bearings: Allow your wheels to roll smoothly. They come in steel and ceramic -- steel is standard, but ceramic have less friction and last longer, though they cost more. You need 8 of them.

Concavity: Generally, if the board is curved down more (more concave) it is more stable to ride. Flatter boards are usually easier to hit tricks on, however you should sample a few decks to determine what you like.

Using a screwdriver or sturdy metal instrument, rub the tape along the edge of the board until the tape makes a white outline along the entire edge. Use a box cutter or utility knife to cut away excessive grip tape. If you have any air bubbles, poke a hole in them with the end of the knife and then press the tape into the board. It is much easier to cut the grip tape from the bottom."

While they may seem standard, different trucks are actually used for different skaters: Longboard riders who plan on using large wheels may need risers which put more distance between the board and the ground. They also absorb some of the force and vibration on landings. Heavier riders need to get a wide hanger, which is the axle that keeps the wheels further apart. Most hangers reach within 1/4\" of the boards outside edges. Bushings control how wobbly the board feels. Technical riders will want harder bushings, while people who like to cruise a lot may prefer softer bushings. [15] X Research source"
