      "content": "Pick a bra that’s one band size smaller and one or two cups larger than your regular size. [1] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Image Consultant Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. For example, if you usually wear a 36B, buy a 36C or 34D for your strapless version. The bra band should be snug, but not cutting into your back. This makes up for the lack of support that straps would provide. Don’t go too small: A band that’s too tight will often slip down to the smallest part of your waist. Measure your band size yourself by wrapping a measuring tape tightly just below your bust. If you get an even number, add 4 inches (10.2 cm) and if you get an odd number, add 5. For example, a 32 on the measuring tape means your band size is 36 whereas a 29 means you should wear a 34. Many stores like Nordstrom offer free bra fitting and measuring services. Even if you’ve been measured before, your bra size can change often so ask the dressing room attendant if any fitters are available or call ahead to make an appointment. The band width matters, too. Larger busts, which are heavier, benefit most from a wider band. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Check that the bra is snug on the loosest hook closure. Strapless bras have to work harder than regular bras, so they stretch out more easily. If a new bra is comfortable at the largest hook setting, you’ll be able to tighten it to the lower settings as it loses elasticity. [3] X Research source If you buy a bra that is most comfortable at the tightest setting, it won’t last as long. This is because once it stretches out, you won’t be able to adjust it any further."

      "content": "Look for a bra that has adhesive grips or silicone lining. These sticky strips often line the inside of the cups along with the edge of the bra band. [4] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Image Consultant Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. They provide more grip between your skin and the bra. Do not use silicone grips if you have a silicone allergy or sensitive skin. You can make your own sticky lining by using double-sided fashion tape. Place a strip or two on the inside of each cup to stick to your skin. Press the cups firmly against your breasts after putting your bra on. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a seamless bandeau instead of molded cups for more comfort. Made of stretchy nylon, bandeaus feel more like a sports bra and lie flat against your chest, so they often aren’t visible through your clothes. They also stay in place much better than a standard strapless bra. You can get pretty lace bandeaus to show off under more revealing tops and dresses. Seamless bandeaus, however, offer less support and separation than cups since there is no underwire. If you have a larger bust, you might not find bandeaus as comfortable."

      "content": "Buy a strapless bra that comes with removable straps. Not only will you need one of these straps for this method, but having the option to add straps means you can get a lot more use from your bra. Bras typically last for 6 months to a year. If your bra is older than 1 year, you’ll want to replace it. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hook a removable bra strap on one side of the back of the bra.",
      "content": "Hook a removable bra strap on one side of the back of the bra. Strapless bras typically have 4 hooks or sleeves: 2 on the back band and 1 on each cup in the front. You can attach the strap to the hook on either side in the back. Keep the other strap in your lingerie drawer so you can find it easily when you need it."

      "content": "Wrap the bra strap around your back and front, underneath the bra cups. Keep the strap as close to the bottom edge of the bra as possible, making sure it is laying flat. Pull it snugly against your ribcage. [7] X Research source You shouldn’t be able to fit more than 1 or 2 fingers beneath the strap. The tighter you make the strap, the more of a push-up effect you’ll get with the bra cups."

      "title": "Attach the bra strap to the hook on the other side in the back.",
      "content": "Attach the bra strap to the hook on the other side in the back. Loosen or tighten the strap as needed to be able to comfortably reach the other hook on the back of the bra band. So if you started on the left hook, you’ll finish on the right hook. Before getting dressed, make sure your breasts are properly situated by leaning forward slightly and using your hands to adjust them inside the cups."

      "title": "Line the bra up where you want it to sit on the dress or top.",
      "content": "Line the bra up where you want it to sit on the dress or top. Do this by trying on the bra and clothing together to see where the clothing naturally hits the bra. For strapless dresses or shirts, this is often right at the top of the clothing. [8] X Research source You can use an old bra for this, even if it’s super ratty. It will be hidden inside the dress."

      "content": "Pin the bra cups to the lining of the clothing to hold them in place. Once you determine where you want the bra to intersect the clothing, use safety pins to secure it to the inside lining only. [9] X Research source You’ll need at least 2 pins (1 for each cup), but you can use more for more support. The important thing here is to make sure your safety pins don’t poke through to the front of the clothing. This is to keep them hidden. You can pin it carefully while still wearing the bra and dress or top, or take them off first. [10] X Research source Pinning the bra and clothing while they’re on your body will give you the most accurate results. If you take them off, you risk losing the right spot."

      "title": "Secure the band in the back to the clothing with pins if necessary.",
      "content": "Secure the band in the back to the clothing with pins if necessary. While the back of the bra usually isn’t the part that slides around, it can still help to pin it as well. Ask a friend to place 1 or 2 pins in the back, or do it yourself by removing the clothes and bra first to avoid pricking yourself. When placing the pins, only grab 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of fabric in the pin. Too much will cause the clothing to bunch up, but too little won’t hold the bra in place well."
