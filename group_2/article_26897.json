      "title": "Mix all the ingredients into a bowl.",
      "content": "Mix all the ingredients into a bowl. Measure 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of white craft glue, 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of shaving foam, ⅛ tsp (0.5 grams) of baking soda, and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of contact lens solution into a bowl. Use a spatula to mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined and form a ball shape. [1] X Research source Make sure to use shaving foam instead of shaving gel, as the foam gives the slime a fluffy texture. Purchase contact lens solution from a pharmacy."

      "title": "Place the clay and food coloring on top of the ball of slime.",
      "content": "Place the clay and food coloring on top of the ball of slime. Take a ¼ cup (100 grams) of light-weight air dry clay and place it on the slime. Measure 0.25 teaspoons (1.2 mL) of yellow food coloring and pour it on top of the clay. [2] X Research source If you don’t have yellow food coloring, use yellow dye instead. Purchase air dry clay from a craft store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the ingredients together with your hands.",
      "content": "Knead the ingredients together with your hands. Push all the ingredients down in the bowl to flatten them. Then, fold the slime in half and flatten it again. Continue to repeat this kneading process until all of the ingredients are combined and the slime is an even color. [3] X Research source Wash your hands after you have mixed the slime, as food coloring tends to temporarily dye your hands. To change the color of the slime, simply use a different colored dye. Store your freshly made slime in an airtight container to keep it stretchy."

      "title": "Stir the PVA glue and borax in a bowl.",
      "content": "Stir the PVA glue and borax in a bowl. Measure 0.5 cups (120 ml) of white PVA glue and ½ cup (91 grams) of borax into a bowl. Stir the glue and borax together until they form a smooth paste. Purchase borax from a hardware, cleaning, or home supplies store. In some countries, PVA glue is called liquid craft clue."

      "title": "Add the modelling clay to the bowl.",
      "content": "Add the modelling clay to the bowl. Place ¼ cup (100 grams) of modelling clay on top of the slime solution. Choose a modelling clay that is the desired colour of your slime, as this will colour the mixture. Avoid using multi-color clay, unless you are happy for the colors to get mixed together in the slime. Purchase modelling clay online or from a craft store."

    {
      "title": "Mix the ingredients with your hands until they form a ball.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients with your hands until they form a ball. Squish the ingredients together with your hands until the clay is completely dispersed in the slime. If you’re having trouble mixing the slime, try kneading it on a clean surface, such as a bench, as this gives you more space to mix it. Store your slime in an airtight container to keep it fresh."

      "title": "Measure the cornstarch and shampoo into a bowl.",
      "content": "Measure the cornstarch and shampoo into a bowl. Add ¾ cup (95 grams) of cornstarch and 0.75 cups (180 ml) of shampoo into a bowl. This makes about 1 large handful of slime. If you want a larger quantity of slime, simply double the recipe. In some countries cornstarch is called cornflour. If the slime seems too thin, add more cornstarch until it reaches your desired consistency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the ingredients until they reach a paste consistency.",
      "content": "Stir the ingredients until they reach a paste consistency. Use a spoon or a spatula to gently mix the cornflour and shampoo together. Avoid vigorously mixing the ingredients, as this can cause the shampoo to bubble which can make the slime less fluffy."

    {
      "title": "Mix baby oil and yellow food coloring into the slime.",
      "content": "Mix baby oil and yellow food coloring into the slime. The baby oil gives the slime a glossy sheen and the yellow food coloring makes it look like butter. Mix in 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baby oil and 0.25 teaspoons (1.2 mL) of yellow food coloring until the slime is an even colour and texture. If you don’t have baby oil, use baby lotion instead. Place your slime in an airtight container when you aren’t using it. This will help it to stay soft and stretchy."
