So, when they come into your life, they help you resolve your karma and grow mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. [1] X Research source A karmic soulmate typically teaches you about what love is, what it isn’t, and reveals important truths about yourself. A relationship with your karmic soulmate is often temporary but challenging, intense, and tumultuous. Because a karmic soulmate is thought to be a soul you’ve met in a past life, you can have multiple karmic soulmates. Karma is the belief that all of your actions have good and bad consequences. These consequences follow you throughout your lifetimes."
