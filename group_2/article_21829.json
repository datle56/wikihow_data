      "content": "Use a stud finder tool to locate a stud in your wall. Place the stud finder unit on the wall and turn it on by pressing the buttons on the side. Slide the tool from right to left until the lights indicate that there is a stud. Mark the area on your wall with a pencil. [1] X Research source A stud will be much sturdier to drill into than just plain drywall. If you cannot find a stud in the area that you want to hang your clock, use piece of hardware called a screw anchor to hold your screw in place. This hardware looks like a large, hollowed-out screw, and you can find it at most hardware stores."

Have a friend or family member check to see how it looks in the position you are holding it. Take a look at the placement on the wall to see if you like where it is. [2] X Research source It’s important to figure out how your clock looks before you put up any hardware since the hardware will make a hole in the wall. Generally, you should hang your clock at about eye level. [3] X Expert Source David Julien DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021.

      "title": "Drill an anchor into the wall if you aren’t using a stud.",
      "content": "Drill an anchor into the wall if you aren’t using a stud. If your clock is especially heavy, use a screw anchor to keep it more secure. Attach a phillips head drill bit to your drill and screw the anchor into your wall about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the mark that you made on your wall. Make sure the anchor is flush with your wall. [6] X Research source You can find anchors at most hardware stores. If your clock is lighter than 20 pounds (9.1 kg), you don’t need to use a wall anchor. Just use a single screw instead."

Gently slip the mounting area of your clock over the screw in your wall. [8] X Research source Most modern wall clocks will have a hole in the back for mounting, while older ones will have wire hangings."

      "title": "Listen for an even ticking sound if your clock has a pendulum.",
      "content": "Listen for an even ticking sound if your clock has a pendulum. Pendulums are the heavy, hanging mechanisms in old-fashioned clocks that keep time. Listen for an even tick-tock sound that keeps time roughly every 1 second to know that your clock is straight. If the ticking sound is off or uneven, adjust your clock so that it hangs straight. If the pendulum is off, your clock might tell the wrong time."
