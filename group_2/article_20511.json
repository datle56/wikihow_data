      "title": "Bring up the subject first.",
      "content": "Bring up the subject first. This sign is known for being direct and to the point when it comes to their communication style. They'll be receptive to an open and straightforward conversation about what happened. Pick a time for you two to talk in private and ask if they would be open to having a discussion about what has upset them. [1] X Research source If you're able to meet in person, say something like, \"I'd really like to talk about what happened. Would now be a good time to talk?\" If you're not able to meet in person, you might text them, \"Are you free to talk? I feel really bad about what happened and think we should have a conversation.\""

      "title": "Keep your words brief and to the point.",
      "content": "Keep your words brief and to the point. Sagittarius men are known for being pretty blunt. They won't be interested in endless apologies or a conversation that keeps going in circles. Instead, be upfront and choose the words that will have the most impact. To help you with this, plan out what you have to say in advance or write out your apology before you say it in person. [2] X Research source You might try drafting your words in a journal or on some scratch paper. If you're having the conversation over text, draft your texts in the Notes app. Everyone is different. It's possible the Sagittarius guy you've hurt will want to have a longer discussion about what happened and why he was hurt. If that's the case, be there for him and stay in the conversation until you can hopefully reach a solution."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest about what happened.",
      "content": "Be honest about what happened. Do this even if it's awkward or painful. A Sagittarius man is considered one of the most honest and trustworthy signs out there. To gain his forgiveness, you'll need to show him that you're both of those things yourself. If you betrayed his trust or made a mistake that's caused him to feel hurt, don't try to hide it. [3] X Research source Instead, state exactly what you did in a calm, respectful manner. A Sagittarius will be open to hearing you out and will likely respect you for your candor. Maybe you lied to him about making plans with an ex. Say something like, \"I completely understand why you're upset. I was dishonest with you about my plans with Mandy, and I broke your trust.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Take responsibility if you made a mistake.",
      "content": "Take responsibility if you made a mistake. Owning up to your actions will go a long way with the always virtuous Sagittarius man. If you messed up and hurt his feelings, tell him explicitly that it was your fault. This may be hard to do, but Sagittarius men admire people who live with integrity. Show him that you're one of those people by reflecting upon your mistakes and holding yourself accountable. Maybe you forgot to pick him up from work like you said you would. You might say, \"There are no excuses. I completely forgot and I feel terrible about how you must have felt waiting at work for so long.\""

    {
      "title": "Apologize sincerely.",
      "content": "Apologize sincerely. A Sagittarius man will appreciate a genuine apology. As pretty forgiving and easygoing people, saying you're sorry can really go a long way to make amends with a Sagittarius. [4] X Research source Just make sure that your apology is sincere by acknowledging his feelings, expressing your remorse, and speaking from the heart. If he's upset that you've been ditching him to make other plans lately, you might say, \"I'm truly sorry I haven't been making you a priority. I really regret taking you for granted and want you to know how much I love spending time with you.\" Anderson offers advice on crafting a good, honest apology. She says, “If you regret your actions, apologize for your actions. If you do not regret your actions, apologize that your actions made the other people feel that way, for that was not your intent.”"

      "title": "Avoid making excuses or placing blame on him.",
      "content": "Avoid making excuses or placing blame on him. If you do this, it might make your Sagittarius man walk away for good. Sagittarius men are forgiving, but they value honesty and integrity above all else. Never blame them for something in order to feel less guilty about what happened. Similarly, don't make excuses if you made a mistake. A Sagittarius will feel disrespected by this kind of behavior and will likely close the door on any chance of forgiveness. Avoid saying things like, \"I only did this because you were making me angry\" or \"I'm sorry you feel that way, but it really wasn't my fault.\" A Sagittarius will interpret those kinds of statements as ways to shift the blame and avoid taking responsibility for your actions. Even if you really messed up, admitting your mistake directly will give you a much better chance at gaining a Sagittarius's forgiveness. As the risk-takers of the Zodiac, they likely understand what it's like to make a mistake and will have empathy for your experience. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Listen to his response.",
      "content": "Listen to his response. A Sagittarius won't be afraid to let you know how you hurt them. If you messed up and feel bad about it, it might be hard to hear what he has to say about it. To really earn his forgiveness, you'll need to do this no matter how hard it may be. Give him the chance to respond, nod along and listen attentively as he speaks, and avoid getting defensive. [6] X Research source Put your phone away when you're talking to each other. If you're unsure about something he said, ask follow-up questions. [7] X Research source You might also try rephrasing what he said in your own words to check that you understood him correctly."

      "title": "Give him space to process the conversation.",
      "content": "Give him space to process the conversation. A Sagittarius man may need to figure out his feelings by himself first. Those with this sun sign are very independent and they need a lot of space to thrive. In conflict, that might look like taking some time to themselves before a situation is resolved. [8] X Research source If this Sagittarius guy needs some time to process before he can forgive you, respect that. Don't push him to forgive you before he's ready, as that could make him feel overwhelmed or stressed by the situation. At the end of your conversation, you might say, \"I totally understand if you need some time before you can forgive me. Just know I'm always here to talk about it.\" If he tells you explicitly that he needs space, say something like, \"I completely understand. Let me know whenever you're ready to talk again.\" Eyedealism shares how much Sagittariuses value space and freedom and warns against coming off too demanding or controlling, as that’s likely to push them away even more."

    {
      "title": "Show him that you won't make the same mistake again.",
      "content": "Show him that you won't make the same mistake again. Sagittarius men have a strong sense of justice, which means they won't stick around to be disrespected more than once. [9] X Research source After you've apologized, make it clear that you will change your actions going forward. That can really help you win back a Sagittarius guy's trust. Perhaps you said something that really offended him. To gain his forgiveness, you might say, \"I realize now that I need to think before I speak. Going forward, I'll always be mindful of how my words affect people.\""

      "title": "Follow through with your actions.",
      "content": "Follow through with your actions. After your conversation, stay true to your commitment to change. A Sagittarius man will want to be around someone who lives with integrity just as he does, so you'll need to keep your word. Live out your promise to change and be mindful of how your actions affect the Sagittarius guy you care about. [10] X Research source Let's say you promised you would be more reliable. When you make plans in the future, write down your commitments with this Sagittarius guy in your calendar so you won't forget about them or be late."

      "content": "Don’t try to get a response by making him jealous. If apologizing to him has yet to yield any results, and you’re thinking about parading around someone new to make him jealous— don’t. A Sagittarius man will take this one of two ways, and neither of them are good: he’ll either assume you’ve moved on immediately and won’t care to chase you, or he’ll know you’re doing it to get a rise out of him or otherwise elicit a response. It’s a lose-lose situation, so don’t play games with this fire sign. You could get burned for good."

      "content": "Work toward a future together if he forgives you. A Sagittarius likes to forge bold, new paths in life. If they've forgiven you and want to move forward with your relationship , look towards a positive future with them. Bring up new conversation topics, make adventurous plans, and keep treating them like you would want to be treated. Do your best to avoid lingering on the past. Mistakes happen, and if this Sagittarius has forgiven you, they likely really mean it. [11] X Research source Eyedealism believes Sagittariuses to be pretty flakey by nature, so if they forgive you and try to make it work— you should consider yourself very lucky. He says, “If they come closer, and engage in intimacy and stick around, that's a big thing for Sagittarius men.”"

    {
      "title": "Accept his response if he doesn't forgive you.",
      "content": "Accept his response if he doesn't forgive you. You can't make someone forgive you, especially a Sagittarius. People with this sign are independent thinkers and are particularly strong-willed. If this Sagittarius man says he's not ready to forgive you, it's best to respect his space and accept that. Rather than pressuring him to change his mind, take a step back and focus on learning from your mistakes. [12] X Research source Acknowledge that you messed up to yourself, but work towards forgiving yourself. That way, you can move on and treat people better in the future. You might consider telling this Sagittarius guy that the door is always open if he ever changes his mind. Say something like, \"I totally understand and respect your feelings. If you ever change your mind, I'm always here.\" Eyedealism notes that Sagittariuses are among the least committal of all signs, right after Gemini , so them choosing to end a relationship would not be out of the norm and should therefore not be taken personally."

If he forgives you, try to move forward and make exciting plans for your future together. You can plan a trip, take up a fun new hobby together, or throw a themed party. If he doesn’t forgive you, respect his choice and take a step back to focus on yourself. You can let him know that the door is always open should he change his mind later on."
