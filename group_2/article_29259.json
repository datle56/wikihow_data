      "content": "Hang your necklaces and bracelets around tubes so they don’t tangle. Use an empty paper towel roll so you have more hanging space, but you can use a toilet paper tube for a shorter holder. Paint or glue a piece of fabric or vinyl around the roll so the cardboard doesn’t show through. Hot-glue the roll horizontally to a candlestick or the top of a vertical tube so there’s room for your necklaces and bracelets to hang down. Then, drape your jewelry over the ends of the roll. [1] X Research source Decorate your jewelry holder with some faux flowers to make it look more elegant. Cardboard tubes also work really well for storing watches."

      "content": "Try this natural look for your earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. You can buy decorative branches from your local hobby store or find your own outside. If you don’t want to attach the base of the branch to anything, simply put it in a vase. Otherwise, hot-glue the thickest end of the branch into the center of a wooden plaque so it’s vertical. Once the glue dries, screw through the back of the plaque into the branch so it stays really secure. Hot-glue additional branches if you want additional places to hang your jewelry. Then, just slide your jewelry on all of the vertical twigs at the top. [2] X Research source Use spray paint to recolor the branch and the plaque if you want to make your jewelry tree more striking. Use an accent color or choose something that matches the rest of your decor. You can also screw the branch into the bottom of an old wooden bowl. That way, you can easily toss rings, bracelets, and other jewelry inside."

      "content": "Revamp an old grater into a stylish earring holder. Clean off your old grater as much as you can and rough up the surface with any sandpaper. You can leave the grater as-is, or you can use an oil-based paint to give it an accent color that stands out in your room. If you paint the grater, wait for it to dry completely before using it. Just hook your earrings in the grater’s holes whenever you aren’t wearing them. [3] X Research source Try screwing hooks into the holes on one side of the grater so you can hang up necklaces and bracelets as well. If you want to make the grater more decorative, then hot-glue pearl beads to the bottom corners after painting."

      "title": "Set rings, earrings, and bracelets here so they’re easy to grab and go.",
      "content": "Set rings, earrings, and bracelets here so they’re easy to grab and go. Get 2 plates of any size and a short candlestick holder. If you want to, use paint pens to draw designs on the plate to make them pop a little more. Once the paint dries, use super glue to attach the base of the candlestick holder to the center of 1 plate. Then, add glue to the top of the candlestick holder and press the bottom of the second plate on top. Set a heavy book on top of the plate until the glue dries. [4] X Research source If you use 2 different-sized plates, use the larger plate on the bottom so it’s more balanced."

      "content": "Store rings and pins in a felted box to keep them safe and organized. You can use any small box, such as an empty recipe box or a decorative wooden box from a hobby store. Measure the depth and width of your box, and then cut strips of felt that are the same width as the box. Starting from the longest edge, fold over a section of felt that’s the same height as the box. Flip the fabric over and then make another fold. Fold the entire strip like this so it looks like an accordion. Stitch or staple the ends of the felt together before gluing them into the bottom of the box with craft glue. Push your rings or pins between the felt folds so they stay in place. [5] X Research source You don’t have to use folded felt for your entire box. For example, you could keep half of the box empty so you can store loose jewelry or other trinkets."

      "content": "Slide your rings onto the fingers for a really decorative look. Cut the ends off of an empty plastic bottle and slide a glove over one side. Tape the wrist of the glove tight against the bottle and position it so the fingers point down. Mix plaster following the directions on the package and slowly pour it through the bottle into the glove. Let the plaster dry and harden completely before peeling off the glove. After it dries, display your rings on the fingers. [6] X Research source You could also drape necklaces or bracelets between the fingers, but they could get tangled."

      "content": "Loop your necklaces and bracelets on the hanger rod for a simple solution. Use a wooden hanger with a rod since it’ll look better than a plain wire hanger. Use a screwdriver to attach screw-in hooks or pegs along the length of the hanger rod so you can easily hang your jewelry. If you don’t have hooks, just clasp your necklace or bracelet around the rod so it goes through the middle. [7] X Research source Paint or wrap the hanger in fabric if you want to customize it even more."

      "content": "Bracelets and necklaces easily fit on the tines of this rustic alternative. Use a garden rake with a metal head that has straight tines so your jewelry doesn’t slide off. Cut the handle off of the rake with a saw. Secure the rake against your wall with nails or screws so the tines point straight out. Then, just slide your jewelry onto the tines. [8] X Research source The rake tines could be sharp, so be careful when you’re hanging or grabbing your jewelry."

      "content": "Try this for a simple, natural way to store your necklaces and bracelets. You can find your own piece of driftwood or buy a piece you like from your local craft store. Rather than using hooks or pegs to display your jewelry, hot-glue some decorative stones along the length of your driftwood. Wrap pieces of twine around the ends of the driftwood. Secure the other ends of the twine to your wall with screws or nails so your jewelry holder hangs level. [9] X Research source You can also try hanging a tree branch on your wall so you have more places to hang your jewelry. Keep the branch pointed up or at an angle so your jewelry doesn’t slip off.

      "content": "Paint stir sticks with hooks prevent necklaces and bracelets from tangling. Cut off the curved section of your stir stick as well as 2 pieces that are 1 in (2.5 cm) long. Glue the end pieces you just cut on the back of the stir stick so they’re flush with the ends. Pre-drill holes through the ends of the stir stick so it’s easier to attach later. Then, paint the stick whatever color you want to match your decor. Add hooks or pegs along the length of the stick, and position it horizontally level against your wall before screwing it in. [11] X Research source Attach multiple stir sticks to your wall end to end to display a long line of jewelry."

      "content": "Organize all your jewelry into tray compartments for a clean look. Get a wooden silverware tray that has multiple compartments from a home goods store. Paint the trays whatever colors pop in your room so you can match the rest of your decor. Hold the tray vertically and secure adhesive hooks at the top of each compartment so you can hang longer pieces of jewelry. Then, nail, screw, or use adhesive strips to attach your silverware holder vertically to your wall. [12] X Research source Try cutting out and gluing scrapbook paper to the back of each tray compartment for added colors and designs. The bottoms of each compartment also work well for holding loose jewelry, such as rings or bracelets."

      "content": "You can drape anything over the pins with this minimalist holder. Cut a piece of corkboard to the size you want for your jewelry holder. Set a piece of fabric that’s 1 in (2.5 cm) longer than the corkboard on each side with the “good” side face down. Put your corkboard in the middle of the fabric, and glue down the loose edges with fabric glue. Flip your corkboard over and push pins through the fabric wherever you want to hang your jewelry. [13] X Research source You don’t need to add fabric to your corkboard, but it does make it look more attractive. If you want to make hanging earrings easier, poke a hole in the corkboard with a pin first and slide the earring hook through it."

      "content": "Pegboard makes it easy to add hooks for necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. You can leave your pegboard plain or paint it whatever color fits well in your space. Secure your piece of pegboard to your wall using nails or screws so it doesn’t come down. Slide some hooks through the holes at the top of the pegboard so you have spots for your long necklaces and bracelets. If you have earrings, just hook them through the holes as is. [14] X Research source You can also get shelf-holders that fit in pegboard holes so you can set your rings or other decorations on a shelf."

      "content": "Add a touch of class to your decor with this framed earring holder. Take an old picture frame and trace the shape of it onto the piece of fabric you’re using. Cut out your piece of fabric with a pair of scissors so it’s the same size as the frame. Staple the fabric onto the back of the frame so it’s secure and flush with the edges. After you hang your frame on the wall, simply loop your earring hooks through the fabric so they stay in place. [15] X Research source You can paint or add decor to the frame if you want to. Screw hooks into the bottom of the frame so you have a place to hang your bracelets and necklaces too. For a more rustic approach, try stapling chicken wire to the back of the frame instead of fabric. [16] X Research source"
