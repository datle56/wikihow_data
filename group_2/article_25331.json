      "content": "When a user restricts you, you can still leave comments on their posts. The catch is, these comments will only be visible to you , not other people who view the post. [1] X Research source The best way to find out if you're restricted is to comment on one of their posts and ask a mutual friend if they can see your comment. If your comment isn't visible to your friend but you're able to see it just fine, the post's creator likely restricted your account. If the post has a lot of comments, it might be tricky for your friend to find the one you left. Make sure your friend check's the comment list thoroughly before jumping to conclusions. If the person restricted you, they'll see \"restricted comment\" instead of your actual comment. If they want, they can tap the See comment link below this message and choose to Approve or Delete it."

      "content": "If you've exchanged direct messages with the person in the past, look for their Activity Status in your inbox. As long as you haven't disabled your own Activity Status , you'll see a green dot or a timestamp next to the profile photo of each person who also has Activity Status enabled. [2] X Research source If you know the person you're worried about is active online right now and you both for sure have Activity Status enabled, they may have restricted your account. This isn't the most reliable way to find out if you're restricted as many people disable Activity Status for privacy reasons. But if you've always been able to see statuses like \"Active yesterday\" \"Active 30m ago\" but don't now, it's possible they've restricted you."

      "content": "Usually when someone reads your DMs on Instagram, you'll see the \"Seen\" status in your inbox. However, if a person has you restricted, you'll never see if or when they've opened your message . If you send a DM and it remains unseen indefinitely, you might be restricted. This can be a tricky way to determine whether you're restricted, as some people don't read their Instagram messages right away. However, if the person has been quick to respond in the past but no longer opens your messages, they've likely restricted you."
