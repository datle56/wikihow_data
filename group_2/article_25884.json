      "content": "Use a good 8\"-10\" carpenter level placed in the center of the top, front-to-back and side-to-side. Legs are screwed partway in, so just lift the range a bit and turn the leg in or out a turn or two to adjust. There are four legs so when you are done, make sure the range doesn't rock. If so, screw a short leg out or a long leg in, making sure the range remains level front-to-back and side-to-side."

      "content": "Now try your level on the burners. They may still be unlevel. The reason is that the top of the range is bowed down in the center. The frame around the edge keeps it level but nothing supports the center. Time and heat have had their way. Proof: Put the level in the center of the top, pointing front and back. It shows level. Now slide it to the front. No longer level, right? Same in the back, because the top is dished. How about fixing it? You can do this, one burner at a time Each burner has three supporting legs besides the connector. This is fortunate because it won't wobble if you make adjustments--a three-legged stool never wobbles."

      "title": "Remove the burner and use a file or grinder to remove some metal.",
      "content": "Remove the burner and use a file or grinder to remove some metal. Take a little bit at a time. You only have to remove metal from the bottom of the leg where it rests on the burner pan, from the tip to a point about 3/4\" back. Start by taking a little at a time and test-fitting after each pass Caution: Don't take off so much metal that you remove the tip that hooks into the burner pan. If you need to remove that much, leave the tip and file a depression behind it where the leg contacts the pan"

      "content": "Since you have now customized each burner to its spot don't mix them up. In the future never remove more than one (or one big and one small) burner at a time for cleaning."
