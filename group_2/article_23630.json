      "title": "Opaque white is the color of the Moon.",
      "content": "Opaque white is the color of the Moon. White contains every color within it, but it also represents simplicity, good virtue, and deep spirituality. Wear white or silver clothing throughout the week and especially on Mondays (the Moon’s day) to harness the benefic powers of the Moon and improve your peace of mind. [1] X Research source Wearing black or other dark colors will have the opposite effect on the Moon’s energy, so stick to whites and brights when you’re planning your outfits. Transparent shades of bluish-white actually represent the planet Venus. Wear pure shades of white (like cloud-white or snow-white) to make sure you’re channeling the Moon specifically."

Both the Moon and meditative practices may bring you peace of mind and soothe turbulent or negative emotions, especially when you add in some deep breathing practices . Meditate in the moonlight or in a space where you have a clear view of the Moon to remedy loneliness, depression, or sleeping problems. Regular practice is most likely to bring you the best results. [17] X Research source Meditate in silence, or try chanting a Moon Mantra or a prayer to Lord Shiva for the strongest connection to the Moon. Reflect on your emotional needs while you meditate as a form of self-care. As Garbis explains, the Moon “reveals your innermost feelings and emotions” and may help you find balance and solutions to any inner turmoil. If meditation isn’t really your thing, try to cultivate other reflective practices that help you to introspect, set intentions , and release emotional baggage. For example, you might try journaling or lunar yoga."

Treat your mother or other maternal figures with respect and follow their wishes and advice if you feel symptoms of a weak Moon. [18] X Research source Disobeying or arguing with these women will cause more bad luck. Show the Moon your good relationship by sitting with your mother or maternal mentor during purnamasi (a full moon) and chanting a Moon Mantra or a prayer to Shiva together. [19] X Research source If you’re dining together, eat with your own hands. Bad luck will follow if you let your mother or maternal figure feed you instead of accepting the Moon’s nourishing food directly."

      "content": "Shiva is a major Hindu god with a strong attachment to the Moon. Offer prayers to Lord Shiva , especially in direct moonlight or during a full moon, to earn both his and the Moon’s blessings. For help overcoming specific obstacles in your life, recite the Shiv Chalisa (a hymn dedicated to Shiva) while focusing on the problem you want to solve. [20] X Research source To strengthen your Shiv Chalisa, look at a picture of Shiva while you speak and try to be as focused and sincere as possible."
