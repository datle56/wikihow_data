      "content": "Understand that fairies are more than just the wings. [1] X Research source Fairies live in and make use of the natural world. They wear flowers in their hair and around the necks and wrists. Fairies embrace a wild beauty; they aren't overly-tidy and their style is exuberant, rather than tailored. Fairies appear fragile but can be strong and protective about their family. Fairy clothing is old-fashioned and romantic. Think long skirts, lace and ribbons, a Shakespearean aesthetic. Fairy hair is very natural, so no need to over-process it with perms, dyes or straighteners. Take care of your hair with regular deep conditioning treatments. Fairies glow, so take care of your skin. Wash, exfoliate and moisturize for a healthy glow."

      "title": "Create fairy hair.",
      "content": "Create fairy hair. Keep your hair natural and whimsical. Messy bohemian styles best capture the fairy look. [2] X Research source If you have long hair, wear it down or in braids. For those who prefer shorter hair, consider a pixie cut or a messy bob. Fairy-like details include piece-y (not perfectly even) bangs and tousled hair. Adorn your hair with ribbons and flowers. Antique pins and barrettes also make for a nice fairy look."

      "title": "Use make-up to create a natural, fairy look.",
      "content": "Use make-up to create a natural, fairy look. Fairy beauty is fresh, glowy and wide-eyed. [4] X Research source Wear lip-gloss or a sheer lipstick. Look for products with shimmer. Avoid matte lipsticks, as these are too heavy. Good color choices include pink, red and wine. Widen your eyes with mascara and light eye-shadow. Choose a good mascara and use only one coat to avoid heavy, spidery lashes. Look for light, shimmering shadows. Mocha, silver and moss-green are some good color options."

      "title": "Dress like fairy.",
      "content": "Dress like fairy. Fairy fashion is feminine and ethereal, old-fashioned and romantic. [5] X Research source Wear sleeveless tops, short sleeve tops, long sleeve tops, any top is fine short skirts, knee length skirts long skirts, long flowy pants, leggings, and flowy dresses. Look for cotton lycra, satin, tulle, chiffon, cotton jersey, cotton spandex, rayon fabrics and filigree detailing. Err on the side of demure. In summer, you can show your arms, shoulders and perhaps some décolleté, but avoid hems that are too high (think thigh-high) and plunging necklines. For your winter wardrobe, check out the winter fashions of 19th-century Russia. The long coats, muffs and round hats capture the romantic fairy look. Accessorize with headbands and jewelry. Again, antique designs, beads, ribbons and flowers create a romantic and whimsical fairy look. Fairies are often barefoot, but this is not practical. Flat shoes, sandals and Mary Janes are excellent choices. Low-heeled shoes are acceptable, but exceedingly high, stiletto heels are not compatible with the free and easy fairy look."

If the wings are plain, consider decorating them with glitter, flowers and beads."
