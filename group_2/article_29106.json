      "content": "Ask your friend ahead of time for tips. Before you meet your friend’s parents, try to learn a little about them so that you can avoid accidentally offending them. Ask your friend what you can do to make a good first impression on their parents. If their parents disapprove of a certain hobby, avoid bringing it up. For example, if they dislike skateboarding, don’t mention that you have a skateboard. Instead, discuss your other hobbies. If their parents like something, on the other hand, you can find a way to bring it into conversation. For example, if their dad was a musician, you can say, “I heard you used to be in a band. That’s so interesting. Do you have any cool stories?”"

      "content": "Dress appropriately for the situation. Choose clothing that is fitting for the location.

[3] X Research source Make sure that your clothes are clean and unwrinkled. Remember to brush your hair. If you know your friend’s parents like them to dress a certain way, you might want to copy that style. For example, if they don’t like tank tops, make sure to wear a shirt with sleeves. Reader Poll: We asked 1307 wikiHow readers how they usually dress for a first meeting with their friend or partner's parents, and only 6% of them said they like to wear something that makes a statement . [Take Poll] Most people prefer—and recommend—to wear something that’s put together, comfortable, represents them well, and is appropriate for the occasion."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Avoid talking about politics, religion, or other touchy subjects, as you might accidentally offend their parents. If they ask you how you are, answer politely, and ask them back in return. Avoid one-word answers like “fine” or “OK.” Instead, answer with full sentences. You can say, “I’m doing pretty well today, thanks. How are you?” If you ask them questions, try to make them open-ended ones which require more than a yes or no response. For example, say, “How did you get into the publishing business, Mrs. Darcy?”"

      "content": "Talk about your successes if asked. Some parents may try to interview you to see if you are a good influence on their child. Avoid talking about any bad habits, failures, or vices that you may have. Instead, focus on your positive qualities. For example, you may be asked what you do for a living. If you don’t have a job, you can say something like, “I’m still looking for a job. I’ve had some positive leads recently, so fingers crossed!” Be honest when answering, but frame things in a positive light. For example, if they ask how you are doing in a particular class, you can say, “I’m not the best at history. Algebra, on the other hand, is my favorite subject.”"
