      "content": "Scalp massages increase blood flow to your scalp and stimulate growth. Use a scalp massager machine or massage your scalp by hand daily for about 4 minutes. Although the effects on the length of your hair are minimal, the massage definitely helps your hair grow thicker (which will keep it looking full and luscious as it grows longer).

      "content": "Iron and zinc support the cells and protein needed to grow your hair. Eat foods like spinach and other dark, leafy greens, beans, whole grains, and seafood to maintain sufficient mineral levels. When iron and zinc are low, you might experience graying hair, delayed growth, or even hair loss. [4] X Research source The amount of iron and zinc you need depends on your age, sex, and lifestyle. Talk to your doctor before changing your daily mineral intake. If you struggle to get proper levels of vitamins and minerals from diet alone, consider adding a daily multivitamin to your wellness regimen.

Get more Vitamin D by spending some time in the sun each day and consuming Vitamin D-rich foods like fortified milk or fortified orange juice.

      "content": "Some people claim that essential oils make their hair thicker and denser. Choose your favorite oil out of rosemary , peppermint, lavender , tea tree, or thyme (they’re all great for hair) and dilute 2-3 drops in about 2 fl oz (59 mL) of a carrier oil like grapeseed, jojoba , or even olive oil. Add the mixture to your hair like a conditioner and leave it in for 30 minutes, then rinse. [10] X Research source Put a drop of your oil of choice on the back of your wrist as a test. If an hour passes and you don’t show any irritation, the oil is safe to use in your hair. Never apply undiluted essential oils to your hair.
