      "title": "Choose a spot for the pond that gets at least 8 hours of sun per day.",
      "content": "Choose a spot for the pond that gets at least 8 hours of sun per day. Lotuses love full sun, so set up the pond in an area that gets plenty of light. The ideal spot should get lots of sun in the morning; it should then be partly shaded from the hot afternoon sun. Afternoon shade discourages algae blooms and helps protect the plants from getting too much intense sunlight. [1] X Research source While trees can offer shade, avoid digging the pond directly beneath a canopy. Fallen leaves and other debris can soil the water, and roots can get in the way of excavation. Additionally, choose a site that's relatively close to your back door or patio. If the pond is out of sight and out of mind, it may be neglected. Plus you won't be able to enjoy your blooms or, if you install one, the trickle of a fountain feature. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dig an 8 to 24 in (20 to 61 cm) deep hole for the pond.",
      "content": "Dig an 8 to 24 in (20 to 61 cm) deep hole for the pond. A depth of about 8 in (20 cm) is fine if you live in a warm climate and are only growing lotus plants in the pond. However, if you plan on keeping fish in the pond, dig a hole with a minimum depth of 18 in (46 cm). If your plants and fish need to get through a cold winter, at least one side of the pond should be below frost depth, or at least 32 in (81 cm) deep. [4] X Research source The pond's other dimensions depend on the number of plants (and fish, if applicable) you intend to keep. As a rule of thumb, an individual lotus needs about 2 ft (61 cm) of space. To maintain water quality, the pond should be at least 40 ft 3 (1.13 m 3 ), or about 300 gal (about 1100 L). For an 18 in (46 cm) deep pond, that translates to a length and width of roughly 7 by 4 ft (2.1 by 1.2 m). While you should be able to dig a 7 by 4 by 1 1 ⁄ 2 ft (2.13 by 1.22 by 0.46 m) hole without power tools, a larger pond may require professional excavation equipment. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Line the pond with rubber or plastic.",
      "content": "Line the pond with rubber or plastic. Stiff, preformed plastic pond liners are the least expensive option, but they're harder to work with and aren't very durable. The best option is synthetic rubber pond liner. Be sure your product is labeled for ponds, as other varieties are toxic to fish and plants. [6] X Research source Look for pond liners online and at home improvement stores. Cut your liner to fit the pond, and overlap the edges by about 12 in (30 cm). Then bury the excess liner around the pond's edges with well-packed dirt to hide and weigh down the material. The liner will prevent water from seeping into the ground, which will help you maintain a constant depth."

      "title": "Add 4 in (10 cm) of sand, clay, and fertilizer if you're not using pots.",
      "content": "Add 4 in (10 cm) of sand, clay, and fertilizer if you're not using pots. If you're planting your lotuses directly into the pond, add a dense mix of 1 part sand, 1 part clay, and slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer to the bottom of the pond. Then cover the mixture with a thin layer of heavy sand or gravel to help weight it down. Don't line the pond with regular garden soil, which will float and muddy the water. [7] X Research source If you're incorporating other plants or keeping fish in the pond, plant your lotuses in pots to control their growth. Additionally, if you plant your lotuses in containers, keeping the water clean will be less work. You should also avoid planting directly into the pond if you live in a cooler climate. Find slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer online or at a local garden center. Use your product according to the label's instructions. If you're stocking the pond with fish, be sure to purchase a fish-safe fertilizer. Even if you're planting lotuses in containers, you can still cover the pond's bottom with gravel or sand and line the edges with river rocks to add aesthetic appeal. Just take care not to stretch or tear the pond liner when you add soil or rocks."

      "content": "Fill the pond with collected rainwater or with tap water from a hose. When you add water, try not to use so much pressure that you disturb the sand or soil bedding and muddy the water. If you use tap water from the hose, let it stand for a week before adding lotuses (and other plants or fish). [8] X Research source Letting tap water stand lowers chlorine levels. It's also wise to test the water with a store-bought test kit, especially if you're stocking the pond with fish."

      "title": "Amend the water if you're keeping fish in the pond.",
      "content": "Amend the water if you're keeping fish in the pond. If necessary, lower chlorine, ammonia, and nitrite levels to 0 ppm (parts per million), and bring the pH to roughly 7.0 (neutral). Find water test kits and amendments online or at pet stores and garden centers. [9] X Research source Fish are more sensitive to high ammonia and nitrite levels, so treating the water takes a little more work. If you're only growing lotuses, just letting the water stand for a week should do the trick. If chlorine is still present after a week, you can add a store-bought dechlorinator to the water."

It'll help keep the pond water from becoming stagnant and deter mosquitoes, algae, and other nuisances. [10] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If you're keeping fish in the pond, the aerator will oxygenate the water and keep them from suffocating. Solar powered aerators are available, but if you want the most reliable product, you'll need an electrician to install a power line to the pond."

[11] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source All-in-one kits with pumps and mechanical filters are available. Biological systems, which are starter colonies of healthy bacteria, are also necessary, but they're usually sold separately. After adding the biological media to the pond, you'll need to wait 6 to 8 weeks for the bacteria to multiply. [12] X Research source If you're keeping fish and use a filtration system, your pond can handle 2 lb (0.91 kg) of fish per 100 US gal (380 L) of water. [13] X Research source"

Plant your lotuses in mid-spring once the average daytime high is over 70 °F (21 °C) and the pond maintains a warm water temperature. To help warm the water faster, you could also use a submersible pond or aquarium heater. Lotus plants will begin to grow only once the water and daytime air temperatures reach 70 °F (21 °C)."

      "content": "Use 2 to 3 ft (0.61 to 0.91 m) containers to control your plants' growth. If you don't contain them, lotuses will take over the entire pond. To maintain the water quality and keep fish and other plants healthy, plant individual lotus plants in separate 2 ft (0.61 m) wide containers. Containers specifically designed for lotuses are wide and shallow; you can find them online or at a garden center. [15] X Research source Choose a round container, as square corners would choke the plant. Steer clear of standard aquatic plant basket meshes, which won't control lotuses' growth and could injure the roots. To ensure the lotuses' rhizomes are contained, go for containers without drainage holes. Black containers absorb heat well and can help keep your lotus plants at a comfortable temperature between 75 and 85 °F (24 and 29 °C). Black is also inconspicuous. Depending on your taste, you could choose other materials, such as terracotta."

Whether you're using a container or planting directly into the pond, dig a shallow hole in the soil mixture for the lotus tuber. Dig the hole in the center of a container to give the tuber room to grow. If you're planting directly into the pond, placing the tubers along the edges in 2 to 3 ft (0.61 to 0.91 m) intervals will encourage them to spread. If you're planting directly into the pond, take care not to disturb the soil and muddy the water when you dig holes. While it might be a bit inconvenient, you can't plant the tubers directly into the pond before filling it with water. The water needs to time to dechlorinate and heat up to the right temperature."

Position the tuber horizontally at a slight angle so the growing tips won't be covered by soil. Then gently cover the tuber with a 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) layer of the soil mixture, and carefully weigh it down with heavy sand or gravel so it doesn't float. [16] X Research source The growing tips are pointed and look like buds. The other end of the tuber is round."

After planting a lotus tuber in a container, set the pot into the pond so the top of the soil is about 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) below the surface of the water. If the pond is deep, elevate the container on top of bricks. [17] X Research source Lotuses can grow in water up to 18 in (46 cm) deep, but they'll bloom a lot faster if the soil is covered by only 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of water. If you're stocking the pond with koi, plant several lotuses in individual containers. Koi will munch on plants; the more lotuses and other plants you grow, the less damage individual plants will incur."

Apply liquid or tablet aquatic plant fertilizer according to your product's instructions once a month until mid-fall. If you're keeping fish in the pond, remember to use fish-safe fertilizer. Slow-release fertilizer is preferable, as immediate-release products will encourage algae blooms."

Provided the water and daytime air temperatures remain above 70 °F (21 °C), your lotuses will grow steadily and bloom about 4 weeks after planting. Each flower lasts for 3 days; use a pair of sharp, clean pruning shears to remove spent blooms and yellow leaves down to the nearest growing shoot. [18] X Research source Clip spent foliage as soon as you notice it to encourage growth and prevent soiling the water. Never prune foliage below the water's, which could injure your lotuses."

Once the plants are growing actively, do your best to maintain a temperature between 75 and 85 °F (24 and 29 °C). If the water cools below that range, heat it with a submersible pond or aquarium heater. [19] X Research source If you're keeping fish in the pond, test the water's pH and ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels monthly. Amend the water, if necessary, to keep the pH neutral, ammonia and nitrate levels at 0 ppm, and nitrate levels less than 2 ppm.
