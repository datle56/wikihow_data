      "content": "Purchase adhesive hooks that can hold the weight of your curtains. Adhesive hooks come in different weight capacities, and you'll want to make sure the hooks you get are strong enough to hold up your curtains and curtain rod so they don't fall. Generally, adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) should work. [1] X Research source You'll need 2 adhesive hooks per pair of curtains you want to hang up. You can find adhesive hooks online or at your local hardware store. Since you'll be using 2 adhesive hooks, each hook only needs to hold half of the weight of your curtains. For example, if your curtains and curtain rod weigh 32 pounds (15 kg) in total, you would need 2 adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) each. Many adhesive hook brands have stylized versions, made with steel or wood rather than plastic. Opt for these varieties if the aesthetic of your curtains is important to you."

      "content": "Cut a right angle out of a piece of cardboard. Draw a square at least 2 in (5.1 cm) wide in the corner of the piece of cardboard. Then, cut it out with scissors to create a right angle. [2] X Research source You'll use the piece of cardboard with the right angle in the corner to mark where you want to hang up your adhesive hooks so they're level with each other."

      "title": "Align the cardboard with the window corner and mark the bottom of a hook on it.",
      "content": "Align the cardboard with the window corner and mark the bottom of a hook on it. The corner of the window should be aligned with the right angle you cut out of the cardboard. Hold one of the adhesive hooks over the cardboard where you want to hang it, and mark the bottom of it on the cardboard with a pencil. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Push a pencil through the mark on the cardboard to mark the wall. Keep the cardboard aligned with the corner of the window while you puncture it with the pencil. You want the mark on the wall to be directly behind the mark on the cardboard. [4] X Research source Try twisting and pressing on the pencil simultaneously to puncture the cardboard."

      "content": "Turn the cardboard over and mark the same spot on the other window corner. Align the right angle on the cardboard with the other side of the window, and use the pencil to make a mark through the hole you punctured in it. Now you should have a mark on each side of the window to show you where to hang your adhesive hooks. The marks should be level."

      "content": "Align the hooks with the marks and press them in for 30 seconds. Take the adhesive strip off of the back of your hooks and press them firmly on the wall so the marks you made are lined up with the bottoms of the hooks. [5] X Research source Make sure you press on the hooks for 30 seconds so the adhesive sticks."

      "title": "Let the adhesive on the hooks dry for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the adhesive on the hooks dry for at least 30 minutes. The adhesive on the hooks needs time to dry before it's secure. If you try to hang your curtains on the hooks too soon, they might fall down. [6] X Research source The exact amount of time you should wait may vary depending on the kind of adhesive hooks you're using. Refer to the packaging for specific instructions."

      "content": "Place your curtain rod on the hooks and test how well it holds. Your curtain rod should balance perfectly on the hooks. If it slides or tilts in one direction, the hooks might not be level. Try removing one of the hooks and checking to see that the marks are level. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "String your curtain on the curtain rod and hang it up. Run the curtain rod through the hoops at the top of your curtains and then hang it up again. Draw the curtains and let them sit for 1 hour to make sure the adhesive hooks can hold the weight. [8] X Research source If your curtain falls, either the adhesive didn't fully stick to the wall or your curtain may be too heavy for the hooks. Consider buying higher-weight capacity hooks, or use 2 adjacent hooks on each side to balance the weight a little better."

      "title": "Buy a tension rod that will fit inside your window.",
      "content": "Buy a tension rod that will fit inside your window. Tension rods have a spring mechanism inside of them that creates tension when the ends of the rod are pressed against a window frame. If the rod is too short, there won't be enough tension, and if the rod is too long, there will be too much tension. Tension rods generally list a window size range on the packaging, so look for one that will work based on the width of your window. [10] X Research source You can find tension rods online or at your local hardware store. If you have particularly heavy curtains, you may want to try adhesive strips instead of a tension rod. A tension rod is best for small, lightweight curtains."

The right way to adjust the length of your tension rod will depend on the model you're using, but generally, you'll pull or twist on the rod. You want the tension rod to be slightly longer than the width of your window so there's enough tension to hold it in place. [11] X Research source If you're not sure how to adjust the length of your tension rod, refer to the instructions that came with it."

      "content": "Take down the rod and hang your curtains on it. Slide the hoops or fasteners on your curtains onto the rod. Make sure all of the panels you want to use are on and facing the right direction since you'll need to take the tension rod down if you want to adjust them. [13] X Research source If your curtains have clips instead of hoops, you don't need to take the tension rod down to hang them up."
