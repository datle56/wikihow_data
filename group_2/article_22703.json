      "title": "Load your body weight.",
      "content": "Load your body weight. Sink your body down using your leg and core muscles so that your knees are bent and waist is lowered, and you are ready to explode. As you sink your body weight down, be sure to keep the tension in your upper back. You want to be in a 45 degree lean at this point. [2] X Research source Keeping your eyes on your opponents armpit is another good way to keep your back in the right position to prevent injury."

    {
      "title": "Ready your hands.",
      "content": "Ready your hands. Putting your hands in front of you will ensure that you’re ready to move. It helps you focus on what’s in front of you and helps keep your weight forward."

      "content": "Use leverage. Having this body posture will only help you hit harder if you’re in the correct positioning when your near your opponent. You want to be right on him, as though you’re stepping on his feet, when you are preparing to tackle him. Take his next step away from him."

    {
      "title": "Activate your arms.",
      "content": "Activate your arms. Use your arms for power by swinging them opposite of your legs. Each time you step with your left leg, your right arm should come through powerfully. Then, your right arm should swing back as your left arm moves forward with your right leg. The motor of your shoulder will help pick your legs up and down. Be aggressive with your arms. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have high knees.",
      "content": "Have high knees. If you activate your arms, it will help you drive your knees up. When running, your knee should come up to propel you forward, and then your foot should land directly beneath your body. This will help engage your hips and make you run faster toward your opponent. Your hips will roll through like an elastic band if you enact your shoulders and legs in your run."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run full speed the entire time.",
      "content": "Run full speed the entire time. The most common problem among players is that they let up before impact. This slow down makes for less hitting power. You want to cut your last step in half, but keep it as powerful and fast as the previous steps. This half step will allow you to align your body weight over your hips and help you hit harder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your whole body.",
      "content": "Use your whole body. Drive your entire body into your opponent. You do this by driving your hips forward through your shoulders for ultimate power. Driving your shoulder through them. This gives you the force to drive your opponent backwards, regardless of their size. Remember to hit low. This will help knock them out of balance. They will wave you off easily if you go in high. Your shoulder should hit in the number area of your opponent’s jersey. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap around your opponent.",
      "content": "Wrap around your opponent. Shoot your hands up and grab your opponent. Make sure not to grab them by only their jersey or you’ll be called for a penalty. Do not stop your feet to wrap your arms around them: it should be one fluid movement. Lock your arms around his body; if you cannot lock your arms, grab as much of his padding as you can.

    {
      "title": "Create rotation.",
      "content": "Create rotation. This ultimately helps override any of the force that your opponent has. The rotation is what will give you the advantage, even if you’re a smaller person. Use your right or left foot to push off as hard and as fast as you can to create this rotation. If you use your right foot, you’ll drive your opponent in a counter-clockwise motion: if you use your left foot, your opponent will rotate in a clockwise motion. This will create “rise” through the ball carrier. [6] X Research source A stronger lower body will help you take down your opponent with more force. Doing heavy lifts such as squats, deadlifts, thrusters, and hang cleans will increase your lower body strength."
