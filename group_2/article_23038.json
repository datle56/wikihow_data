      "content": "The word \"Lord\" is mentioned 7,888 times in the KJV.

      "content": "The word \"God\" is used 4,459 times in the KJV Bible. Christianity revolves around faith in God, so it’s only natural that this very word would be one of the most common ones found in the Bible. [3] X Research source NLT: 4,576 times NIV: 4,047 times ESV: 4,378 times NASB20: 4,374 times Example verse: “Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers.” Job 8:20"

      "content": "The word \"man\" is featured 2,640 times in the KJV Bible.

      "content": "The word \"Israel\" is used 2,568 times in the KJV Bible.

      "content": "The word \"people\" is used 2,141 times in the KJV Bible.

      "title": "Agape (aga-pay): unconditional love",
      "content": "Agape (aga-pay): unconditional love The Greek word \"agape\" is one of the best ways out there to describe how the God of Christianity loves His followers. It’s a type of love that has no strings attached—it’s freely offered even if the recipient chooses not to accept it. It’s also commonly associated with the concept of forgiveness, and absolving someone regardless of what they’ve said or done. [9] X Research source Example in the Bible: “But commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Romans 5:8"

      "title": "Hesed (kheh-sed): undeserved love",
      "content": "Hesed (kheh-sed): undeserved love Similar to agape, \"hesed\" (חֶסֶד) refers to a dedicated, steadfast love that God feels for mankind. It’s also represented in some of the ways that people love each other, like a parent caring diligently and patiently for their child. In the Hebrew translation of the Bible, hesed is often used to represent an active form of love, like Ruth’s decision to stay with her mother-in-law Naomi after Naomi’s sons and husband had passed away. [10] X Research source Example in the Bible: “How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.” Psalm: 36:7"

      "title": "Philia (fih-lee-uh): affectionate, platonic love",
      "content": "Philia (fih-lee-uh): affectionate, platonic love \"Philia\" is another Greek word for love—but instead of describing God’s love for mankind, it illustrates the love that people have for their friends and fellow human beings. [11] X Research source Philia was an important concept in Jesus’s ministry as he stressed the importance of loving one another (and even loving one’s enemy). [12] X Research source Example in the Bible: “Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another.” Romans 12:10"

      "content": "Ahav (ah-HAV): a broad type of love In Hebrew, \"ahav\" (אהב) means “to love,” while ahavah (אהבה) is simply the noun “love.” Both of these terms mention love in a very general sense and are used in a variety of Biblical scenarios, like describing David and Jonathan’s relationship in the Old Testament (2 Samuel 1:26). [13] X Research source Example in the Bible: “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.” Mark 12:30"

It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.” (NIV)"
