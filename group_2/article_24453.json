      "content": "These two will establish trust if they allow each other some space. A mutable sign, Gemini changes their mind often and can even be a little fickle in love. This, combined with their social nature, might threaten a more possessive Aries. A cardinal sign, Aries is a leader at heart and likes to feel in control of their life (relationship included). To make this pairing work, they'll have to relinquish control and allow their Gemini partner the freedom to be themselves. If Aries gives Gemini some room to change things up and hang out with their friends, Gemini will feel more comfortable settling down in the relationship. Gemini, in turn, can remind themselves to be more present. Asking questions, giving compliments, and listening to what their Aries partner has to say will go a long way in establishing trust."
