[2] X Research source Don't make the base too narrow, or you will have troubles slipping the mitten on and off. Cut the pattern out when you are done. Use regular scissors to cut the pattern, not your fabric scissors. You are adding the extra space for wiggle room and seam allowance. Keep your lines and curves smooth. You don't have to make the little bumps for the fingers. Think: basic mitten shape."

[8] X Research source Here are some ideas to get your started: Use embroidery thread in a contrasting color to make a blanket stitch around the bottom hem of your mitten. Keep the stitches loose, or your mitten won't stretch. Add simple embroidery to the top/front of each mitten. Braid some yarn, then weave it around the wrist of your mitten to make a tie cord. Attach a matching pompom to each end of the cord. Fold the cuff over to shorten it, then sew a wood or plastic button on top."
