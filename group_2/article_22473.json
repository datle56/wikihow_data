If you have a friend or family member who seems to be drinking too much, you might want to draw this to their attention. Showing them how their drinking is affecting those around them might be enough to get them interested in quitting—but you can't have this conversation when they're currently under the influence. [1] X Research source Use \"I\" statements to put the focus on you and how their drinking affects you, rather than being accusatory. For example, you might say, \"I was worried and scared last weekend when you got aggressive while drinking.\" Let them know that if they're ready to quit (or even just cut back), you'll be there for them and support them in any way you can. If the person resists or seems unwilling to quit, set firm boundaries related to their alcohol. For example, you might say, \"It's your decision not to quit, but I'll no longer cover for you if you're late to work because you were out drinking the night before.\""

They don't want you to tell them what they should do—they just want you to be a sounding board.
