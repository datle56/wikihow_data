Ask your doctor about oral suppression medication for you and/or your partner. [15] X Research source People with oral herpes (cold sores) can transfer the virus to the genitals of a partner during oral sex, particularly if they have an active sore. It’s best to avoid performing oral sex on a pregnant mother. If you don’t have herpes, be sure to use a condom each time you have sex when you are pregnant. Even if your partner doesn’t have symptoms, you could still contract herpes if you don’t use protection. Refrain from having sex when your partner has an outbreak at any time during your pregnancy. If you and your partner have the same strain of herpes, there is no risk in engaging in vaginal or oral sex in the third trimester. Your doctor can perform a blood test if you don’t know your herpes status."
