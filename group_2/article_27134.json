      "content": "Press the grated ginger to make ginger juice. Use a flexible rubber spatula to press the grated ginger against the sieve over the bowl. Drops of ginger juice will flow into the bowl below. As the grated ginger in the sieve becomes drier, form the grated bits into a mound, then press them repeatedly to yield more juice. [5] X Research source This process should yield approximately 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of fresh ginger juice. Set this aside. If needed, cut and juice a little more ginger to yield the amount needed."
