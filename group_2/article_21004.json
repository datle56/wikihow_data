      "content": "Going solo allows you to set your own schedule. When you go to a concert by yourself, you can plan out your day exactly how you want. You don’t have to worry about someone being late or having to rush to make it to the venue on time. Arrive in time to see the openers, or show up just before the headliner—it’s entirely up to you. [1] X Research source This also means you can take as much time as you want getting food or merch. If you feel like leaving early, there’s no one to pressure you to stay."

      "content": "You can get a better view in GA concerts. If your concert is general admission or standing room early, it’s easier to make your way to the front row if you’re by yourself. It’s a lot harder to move through the crowd as a group. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Attending alone can be more affordable.",
      "content": "Attending alone can be more affordable. Resellers often mark up prices for tickets seated together because they know it’s difficult to find seats for a group to sit together. Buying multiple tickets can be expensive, even if your friends pay you back later. When you go to a concert alone, it’s easier to grab a single ticket for a more affordable price and decide what you want to spend your money on. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "You have the opportunity to make new friends.",
      "content": "You have the opportunity to make new friends. Going to a concert alone doesn’t mean you have to stand by yourself all night. In fact, it can be a great way to meet new people. You already know you like the same music, so that can be a great conversation starter. You may even find future concert buddies by talking to those around you. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "It allows you to fully embrace the experience.",
      "content": "It allows you to fully embrace the experience. When you attend a concert by yourself, you don’t have to worry about how the people you’re with will affect your experience. You won’t have to coordinate bathroom breaks or trips to the concession stand. Sing and dance to your heart’s content without fear of interruption. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop caring what people think.",
      "content": "Stop caring what people think. It can be difficult to get over the fear of judgment, but it’s definitely worth it in the end. Focus on enjoying yourself and listening to the music. If you appear confident (even if you don’t feel that way on the inside), no one will question you. Remember, everyone is there to enjoy the concert. They’ll be so focused on having fun that they won’t notice who’s alone and who isn’t. [6] X Research source Even if someone does notice you’re alone, they’ll probably admire you for being brave enough to attend by yourself, as it’s something many people struggle with."

      "title": "Start with a small event to ease into it.",
      "content": "Start with a small event to ease into it. Stadium concerts can be overwhelming in general, so if possible, try going to a smaller venue for your first solo concert. This will help you become more comfortable with getting to and from the concert by yourself, as well as how to navigate the crowd when you’re there. [7] X Research source If going to any kinds of events alone causes you anxiety, consider starting even smaller, like going to a restaurant or movie theater by yourself."

      "title": "Talk to the people around you.",
      "content": "Talk to the people around you. It’s totally okay if you just want to enjoy the concert by yourself, but this is also a great opportunity to make new friends! Often, if people notice you’re there alone, they’ll try to include you in their conversation, but if you’re feeling brave, start talking to someone first. If you’re not sure what to say, ask which song they’re most excited for, if they’ve seen the artist live before, or if they know the opener. [8] X Research source Try an icebreaker like “Do you think they’ll play [x] song?” or “Have you seen the merch table?” Thanks to Taylor Swift and the Eras Tour, it’s now common for people to swap friendship bracelets during concerts for all kinds of artists. If you’re crafty, make some beforehand and offer them to people as a conversation starter. Be careful not to overshare when talking to new people. Most people will probably be harmless, but you don’t want the wrong person to hear that you’re alone. If you don’t feel like socializing, don’t force yourself! If there’s downtime between sets, take the opportunity to grab a snack or go to the bathroom. Or, just text your friends about how much fun you’re having! This can help you avoid feeling awkward when everyone else is chatting."

Odds are, as soon as your favorite musician comes on stage, you won’t even remember you’re alone. Sing, dance, and cry happy tears all night long. Live in the moment. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Going to a concert alone is perfectly normal. There’s nothing weird about attending a concert by yourself, so don’t let your fear of judgment stop you from doing what you enjoy. Everyone will be too busy enjoying their own experience to pay attention to other people in the crowd, anyway. Get comfortable doing things alone so you can live life to the fullest. [11] X Research source If someone does think it’s weird that you’re by yourself (which is unlikely), that says more about them than it does you. Besides, you’ll never have to see them again after the concert."

      "content": "Plan for transportation ahead of time. Know how you’re getting to and from the venue. If you’re driving yourself, make sure to check where the closest parking is and how much it costs. If you’re using a rideshare service like Uber , know where the dropoff and pickup locations are. Consider asking a friend or family member if they can drop you off and pick you up to relieve some stress. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Share your location. Sharing your location with someone you trust can help ease your mind. While it’s unlikely you’ll run into any problems while at the concert, this is a good safety precaution in case you get lost, hurt, or lose your phone. [13] X Research source If you have an iPhone, drop a pin on Maps to let others know where you are. If you don’t want to share your location, at least let someone know where you’re going in case of an emergency."

When attending a concert by yourself, it’s important to have a fully charged phone so you can contact your ride or call someone if you need help. Charge your phone beforehand and bring a charger pack if it starts to die during or after the concert. [14] X Research source To help your phone stay charged, keep it on low battery mode, turn on Do Not Disturb, and exit out of any apps you aren’t actively using. If your phone is close to 20%, limit yourself to taking photos only—no videos!"

      "content": "Bring an extra form of payment. While most concert venues are cashless, it’s a good idea to bring some cash or a second card in case of emergencies. Stash your extra money somewhere safe, like in an anti-theft bag , a hidden pocket, or in your socks or bra. [15] X Research source"

These are usually found on the venue’s website. [16] X Research source"

Drink plenty of water beforehand and make sure you have some on you during the concert. Some venues allow you to bring in a sealed bottle of water or an empty reusable bottle, so check the venue’s policies to avoid having to pay for a drink. [17] X Research source In many cases, if the concert is general admission, security will hand out water to those who need it. Alert them as soon as possible if you feel sick or lightheaded and can’t get out of the crowd. Be sure to eat beforehand as well, or plan to snack throughout the concert."

However, since you’re by yourself, it’s very important to know your limits so you can stay alert and get home safely. Try to stick to just one or two drinks or avoid alcohol altogether. [18] X Research source The same goes for any other substance use. Have fun, but know your limits."
