      "content": "Set up an outdoor work area for yourself. Tanning your own leather can be pretty messy, and is best done outside. Find a large, open area, like your backyard, where you can get your hands dirty. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of yard space, you could try making leather in your garage."

      "title": "Choose an animal hide to make into leather.",
      "content": "Choose an animal hide to make into leather. Most animal hides will work for your project. Making natural leather is a pretty niche pastime, so there aren’t a lot of specific recommendations out there. However, some experts suggest starting out with a squirrel or deer hide, since they’re easy to work with. [2] X Research source Rabbit hides are pretty thin, and a bit trickier to prepare."

      "title": "Set aside a fleshing knife, a skinning knife, and a knife with a flat, dull edge.",
      "content": "Set aside a fleshing knife, a skinning knife, and a knife with a flat, dull edge. A fleshing knife is a long, straight blade that helps remove the flesh from the animal. A skinning knife is a little smaller than a fleshing knife, and has a smaller, curved blade. You’ll use this knife to cut into the hide after you’ve fully tanned it. [3] X Research source The dull edge of your third knife will help you de-hair the hide. [4] X Research source Try to find a fleshing knife with a handle on each end of the blade. This will make it a lot easier to use."

      "title": "Collect plenty of shredded bark and 2 large sticks.",
      "content": "Collect plenty of shredded bark and 2 large sticks. Set aside enough tree bark to fill a standard bucket about halfway. Any tree bark will work for this, but try to collect some from a fallen tree instead of a living one. The shredded bark will be the main ingredient in your tanning mixture, and you’ll use 1 of the sticks to stir your homemade “brew.” You’ll use the other stick to soften your leather later on. [5] X Research source Tree bark is naturally high in tannins—these are molecules that help protect your leather and keep it from breaking down."

      "title": "Grab lots of twine or cord, a wool sock, and natural leather conditioner.",
      "content": "Grab lots of twine or cord, a wool sock, and natural leather conditioner. Once your leather is tanned and prepped, you’ll need to hang it up in a wooden frame with cord or twine. At that point, you’ll apply leather conditioner all over the leather with your wool sock. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a wool sock, feel free to use a sponge instead."

      "title": "Soak the hide in a bucket of water for 2 days and rinse it off.",
      "content": "Soak the hide in a bucket of water for 2 days and rinse it off. This helps make the skin more pliable. Once you finish soaking the hide, rinse it off in clean water to wash away any leftover blood in the skin. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that a soaked skin will be extremely heavy, so ask a friend or loved one for help if you need it. You don’t have to soak the skin if you don’t want to. However, make sure your hide isn’t completely dry when you start scraping off the flesh. [8] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Then, stir 2-3 coffee cans worth of wood ash into about 3 US gal (11 L) of water. [11] X Research source Submerge your skin in this mixture and let it soak for 3 to 4 days. [12] X Research source Bucking helps shift the pH of your hide, which makes it easier to tan. [13] X Research source You can buy wood ash from an online marketplace like Amazon or Etsy."

Place the skin into the mixture for at least 6 days, so the hair comes off easily. [14] X Research source The hydrated lime mixture helps loosen the hair, so it’s much easier to slide off your hide."

Let the hide soak for at least 1 day, so the lime stops working into your hide. [17] X Research source If you don’t have any lactic acid, use 1 US pt (0.47 L) of vinegar instead."

[23] X Research source Slice a sliver off a thick portion of your hide—if it’s dyed all the way through, then you can take it out of the bark solution. It might take several months before the hide is completely tanned. [24] X Research source For instance, a deer hide could take up to 6 months to tan completely. This may seem time-consuming, but it’s a really important part of the process. Since leather is essentially the skin of a living animal, tanning prevents this skin from breaking down and rotting.

Just mix 1 part beeswax, 1 part cocoa butter, and 2 parts sweet almond oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Once all the ingredients melt, move the saucepan off the burner, letting it cool for 30 to 40 minutes. Then, rub the cooled wax mixture all over your leather, and then buff it down with a clean cloth. [31] X Research source You can also make leather conditioner with natural baby soap. Simply fill a large bucket or basin with 1 US qt (0.95 L) of warm water. Then, stir in 2-3 drops of vinegar, along with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of natural baby soap. Then, dip a clean cloth into the mixture and rub it all over the leather. You can also use melatonin wax to soften your leather."
