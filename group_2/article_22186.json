He that saith, \"I know Him\", and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in Him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked (1 John 2:3-6). Moreover, Jesus said, If ye love me, keep my commandments (John 14:15). He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him (John 14:21). If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His love (John 15:10)."
