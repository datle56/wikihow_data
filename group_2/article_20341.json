      "content": "Master the art of the selfie. If you’re going to try to get a particular girl to on Facebook to like you, you first have to have an interesting profile picture that shows your full form — it’s going to be the first visual impression she gets of you. Have a profile picture with your face. If the girl doesn’t know you well, she’ll want to see your whole face and body. She will also begin to have positive vibes circle throughout her being if you do this every so often. [1] X Research source Instead of going for something absurd, make your profile default picture a clear headshot, preferably with you smiling charmingly, well-dressed from head to toe, and looking good. Don’t go for any overly posed mirror selfies; you don’t want to look too vain. Make sure your image is a high-resolution shot that’s nicely cropped. Pixelated photos with half of your face cut off will not look good. Save your other photos — pictures that are more than one year old, baby pictures, and pictures with other people — for your other albums."

      "title": "Choose a cool cover photo.",
      "content": "Choose a cool cover photo. Your page’s cover photo can be an important addition to your profile pic and is a great space for you to show some of your personality. Consider, for example, color coordinating your cover photo to match or complement your profile picture. Or, use this space to display a photo of an art piece you especially admire. While your profile pic should only be a photo of you, you can use a group shot as the cover photo. If you have friends in common with the girl you're after, take a photo of you with these mutual friends and post it. This way, she can see you hanging with the same people she likes to hang with."

      "title": "Update your info.",
      "content": "Update your info. Take some time to make sure your information in the “about” section of your page is up-to-date. Be thorough and fill out most of the sections, including your birthday, school, job, etc. Be especially sure to fill out the \"interested in\" and \"relationship status\" sections. Make yourself visible to the girl you're interested in, as well as interested in girls who seem to be available for a partnership."

    {
      "title": "Strategize what your “likes” and interests are.",
      "content": "Strategize what your “likes” and interests are. If you can see what the girl is into, mirror a couple of her likes and interests by liking them too. It’ll help break the ice between you, too, if you have some interests in common, so doing some research into what she’s into before the initial encounter is extremely important. Ideally, you’ll have naturally overlapping interests, but it never hurts to add a couple of her favorite bands, TV shows, movies, books, or restaurants to your favorites as well."

      "title": "Post interesting.",
      "content": "Post interesting. You’ll have more chances of impressing a girl and getting her to like you if you seem like an interesting person. [2] X Research source One way to appear cool is to keep your wall activity strategically full with interesting content, like funny status updates, interesting news stories, or photos of the fun stuff you're doing. Photos are the most interesting and visually captivating of all the content you can post on your wall and will be the most likely thing to catch your girl's eye. [3] X Research source Limit banal posts about daily activities like going to school or studying for an important test, and try to only post once a day so you don't look too addicted to Facebook or the internet. RSVP to interesting or cool events and make sure they appear on your wall. You want to look like a fun person who does fun stuff! Outsmart the new Facebook EdgeRank algorithm by posting content (mostly photos) that you know will get lots of \"likes\" and thus ensure that you will show up in the girl's feed.

      "title": "Play around with security settings.",
      "content": "Play around with security settings. You might want to tighten up some of your security settings so that you can hide certain potentially embarrassing or unfavorable things while you're trying to get someone to like you on Facebook. You might want to disable photo tagging capabilities, even if just temporarily, just so you can control what kinds of photos of you your friends can post. Be vigilant as to what others are posting on your page. Intercept anything that could look bad in the eyes of the girl you're trying to impress."

      "title": "Send a friend request.",
      "content": "Send a friend request. If you’re not already friends with her, you’ll first need to start by establishing a friendship. Don’t include a message just yet, and wait for her to follow up after you send the request. When she responds, play up the fact that you have mutual friends or that you attend the same school or live in the same town. Use any of these as the reason why you’d like to get to know her better. If she asks why you friended her, be honest! Even it is just because you like her profile photos, let her know and ask if you can chat online and get to know her better. Chances are she’ll be flattered and interested in learning more about you, too. Keep it simple and safe. Don’t pressure her for a phone number or come across too pushy. You’re still in the ice-breaking phase, and you don’t want to scare her away by seeming too aggressive or forward."

      "title": "Strike up a conversation.",
      "content": "Strike up a conversation. It’s best to initiate contact via private message, so that she doesn’t feel too publicly pressured. [5] X Research source Put some thought into your first message; have a good icebreaker comment rather than just writing a random, unforeseen “hi”. For example, if there was an event or something that just happened at school, ask her what she thought about it; or, if her favorite show just aired, ask her if she watched it and use that to initiate a conversation."

      "title": "Keep the convo going.",
      "content": "Keep the convo going. Communicating through messages is a great way to test out your potential compatibility and to get her to like you before you meet face to face. [6] X Research source Try to offer something new with every message to keep the conversation going. Wait a bit between answers so you don’t look desperate by always answering immediately. Space out your reply once a day to build anticipation. Make it about her. Don’t let the conversation get too one-sided, where you just end up talking about yourself. Make sure that she feels like you’re into learning more about her. After you exchange messages for a while, ask if you can chat through the Facebook instant messenger. This way, to can have more of an immediate, “real life” type of conversation.

      "content": "Keep it clean. Don’t use profanity or leave off-color jokes on her wall. Research has shown that it can be difficult to express or read jokes through internet communication. [7] X Research source That said, it’s best not to push the envelope too much with jokes that can be misinterpreted as offensive or off-putting. Politics and religion can be great topics to talk about, but not necessarily when you’re just getting to know someone and trying to get them to like you. Leave these kinds of polarizing topics for a later date. [8] X Research source"

Leave thoughtful and complimentary comments, especially when she knows photos of herself. Don’t overdo it, though, and “like” everything she posts; you don’t want to look too eager."

Use invite features to let her know when fun stuff is happening; it’s a way of inviting her to hang out with you without having to endure the nose dive of asking her out on a “date.” That will be the next step once you're ready to meet outside of Facebook and the Online World!"
