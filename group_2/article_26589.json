Bring up a special memory that you think about often, so she knows how much it matters to you. She should be able to feel just how happy she makes you, while your words show her how happy you can make her. You are my happiness, my heart’s desire, my everlasting flame, the one that makes my heart beat fast. My love, my queen, I cannot think for a second without you in my mind. I cherish you, princess of beauty. The day we met was the highlight of my life. I discovered the one person who would fill me up with happiness and zest for life. Baby, I care for you more than words can say. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I cannot wait to spend my life with you. My life was not the worst, yet it was not the best before meeting you. However, I am sure that it has been way better when you came. Thank you for all the positivity and support you bring me. I want you to know that I will always be here, no matter what. When I am with you, I feel different in a positive way. I find myself smiling and laughing more. I am very comfortable with you because I do not have to pretend that I am alright. I can open up myself to you and tell you what I feel is truthful. I do not feel alone and in pain because your affection makes me feel safe. In love alphabets, ‘U’ and ‘I’ were placed close to each other because Without U (You), I (am) nothing. I find my purpose in your sight and exist for your love forever. From strangers, we became friends and soul mates. You have always been there from the very beginning. You made me feel loved from the start. You gave your efforts and never left me alone through good and bad. Because you taught me how to love, I will do it only to you forever. You give me something positively unexplainable, and that is why I am sure of what I feel for you. I am so blessed to have someone like you to share life with. You need to always remember that I will always hold onto you no matter what. Your affection always excites my heart. It is the sweetest feeling ever. I will always choose you over anything because your care and support always soothe me. I am still amazed at how important you are to me. The most effortless thing I have done is to show you my affection. You are my savior. When I met you, you were my best friend. But the more I saw you smile, the deeper I fell in love with you. You showed me that true happiness is having a person by your side who accepts you in all your moods, stays through all your ups and downs, and never lets you go, regardless of the hardships. I love you and will do so for the rest of my life. You came into my life like the warmth of the sun. You made my life better, and you made me a better person. You made me smarter, more understanding, and happy to be alive each day. Thank you for being in my life. No one can replace you, and you need to know that. Your smile, your gaze, or the way you always seem to read my thoughts – everything is priceless. You touched places in my heart that I never knew existed. You made me fall deeply in love with you, and I am enjoying every single moment of it. I am so attached to you now that only death can separate us from each other; every moment, I find myself thinking about you. You have become the reason for my smile, the meaning of my life, and my inspiration for the tomorrows to be. The connection that we have is unique. It is a bond so strong that no one can ever break it. When we are together, we can make it through anything and grow stronger with each moment. Together we become unstoppable, which is why you are, without a doubt, my better half."

      "content": "Combine your romantic feelings with humorous words in a funny message. When you truly appreciate being with her, telling her a funny story from your life together will do more than make her smile. It’ll let her know that your relationship is about laughter and love. She’ll feel like she is with someone who gets her as both a friend and romantic partner. Wow! I am 101% in love with you. Can I be so bold as to invite you to study with me Saturday afternoon and after, invite you to go to the movies and then, invite you to dinner and then, invite you to go dancing and then, if you were not tired of my lack of objectivity, ask you a kiss? Please shorten the process by giving me this kiss at once! I sent an Angel to watch over you while you were asleep, but the angel came back sooner than expected, and I asked why the angel said, ‘Angels don’t watch over an Angel!’ I may annoy you, and you might want to kill me. I permit you but on one condition. Don’t shoot me in the heart because that’s where you are! If you were Romeo and I were Juliet, our story would have been slightly different from Shakespeare’s original one. We wouldn’t have died for each other in the end – we would have lived for each other even after the end. I love you. Your smile can be compared to a flower. Your voice can be compared to a cuckoo, your innocence to a child. But in stupidity, you have no comparison; you’re the best! Whenever I try to impress you with my cooking skills, it's like I turn into a contestant on a cooking show. The kitchen becomes my battlefield, and the smoke detector, my biggest fan! Thanks for loving me despite my lack of cooking skills. Let's face it; we're the most adorable, dorky couple on the planet. We may not have a romantic story like Romeo and Juliet, but I'm pretty sure they didn't share inside jokes and snort-laugh like we do! Not to mention, that ending… I love you more than pizza, and that's saying something! I'd share my last slice with you, but only if you promise not to judge me for the ridiculous amount of toppings I pile on. Our love is like a never-ending dance-off. We have our smooth moves, our awkward shuffles, and our epic fails, but it's all part of the fun and laughter we share together. They say love makes you do crazy things, and I can vouch for that! I mean, who else would willingly watch \"romantic\" movies with you, pretending not to cry, while secretly shedding a tear behind a box of tissues? Hope you have the best day ever! You are my lucky charm, my rabbit's foot, my four-leaf clover. With you by my side, I feel like I could win the lottery, even if I never buy a ticket! Mathematicians would have been correct if they had said “You plus me equals Perfect Love.” Isn’t that what we are? Thanks for being mine. If you decide to blow a flying kiss at me, I am not responsible for what happens next. Well, it clearly is not in my hand. That’s what you do to me, just every time."

Watching you walk across a room is the greatest gift. The way you move is so graceful and effortless. The way you smile makes me feel at peace.

Is it already dark there? It is already dark here. There are a large number of stars in the sky. The sky always amazes me. It is limitless without any boundaries. You have a strange resemblance to this sky. You amaze me just like this beautiful sky, and my feelings for you are unlimited. I cannot put limits or boundaries on my love for you.

I know that my heart will always choose you. I love you from every part of my heart. You're my happy place, and I feel the luckiest to be able to call you mine. Love you to the moon and back! Hey cutie, just wanted to say that you make my heart skip a beat and my face lights up with a single thought of you. The reason I call you my heart is because you are…erm…my heart. Do you need more explanation? I love you, honey. I may annoy you, and you might want to kill me. I permit you but on one condition. Don’t shoot me in the heart, because that’s where you are! You are my favorite notification on my phone and my favorite thought in my mind. I adore you more than you can ever know."

I do not mind if others do not understand how beautiful you are, and I do not care if they do not like you. You are mine, and I am yours.

      "content": "Show her that you don’t need to be nearby to still love one another. If you’re in a long-distance relationship, your loving paragraph can start with how much you miss her and go from there. Emphasize how difficult every day can be without her, but how much your knowing her love exists matters. Whether your words come across as dramatic, funny, or unique, they work as long as they genuinely express how much you need her. I love hugging you, but I hate letting go. I love saying hello, but I hate saying goodbye. I love watching you approach me, but I hate watching you walk away. I miss you. I have been diagnosed with the deadly I Miss You Syndrome, which I suffer from a permanent and irreversible disability of Missing You all the time. I miss you, sweetheart. Time flies away like a jet plane when we are together. But when we are apart, I can feel every ticking second of the clock hammering one nail after another straight in my heart. I miss you, girl. A fish without fins, a bird without wings. A crab without claws, a cat without paws. Me without you, you without me. I miss you. Just like how a beautiful day is incomplete without the bright SUN and a picture-perfect night is unfinished without the radiant MOON and shining STARS, I am incomplete without YOU. I miss you. Missing you is not just a habit but a deadly addiction. Missing you is not just a compulsion; it is a painful desperation. I miss you, girl. I miss you, my dear and beloved lady, so much that sometimes it is difficult to breathe. I want to run to you and fall into your tender embrace, smell your hair, feel your warmth, and be with you always. There are days when I miss you so much that I can’t stop myself from thinking of you. You are my world, my life, the very breath I breathe. Everything is dull and boring without you. I miss you so deeply that it hurts, but I know that this pain is a testament to how much I love you. I think about you constantly, and every time I do, I'm reminded of just how much you mean to me. I can't wait for the day when I can hold you in my arms again and never let go. This is me sending you loads of love, affection, care, and chocolates. Suppose that makes your day, well and good. If it doesn’t, I’ll have to try harder, I guess. I hope you remember that I still love you, and I am here for you whenever you need me. Above everything now, I miss you day and night, and I want you here with me for the rest of my life. Have a great day. Each day when I can't see your face or hold you in my arms is a day of grief. I feel like a piece of me is missing, one that will only come back to me when I hold you. Whenever I kiss you, I feel complete – like two perfect pieces of a puzzle coming together. I love you because you are my other better half. My love, even though you’re far away from me, we will continue loving each other. I would never be tired of thinking about you because you’re my inspiration and strength. I love the woman you’re becoming, and I am happy to have you in my life. Keep being the best. Love you till eternity. Distance may separate us, but my love for you knows no bounds. Can't wait to be in your arms again!"

These quotes come from historical, artistic, and pop culture figures of many eras. Despite their differences, they all celebrate how important love is and reflect a personal point of view that only the authors have. “Love isn’t something you find. Love is something that finds you.” — Loretta Young “I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect, and I loved you even more.” — Angelita Lim “The best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard but must be felt with the heart.” — Helen Keller “You don’t love someone for their looks or their clothes or their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear.” — Oscar Wilde “I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride.” — Pablo Neruda, Sonnet XVII “If I had a flower for every time I thought of you... I could walk through my garden forever.” — Alfred Lord Tennyson, Queen Mary “He stepped down, trying not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking.” — Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina “I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul.” — Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities “I have waited for this opportunity for more than half a century, to repeat to you once again my vow of eternal fidelity and everlasting love.” — Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Love in the Time of Cholera “You are my heart, my life, my one and only thought.” — Arthur Conan Doyle, The White Company “I love you till my heart could burst. All I love, all I want, all I need is you—forever.” — Marilyn Monroe “I kiss your vision as it rises before my mind. Your dear heart throbs often in my own.” — Winston Churchill “My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you — I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again — my Life seems to stop there — I see no further. You have absorb’d me.” — John Keats"
