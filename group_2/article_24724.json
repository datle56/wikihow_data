      "content": "Try dental adhesive powders if you have a dry mouth. Dentures usually rely on a thin layer of saliva to adhere to the gums. If you suffer from oral dryness, your bottom dentures may not fit as securely. Denture powders are ideal for those with dry mouths, as they adhere firmly to the gums for up to 12-18 hours at a time.
