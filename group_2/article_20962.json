      "content": "Agree to give each other space at first. For the first weeks or months after a breakup, space is key. Both of you need to properly heal and gain closure. If you try to jump straight into friendship, this is likely to backfire as you'll both be too emotional. Agree to a set period of time to cease or minimize contact so feelings of attraction, romance, and resentment can fade. How much time you give is subjective. Some people may be ready for friendship in a few weeks, while others may need a few months. How much time you spent in the relationship will have an effect; longer relationships typically require longer periods of limited contact. Reader Poll: We asked 1129 wikiHow readers who've broken up with their partner, and only 4% of them agreed that you should prioritize staying friends [Take Poll] immediately after a breakup. Giving each other some space is the best way to avoid causing more confusion and pain."

      "content": "Wait until there's no unfinished business to pursue a friendship. The reason it can be difficult to stay friends with an ex is that people feel the relationship is not finished. If you find yourself feeling you have more to say, or still need closure, it's not the right time to be friends. Wait until you feel at peace with the breakup to pursue a friendship. If you need to talk about a few more things before you can be friends, have a discussion with your ex about any loose ends a few weeks after you break up. Be sure to tie up practical loose ends. If you shared belongings or lived together, wait until your lives are completely separate before pursuing a friendship."

      "title": "Recognize your feelings.",
      "content": "Recognize your feelings. Boundaries are important to any relationship, especially complicated ones. Recognizing your own feelings and limitations is key to establishing firm boundaries with an ex. Spend some time thinking over how your ex makes you feel and what kind of contact you're comfortable with. [1] X Research source Ask yourself what kind of contact makes you feel bad. Maybe you don't like discussing your ex's new relationships. Maybe you don't like that your ex still calls you by your pet name. It's always okay to request someone stop or tone down behaviors that bother you."

      "title": "Talk openly about boundaries.",
      "content": "Talk openly about boundaries.

Let your ex know directly what kind of contact is still appropriate and let them share their feelings as well. [2] X Research source State your boundaries outright so there's no ambiguity. For example: \"I'll eventually be fine with hearing about your romantic life, but I really need space from that right now. Let's not talk about dating together.\""

      "title": "Care for yourself.",
      "content": "Care for yourself. Setting boundaries after a breakup can hurt, even if it's for the best. Recognizing contact will be more minimal and that certain topics are off limits can sting. After setting boundaries, do something nice for yourself. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or make plans with friends. [3] X Research source Doing something nice for yourself may take your mind off of the break up and help you distance yourself from the subject. In turn, this may help you recover sooner."

      "content": "Let go of the hopes you have for a relationship. Remind yourself the relationship is over. One of the major downsides of staying friends with an ex is that it can sometimes keep the hope of a relationship alive. Remember, you are exes for a reason and you need to let go of any dreams you had for the relationship. If you find yourself fantasizing about your future together, stop. Think to yourself, \"We're not together anymore, and that isn't going to happen.\" Replace your hopes for a romantic relationship with hopes for a friendship. Think about how you can support each other as friends instead of as romantic partners."

      "content": "Embrace your differences. Fundamentally different world views or different lifestyles can cause a breakup. Now that you're just friends, you can appreciate these differences more. Now you're free to embrace the positives of having a friend who's different from you instead of worrying about your romantic compatibility. [4] X Research source For example, a friend who likes to sleep with the fan on probably won't affect a friendship, but it could affect a romantic relationship, especially if you live together."

      "title": "Call it off if you're feeling bad.",
      "content": "Call it off if you're feeling bad. It's okay to take a step back sometimes. Stay aware of your feelings as you pursue a friendship.

      "content": "Manage feelings of lingering attraction. It's normal to still feel attracted to someone after a breakup, but don't try to feed into these feelings. It's hard to stay just friends if you're still having sex or being physically intimate. Some exes are able to maintain a physical relationship, or be friends with benefits, after a period of time. However, it's often a bad idea to pursue lingering attraction in the direct aftermath of a relationship.
