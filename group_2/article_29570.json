Draw half of a bare tree shape along the fold. Be sure to include the roots, trunk, and branches. Do not include any leaves. [1] X Research source Make sure that the roots are flat and straight along the bottom edge. If you don't know how to draw a bare tree, find a template online. You can also start with half of a Y-shape, and add branches to the arm."

      "content": "Fold a piece of thin green paper like a fan. Find a sheet of thin green paper, such as tissue paper or a napkin. You can also color printer paper with green markers, crayons, or paint, and use that instead. Fold the paper back and forth like a fan. [4] X Research source Do not use cardstock or construction paper, or the leaves will be too heavy. Your paper does not have to be green. Try red, orange, or yellow for an autumn tree!"

Cut the leaf shape out of the fan while it is still folded. This will give you lots of leaves with just 1 cut! [5] X Research source Repeat this step to create as many leaves as you want on your tree. Use different shades of green for a more realistic effect.

You can also cut an empty paper towel roll down until it is 4 1 ⁄ 2 inches (11 cm) tall. If you want to get crafty, paint the toilet paper roll brown first.
