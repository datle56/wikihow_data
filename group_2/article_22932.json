      "content": "To get rid of mice, exterminators seal entryways and use snap/bait traps. First, professionals seal any gaps that mice may use to enter your home–a process called exclusion. If this method doesn’t work (or isn’t possible), they use snap traps or bait stations to kill small mice colonies. For severe infestations, fumigation may be the only solution."

      "content": "Exterminators get rid of mice by sealing off possible home entryways. Typically, mice don’t live inside your house–they live off-site and only stop by for food. To prevent mice from entering your space in the first place, professionals use a method called exclusion, where they search for any structural openings (cracks, holes) in your home. Any gaps are filled with materials that mice can't chew through. [1] X Research source It’s important to seal any potential openings because mice can fit through a hole as small as 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) in diameter! If you'd like, search for potential entryways in your home and block them with wire screening or sheet metal . If exterminators can’t find any entryways, trapping mice is the next step."

      "content": "Professionals set up snap traps to eradicate small mice populations. If exclusion isn’t possible (or effective), exterminators position snap traps around your home, especially in areas with gnaw marks and/or rodent droppings. [2] X Research source The most common trap is the traditional snap trap with a wooden base and metal spring, but some exterminators prefer using modern plastic ones. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Traditional snap traps are the safest extermination option because they don’t involve any poisonous materials that could harm pets or small children. They’re also relatively cheap and easy to set up on your own! Trap placement is key to successful extermination. Most professionals place traps in pairs against a wall, vertically with their triggers closest to the wall or horizontally with their triggers facing opposite sides. [4] X Research source If the snap trap doesn’t work, it could signal that there’s a large female mice population. Female mice hunt for nesting materials (rather than food), so exterminators may place cotton balls or paper towels in the traps instead."

      "title": "Exterminators use bait stations to kill large mice colonies gradually.",
      "content": "Exterminators use bait stations to kill large mice colonies gradually. Rodents are extremely sensitive so the toxicity of bait must be low. Bait boxes are ideal because they provide an uninterrupted, low-dose supply for 2 weeks. [5] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Inside the box, exterminators leave rodenticide (usually an anticoagulant or blood-thinner) that slowly–and fatally–builds up in the rodent’s body. An immediate kill is undesirable because it makes the bait ineffective–other mice learn that the food is poisoned! If you don’t believe you have a severe mice infestation, you can set up your own bait station without calling an exterminator!"

      "content": "For severe infestations, exterminators use fumigation as a last resort. Fumigation requires tenting your home and filling it with poisonous chemicals, so most extermination companies do not recommend (or even offer) this service for mice. Exterminators only use this method if localized approaches (traps and bait) are ineffective and mice pose a threat to an entire structure.

Ask to see their company license, and call your local pesticide regulatory agency if you have any concerns.

It depends on the size of the colony and the extermination method, but mice extermination takes 3-5 weeks in a residential area. If you live in a rural area, rodents will be an ongoing problem that needs to be addressed monthly, but most homes only require one treatment. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Permanent mice extermination cannot be guaranteed. Mice are more challenging than insects to exterminate. Most extermination companies state their services last one year, but every home is unique–some houses have severe construction problems that an exterminator cannot work around. You may have to hire a contractor to fix these issues for a long-term extermination solution."
