      "content": "Frame out the shower pan using 2 by 6 inches (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) boards. When deciding to install or replace a shower pan you need to consider the size and dimensions of the shower. Measure the distances between the studs on your walls where you plan on building your shower pan and write them down. Use a circular saw to cut boards that are 2 by 6 inches (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) to size based on the measurements you took. Position the cut boards in between the studs in your walls so they’re on top of the bottom plate, which is the board at the bottom of your wall frame. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a circular saw, you may be able to ask the employees to cut your board for you when you purchase it."

Find the length of the side of your shower area that doesn’t have a wall. Lay a 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) board that’s the length you need and nail it into the subfloor. Stack 2 more boards on top of the first one and nail them in place every 8 inches (20 cm). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure a layer of tar paper to the floor to block moisture. Tar paper protects your subfloor if water ever gets underneath your shower pan. Lay a large sheet of tar paper on the entire floor of your shower pan and smooth it out as flat as possible. Drive a nail into the floor every 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) so the tar paper stays in place. [3] X Research source You can buy tar paper from your local hardware or home improvement store. If you need to use multiple pieces of tar paper, make sure the pieces overlap by at least 2 inches (5.1 cm)."

Once you find it, follow along the edge of the drain with a utility knife to cut through the tar paper. Try to stay as close to the edge of the drain as you can so you don’t remove too much tar paper, or else water may be able to get to your subfloor. [4] X Research source If you don’t already have a floor drain in place, hire a plumber to install the pipes for you so it’s done correctly. Make sure you have a 2-part drain with an upper and lower flange. You can buy 2-part drains from your local home improvement store."

Overlap your pieces of tape by 1 inch (2.5 cm) so it’s completely covered. Once you protect the drain with the tape, you can start applying mortar for your shower pan. [5] X Research source If you don’t have any duct tape, you can also shove a cloth into the drain pipe to prevent mortar from getting inside."

      "content": "Mix mortar inside of a mixing tray with a hoe. Pour a bag of quick-set mortar into a large mixing tray and spread it out evenly. Pour in a small amount of water at a time and mix the mortar together with a garden hoe. [6] X Research source Aim to use 1 part water for every 4 parts of mortar mix to get the right consistency. As you mix the mortar, form it into a ball and squeeze it with your hands. If water comes out, then use more of the mortar mix until the ball holds its shape. [7] X Research source If your mortar is too runny, it will be difficult to apply since it won’t hold its shape as well. The amount of mortar you need depends on the size of your shower pan. For a 4 ft × 4 ft (1.2 m × 1.2 m) shower pan, you need approximately 2 bags that are each 30 pounds (14 kg) of mortar."

Use a flat trowel to push and shape the mortar into a border around the shower that’s 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) thick and extends out 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) from the frame. Press down on the mortar with the trowel to compact it so there aren’t any air pockets. [8] X Research source Shaping the border first isn’t necessary, but it makes it easier to slope later on."

Once you have a border around the edge of your shower, start smoothing out the mortar toward the bottom flange of your drain. Start from the corner furthest away from the curb and work backward so you don’t disturb any of the mortar you’ve already worked on. Slope the mortar so it drops 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) per 1 foot (30 cm) between the wall and the drain. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source The first layer of mortar doesn’t have to be perfectly smooth, but it needs to have the correct slope in order to move on. Make sure you apply the entire layer of mortar in 1 day, or else it could dry unevenly."

The mortar takes about 24 hours to set before you can start working on it again. When the mortar is dry, peel off or cut through the tape that’s covering the drain to remove it.
