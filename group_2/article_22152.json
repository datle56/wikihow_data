      "title": "Ask open-ended questions.",
      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. Lead the conversation by asking quality questions that encourage the other person to think and participate. For example, instead of saying \"It's a nice day, isn't it?\" Say, \"How are you planning to enjoy this beautiful weather?\" The first example only requires a yes or no answer, which could be a dead end for the conversation. The second allows the person to share their thoughts, which will make it easier to bounce ideas. [1] X Expert Source Lynda Jean Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 17 November 2020. Ask clarifying questions, too. For example, you might ask someone “what makes you feel this way?” or “when did this happen?” If the conversation is a negotiation, ask questions aimed at solutions. For example, if you’re having a talk about rules with your teenager, you might ask \"I hear you saying that you're frustrated because you feel like you don't have enough freedom. What can we do to find a solution that works for both of us?\""

      "content": "Refer to people by their names. Research shows that people respond better to the sound of their own names. [2] X Research source Making a point to remember people's names and use those names in conversation can help increase the personal connection between you two. When you first learn someone's name, repeat it in conversation. For example, if someone says, \"Hi, I'm Emily,” say, \"It's nice to meet you, Emily.\" The immediate repetition will help you imprint the name in your memory. It can also help to make a connection to someone’s name. Find someone from your past or a unique quality they have to make their name stand out. You might say “Kristen, like my sister” or “Winston, like Churchill. Are you British?”"

      "content": "Offer a compliment to start things off. Saying something nice is a great (and heartfelt) ice-breaker. Most people respond positively when you compliment them. Try to choose something specific to comment on, smile, and be sincere [3] X Research source Try to compliment things people have control over. For example, if you’re commenting on someone’s appearance, focus on their outfit and their accessories, rather than their body. If you’re talking to a coworker, you might say \"I really admire the way you delivered that presentation. Could you give me some tips on how to organize an effective pitch?\" If you’re talking to a friend, you might say “It’s so nice to see you! Your humor is always a bright spot in my day.” If you’re talking to a stranger, you might say “Nice shoes! Where did you get them?” Reader Poll: We asked 164 wikiHow readers, and 48% agreed that the best way to start a conversation when introducing yourself to someone at a party is to compliment something they are wearing .

This makes your conversation partner feel valued and respected. [4] X Expert Source Lynda Jean Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 17 November 2020. You can indicate that you’re actively listening through physical cues like nodding and maintaining eye contact or verbal ones like paraphrasing or affirming their thoughts at appropriate times. [5] X Research source Your affirmations can be as simple as \"That's interesting!\" or more substantial, like \"I didn't know that. Can you tell me more about what it physically feels like when you're running a marathon?\" Active listening is about retaining and thinking about what the other person is saying. Instead of trying to formulate your response, focus on hearing what they are saying and absorb the information. Always give it a few seconds and address their thoughts first before replying."

      "content": "Show a genuine interest in other people’s passions. Be sincere in what you talk about with other people. Try to find topics that allow for real moments of connection, and demonstrate that you value people’s opinions when you express them. [6] X Research source For example, if you want to get to know your boss better, instead of “how was your weekend?,” ask what got them started with this company, why they like this job, and for advice on dealing with clients. If you want to get to know an in-law better, instead of “how have you been?” you might ask for stories about your partner or how they met theirs. Be on the lookout for signs of people’s interests. Do they have a t-shirt of a specific band? A sticker for a college they went to? These are great hints this person feels strongly enough about these things."

      "content": "Comment on your surroundings in spur-of-the-moment conversations. Try to start a conversation with someone you encounter in your everyday life at least once a day. Then, use your shared space as a natural topic to connect over. For example, you could try talking to the person in line behind you at your local cafe. You might say \"I love the coffee here. What's your favorite roast?\" [7] X Expert Source Lynda Jean Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 17 November 2020. Parks, gyms, and other recreational areas are great spaces for starting conversations, since people are in good moods and you can easily find common ground.

      "content": "Strike a positive tone whenever possible. Whether it’s a stranger or a close friend, offering a cheerful comment is usually more effective than saying something negative. In addition, affirming people’s comments and offering positive feedback can boost dopamine and enhance your connection. [8] X Research source For example, when making small talk, you might say \"Isn't this weather great? I love when it's cool enough to wear sweaters\" instead of “Oy, I hate cold weather. Don’t you?” Even if someone’s tone feels dejected or negative, saying yes to those feelings can make them feel validated. For example, if they say “Ugh I hate traffic,” you might say “I know. Traffic sucks. I wish there were an easier way to travel.”"

      "content": "Find common ground. The more common interests you have to connect over, the easier your conversation will be. Ask your conversation partner what they like to do in their free time, where they’re from, or what their family is like, and try to find some common bonds. It might take some time to find the exact common ground, but it will be worth your efforts. [9] X Research source Easy topics to find similar interests include: books, movies, and music. Odds are, you have at least one genre you both like. Build from there. If all else fails, most people like good food. Ask someone what their favorite dinner is, and go from there."

      "content": "Maintain eye contact and use friendly body language. Facial expressions and physical gestures are a key component of face-to-face conversations. Meet people’s gazes (but don’t stare) to indicate that you’re engaged in the conversation, and use hand gestures to emphasize important points. Try to maintain eye contact for 50% of the time when you are talking and 70% of the time when you are listening. You can communicate with other non-verbal cues too. Try nodding your head to show understanding, or smiling when a positive response is called for. Be aware of the emotion that certain gestures convey. For example, biting your nails may convey nervousness, clenched fists may convey anger, and yawning may convey exhaustion."

Try offering 1 or 2 new pieces of personal information per conversation (like your goals, your childhood, your insecurities) to deepen your relationship. It can be scary to share these things because you run the risk of being rejected or criticized, but 9/10 times, it’ll pay off and you’ll feel closer to each other. [12] X Research source Another easy way to embrace vulnerability is to acknowledge that you’re enjoying someone’s company. If you feel connected with someone after a conversation, tell them."

Before blurting something out, silently ask yourself ask yourself, \"Is this the appropriate person to discuss this with?\" Getting personal is good, but you don’t want to create an embarrassing moment. [13] X Research source Over-sharing happens a lot when you are nervous or especially eager to make a good impression. If you know you’re entering a stressful situation, take a few deep, calming breaths before you enter the room. Also, take a moment to think about what you're going to say before actually verbalizing your thoughts. You can also try slow-talk, which is when you speak at ⅓ of your normal speed."

      "content": "End the conversation when you’ve run out of things to discuss. It can be awkward if a conversation goes on too long, and it’s better to leave someone wanting more than overstay your welcome. Pay attention to verbal cues (people summarizing what you talked about, references to other people they’re looking for) and nonverbal cues (checking their phone or watch, acting distracted) to know when it’s time to say goodbye and talk to someone else. [14] X Research source Verbal cues to end a conversation might be “glad we got to catch up,” “I should get back to work,” or “keep me updated.” If you’re unsure whether or not a conversation is ready to end, ask yourself: have you learned more about this person, did the conversation finish its original purpose, and has it gone on for more than 10 minutes. If the answer to all 3 is yes, it’s probably best to say goodbye."

[18] X Research source However, this rule is by no means set in stone. If you’re having an intense philosophical discussion where you and your friend are bouncing paragraphs at each other, by all means keep going.
