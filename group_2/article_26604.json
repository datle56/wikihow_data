      "content": "Lower your sodium intake by consuming less salt. Many people eat as much as 3,500 mg of sodium per day. The DASH diet, which is short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, recommends no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Sodium is in salt, so the best way to reduce your sodium intake is to eat less salt when you cook or order out. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Season your food without table salt . Do this by not salting meats and not adding salt to the water when you cook rice or pasta. Avoid salty snacks and processed food like chips, pretzels, and salted nuts. They often have large amounts of salt added to them. If you do purchase prepared foods, look for low-sodium versions. Check the contents of canned food, premixed seasonings, bouillon cubes, canned soups, jerkies, and sports drinks to see if they have salt added to them."

      "title": "Consume 6-8 servings of whole grains every day.",
      "content": "Consume 6-8 servings of whole grains every day. Whole grains are better than processed white rice or processed flour because they have more fiber and nutrients. A serving is a slice of wheat bread, 1 ounce (28 g) of dry cereal, or a ½ cup (19 g) of pasta. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Buy whole wheat flour and pasta instead of white.

[3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Eat a side salad with every meal. Keep them interesting by varying what you put in them. Add a sweet element by throwing in some apple or orange slices. Go easy on the salad dressings, though—they have a lot of salt and fatty oils. Incorporate vegetables as a side dish. Instead of cooking pasta, try putting the main dish over a sweet potato or next to a side of squash. Snack on fruits and vegetables between meals. Take an apple, banana, carrot, cucumber or green pepper with you to work or school. Buy frozen vegetables . If you are worried about having fresh produce go bad before you eat it, frozen vegetables are an excellent choice."
