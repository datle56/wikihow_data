      "content": "Send your sis a humorous bday message to start her day off with a laugh. No one gets your sense of humor like your sister, so why not write her a giggle-inducing message to remind her of your special bond? Dr. Supatra Tovar, licensed clinical psychologist, highlights how important it is for siblings to “bond with humor” and connect over “what’s weird and funny in your family.” In accordance with this expert advice, here are some of the best and funniest birthday wishes for sisters: Happy birthday to my former womb mate! You’re the jelly to my roll. Happy birthday, sister! Screaming happy birthday to the one who gets me most! I’m really just here for the cake. Oh yeah, happy birthday! Cue the cocktails, sis! It's time to celebrate your special day! I think me being your sister is enough of a gift. You're welcome! Happy birthday to the person who will always be older than me. Let’s party like it’s your birthday! Oh wait, it is! Happy birthday, sis. I’m sorry I called you old. I really thought you knew…Happy birthday! For your birthday I got you a fruit salad.

If you want to quickly wish your sister a happy birthday—whether in a birthday card or over text —you can still convey the same amount of love and well wishes with a short and sweet birthday message.
