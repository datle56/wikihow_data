      "content": "Cut out 2 pieces of ribbon for the bow. Cut one 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) long piece of 1.5 in (3.8 cm) wide ribbon, depending on how big you want your finished bow to be. Then, cut one 4 in (10 cm) long piece of 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) wide ribbon, which you will wrap around the center of your baby bow. Measure the 2 pieces of ribbon with a ruler and cut them with a sharp pair of fabric scissors. [1] X Research source Choose 2 kinds of ribbon that complement each other. Also, make sure to select ribbon in prints, colors, and textures that you like. Since you will be folding the ribbon in half, a 4 in (10 cm) long piece of ribbon will create a 2 in (5.1 cm) bow, while a 6 in (15 cm) piece will create a 3 in (7.6 cm) bow. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the 1.5 in (3.8 cm) wide piece of ribbon in half. Match up the 2 short ends of the ribbon to fold it in half. Then, crease the ribbon along the fold. This crease line will serve as your guide for gluing the ribbon’s ends to form the bow. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that this fold is only temporary to create a crease. You will need to unfold the ribbon to form the loops for the bow."

      "title": "Apply hot glue along the crease and press the ribbon into it.",
      "content": "Apply hot glue along the crease and press the ribbon into it. Unfold the ribbon and lay it with the back side of the ribbon facing up. Then, apply a line of glue along the edge of the crease and press 1 end of the ribbon into it. Hold the end of the ribbon against the line of glue for 15 seconds to set it. This will form 1 loop with the ribbon. [4] X Research source Repeat for the other side of the ribbon so that you have 2 loops on either side of the crease you made. Be careful not to get hot glue on your skin or it may burn you. To avoid touching the glue at all, press down the ends of the ribbon with the end of a pen or a pencil eraser. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pinch the bow at the center to fold the ribbon in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Pinch the bow at the center to fold the ribbon in half lengthwise. Next, grasp the center of the bow with the raw edges of the bow against your fingertips. Pinch until the center of the bow is folded in half and the 2 edges of the center meet up. Hold the bow in this position for about 5 seconds to crease this fold. [6] X Research source Make sure that the hot glue has already set and cooled before you release the center of the bow. Otherwise, you may undo the ends or even burn your fingers."

Pinch the bow again to press the 2 sides of bow’s center together around the glue. Hold the bow in this position for about 15 seconds to set the glue. [7] X Research source Only use a small dot of glue. Too much and it will squeeze out around the center of the bow and glue too much of the center together and possibly even burn your skin."

Press the ribbon in the opposite direction of the first fold to create an accordion-like fold at the center of the bow. Then, release the ribbon and apply a dot of glue to the fold and press it again. Hold it in this position for 15 seconds to set the glue, and then repeat the same fold on the other edge. [8] X Research source The second fold should be the mirror image of the first fold, but on the other side of the bow’s center."

Then, wrap the ribbon around the center going towards the front side of the bow and back around to the back. Do this 2 times, and then glue the other end of the ribbon behind the bow. [9] X Research source If there is any excess ribbon, cut it off with your scissors. If you want to make a double bow, then do not wrap the center of your bows. Leave them bare so that you can wrap the ribbon around both bows at once."

You can use the same color ribbon or a complementary color.

Then, place the other bow against the center of this bow and pinch the 2 bows to press them together around the glue. Hold the bows in this position for about 15 seconds to set the glue and secure them together. [12] X Research source Only apply a small dot of glue between the 2 ribbons to attach them. You will be wrapping the bows with a piece of ribbon as well, so it is okay to only use a little glue."

Bring the ribbon around the center of the bows 1 more time and then glue the other end in the back.

As a final touch to secure the bow and make the barrette easier to keep in your baby’s hair, cut out 1 more 4 in (10 cm) long piece of the 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) wide ribbon. Open up the barrette and apply a dot of glue to the underside of the barrette. Press the end of the ribbon into it and wrap it around the center of the bow.
