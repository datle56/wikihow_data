      "content": "Put on an old, fitted shirt you don't mind ruining. Make sure that the shirt conforms to your torso without too many wrinkles. Also, make sure that the shirt comes down to your hips. Don't wear a baggy t-shirt as it will create too much bulk. You won't be able to salvage this shirt. You will cover it with tape an cut it up."

    {
      "title": "Cover your neck and collar area with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Cover your neck and collar area with plastic wrap. Tear off a sheet of plastic wrap and fold it until it's the same height as your neck. Gently wrap it around your neck. Tuck the two ends under the front color of your shirt so that no skin is showing. You will eventually be taping up your neck as well, so you need to protect the delicate skin there. If you don't have plastic wrap, you can use paper towels instead. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap a strip of duct tape around your torso, just under you breasts.",
      "content": "Wrap a strip of duct tape around your torso, just under you breasts. Make sure that you wrap it firmly so that it conforms to your figure, but not so tightly that you can't breathe. If you are male, wrap the tape just under your pecks. You will need to have someone help you during this step, and for the rest of the steps in this part."

      "title": "Cross two pieces of tape across the front of your chest.",
      "content": "Cross two pieces of tape across the front of your chest. Lay down one piece of tape so that it goes from your left shoulder down to the underside of your right breast. Lay down a second piece of tape so that it goes from your right shoulder down to the underside of your left breast. You should be left with an X-shape, with the center being between your breasts."

      "title": "Continue adding tape across the shoulders, breast, and back area.",
      "content": "Continue adding tape across the shoulders, breast, and back area. Lay down a strip of tape across your left shoulder. Bring one end down across your left breast towards the horizontal strip of tape. Bring the other end down across your back. Continue adding strips of tape until you reach the edge of your shoulder. [2] X Research source Overlap each piece of tape by ½-inch (1.27 centimeters). Repeat this step for the right shoulder and breast."

      "content": "Touch up the top and bottom edges, if desired. Take a look at the top and bottom edges of the mannequin. If you are happy with them, leave them be. If they look ragged or jagged, touch them up with more tape. Consider cutting the top edge of the neck down at a slight, downward angle to mimic a real mannequin. Make sure that you still have some neck left, however!"

[5] X Research source For extra security, use epoxy or an industrial-strength glue instead. If you are using a lamp post, make sure that you cut away any wires so that you are just left with the metal stand."
