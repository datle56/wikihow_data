      "title": "Find the measurement for your dog's belly near its ribcage.",
      "content": "Find the measurement for your dog's belly near its ribcage. Take a tape measure and wrap it around your dog's belly so it's directly behind your dog's rib cage. Keep the tape measure loose so you're not pulling tightly on your dog's belly. Once you've brought the tape around and it's touching the end, write down the measurement . [1] X Research source For example, a medium-sized dog might have a measurement of 16 inches (41 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Measure your dog's belly near its hind legs.",
      "content": "Measure your dog's belly near its hind legs. Move the tape measure so it's still around your dog's belly but so it's positioned right in front of its hind legs. Keep the measuring tape secure as it goes over your dog's back and write down the measurement where the tape meets at your dog's spine. [2] X Research source Don't be surprised if the second measurement is smaller than the first. For example, the second measurement might be 14 inches (36 cm) for a medium-sized dog."

    {
      "title": "Add the 2 measurements together and divide the answer by 2.",
      "content": "Add the 2 measurements together and divide the answer by 2. Look at the 2 measurements you wrote down for your dog's belly and add them together. Then take the answer and divide it by 2. This will give you an average that you'll add 2 inches (5.1 cm) to in order to get the belly band length. [3] X Research source For example, add 16 inches (41 cm) plus 14 inches (36 cm) in order to get 30 inches (76 cm). Then divide 30 inches (76 cm) by 2 to get 15. Add 2 in order to get a belly band length of 17 inches (43 cm)."

      "title": "Determine how wide to make the band by measuring the belly length.",
      "content": "Determine how wide to make the band by measuring the belly length. Now take the tape measure and wrap it right behind the middle of your dog's ribcage. Feel your dog's ribcage so you can find where its waist starts to narrow near the belly. Extend the tape down until it's 1 inch (2.5 cm) beyond its penis. [4] X Research source If your dog has a 15 in (38 cm) waist with a belly band that's 17 inches (43 cm) long, the belly band will probably be around 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) wide."

      "title": "Cut a piece of tracing paper according to your measurements.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of tracing paper according to your measurements. Lay a piece of tracing paper over a cutting mat and use a roller cutter or scissors to cut the measurements of the belly band. [5] X Research source Although you can skip this step, it will save you from wasting fabric if your measurements are off."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the tracing paper around your dog to check the size.",
      "content": "Wrap the tracing paper around your dog to check the size. Take the piece of tracing paper and wrap it around your dog's belly. Pay attention to how well it fits and make a note of any size adjustments you need to make. The band should fit snugly so it' won't fall off when your dog walks. [6] X Research source For example, if the paper looks too tight around the belly, add another 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the width measurement."

      "title": "Pin the tracing paper to your fabric.",
      "content": "Pin the tracing paper to your fabric. Once you're happy with the belly band measurements, get out your fabric. Fold the fabric in half and lay the tracing paper on the fabric so 1 narrow end of the paper lines up with the fold. [7] X Research source By cutting the rectangle of fabric out along the fold, you'll end up with a very long rectangle. You'll fold this over so you have a double-layered belly band."

      "content": "Cut out the fabric according to your measurements and turn the fabric. Use a rotary cutter or sharp scissors to carefully cut the 2 long sides of the rectangle. Cut the short end of the fabric, but avoid cutting the short end that's folded. Then fold the fabric so it's inside out. [8] X Research source If you accidentally cut the folded end of the fabric, you'll still be able to stack and use the pieces."

      "title": "Cut a piece of batting and pin it to the folded belly band.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of batting and pin it to the folded belly band. Place a piece of batting on your cutting surface and place the piece of tracing paper or the folded belly band fabric on the batting. Carefully use the scissors or rotary cutter to cut the batting to size. Then place it under the folded belly band and pin it in place. [9] X Research source The batting will provide padding for the belly band. This will make it more comfortable for your dog to wear."

      "title": "Sew",
      "content": "Sew around the perimeter of the fabric and leave a 3 in (7.6 cm) gap. Take your belly band over to your sewing machine and start sewing near the center of 1 of the long sides. Leave a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) allowance and continue to sew around the corner and remaining sides of the belly band. Stop sewing when you're about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from where you started. You'll need the gap in the fabric in order to turn the fabric so it's right-side out."

      "title": "Turn the belly band so the right side of the fabric faces up.",
      "content": "Turn the belly band so the right side of the fabric faces up. Insert your fingers into the gap and pull the fabric so you can pull it out through the gap. Remember to reach into the corners to grab all of the fabric. [10] X Research source The belly band fabric should now be right-side out."

    {
      "title": "Sew around the perimeter and the center of the band.",
      "content": "Sew around the perimeter and the center of the band. Return the belly band to the sewing machine and sew around the entire perimeter again. Ensure that you sew the gap closed. Then sew across the middle of the belly band. [11] X Research source Sewing across the center of the belly band will hold the batting in place."

      "title": "Sew a patch of velcro onto each end of the belly band.",
      "content": "Sew a patch of velcro onto each end of the belly band. Get out a package of 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) velcro fasteners. Place the soft loop velcro piece on the inside of the belly band about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the end. Use the sewing machine to sew the perimeter of the velcro so it stays in place. Then sew the rougher velcro piece to the top of the belly band on the opposite end. [12] X Research source When you bring the ends of the belly band together, you should be able to stick the velcro pieces together."

    {
      "title": "Put the belly band on your dog.",
      "content": "Put the belly band on your dog. Once you've attached the velcro fasteners, bring the inside of the belly band so the center is under your dog's belly. Wrap the ends up and over your dog's back and press the velcro fasteners in place. You can leave the belly band on your dog throughout the day and remove it when your dog needs to toilet outside. Ensure that the band isn't too tight or it will be uncomfortable. You should be able to slide 2 of your fingers comfortably under the band."
