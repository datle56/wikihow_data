      "content": "Scrape off the excess oil and blot the area with a paper towel. Use a butter knife, spoon, or old credit card to scrape off any solids or pooling grease. Blot the spot with a clean white paper towel or cloth to absorb as much oil as possible. [1] X Research source If the oil has already dried up, move on to the next step. Plain paper towels are best for this step—colored cloths or paper towels with printed patterns may transfer color onto your clothing. Optionally, pretreat the area with a prewash stain remover .

      "content": "Apply baking soda and let it soak up the oil for 5 to 10 minutes, then brush it off. Use an old soft toothbrush to gently scrub the baking soda into the stain. If the baking soda clumps and turns brown, scrape it off and apply a new layer. Repeat until the baking soda no longer changes color, then brush off any leftover soda with the toothbrush. [3] X Research source For delicate or dry-clean-only fabrics (like silk or chiffon): Use cornstarch, talcum powder , or baby powder instead of baking soda and skip the next step. After brushing off the baking soda, you can spray or pour white distilled vinegar directly on the stain to cut through the grease and let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash as directed and allow the shirt to air dry. Check your clothing’s care label for specific requirements. Try to avoid putting your garment in the dryer—high heat can react with the leftover oil and cause a fire hazard or set the stain into the fabric. [6] X Research source Check your clothing’s care label for washing instructions. Add ½ to 1 cup (118 to 237 mL) of white vinegar to the wash cycle to make the detergent more effective. If the stain is there after washing and air-drying the garment, repeat these steps until it’s gone. If the stain remains, try the next method. For dry clean only items or fabrics like wool, silk, or cashmere: Bring your garment to a professional for special care."

The cardboard will prevent the stain from sinking into the back of your garment.

The WD-40 will help break the oil stain down and make it easier to get out. [8] X Research source Alternatively, apply a lemon juice and salt paste to the stain and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. Scrub with an old toothbrush, then rinse the garment and wash it as usual. [9] X Research source"

[14] X Research source If you have a hair spray that contains alcohol, you can use that in place of rubbing alcohol. However, most modern hair sprays are alcohol-free. This method and the methods below might not be as effective as using dish soap or WD-40, but you can try them if the stain still doesn’t come out."
