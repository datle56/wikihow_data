      "content": "Follow safety procedures. This process is not too dangerous if an adult follows these instructions precisely. Skipping any of the steps below greatly increases the risk of fire, especially if you heat the wax directly instead of using the double boiler setup described here. If the wax does ignite, extinguish the fire with baking soda or a chemical fire extinguisher. Never add water or a water-based fire extinguisher to a wax fire, as this causes an explosion."

      "title": "Add a smaller pan.",
      "content": "Add a smaller pan. Choose an aluminum or steel pan, and place it on top of the metal stand. Avoid other metals, which can discolor or react with the wax, and non-stick pans, which are very difficult to clean wax from. Don't use this pan for food again, unless you're using food-grade paraffin wax or beeswax. Even a food-safe wax may leave residue that affects the taste of your food, but it won't harm you."

      "content": "Crumble small pieces of wax into the small pan. You can use beeswax or paraffin wax from a hobby retailer, or remove the wick from used candles and use them. Crumble or cut the wax into small pieces so they melt faster, then throw them into the smaller pan. Make sure there's enough wax to cover your hands."

      "content": "Add color (optional). You can shave crayon wax into the mix to add color, or purchase wax dye or candle dye from a hobby store. If you're using a dye product, follow the instructions on the label. It's best to assume that any color addition is not safe for food, even if it is labeled non-toxic. In other words, if you add color here, don't use this pan for cooking."

      "content": "Set up your other materials. Before you begin heating the wax, read over one of the two methods below and gather any materials you need. There are two types of wax hands you can make: Hollow wax hands are easy to make, and the only additional material you need is a container of water. To make a solid wax hand you can use as a candle, you'll need a bucket of damp sand, a dowel, and a candle wick. Read the instructions below for preparation before you start heating the wax."

Stir slowly and constantly using a steel or aluminum utensil. If the wax is not food-grade, this utensil will also not be suitable for cooking. This can take quite a while, especially if the wax is in large chunks. Never leave wax unattended while it's being heated."

      "content": "Fill a container with cool water. A bucket works well, since you'll need to dip your whole hand into it. Fill it up most of the way, but leave room at the top to avoid spilling. You can add food coloring to the water to color your wax hands. This only has a minor effect, but may be a better coloring option if you don't want to use non-food-safe dyes or crayons in your wax-heating pan."

      "content": "Wait for the wax to cool. Follow the instructions above to melt the wax, then wait for it to cool. Touching hot wax can cause serious burns, so it's best to use a candy thermometer or candle-making thermometer to be sure the wax is safe. The wax is ready once it has cooled to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43ÂºC) or slightly lower. If a solid film has formed over the wax, return the pan to heat again to melt it, then let it cool again."

An average-sized wax hand is ready after eight dips, but a small child's hand may be ready after three to four. End with a water dip. This will help adhere the final layer of wax to the layers beneath it."

      "content": "Make the finishing touches. Dip it in water one last time to help the wax harden. While the wax is still soft, use your fingers to smooth out any bumps or tears. Once the wax is air-dried, the job is done. Optionally, you can dip the wrist end of the hand into the warm wax, then fold the edges inward to make a sturdy base for the hand to stand on. This may not work if the wax wrist is torn or short."

You may need to trim the wax hand if it's seeped out of the original hollow, or scrape it slightly to uncover the wick. Once that's done, your hand candle is complete."
