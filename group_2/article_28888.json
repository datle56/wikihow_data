Regular white printer paper will work just fine for this, but if you want something sturdier, use construction paper or cardstock for your mask. You don’t need any colored ink for this—black ink works perfectly and creates an authentic look. [2] X Research source Don’t worry—you'll be decorating the mask later, so you can make it as colorful as you like at that point. Many templates have designs on the skull already, which makes it super easy to create an authentic-looking mask.
