      "title": "Find an old dresser.",
      "content": "Find an old dresser. The dresser should be roughly the size that you want your faux fireplace to be. Be sure to look curbside – and don’t worry about the color."

      "content": "Pull out all the drawers and interior hardware. This includes the screws and runners for the drawers. Your dresser should now be an open shell."

      "title": "Take apart the drawers.",
      "content": "Take apart the drawers. Be sure to save the three nicest drawer faces and remove their handles; if necessary, fill any screw holes with wood putty, plaster, glue, etc. and let dry."

      "title": "Attach a drawer face horizontally across the top of the open front of your dresser.",
      "content": "Attach a drawer face horizontally across the top of the open front of your dresser. In other words, the face of the drawer should be in the same position that the top drawer once was. Attach it by nailing it on with small, inconspicuous finishing nails or, preferably, by screwing it on starting from the inside of the dresser and screwing outwards through the back of the drawer face."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the height of the remaining opening in the front of the dresser.",
      "content": "Measure the height of the remaining opening in the front of the dresser. Be sure to measure from the bottom of the newly-applied drawer face down to the bottom of the opening (but not to the floor)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the length of the drawer faces.",
      "content": "Measure the length of the drawer faces. Since you will continue to “board up” the wide opening of the dresser by attaching a drawer face (oriented vertically) on either side of the opening, you will most likely need to adjust the size of either the drawer faces or of the dresser itself. If the opening you measured in Step 5 is taller than the drawer faces are long, you will need to cut the bottom of the dresser off. If the opening you measured in Step 5 is shorter than the drawer faces are long, you will need to cut one end of each drawer face off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the remaining two drawer faces vertically on either side of the opening.",
      "content": "Attach the remaining two drawer faces vertically on either side of the opening. One drawer face should slightly overlap the right-hand side of the opening, one drawer face should slightly overlap the left-hand side of the opening, and the tops of both drawer faces should be against the bottom of the already-attached drawer face. If you cut the ends off your drawer faces, be sure to orient the cut ends downwards for a clean look. Attach them to the left and right sides of the dresser by nailing them on with small, inconspicuous finishing nails or, preferably, by screwing them on starting from the inside of the dresser and screwing outwards through the back of the drawer face. To attach the side drawers to the top drawer, you will need small pieces of scrap wood. Align each piece across the gap between the drawers (inside the dresser) and screw it to both drawer faces."

      "content": "Make a base for your fireplace (optional). If you cut the bottom of your dresser off to accommodate the drawer faces, your dresser will look unfinished when placed on the floor. To create a base, simply find an appropriately-sized coffee table, cut off the legs, paint it to match, and place it beneath the fireplace."

      "title": "Get two decorative pillars of equal height and four wooden squares.",
      "content": "Get two decorative pillars of equal height and four wooden squares. The height of the pillars should be roughly the height that you want your fireplace to be. Since the wooden squares will be placed at the ends of the pillars, they should be slightly wider than them."

      "content": "Attach the wooden squares to both the top and bottom of the pillars. You may need to use screws, nails, glue, or some combination thereof. (Don’t worry about keeping the tops and bottom of the wooden squares looking nice; these will be hidden.) Your pillars should now have a finished look."

      "title": "Attach the mantelpiece across the tops of your pillars.",
      "content": "Attach the mantelpiece across the tops of your pillars. Again, you can screw, glue, or nail these, but be careful to keep your attachments inconspicuous. For example, if the squares at the tops of the pillars have enough corner area sticking out, you might nail a few well-placed finishing nails from these overhanging corners upwards into your mantle."

      "content": "Add “fire” to your fireplace. Place an electric light source (like an electric candle or extension cord with a night light port) inside the cavity of the fireplace. You can also place small logs over the electric candles so only their flames can be seen. Any logs obtained from the woods look great, and work well to add to a realistic feel. (Store bought formed fireplace logs are not suggested as they look fake and tend to be made to be MORE flammable.) Of course, you can always paint the flames in as well."
