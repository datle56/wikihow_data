      "content": "Naturally passionate and confident, Leo men like to challenge others. But if that challenging nature turns hostile, it’s a sign that he’s playing games with you. He knows exactly what buttons to push to make you mad, and he’s hoping to get a reaction out of you. [1] X Research source If he thinks you like him more than he likes you, he may draw boundaries toying with your emotions. Being antagonistic is a red flag, as a Leo in a serious relationship dotes on his partner. He may push your buttons by bringing up something he knows upsets you or purposefully behaving in a way that annoys you."

      "title": "Leos actively seek attention from others.",
      "content": "Leos actively seek attention from others. If he goes out of his way to avoid you in person or online, he may be playing games with you. [2] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. He might have been attentive before, but by avoiding you now, he’s trying to confuse you and keep you guessing. [3] X Research source He might dodge your calls and ignore you every so often. Being ignored hurts, especially when that person leads you to believe they want to be around you, so this is a major red flag! By hurting you, he might be trying to make himself feel more important by getting you to chase him."

      "title": "Leos are usually friendly and outgoing with people they want to be with.",
      "content": "Leos are usually friendly and outgoing with people they want to be with. If a Leo man is abruptly rude to you, he’s likely playing games and no longer interested. He may start to challenge you, trying to one-up you. This is not the type of competition you want from a Leo man. Rather than actively pursuing your affections, he’s pushing you away and trying to discourage you. [4] X Research source For example, he might cut you off in conversation, speak ill of you in front of other people, or repeatedly mock you."

    {
      "title": "It’s very difficult for Leos to lie.",
      "content": "It’s very difficult for Leos to lie. He’s playing games with your emotions if he's being nice to you one minute and mean the next. Being transparent in nature, it’s difficult for a Leo man to hide his emotions. By treating you one way one second and another way the next, chances are he’s showing you his true colors. He may say he cares for you one minute and then tell you he hates you the next. He’s playing games with your emotions, and you deserve more than that!"
    },
    {
      "title": "A Leo man is not subtle about his affections.",
      "content": "A Leo man is not subtle about his affections. In a serious relationship with Leo, there are usually no questions. He’ll do anything to show you he loves you! [5] X Research source If you’re wondering how he feels, there’s a high chance he’s playing with you. He might be flirtatious sometimes and cold later on, causing you to feel confused and dejected, questioning whether or not you’re worthy of him. You may also start questioning your value as a partner, companion, and individual. Doubt is a powerful tool of manipulation. If he truly cares for you, he’ll empower you, not put you down for his own gain. [6] X Research source If he’s trying to gaslight you, he is not worth your time! You know yourself better than anyone, so don’t let him trick you into self-doubt."

      "title": "Although loving, Leos can have a vindictive side.",
      "content": "Although loving, Leos can have a vindictive side. People who play mind games can get a thrill from isolating others, and this is no different for Leos. Leo men like to be the center of attention, so if he’s playing you, he might try to subtly (or outrightly) pin others against you. [7] X Research source Maybe he’s saying rude things about you in group settings or talking harshly about you behind your back. Either way, this is a huge red flag, as no partner should want to isolate you from your loved ones."

      "title": "Leo men are naturally braggarts.",
      "content": "Leo men are naturally braggarts. To them, they’re just sharing their achievements—not bragging. They take pride in their successes and the accomplishments of their partners. If a Leo man truly values you, he’ll sing your praises and talk about your talents to everyone. However, a Leo man might be playing games with you he compares you to other people instead of praising you. This is a subtle game that can be easily missed. He might tell you that your friends are more fun or compare you to a past ex. This isn’t him bragging about how proud he is of you and your achievements; he’s putting you down by making you question your abilities. Furthermore, if he expects you to praise all of his accomplishments but won’t acknowledge yours, he might just be using you as an ego booster. If this happens, remember: you’re amazing, and there is no need to compare your life to anyone else’s!"

      "title": "A Leo man might bombard you with flattery to keep you invested.",
      "content": "A Leo man might bombard you with flattery to keep you invested. Normally, Leo is a super affectionate and friendly sign—so it’s not unusual to get heartfelt compliments from them! However, if a Leo man seems to give you more compliments that feel exaggerated or insincere, it might actually be his attempts to hide the fact that he’s playing you. Pay attention to the compliments he gives you. Are they specific and sincere, or do they seem impersonal and over-the-top? If he’s constantly flattering you without actually looking for specific traits and accomplishments to compliment you on, he might be playing you."

      "title": "Although egotistical, Leos aren’t normally jealous people.",
      "content": "Although egotistical, Leos aren’t normally jealous people. A Leo man’s ambition will drive him to work harder to gain your affection, not be jealous. He’ll stop at nothing to show you how much you mean to him. Leos hold themselves and others to high standards and are wounded by acts of betrayal. So, if he goes out of his way to make you jealous, he’s going against his own values to play games. [8] X Research source For example, he might flirt with someone else in front of you or text an ex and deliberately leave his phone out for you to see. This behavior could leave you feeling jealous and wanting to win him back. By making you jealous, he’s putting more attention on himself while leaving you feeling insecure and confused."

      "title": "A Leo man that’s interested in you will make a scene chasing you.",
      "content": "A Leo man that’s interested in you will make a scene chasing you. He’ll want to share every part of his life with you. [9] X Research source If he stops talking to you and closes up emotionally, it’s likely he’s not interested in a serious relationship. He might do things like avoid emotional or meaningful conversations, criticize everything, and reject your affection. This can be a way for him to test how much you care about him and how far you’ll go for attention. Rather than chasing you (as he would in a committed relationship), he lets you chase him. He might also withdraw all affection. Where before he might have been super touchy-feely and affection, he might suddenly not want to get close to you."

    {
      "title": "Leo men love attention but know when to put their partner first.",
      "content": "Leo men love attention but know when to put their partner first. He should want to learn more about you, asking you questions about your life. By only talking about himself, he’s purposefully putting himself in the spotlight and restricting himself so that he can’t learn more about you. [10] X Research source A healthy relationship is two-sided; if he fails to learn as many wonderful facts about you as possible, he’s missing out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leo men are normally extremely loyal.",
      "content": "Leo men are normally extremely loyal. As fixed signs (the zodiac's driven and dedicated “doers”), they’re loyal, stubborn, and value commitments. So, if a Leo man won’t discuss the future, come out and say you’re in an exclusive relationship, or commit to you in any significant way, it’s a strong sign that he’s actually playing you. For example, a Leo man might avoid commitment because he’s trying to keep his options open or maintain his flexibility."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leo men are upfront people.",
      "content": "Leo men are upfront people. If something is bothering your Leo, he will most likely say so. He may say outright that he’s not into you in the same way or ask to be friends. Either way, if a Leo man tells you he’s not interested, try to accept his wishes rather than force a relationship. [11] X Research source In any relationship, it’s important to respect boundaries. Just because he doesn’t want a romantic relationship doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to be friends! Listen to him and give him time. A Leo guy doesn’t like being forced into decisions. He’ll really appreciate you honoring his boundaries."
