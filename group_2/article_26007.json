      "content": "Exfoliate your knees with a loofah or sponge in the shower regularly. Oftentimes, dark knees are caused by psoriasis and other dry-skin conditions. After washing your body with soap, use a loofah or hard sponge (or even a pumice stone ) to exfoliate the dead and flaky skin cells that are making your knees ashy. Scrub each knee for about 30 seconds, then rinse. Repeat this process every time you shower. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even if you don’t have dark knees, make exfoliating regularly a habit. Exfoliation detoxifies your skin, stimulates your nervous system, and leaves your skin glowing (whether it’s prone to dryness or not)."

They’ll also be able to offer more effective treatments for lightening the skin. If you’re having trouble finding a dermatologist, search the American Board of Dermatology’s database for a doctor who specializes in hyperpigmentation. You can also ask your GP if they can refer you to anyone. (If they can, your insurance will likely cover it!) Explain which methods you’ve used to try to get rid of your dark knees in as much detail as possible. The more your dermatologist understands your body’s history, the more equipped they are to find the cause of the problem."
