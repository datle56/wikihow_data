      "content": "Your key fob batteries are dead. When your key fob is dead, your keyless start system can’t recognize your key. One of the most common reasons why you’re seeing this error is because you need to swap the batteries in your key fob. If your key fob batteries have been replaced recently, check your key fob for damage. If you dropped your key fob recently, it may have a faulty switch inside that you need to get replaced. Try using your spare key fob to see if the error goes away. If it does, it’s likely your key fob that’s the problem, not the car."

In your center console, look for a button with an “A” in a circle that says “OFF.” Push this button to turn the system back on. If it was off, the same “A” in a circle symbol will pop back up on your dash, indicating that it’s turned on now. [6] X Research source If the start/stop system was already on, the “A” symbol will disappear from your dash. That means that it’s likely a different issue, and you can turn the system back on by pressing the button again. In some cases, the start/stop system may be faulty. We'll explain how to replace it in the next method."
