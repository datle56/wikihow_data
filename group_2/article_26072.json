      "content": "Make sure the item can be sold on Etsy. In general, you can list items on Etsy as long as they are handmade (by you), are vintage (at least 20 years old), or are supplies used for crafting. [1] X Research source Crafting supplies are generally things used to create things, but also can include party supplies for special events. All of the following would be considered crafting or party supplies: Yarn, beads, instructional books, patterns, blank canvases, confetti, cake-toppers. [2] X Research source If you've restored a vintage item significantly enough that it no longer looks or behaves like the original version, list it as handmade, not vintage. Example: You stylistically cut up a vintage t-shirt and added a beaded fringe. You can't re-sell someone else's handmade items on Etsy, even if you've repackaged it creatively. For example, you can't sell a gift basket full of soaps you purchased from farmers markets, other Etsy, sellers, etc. [3] X Research source Metaphysical services like spellcasting and reiki are prohibited. You can, however, offer tarot readings. [4] X Research source"
