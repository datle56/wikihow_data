Here’s how you can stop cats from scratching furniture : [24] X Research source Place a scratching post near the area the cat is scratching. Invest in a durable scratching post with a strong base and tall pole. Purchase a scratching pad for a cat that likes to scratch horizontally. Place catnip on scratching posts or pads to encourage scratching. [25] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Discourage scratching by moving the scratched item or using a deterring spray. Stick double-sided tape on favored surfaces to protect them and deter scratching. Protect furniture with thick, shiny plastic."
