      "content": "Find a good spot for your nook, such as a corner, alcove, or a box. You may find it necessary to rearrange your bedroom furniture. Doing so will open up spaces that are good potential nooks. Pick a spot that's as quiet as possible. You do not want a lot of loud noises, such as a radio or TV, to disturb your peaceful little getaway. The corner of a room or a space near a window makes great spots for reading nooks. Though natural light is ideal, you could use lamps in the nook if necessary."

      "content": "Decide what kind of seating you want to utilize. Do you want a big fluffy chair that swallows you up? Do you want a chair that you can curl up in? Do you prefer a bunch of pillows on the floor or a beanbag instead? Or do you want a woven bench that doubles as a coffee table and an ottoman? Consider how much space you have for seating as well. A chaise lounge will create a luxurious feel if you have a lot of room. If you don’t have a lot of space, a hanging chair or floor pillows will work well."

      "content": "Brighten up your space with light. Ample light is the perfect way to capitalize on moments of inspiration that might come to you as you read. Find a light that strikes a balance between lighting needs and your level of comfort. For daytime reading, nothing beats glorious daylight. If it gets too bright, pull across the curtains to prevent the direct sunlight from beaming onto your reading material. For reading at night, a simple lamp will do, as long as it is adjustable. Another option is to buy a desk or floor lamp. You could also hang a reading light or globe light above the reading nook."

      "title": "Make it a place of comfort.",
      "content": "Make it a place of comfort. The most important part of a reading nook is comfort. It must be something that appeals to you and encourages you to curl up in it time after time. Think of softness and textures that delight you. Do not use anything that you do not like or that gives you a feeling of unpleasantness. Surround yourself with the things that make you the most comfortable, such as a plush throw or soft pillows. Use colors, patterns, and textures that make you feel safe and warm. To anchor the nook visually, add a small rug to the space. This has the added benefit of a comfortable place to rest your feet."

      "title": "Seclude the reading nook from other parts of the room if possible.",
      "content": "Seclude the reading nook from other parts of the room if possible. This can be as simple as putting a low dresser perpendicular to one wall to give the impression of division, or it can be as complicated as hanging curtains around the nook to create a canopy. The division will give you a sense of ownership of the nook and keep others from invading your private space. Treat your nook like a hideaway and keep a snack nearby that’s savory and sweet, like cheddar popcorn with candy corn. Unplug from everything and don’t introduce phones or electronics to your quiet space. Surround yourself and your haven with sweet aromas. Purchase a season-themed candle and place it in your nook to help you further unwind. To make the space even more tranquil and absorb noise, hang a tapestry on the wall."

The perfect size for an embroidery hoop is about 23 inches (58 cm) and the hoops can be found at any local store that sells crafts.

Cut 3 pieces of ribbon about 4 inches (10 cm) long so that the hoop can hang a good distance away from the ceiling. If you want the canopy to hang down even lower from the ceiling, cut the ribbon pieces a little longer. [4] X Research source Spread the curtains and loop the ribbons around the sides of the hoop. The ribbons should be looped onto the hoop every couple of panels so that the curtains are even on each side and the access points are more plainly seen. [5] X Research source Tie the ribbons together at the top into a knot."

Hang the knotted ribbon and your canopy curtains over the hook in the ceiling. Spread 2 of the panels to create a door.

These reading nooks can also act as a tent around small armchairs in children's rooms and nurseries and can be the perfect place to read to your child while they’re in your lap."
