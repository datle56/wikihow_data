    {
      "title": "Measure the length of the fence that you are going to cover.",
      "content": "Measure the length of the fence that you are going to cover. You can attach bamboo screening to wood fencing, chain link fencing, or concrete. Take a look at your yard and determine where you want to install your screening. Use a measuring tape to calculate the length of the area you want to cover. Jot these numbers down to reference them when ordering your bamboo. You don’t need to cover your entire yard. Many people install screening along one section of their fencing to create an accent wall or cover up a damaged or ugly portion of their fence. Bamboo rolls typically come in 6–8 ft (1.8–2.4 m) rolls. Expect to spend $100-200 on each bamboo roll depending on the height that you choose."

    {
      "title": "Use a measuring tape to determine the height you desire.",
      "content": "Use a measuring tape to determine the height you desire. You can cover your fence entirely, have your fence poke out a little at the top, or have the bamboo extend past your fencing. This is completely a matter of personal preference. Use a measuring tape to determine how high you want the fencing will go. Write this measurement down alongside the length you’re going to cover to reference it when you’re ordering your screening. You can purchase custom-sized bamboo screening if you live near a company that cuts bamboo to size, but most bamboo screening is 3.5 ft (1.1 m), 4 ft (1.2 m), 5 ft (1.5 m), 6 ft (1.8 m), or 8 ft (2.4 m) tall. If your fence doesn’t match these heights, decide whether you want the bamboo to be a little short or a little tall."

      "title": "Select a color of bamboo for your screening based on preference.",
      "content": "Select a color of bamboo for your screening based on preference. Like other forms of wood, bamboo comes in a variety of colors and stains. Consult with your manufacturer to find what they have available. Natural bamboo is a great choice if you want a naturalistic look, while mahogany or black bamboo can create a modern vibe for your backyard. [1] X Research source You can always stain the bamboo after you install it if you want to change its color."

    {
      "title": "Choose the diameter of your bamboo stalks if you have an option.",
      "content": "Choose the diameter of your bamboo stalks if you have an option. Some manufacturers offer bamboo stalks in different diameters. Choose your thickness based on the look you’re going for. Thinner bamboo blends together visually to create a unique look, while thicker pieces of bamboo are easily identifiable and recognizable. Thinner bamboo may be less than 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter. Thicker stalks may be bigger than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter."

      "title": "Purchase rolls of bamboo fencing from a bamboo supplier.",
      "content": "Purchase rolls of bamboo fencing from a bamboo supplier. Find a bamboo supplier in your area that sells bamboo screening or fencing. Tell them the height and length that you’re going to cover to determine how many rolls of bamboo you require. Pay for the bamboo and wait for it to be delivered to your home. There aren’t a ton of bamboo screening manufacturers, so you probably have to have it delivered. You may be able to pick it up in a truck if you live near the company, though! You can install screening on both sides of a fence if you’d like to cover it entirely. If you do, order twice as many bamboo rolls."

      "title": "Lean your first roll vertically against your fencing.",
      "content": "Lean your first roll vertically against your fencing. Start at the end where you want the edge of the screening to be. Keep the bamboo wrapped up in the packaging and lift the roll in one piece. Stand it up against your fence at a 15-degree angle. [2] X Research source This process is much easier if you have assistance. If you can, ask a friend or family member to help you carry the bamboo. They can also help you brace the screening as you’re installing it."

      "content": "Unravel the bamboo and spread it out against your fence. Remove the ties or tape keeping the bamboo rolled up. With the bamboo unpacked, begin slowly unravelling the roll. For each section that you unravel, push it gently against the fencing to keep it pressed against the wood. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Drill a screw into the bamboo while holding it flush against the fence. Grab some 2.5 in (6.4 cm) wood screws and a drill. Starting at one end of the roll, raise the bamboo up so that it’s flush against the fence at the top and bottom. Then, drive a screw through the bamboo and into the horizontal support beam at the top of your fence. [4] X Research source If you have someone helping you, have them brace the area next to where you’re working to keep the roll pushed against the fencing."

      "content": "Continue driving screws through the bamboo to attach it to the fence. Place 1 screw every 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) along the support beam at the top. Continue adding your screws by drilling through the bamboo and into the wood behind it. [5] X Research source When drilling through the bamboo, place the head of each screw in the center of a bamboo stalk to keep the roll secured to the beam behind it."

      "title": "Install wood screws every 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) along the bottom.",
      "content": "Install wood screws every 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) along the bottom. Add screws to the same stalks that you drilled in at the top to secure the roll to the fence. Continue adding your wood screws until you’ve completely secured the bottom of your bamboo roll to the support beam at the bottom. Repeat this process by unrolling your new sheet next to the roll that you’ve just finished installing. Bamboo rolls aren’t especially heavy, so you really don’t need more than wood screws to hold them in place."

      "title": "Drill pilot holes through your support beam and into the grout on your masonry.",
      "content": "Drill pilot holes through your support beam and into the grout on your masonry. Get a 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) piece of wood that’s long enough to match your bamboo roll. Use a masonry drill bit to drill pilot holes through the wood and into the grout at eye level. Place 1 pilot hole every 12 inches (30 cm). A pilot hole is a small hole that makes it easier for the threading on a screw to catch. Use a pilot drill bit that is slightly smaller than the diameter of your screw for this. You cannot drill the bamboo directly into the masonry since the grout can crumble over time as the bamboo sways a little in the wind. The support beam acts as a platform for the bamboo so it won’t come loose."

      "content": "Install your support beam with masonry drills. Hold your wood support beam up to the masonry so that the pilot holes on the wood and the pilot holes on the masonry overlap. Then, use 3.5 in (8.9 cm) masonry screws to install the support beam on the concrete wall. Drill a screw into each pilot hole to ensure that it is completely secured to the wall."

      "content": "Install a second support beam underneath your first beam. Drill a second set of pilot holes 1 ft (30 cm) off of the floor and parallel to your first support beam. Then, repeat the process with another 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) wood beam. Use masonry screws to attach the beam to the masonry."

Hold the bamboo steady and gently push down on any bamboo stalks that aren’t flush against the wall. If your roll of bamboo is particularly long, do this in 3–4 feet (0.91–1.22 m) sections. This is a lot easier if you have a friend or family member hold the bamboo in place for you."

Unravel the bamboo in the direction that you want to cover. The entire roll has to be set against the chain link fence to install it, so get help from a friend if the roll is too big and unwieldy. [8] X Research source It is exceptionally tricky to install bamboo on both sides of a chain link fence, so you’re better off not doing this on your front yard unless you only want to cover the exterior fence."

Then, wrap the excess wire on each end around a chain link next to it. Wrap it 3-4 times around the chain and use a crimping tool or channel locks to bend the wire tightly at the end to secure it. [11] X Research source Don’t use all of your weight to pull the wire tight before crimping it. If you pull too hard, you may crack the bamboo."

Run the plastic end through the small notch on the other side of the zip tie and pull it tight. Then, add additional zip ties every 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) along the top of the roll."
