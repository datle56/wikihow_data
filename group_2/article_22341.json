      "content": "Put a cold compress on the eye for 10 minutes twice daily. Wet a small cloth with cold water, and squeeze it out until it's damp. Place the compress over the affected eye for about 5-10 minutes twice daily. The cold sensation will soothe your eyelid and help to reduce swelling and inflammation. [1] X Research source Try steeping a tea bag and letting it cool in the refrigerator before applying it like a cold compress to your eye. This will soothe the eye area and reduce swelling. For an alternative, wrap ice in a cloth or paper towel and put it on your swollen eyelid. Do not apply ice directly to the skin, as it can cause frostbite and damaged skin tissues. If you know an irritant like pet dander or pollen is causing your swollen eyelid, adding a dollop of petroleum jelly to the damp cloth before you apply it can help to provide extra-soothing relief.
