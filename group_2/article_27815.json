    {
      "title": "Socialize with everyone.",
      "content": "Socialize with everyone. Very few people can be friends with everyone -- and if that one person can be you, all feet will be wishing they were in your shoes. They'll wonder how you do it, how everyone likes you, and how you have time to know everyone. So don't write other people off just because they're \"uncool\"; you don't have to be best friends, you just want everyone knowing your name and liking you. [1] X Research source It's so easy to forget that everyone has battles they're fighting. We all see other people and think, \"Wow. They're so put together!\" when on the inside, they could be crumbling. Take advantage of this by always being bright and positive with everyone. When you're constantly happy, funny, and friendly, you'll give off that \"perfect\" vibe almost effortlessly."

      "title": "Manage your image on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media.",
      "content": "Manage your image on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media. There are tons of news stories lately about how \"Facebook makes us sad\" because we look at other people's lives and want them. Use this to your advantage! Post photos of you having fun with your friends, tweet funny comments and talk about all the awesome things you're doing. It's surprisingly easy to make your life seem awesome online, even if you spend your weekends on your couch with a bowl of cheese popcorn and your three cats. As long as you're a bit selective and aren't obnoxious about it (OMG LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OF ME AND TAYLOR SWIFT AHHHHH!!!!!!!), people will wonder if you're just absolutely perfect and be just ripe with envy."

    {
      "title": "Know the latest drama.",
      "content": "Know the latest drama. Which won't be hard, because you know everyone. Being \"in the know\" makes you look viable, up-to-date, and like you're at the center of everything. Which maybe you are! It'll give you interesting things to talk about and an edge on every situation, too. And when it comes to knowing the drama, it's no big deal. Eliza just dumped Jacob for John? Yeah, you know. You knew two weeks ago. It's just not something you mentioned because you don't talk about other people's business. Besides, what's it matter? Eliza goes through boyfriends like underwear."

    {
      "title": "Be flirty.",
      "content": "Be flirty. Wink, wave, smile, blow kisses, and get to being confident . There's something about a person who's confident enough to be flirty initially that's inexplicable attractive. And if you're flirty, you're probably positive and happy, too, getting your audience, smiling, laughing, and feeling good about themselves. And then everyone else will wonder why they can't make others do that, too! [2] X Research source These bold things might seem awkward at first, but once you get used to being noticed, that awkwardness will fade away. Make sure you make eye contact and believe in yourself. [3] X Research source Nobody wants to flirt with someone who feels unattractive!"

    {
      "title": "Avoid gossiping too much.",
      "content": "Avoid gossiping too much. A little is fun, but if you do it too much people will start to wonder whether you talk about them behind their backs and will start to become more wary of you, not liking you. Any negativity should be avoided. Think Regina George from Mean Girls: she didn't let anyone know she gossiped about them. She was a princess on the outside and that's why everyone wanted to be her. If she were evil, she would've been hit by a bus much sooner. [4] X Research source Knowing the latest drama and gossiping, for the record, are two totally different things. When you gossip and people know you gossip, they'll avoid telling you things. When you don't gossip, people will trust you, and come to you with their drama themselves. That makes it all so much easier on you!"

      "title": "Keep it understated.",
      "content": "Keep it understated. Because the fact of the matter is that it's too easy to skip the jealousy line and go straight to downright disdain. If you walk into the room, sit down, and pull out your diamond wallet that's too small for your 50-dollar bills, your 2 iPhones, and your personal maid you brought to lay rose petals down 1 step behind you, no one will be jealous -- they'll just not like you. So keep it cool! Don't flaunt all the awesome stuff you have and all the awesome stuff you are. The fact that you have a diamond wallet is so painfully normal to you that you don't even think twice about it. And it's the fact that your diamond wallet is so normal to you that you want people to be jealous of -- not your diamond wallet itself."

      "title": "Don't seek others' approval.",
      "content": "Don't seek others' approval. [5] X Research source You know that one person in every group that wants people to like them so badly that they'll do absolutely anything to get it? The one that loses their identity bending over backward to please everyone but themselves? They're never the ones people are jealous of. To get people aching for your green grass, don't worry about whether they do or not. Because if they should, what's there to worry about? Caring whether they're jealous of you or not sheds light on the cracks in your otherwise perfect fa√ßade. So when no one comments on your state-of-the-art tablet, or your perfect hair, don't think twice about it. Who'd admit it anyway?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't expect to know if people are jealous of you.",
      "content": "Don't expect to know if people are jealous of you. The last thing the people around you are going to say to you is how much they envy you (whether they do or not). No one likes being jealous and everyone hates admitting it. So even if the entire room is wishing to be in your shoes, you may never know. You'll just have to trust! And no, you can't ask. It's a huge turn off assuming people want to be you -- asking them will give them the impression you're haughty and love yourself enough for just about everyone. Don't do it."

      "title": "Be on top of trends",
      "content": "Be on top of trends -- or start them! Copiers are a dime a dozen. Sure, you could look through fashion magazines and watch TV shows, but you'd wind up looking like everyone else trying to be in the cool club. You want to be a trendsetter, ahead of a curve. So do your own thing or make your own twist on what's out there. People can't try to be like you if you're trying to be like everyone else. [6] X Research source So many of us are so concerned with fitting in that we're just in awe of those who are comfortable going outside of the mold. You don't have to wear grocery bags or dye your hair rainbow-colored to be different -- just add your own flair to what's already out there."

      "title": "Make people jealous of your love life.",
      "content": "Make people jealous of your love life. Even if you don't have a significant other, big deal! Being single and playing the field is something to be jealous of too! So whether one boy is texting you all the time and bending over backwards for you or a dozen are trying to get your attention, drop little hints. Your buzzing phone will be hint number one! Now which boy is it again? Be subtle but clear about this. When someone asks what you're doing Thursday night, you're hanging out with the boy-toy. It's date night. No need to mention that he may or may not have showered you with roses last weekend between rounds of feeding you Belgian chocolates. People may turn up their noses, being disgusted with how it seems you're exaggerating for validation."

      "title": "Make people jealous of your wealth.",
      "content": "Make people jealous of your wealth. Because sadly, people get super jealous of this stuff too easily. Even if you don't have that much money, no one has to know! Keep your things in good condition, keep up on trends, piece together your outfits carefully, and always be aware of the newest thing. Wealth is something that's understood, not spoken about. Saying, \"Ohmigod, I just have so much money I don't know what to do with myself!\" is not effective. But whipping out your brand-new Coach purse might just do the trick."

      "content": "Take chances. Another thing that plagues most of us is fear. [7] X Research source We're afraid of putting ourselves out there, being vulnerable, and doing things we're not good at. But not you! You take chances and more often than not you succeed. [8] X Research source What's not to be jealous of? We're not talking about jumping off of bridges, here. We're talking about walking up to that cute boy and starting a chat with him. Signing up for that intramural team and picking up a new sport. Signing up for the study abroad program. Running for class president. Things most people would be uncomfortable doing, but might like to do in a perfect world -- your world."

You don't want ones that are good-looking or popular -- you want friends that you actually like and that actually like you. Respect them and keep their secrets. In order for you to have good friends, you need to be there when they need you, too. Never talk about their drama just to show that you're \"in the know.\""

You'll stay busy, be social, hone your skills, and have fun while doing it, too. You'll be able to talk about anything and for every story you'll know a person who knows a person who knows a person that was involved. You're so well-connected and talented. How do you do it?! Branch out! Instead of playing basketball, soccer, and softball, do basketball, choir, and Italian. Spread yourself across a whole bunch of different personalities. Be the one who plays sports, gets creative, helps the community, and builds robots in the few spare minutes she has. It's like you're a machine!"

      "title": "Overachieve!",
      "content": "Overachieve! Be successful at everything you do. Have excellent grades, get a main role in a play, be good in your favorite sport, and be great at making friends. This gives people a more of a reason to be jealous of you. What aren't you capable of? This will take work, which you probably figured, huh? No one said making everyone jealous would be easy! Just make sure not to burn yourself out. It's better to do three things well than six things halfway okay."

      "title": "Cover the details.",
      "content": "Cover the details. People would love to catch you with your guard down, but it just won't happen. Even the tiniest of details about you are worthy of jealousy. Think of the small stuff, like having good handwriting. Smelling good. Reading the latest bestseller. Accessorizing. Making a mean chocolate cake. The more people know about you, the more they're still in awe. Sure, it's one thing if people are jealous of you from afar. They see you and they see beautiful hair, beautiful clothes, and a smiley, bubbly personality. But then when they get to know you, you don't want that to go away, so you got to back it up! It's these small things that will really put the icing on the cake."

Make sure your hands and nails are perfectly groomed, too, and your toe and fingernails are properly trimmed. It doesn't matter if you're pale and freckly or dark and caramel-y, just exude radiance. Wash your face every day and drink 6-8 cups of water every day for that natural glow. Water is just about the best thing you can do for your hair, skin, and nails! [10] X Research source"

So every day, make sure your breath is as fresh as the Prince of Bel-Air by brushing your teeth, flossing and using mouthwash, your body is like a field of daisies, and your hair smells just as sweet. In other words, use deodorant and shampoo on the regular. [11] X Research source Your friends will appreciate it, too. Unfortunately, we humans generally judge books by their covers. So even if you're this perfect, overachieving goddess, you won't be the object of others' envy if you smell like a baby's bottom. And you won't want to be around you either!"

      "content": "Take care of your hair. You never know who you might run into at the grocery store! Make sure your hair is clean and styled at all times. Experiment with finding ways to deal with those bad hair days (we all have them) and perfect the pajama-chic look. Those girls that look good when they wake up in the morning? Like that. That being said, keep it natural. Definitely don't look like you're going to the prom everywhere you go -- that'll raise a few eyebrows and not in a good way. Keep your make-up natural and your hair styled, but not like it took you hours. You have too many other things to do and friends to hang out with!"

Be eccentric and yourself, all the while looking fashionable and inspiring others. Whether you're the sundress type or the flannel shirt and jeans type, if you rock it, it'll work. At the end of the day, the clothes that look good on you are the clothes you like (apart from the dirty and wrinkly ones, of course!). So don't fret over the trends that all your friends are taking part of. If you like it, try it. If you don't, you don't!"

[12] X Research source Remember to have good posture and remember to smile . You want an aura of confidence and positivity that everyone will want to emulate.
