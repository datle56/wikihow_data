      "title": "Access the Altus Plateau region.",
      "content": "Access the Altus Plateau region. Giant Crusher can be found in the Altus Plateau, a fairly high-level game area. To get there, take one of two routes: defeat the Magma Wyrm Makar boss or find the two pieces of the Dectus Medallion to ride the Grand Lift of Dectus. Taking the Grand Lift is the less difficult route, so decide what to do based on your current power level. [1] X Research source Grand Lift route : The left and right medallion pieces are in Mistwood and Dragonbarrow, respectively. With the medallion, you can ride the Grand Life of Dectus (at the end of the Bellum Highway in northern Liurnia) to the Altus Plateau. Magma Wyrm Makar’s route : Travel to the Ruin Strewn-Precipice in the Liurnia of the Lakes region to face this boss. After defeating Makar, you can cross the Precipice to enter the Altus Plateau."

      "content": "Travel to the Outer Wall Phantom Site of Grace. Once in the Altus Plateau, head southeast. You’ll find the Outer Wall Phantom Site of Grace just outside Leyndell, the Royal Capital. Then, from that Site of Grace, travel directly south until you reach a circular encampment. [2] X Research source Tip : A boss enemy is guarding the camp, so be prepared to sneak before getting close to the camp if you don’t want to fight."

      "title": "Take the Giant Crusher hammer from a chest in the camp.",
      "content": "Take the Giant Crusher hammer from a chest in the camp. There’s a large cart at the center of the camp with a chest inside it, and that’s where you’ll find Giant Crusher. However, as mentioned above, an Ulcerated Tree Spirit is guarding the camp; it’s dormant but will wake up and attack if it notices you—so decide if you want to sneak to the cart or do the boss battle. [3] X Research source Either way, once you reach the cart, just open the chest and grab the hammer. Congratulations: you’re now the proud owner of Giant Crusher!"

      "title": "Giant Crusher is a colossal weapon that deals high physical damage.",
      "content": "Giant Crusher is a colossal weapon that deals high physical damage. It scales mainly with Strength, requires 60 Strength to wield, and comes with the Endure weapon skill, which lets you brace for attacks to get a brief boost in poise and damage reduction. It has the Strike attack type and a 26.5 weight. Giant Crusher’s standard stats (before any upgrades) are: [4] X Research source Attack power : 155 (Physical), 100 (Critical) Guarded damage negation : 88% (Physical), 52% (Magic), 52% (Fire), 52% (Light), 52% (Holy), 58% (Boost) Upgradeable : Yes, using Smithing Stones Sell value : 100 Runes Game description : A hammer made from a boulder, used in the War against the Giants. One of the heftiest weapons in the entire Lands Between. After the giants were quelled and man turned against man in violence, this weapon was all but forgotten. Man has grown feeble in comparison to his forebears."

      "content": "Give your character high Strength and Vigor attributes. You’ll need at least 60 Strength to wield Giant Crusher, so it should be your primary stat in this build. Secondary stats should be Vigor (so you’ll have high hit points) and Endurance (so you’ll have the stamina to use Giant Crusher). Mind, Dexterity, Faith, Arcane, and Intelligence aren’t as important. Ideal high-level attributes for this build would be: [5] X Research source Strength : 80 Vigor : 60 Endurance : 45 Mind : 36 Faith : 25 Dexterity : 12 Intelligence : 9 Arcane : 9"

      "content": "Improve Giant Crusher with Ashes of War. Ashes of War are unique items that add new properties to weapons when equipped—and certain Ashes are especially effective when paired with Giant Crusher. Try to equip an Ash of War that’ll let you perform special attacks or deal extra damage with Giant Crusher, such as: [6] X Research source Lion’s Claw . This is likely one of the best Ashes for Giant Crusher; you’ll gain Heavy affinity (which increases Strength scaling) and be able to perform a somersaulting Lion’s Claw attack on foes. Royal Knight’s Resolve . This Ash of War lets you bolster your resolve on attacks to deal extra damage. Savage Lion’s Claw . This Ash of War uses Heavy affinity and lets you perform a savage attack with more overall damage than the regular Lion’s Claw but less Stance damage (and its first input is a bit weaker)."

      "title": "Use protective armor with high poise and physical defense.",
      "content": "Use protective armor with high poise and physical defense. A Giant Crusher build is essentially a Strength build, which means you’ll need armor that can withstand incoming attacks since you’ll be charging into the fray with your hammer. So, you’ll need armor with high poise (which determines your toughness and ability to withstand stunning or staggering attacks), such as: [7] X Research source Bull-Goat Set . This is the heaviest armor set in the game and tied with Verdigris for offering the highest poise and physical defense of all armor sets. You’ll need to kill Great Horned Tragoth to get this set. Verdigris Set . This set also boasts high poise and physical defense, though it comes with the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. You can loot this set from Moore’s body after fighting him or telling him to “Remain sad forever.” Solitude Set . Another armor set added by Shadow of the Erdtree, the Solitude set offers high damage negation and resistance, making it a strong choice for tank builds."

      "content": "Equip talismans for additional buffs. Talismans are special accessories that can enhance your overall build and abilities. Although there are lots of talismans to choose from, in general, aim to use talismans that’ll make you more durable in battle and your physical attacks stronger, such as: [8] X Research source Shard of Alexander . This talisman boosts the attack power of all your skills. Two-Handed Sword Talisman . This grants a 15% enhancement to attacks with two-handed weapons. Great-Jar’s Arsenal . This raises your maximum equip load, making you more mobile even with a heavy hammer and armor equipped. Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman . This offers a significant boost to physical damage negation. Green Turtle Talisman . This grants faster stamina recovery in battle. Assassin’s Cerulean Dagger . This talisman replenishes focus points on critical attacks. Assassin’s Crimson Dagger . This talisman replenishes your hit points on critical attacks. Great Runes can also offer impressive buffs. For this build, use Morgott’s Great Rune (to raise your maximum hit points greatly) or Radahn’s Great Rune (to raise your maximum hit points, focus points, and stamina)."

      "content": "Use the Flask of Wondrous Physick. The Flask of Wondrous Physick is a consumable you can customize using Crystal Tears, allowing you to choose the buffs you want each time you use the Flask (which can be done once per rest). For a Giant Crusher build, try combining the following Crystal Tears with your Flask of Wondrous Physick: [9] X Research source Greenburst Crystal Tear . This will boost your stamina recovery (since you’ll consume a lot of stamina on attacks). Stonebarb Cracked Tear . This will make it easier to break your opponents’ stance in battle. Leaden Hardtear . This will temporarily increase your poise, which is helpful against boss enemies with heavy attacks. Bloodsucking Cracked Tear . This will temporarily increase your attack power at the cost of draining your hit points."
