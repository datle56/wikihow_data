      "title": "Purchase crocus corms.",
      "content": "Purchase crocus corms. The purple-flowered saffron plant grows from the crocus corm (which is similar to a bulb). These corms should be purchased fresh, just prior to planting. You can order them online, or buy them from a local nursery. [1] X Research source Crocus corms will grow best in hot climates, with a hardiness zone of 6-9. Local nurseries within these zones are more likely to carry crocus corms."

      "title": "Find a planting location with well-draining soil and full sun.",
      "content": "Find a planting location with well-draining soil and full sun. Select an area of land that gets a good amount of direct sunlight. Dig into the soil to make sure that it’s not too hard or packed too tightly. Crocus bulbs can die if they become waterlogged, so you need soil that drains effectively. [2] X Research source You can til the soil prior to planting in order to loosen it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the soil with organic matter.",
      "content": "Prepare the soil with organic matter. Till the location where you will plant your corms, and work organic matter 10 inches (25 cm) deep into the soil. You can use compost, peat, or shredded leaves. This provides nutrients for the crocus bulbs to survive through the winter. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Plant your corms in containers as an alternative.",
      "content": "Plant your corms in containers as an alternative. If rodents or other pests are a common problem in your garden, planting in containers might be a good option for you. You will need plastic milk crates, weed cloth, duct tape, and topsoil. [4] X Research source Be sure to choose a container with drainage holes or add them if it doesn’t have any. Line plastic milk crates with weed cloth and secure with duct tape. Fill your milk crates with about 5 inches (13 cm) of topsoil."

    {
      "title": "Plant your crocus corms before the ground freezes.",
      "content": "Plant your crocus corms before the ground freezes. For best results, you should plant your corms 6-8 weeks prior to the first deep frost of the season. Depending on your climate (and hemisphere), this may be around October or November. [5] X Research source Check a farmer’s almanac or ask local gardeners if you need help determining when to expect a deep frost in your region."

    {
      "title": "Place your crocus corms in clusters.",
      "content": "Place your crocus corms in clusters. Rather than planting them in rows, your crocus flowers will grow better in clusters. Plant your crocus approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart from one another, and cluster them in groups of 10-12. [6] X Research source If you are using containers, each milk crate can hold 1 group of 10-12 corms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plant the corms 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) deep.",
      "content": "Plant the corms 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) deep. Use a trowel to dig small holes approximately 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) deep. Position each corm with the pointy end up, and place 1 corm in each hole. Cover each bulb with soil. [7] X Research source If using containers, place your corm on top of the 5 inches (13 cm) of soil you already added to the container. Then cover your corms with another 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Water your corms through the fall.",
      "content": "Water your corms through the fall. Autumn is the growing season for your crocus corms. During this time, it is important to keep the soil moist, but not waterlogged. [8] X Research source Start by watering your corms 1-2 times per week. Several times a week, insert 2 fingers into the soil to gauge the moistness. If there is standing water more than a day after watering, begin watering just once a week. If your soil is completely dry (not moist) within a day, begin watering 3 times per week."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply fertilizer once per season.",
      "content": "Apply fertilizer once per season. If you live in an area with a short, warm spring, apply fertilizer to your corms in the early fall. If you live in an area with a long, temperate spring, apply fertilizer to your bulbs right after they flower. This will help your crocus corms build up a strong store of carbohydrates to help them survive into the next year. [9] X Research source Bonemeal, compost, or aged manure are good fertilizer choices."

    {
      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. Crocus flowers are easy to cultivate. They are naturally hardy, and naturally resistant to insects and disease. The problem is that each corm will only produce 1 flower, and each flower will only produce 3 saffron stigmas. At the end of your harvest, you’ll only wind up with a tiny bit of usable saffron [10] X Research source Although crocus flowers should appear 6-8 weeks after planting your bulbs, sometimes the flowers will not appear until the following fall, a full year after you plant your bulbs. In some cases, planting in spring can produce blooms in the fall."

    {
      "title": "Pluck the stigmas from each crocus flower.",
      "content": "Pluck the stigmas from each crocus flower. In the center of each purple crocus flower, you should find 3 orange-red stigmas. Wait for a sunny day when the flowers are fully open, and carefully remove these stigmas from each of your crocus blooms using your fingers. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dry and store your saffron.",
      "content": "Dry and store your saffron. Once you have carefully removed all of the saffron stigmas, lay them out on paper towels in a warm, dry place. Leave them alone for 1-3 days until they are completely dry. [12] X Research source Dried saffron should be kept in a cool, dry place. You can store saffron in an airtight container for up to 5 years."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use saffron in recipes.",
      "content": "Use saffron in recipes. When you are ready to use your saffron, steep the dried stigmas in hot liquid (such as milk, water, or broth) for 15-20 minutes. Add both the liquid and the stigmas to your recipe. Saffron can be used for rice, soups, sauces, potatoes, baked goods, and other dishes. [13] X Research source Adding the stigmas along with the liquid allows them to release more color and flavor into your food."
