Although this can be frustrating, if you show him that you’re able to adapt to his ever-changing schedule, it can definitely help win him over. For example, if he calls you the day before a date and says he has to cancel because he just scored tickets to a sports game, try not to get too frustrated about your plans falling through. Instead, be as understanding and flexible as you can, and suggest that the two of you reschedule for another night. He’ll appreciate your willingness to go with the flow!"

      "content": "Lean into your independent side. Geminis definitely enjoy it when you’re affectionate and flirty, but they also need a fair amount of freedom and space. They tend to get turned off by people who come across as too clingy. [7] X Research source Because of this, it’s a good idea to show the Gemini man in your life that you’re a strong, independent person with interests of your own and that you don’t mind spending time without him. For example, try spending a Friday night hanging out with your friends or participating in a hobby, rather than asking him to meet up. If he’s going out with his friends, try not to be jealous or possessive of his time, and let him know that you're glad he's having fun. This will show him you’re confident and self-assured enough to give him his space and spend time apart, which can definitely help convince him that you’re a great match."

      "title": "Geminis can be hard to read, but there are a few signs to look out for.",
      "content": "Geminis can be hard to read, but there are a few signs to look out for. For one thing, if a talkative Gemini is super into you, he’ll “gush and constantly chatter about you to everyone, particularly the people he lives with,” explains Garbis. “He’ll dissect text messages, relive conversations, and talk about little things you do, like you walk on water,” she says. So, if his friends or family members mention that he’s been talking about you a lot, this could be a major sign that he’s falling for you! If the Gemini man in your life becomes shy or quiet around you all of a sudden, even though he was super talkative before, this could be another sign that he’s developed romantic feelings. “He may clam up and have problems speaking up to you and telling you he likes you,” says Garbis. If this happens, he may try to get a friend involved to tell you how he feels about you instead. So, if a Gemini man’s friends start asking for your thoughts about him or hinting that he may have feelings for you, this is another big sign that he’s into you."
