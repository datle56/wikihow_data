      "title": "Choose material for the hand.",
      "content": "Choose material for the hand. Use a paper plate or thick paper that is sturdy enough to support the materials you will be adding. A paper plate works best because they are designed to hold food and be supportive, like a hand! [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Trace your hand on a paper plate.",
      "content": "Trace your hand on a paper plate. Place the paper plate on a flat surface, facing up as if you were about to put some food on it. Put your hand in the center of the plate, palm facing down and fingers spread out. Trace your whole hand with a pencil. Make sure you hold your hand steady. Stand up and put pressure on your hand so it is less likely to scoot around on the table. Tape your plate to the table to keep it in place. Make sure your fingers are spaced out 1/2 an inch to 1 inch so you have space to trace them and so they can wiggle once you cut out your hand. Use a pencil so you can erase mistakes and any visible lines that are left once you cut the hand from your plate."

      "content": "Cut out your fake hand. Follow your outline the best you can. Start at the bottom of your fake hand and work your way up towards the thumb, over the fingers, and then back down along the pinkie side of your hand."

      "content": "Mark your joints. Use a pencil to mark on each finger of the plate where a joint should be. Study your own hand to judge where to mark.

Place two on the thumb: one between the two joints and another between the last joint and the thumb's tip. Place five more along the line across the palm. Keep the straw pieces separated from each other in the fingers and thumb. If you don't have enough room to do the same with the straw pieces in the palm, allow them to touch end to end."

Lay your tool lengthwise along the top of the clay, angled toward the wrist, with the tip of your tool roughly centered in the middle of the palm. Gently roll or worm it to form an impression. Imagine your clay is a clock and your tool as the hour hand. If you’re making a left hand, the hour should read 10:30. If you’re making a right hand, it should read 1:30."
