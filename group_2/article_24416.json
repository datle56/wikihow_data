      "content": "Choose a social media platform that most of your friends and acquaintances use. Use the infrastructure of the social media site to create an event, and send invitations to all those you’d like to see at your party.

    {
      "title": "Include all the necessary information.",
      "content": "Include all the necessary information. Add the time, date, and location for your event, as well as the theme and dress code (if applicable). Throw in a picture or two if you like. The more complete your invite is, the more people can get a picture of the awesomeness of your party. For a casual party, say something like, \"I'm throwing a party this Friday at 7! Feel free to stop by.\" For a formal party, you could say something like, \"We'd be honored if you would attend our anniversary party at Ramset Park on the 17th at 12PM. Let us know if you can make it!\" Be creative here! Saying, \"Hey guys, having a party at 7 on Friday!\" won't get them jazzed."

      "title": "If you can, start up a conversation in the event panel.",
      "content": "If you can, start up a conversation in the event panel. Be sure to respond to the comments and questions of others. This way you can start being a good host before your party even begins. Getting people involved in the makings of your party will ensure their attendance and get them feeling like a part of the magic."

      "title": "Be wary of how many people you invite.",
      "content": "Be wary of how many people you invite. Oftentimes, the number of people you invite to a social media event and the number of people that show up are quite different. Never take the numbers you see online at face value. Usually, fewer people show up than RSVP \"yes,\" but the discrepancy can trend in either direction. Especially if it's open and people bring friends. Generally, the higher the number of people that RSVP \"yes,\" the more likely it is for your party to \"snowball\" into a much bigger event than you planned for.

      "title": "If you don’t have them, obtain the phone numbers of those you wish to invite.",
      "content": "If you don’t have them, obtain the phone numbers of those you wish to invite. No need to be sneaky about it -- just send them a quick message online. If you don't have their online info, ask a friend who likely has their information."

    {
      "title": "Call your guests at a time when they are unlikely to have other engagements.",
      "content": "Call your guests at a time when they are unlikely to have other engagements. They'll be less excited about your party if you're calling them when they're in the middle of a meeting or in between bites of food. Before or after dinner is usually a safe bet. People are generally less busy between 5 and 6pm, or after 7pm. Gauge what time they eat dinner (different cultures, different times) and work around that. Earlier in the week is best, too. Don't call too late! Call before 9:30 or 10:00pm. You don't want to wake anyone up with what should be a warm and welcome invitation."

    {
      "title": "Make use of the personal nature of a phone call.",
      "content": "Make use of the personal nature of a phone call. Chat with your guests as you fill them in on the details of your party. Your winning personality will sell the party for you! Try starting out with the usual pleasantries. \"How are you?\", \"How is work going?\", and \"How's the family?\" are often good starting points. Choose a natural pause in conversation or termination of a subject to bring up that you are having a party. After you have alerted them to the party, you can answer any immediate questions the guest might have, and even gauge interest through tone of voice."

      "title": "Make sure your guest remembers the important party information.",
      "content": "Make sure your guest remembers the important party information. The spoken word can be easily forgotten, and it may be worth emailing, texting, or mailing them some of the details. They could be swamped with a dozen other things going on, even if they are really interested in your party. Make sure they know what's expected of them. Sometimes getting involved (like bringing a dish) can get them remembering and even looking forward to it."

      "title": "If your guest cannot give an immediate yes or no, set up a time to call them back.",
      "content": "If your guest cannot give an immediate yes or no, set up a time to call them back. You're not nagging them; you're simply getting a head count so you can plan your party accordingly. If they can't give you a yes or no on the second go-round, it's best to discount them. If they show up, fine, but if they don't, it's no skin of your nose. The party will still go on and it'll be great."

      "title": "Approach your guests at a convenient time.",
      "content": "Approach your guests at a convenient time. Invite them during a time you might see them anyway. Maybe you share a scheduled activity together? Otherwise, schedule an activity or meet up with them as is convenient. The more time they have, the more receptive they'll be to your approach."

      "title": "Leave guests a way out.",
      "content": "Leave guests a way out. Don't invite guests in a way that makes them feel they have to say yes. Your party should be fun and totally accommodating. If they can't make it, they should feel a little disappointed -- not guilty! For example, instead of saying \"You're coming to my party next weekend, right?\", say something like \"Hey *guest's name*, I'm having a party next weekend. I'd love it if you could come!\""

      "title": "Make sure to give them all the necessary information.",
      "content": "Make sure to give them all the necessary information. Much like with a phone invitation, it is easy to forget details in the heat of a personal conversation/invitation. Make sure to cover where and when it is, what the occasion is, and if they need to bring anything. To avoid guests forgetting information, you can hand out a physical invitation as well. This doesn't have to be a tried-and-true invite so much as a reminder. Short of that, you can offer to write information down or text it to their phone, etc."

    {
      "title": "Chat up your guests.",
      "content": "Chat up your guests. You can raise interest for your party with an in-person invitation. This can be especially effective in a group setting. The more excited you are about it and the more you can build it up with detail, the less they'll be likely to forget and the more likely they are to feed off your excitement and get excited, too. Describe what your party will be like, and how excited you are. You can say something like \"I'm really looking forward to it; it's going to be great!\" You can also use tone and body language in a personal conversation for added effect. If you don’t have the party’s details nailed down, open them up for suggestions by your guests. Guests are much more likely to come if they had a hand in the creation of your party."

      "content": "Be aware that you may offend people you didn’t invite who overhear your invitations to others. Be discreet when you're doling out your in-person invitations. Make sure only the people you want invited are hearing the discussion. If it's an issue, tell them that you can only have so many people at the party. Because of that, you need them to keep word on the down-low. They'll feel special for making the VIP list!"

And it gets the buzz going! E-Cards are sent to email addresses just like a normal message, but they include images, sound, and sometimes short animations. E-cards can also be acceptable for semi-formal parties if themed correctly.

Make it unique and personal -- not just some template that will do. The more time you spend on it, the more impressive it'll be.

      "content": "Make sure to send out written invitations at least two or three weeks before the event. \"Snail mail\" can take a while to be processed, delivered, read, and replied to. A time before that and people may write it off thinking, \"I don't know what I'm doing for breakfast, much less next month!\" Too soon and people already have plans. Around 2 weeks out is your best bet."

      "content": "Decorate your card appropriately. A mailed invitation is a great opportunity to impress a guest, but don't over-complicate an invitation to a simple party - this may intimidate guests. You're just inviting them for a good time! Have something on the envelope that clearly indicates your invitation is something to be intrigued by. Yours isn't just another piece of junk mail!"

[2] X Expert Source Stefanie Chu-Leong Professional Event Planner Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. If your party doesn't have a theme, have the invitation mirror the formality of the party. If you're throwing a black tie soiree, keep it simple with a plain border, a fancy font, and to-the-point text. If you're throwing a rave, make your invitation as wild as you'd like. You can also send a mail to your friends and relatives to give an invitation for a party."

Does the party have a specific time it ends? You may want to include a few selling points if applicable. Will you be having awards for best dressed? Provide beer and wine?
