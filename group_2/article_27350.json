      "title": "Get an aloe vera leaf.",
      "content": "Get an aloe vera leaf. While you can always use store-bought aloe vera, using an actual aloe vera leaf is so much better for your hair because it is all-natural and does not contain any extra ingredients. Try to get a large leaf, if you can; a small one won't give you much gel. [1] X Research source If you plan on making the homemade gel often, it is more economical to buy an aloe vera plant rather than just a leaf. Your local garden store can help you select one."

    {
      "title": "Cut the base off of the leaf.",
      "content": "Cut the base off of the leaf. Set the leaf onto a cutting board, then cut off the very bottom of the leaf with a sharp knife. Discard the part that you just cut off. You'll see the raw aloe vera gel inside the leaf. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Chop off a segment of the leaf, if needed.",
      "content": "Chop off a segment of the leaf, if needed. If you are using a small leaf, you may not need to do this. If you are using a larger leaf, however, you may want to cut off a 3 to 4-inch (7.62 to 10.16-centimer) segment for the bottom, then wrap and store the rest of the leaf for later.

    {
      "title": "Slice the leaf apart lengthwise.",
      "content": "Slice the leaf apart lengthwise. Make sure that you are cutting the leaf apart from edge-to-edge, like cutting a roll for a sandwich. You'll end up with two, long, skinny halves of aloe vera leaf. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrape the pulp out into a bowl.",
      "content": "Scrape the pulp out into a bowl. You can do this with a spoon, as long as it has a sharp edge. You can also do it with a knife if you are very careful; you want to only scrape the gel out, and not the skin or rind. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Consider enhancing the gel further.",
      "content": "Consider enhancing the gel further. You can apply plain aloe vera gel to your hair. You can also make a fancier gel by adding extra ingredients to it. For example: Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil for fragrance. Rosemary, lavender, or grapefruit work especially well. [6] X Research source Add 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) for every 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of aloe vera gel for a conditioning gel. [7] X Research source For extra moisture and shine, add a few drops of your favorite oil. [8] X Research source Almond, coconut, or olive oil work especially well."

      "content": "Blend everything together. It would be easiest to do this in a blender, electric mixer, or food processor. You can also use a fork or whisk, if you’re only making a few ounces of gel. Keep blending the gel until it is thick. If you added any extra ingredients to it, keel mixing until the color and texture are consistent. [9] X Research source"

Allow the flax seeds to sit in the water for at least 6 to 8 hours; overnight would be better. [10] X Research source If you are in a hurry, you can skip this step. Soaking the seeds will simply give you more gel. Discard any excess water after the soaking process."

Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce it to a simmer. Allow the flax seeds to cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they just start to gel.

If it falls off the spoon in a quick, steady stream, it's not ready and you should cook it longer. If the gel is thick and gloopy, it's ready. [13] X Research source"
