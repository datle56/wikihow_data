      "content": "Figure out where you want to take your date. The place of the date definitely sets the tone for the date. If you are trying to be more romantic and lavish, reserve a table at a fancy restaurant. If you want to be more casual, consider taking her out for ice cream or to a casual bar. If you do decide to go for the casual date, be sure the place won't be too crowded. You don't want to have to deal with the frustration of waiting in line for the entire time. It can also make it difficult to talk if the place is too crowded. If you decide to go for the fancy date, be sure the items are within your price range. It is silly to spend hundreds of dollars on a first date if you don't have the money for it.

      "content": "Decide whether or not to meet her at the place or pick her up from her house. Generally, it is a good idea to pick her up from her house because it shows that you really care about the date. This will also give you a chance to talk on the way. It is an especially good place to ask her about her music tastes since you will be able to easily play music in your car."

      "content": "Consider buying her flowers. If you would like to be romantic, buy her flowers and give them to her when you pick her up. It is a nice gesture and shows that you have been thinking about the date for a while. Roses are always a good choice if you are unsure of which type of flower to buy. If you feel this is too forward or old-school, skip it."

      "content": "Look good . It is key to make sure you dress appropriately for the occasion. If you're going to a fancy restaurant, wear nicer clothes than if you were taking her to a movie and ice cream. Take a shower , fix your hair, put on deodorant and cologne, brush your teeth, carry gum, wear a nice clean shirt, pants, and shoes, and don't forget to shave your face . Your time and effort in your looks will let her know that you care.

This will also show her that you have been thinking about the date and that you want to make sure it happens. Sending a quick \"Looking forward to seeing you at 7\" should be sufficient."

      "content": "Put your phone on silent. Checking your phone for texts or emails during the date will show her that you do not truly care about the date.

      "content": "Open up the passenger side of the car door for her and close it once she is seated. This is a gentlemanly gesture which some think is antiquated. Your date may or may not like it, so consider what sort of tone you want to set for the date. If you open the door for her and she reacts negatively, take note of it and possibly let her close the door on her own. Walk around the front of the car to get back to the driver's side so you aren't awkwardly making a long walk."

Unless she is really against you doing so, continue this practice throughout the date.

      "content": "During conversation, pay attention . The most important thing you can do on a first date is to be genuinely engaged and interested in what she is saying. When she is talking, listen to what she says. Smile and ask questions to show you are listening to her. If you don't understand what she's sharing, ask her to clarify. Share experiences of yours that relate to what she shares with you. People like to be heard and understood. [5] X Research source Be sure to look her in her eyes while she is talking. If you feel uncomfortable maintaining eye contact for a long time, as many people do, try looking right in between her eyes."

      "content": "Ask questions which will prompt her to talk about herself. Try to avoid controversial topics like religion or politics. These topics are almost guaranteed to make the date go poorly. Instead focus on FORD: Family. Ask her about siblings, parents, cousins, and uncles. Occupation. Ask her about her job and what she thinks of it. Recreation. Ask about what she does in her free time. Does she play in a sports rec. league? What are her hobbies? What shows does she watch? Dreams. What does she want for her future? This is a good way to prompt her to talk more deeply about herself."

      "content": "Try to be interesting and polite . If you've found a common interest between you and your date (i.e. you both like gardening) focus on that interest. Talk about funny experiences, tips and tricks you've discovered, and your favorite parts of that common interest. Try turning the conversation back to your date by asking questions, listening, and asking follow-up questions (How did you get interested in that? Why is that your favorite? etc.). Share funny and relatable stories from your past. Talk about the same topics that you asked her about, such as your family, occupation, recreation, and dreams. If you have a plan for achieving your dreams, share that with her. It will come across as confident and passionate. Avoid dwelling on negative things and experiences. You will have time for sharing negative experiences later on in the relationship, but try to keep things positive initially. Be polite when she is speaking. Don't interrupt her when she is talking and try not to argue with her. Speak passionately, and be honest about, your interests. It is best to be honest about what you like because she may find the same things interesting. If you are honest with your interests, you will also be able to speak with greater passion. In general, just try your hardest to be kind and polite. Pay attention to table manners such as keeping your elbows off the table and not chewing or talking with your mouth open."

If she makes it clear that she wants to move quickly, or if she wants to hold hands, you'll definitely know. [7] X Research source It is also more respectful to take things slow because it sends the message that you care about more than just her body. Try not to act too needy. If you have been obsessed with her since the moment you saw her, try not to explicitly say that on the first date. Instead, imply it by saying things like, \"I'm so glad you decided to come out with me tonight!\" Think about what you want to say when your date ends so it's not awkward and you make it clear you want to see her again."
