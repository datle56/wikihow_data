Whether you’re dealing with a tough situation today or could just use a little boost of confidence and faith on a cranky morning, these prayers are sure to give you the spiritual fortitude you need: Good morning, Father! Your mercies are new every day. Grant me the courage to face whatever hurdles I encounter today. Amen. Lord Jesus, this is your day, and I am your servant. Thy will, not mine, be done—so lead me by the hand, and we will face the day together. Amen. Father, I am weary, and the day has barely begun! Please give me the courage and the will to make today a good one. Allow me to take comfort in Your love and protection. Amen. Father, as I face this morning, help me to remember You are by my side at all times, and You have a plan for me. You will never fail me nor desert me. Help me to stay strong in the face of fear, and to pass love and mercy to all I encounter. Amen. Lord, on this day, please imbue me with the fruits of the spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control—that I may better fulfill Your will and live happily. God, I don’t want to face the day, but with Your support, I know I can. When I am weak, You are strong. When I am scared, You are brave. When I am doubting, You are ever-faithful. Help me to embody Your strength and love today. Amen. Lord, may I remember Your presence with every step I take today. May I recall Your love and power no matter what evil befalls me. May I stay strong as You are strong, faithful as You are faithful, loving as You are loving. In Your name, amen. God, today is not my day! I pray to You for the strength and good humor to face whatever Satan throws my way! Father, bless me with a measure of Your steadfast and transcendent love today, that I may bless others with love in return. Amen. Good morning, Lord! May today be a day in celebration of You and Your divine works. Give me the strength, the wisdom, the patience, and the unending love to do Your will and share Your message with the world. Amen!"

      "content": "Running late? These prayers are short but effective. As Woodford notes, it’s not about how long you pray—but how meaningful the prayer is. “Dedicate time,” she says, “[and be] present.” If you’re running behind in the morning, these prayers are the perfect way to give gratitude to God and ask for His blessing as you begin your day: Father, I am grateful for all You do. I ask for Your comfort and guidance today. Amen. Lord, in all ways, guide my steps. Amen. God in heaven, allow me to face this day with love, patience, and faith. Amen. Father in heaven, Thy will, not mine, be done. Amen. My God, today and all days, lead me. Amen. Dear Lord, I pray for peace today. Amen. My Father, protect me and mine today, and lead us not into temptation or despair. Amen. Good morning, Lord! Allow me to remain grateful and steadfast in my faith today. Amen. Father, allow me to move through this day with devotion, wisdom, and love. Amen. I love you, Father, and I pray to you to keep me safe and strong, today and always. Amen."

These Bible verses will help you face your day with positivity and confidence: “The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.” —Numbers 6: 22-26 “Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.” —Lamentations 3:22-23 “LORD, be gracious to us; we long for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of distress.” —Isaiah 33:2 “In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.” —Psalm 5:3 “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.” —Psalm 30:5 “But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.” —Psalm 59:16 “But I cry to you for help, LORD; in the morning my prayer comes before you.” —Psalm 88:13 “Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.” —Psalm 90:14 [1] X Research source “This is the day the Lord has made.

      "content": "Share wise words from one of these spiritual sources. Sometimes, the best words to use have already been said! Whether you’re looking for spiritual wisdom yourself or want to spread love to those you care about, these prayers and quotes about God’s love and guidance are the perfect ways to begin the day: “Starting the day with God in mind leads to keeping God in mind throughout the day.” —Fr. Thomas F. Dailey, OSFS “It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness.” —Charles Spurgeon “We had to learn to look at our daily lives, at everything that crossed our path each day, with the eyes of God.” —Walter J. Ciszek, SJ “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” —C. S. Lewis “God and Nature first made us what we are, and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be. Follow always that great law. Let the sky and God be our limit and Eternity our measurement.” —Marcus Garvey “God's truth judges created things out of love, and Satan's truth judges them out of envy and hatred.” —Dietrich Bonhoeffer “Prayer is not about changing God, but being willing to let God change us.” —Richard Rohr “The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be.” —Anne Frank “What God intended for you goes far beyond anything you can imagine.” —Oprah Winfrey “For prayer is nothing else than being on terms of friendship with God.” —St. Teresa of Avila [2] X Research source “Anyone who has read the prophets and the New Testament with any attention recognizes that one of the most essential facts regarding Christianity is that, being a religion of love, it is also at the same time a religion of dynamic change.” —Thomas Merton “My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I cannot see the road ahead of me and I do not know for certain where it will end. Nor do I know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road, though I may know nothing about it. Therefore I will trust you always. Though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death, I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and will never leave me to face my perils alone.” —Thomas Merton"

      "content": "Woodford notes that it’s important to start your prayer with gratitude. “There's so much that we take for granted,” she says. “The air that we breathe, the beauty of the flowers, the foods that we eat…[so] start [your prayer] with appreciation.” What are you grateful for this morning? Acknowledge the blessings the Lord has provided for you, from the big to the small. Dear Lord, I am grateful for the birds singing outside my window this morning. Holy Father, thank you for my loving family, and thank you for keeping us in good health."

      "title": "Share whatever is on your heart.",
      "content": "Share whatever is on your heart. Woodford doesn’t like to be too black-and-white about how to pray. Prayer, she says, is “like building a relationship, like you would with another person…. You talk to them…and after you've talked…you just listen or be quiet, you know, to see what's present…. How do you create that rapport? That reciprocity? That trust?” After expressing thanks for God’s blessings, speak freely with him—like you would with a trusted friend. There’s really no “wrong” way to pray! God, I’ve been feeling sort of sad lately, since Mittens died… Lord, I’m so excited to have brunch with Martha this weekend. It’s been so long since we’ve met up!"

      "title": "When you ask for something, avoid demanding.",
      "content": "When you ask for something, avoid demanding. As Woodford says, “When you ask a friend for something, you don't just get on the phone and go, ‘I need this from you.’… The key thing is [not to] demand, but to appeal: ‘I'm really needing help here.’ …Be vulnerable, [and] share what you're feeling, and that it's bigger than what you know how to deal with.” Another reason not to demand anything of God? When it comes down to it, you might not even know what the answer to your prayers really is! For instance, while you might want to ask God to help you get a certain job with a certain income, it may be that you’d be happier with a job you never considered. So instead of demanding something specific, tell God, “‘I put myself at your feet,’ or ‘I put myself at your mercy or your grace, because I need your help.’”"

      "content": "Consider dedicating a place in your house for prayer. You can (and should!) pray anywhere, but Woodford advises “[having] a place dedicated in your home for the sacred or for the divine, or your relationship with God. Some people call it an altar.” After all, she observes, we have dedicated spaces for other activities: “Here’s the kitchen…where food happens. Here's the bed…for sleep…[and here’s] this corner where my relationship with God happens.”"

      "title": "Prayer brings us closer to God.",
      "content": "Prayer brings us closer to God. “Prayer is the foundation for any religious practice, any relationship with the divine, our connection to our soul and spirit… It all begins with prayer,” Woodford says. It’s through prayer that we develop a trusting relationship with God and learn to rely on His divine will. Woodford also notes that prayer can help us to know ourselves even better: it can enhance our vulnerability and our sensitivity, and invite “a deep connection with your own feelings.”"
