      "title": "Grease a microwave-safe dish or mug with butter or oil.",
      "content": "Grease a microwave-safe dish or mug with butter or oil. Rub a little butter or oil in the bottom of a microwave-safe dish or mug, or spray the inside of the container with cooking spray. This ensures that the eggs won’t stick to the side of the dish as it cooks, making them easier to remove. [1] X Research source If you plan on making a breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs, consider using a mug to help the eggs form into a small, circular shape. For any other variation, use whichever microwave-safe bowl, mug, or cup you’d like."

      "content": "Crack 2 eggs into your dish and add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of milk. Carefully crack the eggs into your chosen dish or mug like you would on a skillet. Then, add your choice of milk to the eggs. [2] X Research source Try using half-and-half for creamier scrambled eggs. Consider a milk alternative, such as soy, hemp, or almond milk. Substitute the milk with water for dairy-free eggs."

      "content": "Beat the eggs with a fork or a whisk until they’re combined. Use a fork or a whisk to vigorously mix the eggs for 10 to 20 seconds. Then, sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste. [3] X Research source Mix the eggs just until the yolks and whites are combined. Beating a lot of air into the eggs could make them puff up too much in the microwave."

      "title": "Microwave the eggs for 1.5 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave the eggs for 1.5 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Place the uncovered dish in the microwave and heat the eggs on full power in 30-second intervals for 1.5 to 2 minutes. Stir the eggs after each 30-second interval so they scramble as they cook. [4] X Research source The eggs are done cooking when they’re firm and no longer liquidy."

    {
      "title": "Remove the dish from the microwave and let the eggs cool before serving.",
      "content": "Remove the dish from the microwave and let the eggs cool before serving. Use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot dish from the microwave. Stir the eggs a final time to loosen them. Then, transfer them to another plate or eat them directly from the microwave-safe dish—but be careful! The eggs will be very hot immediately out of the microwave, so consider waiting a minute or so before eating. [5] X Research source If you have leftover eggs, transfer them to an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to 3 days."

      "title": "Stir shredded cheese into the eggs for a creamier texture.",
      "content": "Stir shredded cheese into the eggs for a creamier texture. Stop the microwave about 1 minute before the eggs are finished cooking. Then, stir in a handful of shredded or crumbled cheese. Use your favorite cheese or try common egg-cheese pairings like cheddar, parmesan, feta, or goat cheese. [6] X Research source If you forget to add cheese to the eggs while they cook, no worries! Scatter shredded cheese over the cooked eggs when they're done. Then, pop them back into the microwave for 5 to 10 seconds to melt the cheese. For an extra-creamy texture, stir a few spoonfuls of cream or cottage cheese into the eggs before microwaving them."

      "title": "Add cooked bacon, ham, or sausage to the eggs for a savory flavor.",
      "content": "Add cooked bacon, ham, or sausage to the eggs for a savory flavor. Since eggs cook quickly in the microwave, stirring in fully cooked meat is the safest bet. Try adding a small handful of chopped bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo into the eggs about 30 seconds before they're finished microwaving. Save time in the kitchen by purchasing precooked bacon and heating it in the microwave . Add flaked smoked salmon or trout for a slightly smoky flavor."

      "content": "Make a quick egg sandwich out of microwaved eggs, cheese, and bread. Spoon your scrambled eggs onto toast once they come out of the microwave. Then, top them with cheese, bacon, tomato, and/or avocado. Spread a little mayonnaise or butter onto another piece of toast, place it on top of your eggs and toppings, and boom! You’ve made a quick and tasty breakfast sandwich. [7] X Research source Elevate your sandwich by using a toasted English muffin or bagel instead of plain toast. If you made the scrambled eggs in a mug, simply flip the mug upside down to turn the scrambled eggs directly onto the bread."

Put about 1 cup (210 g) of frozen shredded or cubed potatoes into your dish and microwave them for 1 to 1.5 minutes. [8] X Research source Then, crack in 2 eggs and mix them into the potatoes with a fork. Heat the mixture for 1.5 to 2 more minutes (or until the eggs are cooked), stopping and stirring the hash every 30 seconds. Make a carb-conscious hash by swapping the potatoes with chopped vegetables. For example, add diced red pepper or chopped onion ."

      "content": "Top the microwaved eggs with fresh herbs for extra flavor. Mince your favorite fresh herbs and sprinkle them over the cooked scrambled eggs just before you eat them. [9] X Research source Try using light, leafy herbs like basil, tarragon, or parsley. If you don't have access to fresh herbs, don’t fret! Sprinkle dried herbs into the eggs before you microwave them for a similar effect. For added pizzazz, stir pesto into the eggs once cooked."

      "content": "Serve the scrambled eggs with salsa or your favorite sauce. If you don't have time to add things to the eggs before you cook them, you can still season them before eating. Try squirting hot sauce, ketchup, or soy sauce over the eggs, or spoon fresh salsa or pico de gallo onto them. [10] X Research source For a quick seasoning, sprinkle a little spice blend, such as za'atar or garam masala, over the eggs. For an umami flavor, serve the eggs with kimchi, furikake, or sriracha."
