      "title": "It's more fun to text someone who's positive and optimistic.",
      "content": "It's more fun to text someone who's positive and optimistic. That kind of energy is infectious and enjoyable to be around, even over text. To really make her want you, make your texts light and playful. \"Just had the best Saturday morning. Coffee, breakfast with friends, and on my way to the movies. How's your Saturday treating you?\" \"I'm at a show right now and the opening band just killed it. We've got to check out some live music together sometime!\" It's okay to complain every now and then (everyone has bad days). Just try to make sure the majority of your texts are optimistic."

      "title": "A sweet compliment will make your affection known.",
      "content": "A sweet compliment will make your affection known. Be specific and compliment her on something that makes her special. Everyone loves to be flattered (girls included), and she'll be pretty excited to hear what you like about her. If the feeling is mutual, she'll likely keep texting and may even compliment you, too. [1] X Research source \"You've got such a unique sense of humor. You crack me up! üòÇ\" \"Your smile is so beautiful. That lipstick you were wearing last night looked amazing.\" \"I love your style. You turn heads without even trying!\""

      "title": "This text is flirty and sweet at the same time.",
      "content": "This text is flirty and sweet at the same time. After all, it shows her that you woke up thinking about her. If the feeling is mutual, she'll love the fact that you couldn't wait until the afternoon to text her and will likely text back in a heartbeat. \"Good morning! üòä Hope you have a great day.\" \"Morning üòò How's your day so far?\" \"Woke up with you on my mind. Hope Monday has been treating you well! ü•∞\""

      "content": "A sexy text can help build your connection and bring you closer. If you'd like to make your conversation a little more suggestive, test the waters with a steamy text or two. Avoid sending anything super explicit (unsolicited pictures are never a good idea) and see how she responds before things get too risque. \"You've been on my mind all day. üòè\" \"Can't stop thinking about last night...\" \"Looking forward to seeing you tonight. üòà\""

      "title": "Making her laugh might just be the key to her heart.",
      "content": "Making her laugh might just be the key to her heart. Send her a meme or a GIF that relates to her interests and sense of humor. It'll show off your comedy chops and likely make her want to keep texting you. [2] X Research source If she's into astrology, send her a funny meme about her sign. Add something like, \"Thought I'd send this to my favorite Leo. üòâ Does this sound familiar?\" React to a text she sent with a funny GIF. Opt for something that relates to a TV show or movie that she likes to really make her laugh."

      "title": "Music is a great way to bond and get to know someone better.",
      "content": "Music is a great way to bond and get to know someone better. Share a song that makes you think of her or let her know that you've been checking out her recommendations. It'll give you the opportunity to deepen your connection, and she'll want to get to know you even more. Add a caption like: [3] X Research source \"This made me think of you.‚ù§Ô∏è Hope you're having a good day!\" \"You mentioned you liked this band right? I'm super into this album right now.\" \"I've had this song on repeat all day. Thanks for showing it to me!\""

    {
      "title": "Show her that you want to get to know her better.",
      "content": "Show her that you want to get to know her better. This will help show her that you're attentive and genuinely interested. It'll also keep the conversation going if things are starting to die down. Try a question like: \"What did you like to do for fun when you were a kid?\" \"If you could travel anywhere right now, where would you go and why?\" \"What's one of your biggest dreams in life?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "She'll want you more if you talk about your similarities.",
      "content": "She'll want you more if you talk about your similarities. Talk about your interests (like your favorite movies, albums, and things to do for fun) and see if you have any in common. Bringing up about your shared interests will make her feel more comfortable around you, and she'll want to spend more time getting to know you because of it. \"You mentioned that you played soccer growing up, right? Me too! What position did you play?\" \"I'm a secret emo fan, too. Who do you like better: My Chemical Romance or Fall Out Boy?\" \"I saw in your bio that you like horror movies. What's the scariest one you've ever seen?\""

      "title": "She's more likely to text back if your texts are interesting.",
      "content": "She's more likely to text back if your texts are interesting. Send messages with unique descriptions of your day, your interests, and your hobbies. It'll show her that you're making an effort to really get to know her, which will help you stand out and make you seem more appealing. If she asks you how your day is going, send something more than just \"Good.\" Keep her interested with a text like, \"It's been great! Been marathoning the new season of Euphoria. How about you?\" Even if you're not sure what to say, try to avoid replying with something like \"K\" or \"Yep.\" This might make the girl you like think you're not interested in her. If your conversation has reached its natural end, hold off on responding until you think of a new conversation starter. That way, you can avoid sending a one-word text."

      "title": "Mirroring her style might make her feel more comfortable.",
      "content": "Mirroring her style might make her feel more comfortable. This doesn't mean you have to copy what she says verbatim, but subtly mimicking her texting style might help her see you as a like-minded person. This will make her excited to get to know you even better. If she takes a few hours to respond to each text, you might try doing the same. If she's comfortable double-texting you, don't be afraid to send a follow-up text, too. If she uses a lot of emojis, go ahead and throw in a few throughout your conversation as well."

      "content": "Meeting up in person will take your relationship to the next level. If you really like her, you probably want to actually hang out! Ask her out on a fun date so the two of you can get to know each other better and see if you have a connection. If she's into you, she's likely been waiting for you to ask (and will be super stoked when you do).

Would you like to go together?\" Reader Poll: We asked 468 wikiHow readers which type of invitation would most likely excite a Sagittarius woman, and 55% of them said Going on a spontaneous day trip.
