Don't initiate any contact with your ex, including phone calls, texts, emails, messages on social media, and in-person conversations. If he tries to initiate contact with you, don't respond. Depending on the situation, you may want to respond to a text or email by simply telling your ex that you are not interested in talking to him. [3] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. If he is being completely unreasonable, don't bother responding. If you are getting threatening messages from your ex or he is stalking you, report the behavior to the police immediately. You may be able to get a restraining order to keep him from contacting you or coming near you. If your ex-boyfriend will not stop calling, texting, or emailing you, you can block his number and email address. If he is very persistent and starts calling you from other people's phones or emailing you from different addresses, you might want to consider changing your phone number and/or email address. Most social media sites allow multiple options for blocking or ignoring a person. If you want to prevent your ex-boyfriend from viewing your profile and you want him to get the message that you don't want any contact with him, block him. If you don't want to take it to that extreme, but you also don't want to see any updates from your ex, ignore or unfollow him. If possible, avoid places where you know you are likely to run into your ex. If this is not possible, just keep walking when you see him instead of stopping to talk."

If you share mutual friends, have classes together, or work together, you might have no choice but to spend some time in the same room with your ex. It might be hard at first, but do your best to interact with everyone else in the room normally, and avoid talking to your ex as much as possible. [5] X Research source Don't go overboard by literally pretending not to see him. This will probably make him think that you're uncomfortable being around him, which is not what you want. Instead, address him as you would a stranger. Keep your interactions brief and avoid body language that suggests intimacy, like direct eye contact. If you're with a group of people, make an effort to talk to other people in the group instead of to your ex-boyfriend. If your ex starts talking to you, respond politely, but very briefly, so he will know you're not interested in talking. [6] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. For example, if he says, \"That math test was really hard. How do you think you did,\" just say, \"Fine,\" and show no interest in continuing the conversation. If your ex-boyfriend tries to use other people to give you messages, respond according to the situation. If the messenger is your friend, just tell him that you're not interested in hearing what your ex has to say and you hope that he won't let that get in the way of your friendship. If the messenger is not your friend and has been sent by your ex to say something mean to you, just ignore him."

      "content": "Find new attachment figures. If you're like most people, your boyfriend was probably the first person you went to for consolation when something bad happened to you, and also the first person you told when something exciting happened. This can make it very hard to let go of your ex because you may still feel like contacting him in these situations. Instead, try turning to a friend, a sibling, or a parent. [7] X Research source It might be tempting to replace your ex with a new boyfriend, but don't do this unless you're really ready to commit yourself to a new relationship. If you do feel ready, then go ahead and date new people."

Start doing more things with your friends, join a club, or take up a new hobby to get your mind off your ex and make ignoring him completely natural. [8] X Research source If you and your ex-boyfriend are in the same social circles, it will help if he sees you looking happy and enjoying life without him.

      "content": "Talk to your friends. If you and your ex-boyfriend have mutual friends and his mean behavior is making social interactions uncomfortable for you, let your friends know what's going on. They may be able to reason with your ex in a way that you would not be able to, or they may decide to stop inviting him to events as long as he continues to be mean to you. [10] X Research source Depending on the relationship that both you and your ex have with your friends, you may have to be willing to cut ties with some of them. Keep in mind that someone who encourages your ex to be mean to you is not really your friend at all. Talking to your friends about the situation will also give you a way to vent. Supportive friends will make you feel good about yourself, which will make it much easier to deal with your mean ex."
