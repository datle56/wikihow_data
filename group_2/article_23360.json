Some of these cuts may include the Teddy Bear cut, the Kennel cut, the Natural cut, Cording, and the Puppy cut. [13] X Research source The Teddy Bear cut appears as the same length all over (usually around 3 inches) apart from the head, where the hair is fluffy and cut in a rounded shape. [14] X Research source The Kennel cut is seen as clipping the hair much shorter all over. [15] X Research source The Natural cut is a long, wavy cut which has been left to grow all over. [16] X Research source Cording seems similar to human dreadlocks, and their hair naturally develops into cords if left long enough.
