      "title": "Tuck a black turtleneck into a pair of black cargo pants.",
      "content": "Tuck a black turtleneck into a pair of black cargo pants. Slip into a long-sleeved black turtleneck shirt. Pull on a pair of straight-fit cargo pants that are slightly loose. If you don’t have a black turtleneck, a white one will work. Make sure you change the other main costume details to white, as well. If you don’t have black cargo pants, try black tights, skinny jeans or leggings."

      "title": "Tie a short piece of black ribbon over the pants at each ankle.",
      "content": "Tie a short piece of black ribbon over the pants at each ankle. All cargo pants are straight-fit, but ninja pants taper at the ankles. To get the same effect, use black ribbon to tie the pants off just above the ankles. Tie the knots securely."

    {
      "title": "Obtain a black kimono or short black robe.",
      "content": "Obtain a black kimono or short black robe. A real kimono might be expensive, but the perfect substitute is a short black satin (or thin cotton) robe. These can be found at any department store. Make sure it comes with a belt! If you can’t find a completely black satin robe, look for one that has detailing in bright, rich colors like red, blue, green and white. Minimal floral detail in those colors would work, for example. You could also just get the darkest solid color they have (red and white ninjas aren’t uncommon)."

    {
      "title": "Put the robe on over your turtleneck and cargo pants.",
      "content": "Put the robe on over your turtleneck and cargo pants. Slip it on like you would a regular robe, then arrange it until you feel comfortable. Fasten the belt firmly at the waist by tying it in a knot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slip on a pair of black gloves.",
      "content": "Slip on a pair of black gloves. Any material will do – leather, wool, knit – as long as they’re black. Tuck the wrist part of each glove into the sleeves of your black turtleneck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap a black scarf around your upper torso.",
      "content": "Wrap a black scarf around your upper torso. Once you get it around your upper torso (bottom half of your ribcage down to about your belly button), the front will look like a very wide belt. Take the ends of the scarf and tie them together tightly behind you. Use safety pins to secure the scarf in place. For a cleaner look, tuck the ends underneath the main part of the belt so they don't hang down."

    {
      "title": "Tuck your pants into black ankle-high boots.",
      "content": "Tuck your pants into black ankle-high boots. Slip on a pair of black boots. Before you tie them, tuck the ends of your pants down into them. Then tie them like you normally would, securing the pants in place."

    {
      "title": "Put on a long-sleeved t-shirt and stop above the ears and nose.",
      "content": "Put on a long-sleeved t-shirt and stop above the ears and nose. In other words, pop your head about halfway through the collar. The top of the tee (the collar) should be resting on the arch of your nose and ears. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pull the back of the shirt over your forehead.",
      "content": "Pull the back of the shirt over your forehead. Adjust it so it's a bit above your eyebrows. It doesn't have to feel tight just yet, just get it situated in place. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the sleeves and tie them behind your head.",
      "content": "Take the sleeves and tie them behind your head. Tuck the material under itself so that it just covers your forehead. It's okay to leave the sleeves dangling in the back. You can either leave them free or tuck them into the turtleneck. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Create pant guards with red or black t-shirts.",
      "content": "Create pant guards with red or black t-shirts. Pant guards are tied around both calves and around both thighs, right above the knees. You’ll need four shirts. You could also use scarves instead of t-shirts, if you have those on hand. Red and black are ideal, but white would work, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place one shirt across your upper thigh above the knee.",
      "content": "Place one shirt across your upper thigh above the knee. The collar should be pointing toward your navel at an angle. Tuck in the seam of the collar to get rid of the awkward lines. Tuck any loose material so that the band is 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide. Your thigh is not in the t-shirt. The t-shirt is simply draped over it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the sleeves and wrap the shirt around your upper leg.",
      "content": "Take the sleeves and wrap the shirt around your upper leg. Tie off the sleeves in the back of your leg. Fold the knots under. Tuck any loose material so that the band is 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide. Then, tie off the bottom ends of the shirt behind your leg. Make sure you tuck loose ends or knots. Do this to both legs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take another shirt and do the same to your lower legs.",
      "content": "Take another shirt and do the same to your lower legs. Wrap a t-shirt around the middle of one of your calves. Tie the sleeves in the back, just like you did with the thigh guards. Fold the knots under the fabric. Do the same thing for your other calf."

    {
      "title": "Make some ninja weapons to complete the look.",
      "content": "Make some ninja weapons to complete the look. You could make throwing stars or a ninja sword out of cardboard, or buy plastic ones from a costume shop and carry those. If you have nun-chucks, carry those with you. If nothing else, ninjas used long wooden staffs as weapons, so you could try using the long handle of a broom or find a tree branch outside that resembles a staff."

      "title": "Make a weapon.",
      "content": "Make a weapon. Take a piece of cardboard, and cut it to the shape of the weapon. Use duct tape, to create a sliver shine. On the end, take black tape, or cloth for the handle."
