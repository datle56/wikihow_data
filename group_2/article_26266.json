When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above the 1st.” [1] X Research source Level: 1st Casting time: 1 Action Range/area: Touch Components: Verbal, Somatic, Material (requires a pinch of dirt) Duration: 1 hour School: Transmutation Attack/safe: None Damage/effect: Buff Classes: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard, Artificer"

Although it might not be useful to cast this spell during combat and waste one of your actions, it can be helpful to cast before you enter combat to boost your climbing and walking speed. Ask your DM if they allow non-casters to use spell scrolls. If you’re not a bard, druid, ranger, wizard or artificer, you might be able to buy a scroll of Longstrider to get the same perks.

      "content": "Cast Longstrider on your mount to increase your travel times. Whether you’re chasing down a foe on horseback or flying across open waters to the next continent on a wyvern, Longstrider can be a good spell for speeding up those long traveling times. Once you level up, you can also cast this spell on the mounts of all your party members so you can ride together. [3] X Research source If your DM decides to ignore movement speed outside of combat, Longstrider might be more useful if you’re riding a controlled mount in combat."

      "title": "Use Longstrider to increase your swimming speed.",
      "content": "Use Longstrider to increase your swimming speed. Since Longstrider doesn’t specify which speed it increases, it applies to all speeds equally. This means that this spell not only increases your walking speed, but your climbing, jumping, and swimming speed. If you find yourself having to cross a large body of water in a fight, try casting Longstrider . [4] X Research source This might make the spell especially useful for water-based worlds, where movement speed may be more limited."

      "title": "Cast Longstrider on a creature with no walking speed for hilarious results.",
      "content": "Cast Longstrider on a creature with no walking speed for hilarious results. Since the spell doesn’t specify what kind of speed it increases, you might be able to cast it on creatures to increase a movement speed they don’t have from 0 ft to 10 feet (3.0 m). If your DM allows it, cast Longstrider on a fish or shark to see it walk (or bounce) on land. This may be allowed because every monster has a “speed,” which refers to walking speed specifically. Increasing a shark’s speed may increase its “walking speed.” [5] X Research source Alternatively, if your DM doesn’t allow this interpretation, casting Longstrider might just increase the creature’s swimming speed by 10 feet (3.0 m)."
