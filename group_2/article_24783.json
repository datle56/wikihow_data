      "title": "Understand the purpose of your daydreaming.",
      "content": "Understand the purpose of your daydreaming. Knowing why you tend to daydream is crucial in learning how to change it. If you don't know why something is occurring (what the actual problem is) you may have more difficulty coming to a solution. Sometimes individuals daydream as a way to avoid stress or other painful feelings. This imaginary world allows them to escape and avoid dealing with negative emotional states. Daydreaming can also be used as a way to self-soothe by imagining your wishes fulfilled. In addition, fantasizing can be linked to a need to forget certain information (trauma, painful situations, etc). Daydreaming can actually result in forgetting previously learned information or memories. [1] X Research source Make a list of the types of daydreams you have, and what you think the function of this fantasy is. For example, you might identify that you frequently daydream about conversations with friends, which helps you predict what might happen and practice how to respond. Another example is if you have daydreams about buying a home, this may help you think of a brighter day and have hope for the future. Ask yourself, “what is the purpose of my daydreaming in general?” Do you daydream to escape, distract, make yourself feel better, or pass the time?"

[2] X Research source Do you daydream at school mostly, or at work? Are there certain situations that trigger your daydreaming behavior? Recognize how often you daydream. Set your alarm for one hour. Keep a tally of how many times you drifted off into a daydream for that hour. For example, the moment you notice you are daydreaming, write a tally mark on a piece of paper, and so on. This will increase your awareness of how much you actually daydream. Sometimes it may take you a few minutes to realize that you were in a daydream and that is okay, just tally each time you notice that you were drifting off."

      "content": "Identify the negative consequences. If your daydreaming results in difficulties in daily life such as disruption in work or school, interpersonal relationships, or personal obligations, then your daydreaming may be excessive and harmful.

      "content": "Set guidelines and limits for your daydreams. Certain types of daydreaming can lead to negative outcomes. For example, daydreaming about people whom you do not know very well can increase loneliness. [7] X Research source However, imagining people who are close to us can increase feelings of connection and satisfaction with life in general. [8] X Research source Choose boundaries that, when crossed, signal you to stop daydreaming. Some of them might include intimacy, spending large amounts of money, or extreme violence. Sometimes when you are lost in your own dreams and it is wasting your time, just look at your watch. Keeping a watch is a reminder telling you that how precious it is for you make the most of this moment because it won't be back ever again!"

One example of an imagery exercise is to close your eyes and imagine yourself in a safe place. [10] X Research source This place may be a beach, your bedroom, a church or any place that you may feel safe, secure, and relaxed. Imagine how it feels in this place. Notice the temperature, the air, how your body feels, and what other sensations and feelings you have. Imagine what is smells like and sounds like in your safe place. Are there other people in your safe place? What are you doing in your safe place? Stay in your safe place until you are fully relaxed and ready to open your eyes.

You can even give yourself a 5 minute break from your work as a reward.Taking appropriate breaks actually increases productivity overall. Use this time to do something you enjoy such as playing a game or texting a friend."

      "content": "Use grounding techniques. Grounding helps you detach from emotional pain; it is useful especially when dealing with difficult situations and emotions and can serve as a healthy and useful replacement to daydreaming or fantasizing. Grounding can be done in any situation and at any moment that you choose, and it helps to re-focus your mind. Once you do the grounding exercise, go back to your original duty or task. You may find that you are better able to focus after using a specific grounding technique. Name some of the different objects in the room and their different uses. You could name some color or animals that you can think of. Remember not to spend too much time doing the grounding technique, or you are simply using it as another form of daydreaming. Limit yourself to about 1 minute, and then go back to what you were previously doing."
