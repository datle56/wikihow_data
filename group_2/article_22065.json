      "title": "Understand the stock market competition system.",
      "content": "Understand the stock market competition system. In the GTA V stock market, each stock has a similar rival stock; destroying that rival's property or causing chaos at that rival's venue will cause their stock to lower, thus increasing their competitor's stock. The competition pairings are as follows: Coolbeans | BeanMachine Burgershot | Up-An-Atom Clucking Bell | TacoBomb FlyUS | AirEmu GoPostal | PostOP Bilkington | DollarPills Pißwasser | Logger MazeBank | BankOfLiberty Redwood | Debonaire Slaughter, Slaughter & Slaughter | Bullhead RadioLosSantos | WorldwideFM eCola | Raine"

    {
      "title": "Find a stock that you want to disrupt.",
      "content": "Find a stock that you want to disrupt. For example, if your preferred in-game drink is eCola, attack every eCola delivery truck that you see. This becomes difficult for certain location-based vendors, though going to the vendor's location and attacking standers-by there may work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the stock to go down in price.",
      "content": "Wait for the stock to go down in price. Once the stock for the brand that you've been harassing goes down in price, you can proceed with this method—or harass them more to cause the stock to fall further. Changes to a company's value may take a day or two of in-game time to reflect on the stock market."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy the stock once it's cheap.",
      "content": "Buy the stock once it's cheap. With your chosen company successfully disrupted, the stock should be significantly cheaper than it was before, allowing you to buy a fair amount of stock in the company. The price of the stock will depend heavily upon the brand, the amount of damage done, and the current market in-game."

    {
      "title": "Begin attacking the competitor's property or clientele.",
      "content": "Begin attacking the competitor's property or clientele. In the case of eCola, this would be Raine; simply find the corresponding competition and repeat your mayhem-inducing actions for them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch your invested stock rise in value.",
      "content": "Watch your invested stock rise in value. As you cause problems for the competitor, your invested stock should begin to rise again. Keep harassing the competition until you've made a profit, then repeat this process as much as you like. This is not the most lucrative use of the stock market in GTA V, but it is a good way to begin making some extra side cash early on in the game."

    {
      "title": "Understand the concept.",
      "content": "Understand the concept. By investing in certain companies before killing their rivals' investors or owners in assassinations, you can make huge amounts of money. You'll have to wait until the story mode is over before doing this, since you won't have enough money to make a large profit until after the game's campaign is over. All of the assassination missions are completed by Franklin, and given to him by Lester. [1] X Research source Never complete the next mission in the sequence until all your stock shenanigans are finished."

      "content": "Play the main story up to the Hotel Assassination mission. You shouldn't complete any side assassinations for now, but the Hotel Assassination mission is mandatory to progress forward the story. Before doing this mission, you'll want to invest all of your money in a stock that's guaranteed to go up."

      "content": "Sell the Beta stock immediately after completing the Hotel Assassination. Doing so will result in a profit for you. At this point, you technically can wait three in-game days, buy Bilkington stock on the LCN, wait an in-game week, and then sell Bilkington off, but it's unnecessary and won't net you much profit."

      "title": "Finish the story mode.",
      "content": "Finish the story mode. It takes money to make money on the stock market; finishing the story mode will net roughly $25 million dollars for each character, after which point you can continue along to the rest of the assassination missions."

      "content": "Sell off Facade after it rebounds. The rebound can take a couple of days, so make sure that you save before buying Facade and monitor the stock's peak level. You can normally sell Facade for a 30 percent profit, which should put you in the neighborhood of 2 billion dollars."
