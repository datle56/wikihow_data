      "content": "Get a new hobby. There are hundreds of different things you can do with any size of budget. If you're low on cash, it's as simple as getting a pencil and piece of paper and learning to draw things. For absolutely no money down and no money ever, you can start going for walks in the countryside or along the river, or even start teaching yourself HTML or CSS. If you’re willing to dive into your wallet, try dance classes, an instrument, or find a way to up your adrenaline. [1] X Expert Source Tracey Rogers, MA Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 January 2020. By keeping yourself occupied with something you enjoy, not only will you be less bored and therefore a happier person, but it'll make you a more interesting person to be around and could force you to make new friends. What’s more, you’ll have an awesome skill to talk about and showcase to the world."

      "content": "Take a course online. If you have the internet, you can get an education. Technology is amazing and it leaves room for no excuses. There are large sites like Coursera [2] X Research source or Khan Academy [3] X Research source that offer you free online courses, and then there are university websites like MIT and Harvard that put up all the content from certain courses online available to everyone. Not only does it keep you busy, but it keeps your mind working while expanding your horizons. Win, win, and win. And it’s not like college where you ‘’have’’ to take certain courses. You can browse through their class list and pick out 1 or 2 that would fascinate you. And if you don’t keep up? There’s no failing grade. It's much easier to learn things and expand your life and mind when you have a genuine interest in what you're studying. Reader Poll: We asked 381 wikiHow readers and 46% of them chose learning a new language as the skill they’d be most excited to learn. [Take Poll] So you may want to try taking a language course and see if it interests you!"

      "content": "Get involved in an organization that you believe in. Have you ever met someone that dedicates their free time to individuals worse off than they are? Odds are it hasn't been often and if you have, you've been in awe of them. Why can’t this person be you? Whether it means volunteering at a hospital, an old folk’s home, or just giving dogs at the Humane Society walks, you and the world will be better for it. Doing acts of kindness will help you feel better about yourself and what you have going on for you, too. In addition to that, you'll be surrounded by like-minded, interesting people who also want to better the world."

      "content": "Get active in non-traditional ways. Being a runner is great. Going to the gym on the regular is wonderful. But what if your form of exercise was rock climbing or pole dancing or cross-country backpacking? It’s good for your body, your soul, and it makes you pretty cool. What’s not to like? This is a great way to get fit and to meet people. Join an adventure organization or a rock climbing team. Not feeling that crazy? How about your local intramural slamball team or a horseback riding club? There are many groups out there that are just for fun and don't require a vast amount of skill. You can even find groups of people looking to try new things on sites like Meetup.com"

      "title": "Do something you’d never dream of doing.",
      "content": "Do something you’d never dream of doing. We all tend to put ourselves into little boxes. We think we would like this, we think we should act like that – but it really doesn't do us any good. Take a minute to think of something you’d never do and then put your mind to doing it. Would you never go skinny dipping? Do it. Never hold a spider? Do it. Even you can surprise yourself. It doesn’t have to be something scary – it could even be going to a country music concert if that’s something you’d never do,or traveling to a completely new place. It’s about getting out of your comfort zone and becoming a more dynamic person. And this way you can know if you ‘’actually’’ like it or not."

      "title": "Get off your computer.",
      "content": "Get off your computer. Challenge yourself to limit your time spent on Facebook, Twitter, and every other site that isn’t making your life any better. Think of all the hours you’ve wasted mindlessly scrolling down a page when you could be crafting something, talking to a family member, or helping out a friend? Being on your computer could be keeping your life from being more interesting and from being a better, more well-rounded person. Don't go cold turkey – we all still need our fix. Start just by limiting yourself. Once you've spent 30 minutes or an hour a day on the sites you frequent, cut yourself off. Change to reading a book, or learning that skill you've been trying to cultivate. Just remember social media presents curated versions of people's lives, and can lead to unrealistic expectations and even depression. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake up your routine.",
      "content": "Shake up your routine. It doesn’t matter if other people think you’re interesting, it only matters if you think you’re interesting. And all that takes is a few baby steps and a different routine. So wake up 15 minutes earlier in the morning, make yourself a breakfast you never eat, and go sit out on the porch with a newspaper. Spend a day going to the movies. Make hanky panky during your lunch hour. It doesn’t have to be big, it just has to be different. Try to think of one thing each day you can do differently. Whether it's taking a different route home, actually cooking dinner for once, or calling up a friend you haven't spoken to in years, give it a try. It's about surprising yourself, not other people."

      "content": "Find local events such as markets, festivals, and music events to attend. Pick out things in your area which you think might be interesting and give them a visit. There are often many local events going on, especially in summer, which don't involve spending much or any money. By doing these things which aren't part of your routine, you’ll keep yourself surprised and energized. To find these events, read newspapers, go online, look at flyers on the street and in cafes, and talk to friends and strangers (like the girl setting up the mic at your favorite coffee house). You’ll make social connections, too, making you feel doubly productive."

      "title": "Explore your hometown.",
      "content": "Explore your hometown. When you go on holiday anywhere, the place you’re visiting always seems so much more interesting than where you live. But in reality there is probably lots to do around where you live, you just haven't bothered to look properly since it’s been there all along. Open your eyes; what have you been missing? Go to your local tourist information office and find out what the tourists do in your hometown. There may be museums, boat rides, art galleries or landmarks which you never previously noticed or took interest in."

      "title": "Accept all invitations.",
      "content": "Accept all invitations. If you keep coming up with excuses why you can't socialize then people will just forget about you and stop inviting you out. Even if you're not that keen on the people going, or the places they're going to, try giving them a chance and go and hang out with them anyway. It doesn’t have to be all the time – just once in a while. Socializing with friends is an instant uplift. If your life is full of work, work, and more work, put the guilt and the responsibility at bay for a day and go out and have fun. You deserve it."

      "title": "Do something spontaneous.",
      "content": "Do something spontaneous. On Sunday morning, you probably often find yourself lounging around, popping in and out of Facebook, watching some TV, and just taking it easy (at least, hopefully). Whenever you find you have a moment like that, take it as an opportunity to go do something. Book a night at a local hotel. Find a breakfast brunch buffet. Hop in the car and don’t plan on where you’re going. Be your own “surprisologist.” Make it a point once in a while to have a day dedicated to nothing, where you refuse to make plans. When that day rolls around, do whatever pops into your head. It could be a movie, it could be a trip to the mountains, or it could be somewhere in between. Just listen to your instincts."

      "title": "Organise a party or a night out with your friends.",
      "content": "Organise a party or a night out with your friends. Not only will the organising keep you occupied, but you'll have a good night to look forward to, and then something to look back on happily. Those around you will likely bring up ideas of things you should try, too. Find these opportunities, too. Are you out listening to live music? Buy the guitarist a drink and strike up a conversation. Get a bite to eat with your new slamball teammates. Sometimes you have to knock on opportunity's door and not the other way around."

    {
      "title": "Plan a trip.",
      "content": "Plan a trip. Instead of spending your weekend at home (though weekends are great wherever you are), plan a trip for just a 2-day getaway. You don’t have to take time off work and it doesn’t have to be expensive – it can even be half an hour away where you spend the entire weekend in a hotel basking in the room service. Just go out and have fun! Is there somewhere fairly close by that you’ve always meant to experience but just never gotten around to it? Take this as a prime opportunity to check it off your list. Even if it only takes an afternoon, it counts. Play tourist for a while, getting away from it all. It's a chance to relax, learn something, and get out of your routine."

      "title": "Get rid of whatever bores you.",
      "content": "Get rid of whatever bores you. Things in life often get too comfortable for our own good. We get in a job we don't like but that pays the bills, a relationship that has fizzled out, or in a place where we'd just rather not be. If there's something large going on in your life that's bringing you down, call it a day. It'll be hard now, but it'll be so much better later. In moments like these, you've got to weigh up the pros and cons. Can you afford to move or quit your job? Is your relationship just in a funk and it's not permanent? Make sure you've thought of every side of the equation before you go about making a big change. Can't make a breakaway? Then think up a few ways to make these things more exciting. Ask for a project at work, travel more often, or do new and crazy things with your partner. Everything has the ability to change."

      "title": "Clean up the mess.",
      "content": "Clean up the mess. A tidy house is a tidy mind, where you can finally make room for the fun stuff. By doing this you're showing yourself that you're making a change and bringing out a new improved self. Having a clean home will also make you feel good about yourself, help you to be more organized, allow you to have friends over more often without feeling ashamed, and save you time when looking for things. Getting rid of all that mess will make rooms seem brighter and bigger, therefore making you feel more energized and happy when you get up in the morning or get home from work. Everyone should enjoy being at home, and this will make it easier to do so. You can even try something like redecorating your home. Adding some new paint or rearranging your furniture can help an old space feel newer and more exciting."

      "title": "Stop focusing on the negatives.",
      "content": "Stop focusing on the negatives. Next time you get invited out somewhere, or you have an assignment due in, don't let your brain fill up with bad things about it. If you can focus on the positives, you'll find yourself enjoying even the smallest things. It's far too easy to drown in negativity, but you'll never be happy with your life if you just point out the bad in everything. [5] X Expert Source Tracey Rogers, MA Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 January 2020. If a negative thought comes into your head, try to replace it with a neutral thought. These will be easier to believe at first. Eventually, positive thinking will come naturally. For example, if you think, \"This is so difficult...,\" then just think, \"...but I won't have to worry about it once it's done.\" [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Only care what you think.",
      "content": "Only care what you think. The idea that your life isn’t interesting is nonsense. Everyone’s life is interesting somehow, because only you are you and no one else is can ever have that title. Try to focus on what’s interesting to you and not to others. If you don’t, you’ll still feel boring and like you don’t measure up. This is why your definition of interesting is the only important one. If you think working 4 jobs and never sleeping is interesting, go for it. If your definition means traveling the world, go for it. If being interesting means having loads of different skills, go for it. Everybody has a different concept – and you can only adhere to one."

      "title": "Change your eating.",
      "content": "Change your eating. When it comes to your tastebuds, keep two things in mind: Eat a good balanced diet. A balanced diet is good for your health, but is also good for your mood. A bad diet will cause energy slumps which will make you feel groggy and ill. In addition to that, by knowing that you're looking after your body, you'll feel better about yourself which will give you more confidence and keep you feeling happy. Mix it up. Find a few new recipes you want to try. Go out for Ethiopian next Friday. Try tastes you’ve never had before. Eating exciting meals means you could be interesting 3 times a day. Not too shabby."

      "title": "Take time to relax.",
      "content": "Take time to relax. Whether it's a pampering session once a week, a hot bath or deep breathing sessions, you need something to help you to wind down. Everyone needs time to relax after a hectic week to escape from work or chores for a couple of hours. Even if it’s 15 minutes with a book, it counts. Some people are sticklers for things like yoga and meditation. Others would rather zone out with a video game. There's no right or wrong way to relax as long as it's effective for you. Afterward, you should feel like you've completely recovery mode and are ready to get back in the game."

    {
      "title": "Spend time around happy people.",
      "content": "Spend time around happy people. Avoid people who moan and complain about things all the time and look for people with a good sense of humor who have a positive outlook on life. You'll find that their positivity is contagious. These people are likely to be the ones seeking out exciting, new things to do, too. Another good idea? Spend some time with your family. As we get older, we often realize that when we were young and thought they were lame, we really just missed out on valuable time with them that we'll never get back. They're probably doing interesting things too and would love to take you on for a ride."
