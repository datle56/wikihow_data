      "content": "Cut 3 equal sized strands of thread. If you want to make a very basic design, you can use three strands of thread. In this example, we're using violet, pink and blue. You may want to make a more elaborate design later on, but this pattern will teach some of the basics of knotting. Cut out the strands to the length you wish. Keep in mind, as you'll be knotting during the process, the original length of of your threads will be shorter than the final product. Lie your threads out side-by-side on a flat surface to start."

      "content": "Tie a knot near the end of the strands. To begin, you'll need to tie a knot near the end of your stands of thread. These will connect the strands together. Tie your knot roughly two centimeters away from the ends of the threads. As you move forward, you'll have to use specialized types of knots. However, at this point that is not necessary. Just use a basic knot, like a knot you'd use when tying your shoes. Just make sure your knot is tight enough. If it comes undone, your bracelet could unravel."

      "content": "Make a forward knot with the outermost strand on the left. Take the outermost strand on the left. In our example, this is the violet thread. Use this thread to make what is known as a forward knot. To make a forward knot, take your violet thread and bend it at roughly a 90 degree angle, laying it over the pink thread. This should look something like the number four. Then, loop the violet thread under the pink thread, moving upward towards the knot connecting all the threads together. Pull upwards. Then, repeat the process. It's very important you knot twice using forward knots. If you don't knot twice, your bracelet will have too much slack."

Repeat this process, making forward knots with the violet string, followed by the pink string, followed by the blue string. You can continue knotting until your bracelet is as long as you want. This depends on your needs, wrist size, and other factors. A bracelet that is too short may not fit. However, a bracelet that's too long may slip off. Pause on occasion while working to wrap what you have around your wrist. Stop when you reach a point where the bracelet can be slipped on and off easily, but remains in place."

You'll need either a safety pin or tape to secure the thread while you're working. [1] X Research source You'll also need scissors for cutting the thread.

Cut 12 strands of thread in your different colors. Strands should be about 24 inches (61 cm) each. Make sure you have 2 sets of each of the six colors you chose. [4] X Research source Combine the thread by tying a knot towards the end of the strands, leaving at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of slack. You'll need these 3 inches (7.6 cm) later when you're finishing up your bracelet. [5] X Research source In order to work with your thread, you'll need to secure it. There are two ways you can do this. You can tape the knot to a flat surface, like a table. You can also use a safety pin to pin the knot down on a pillow. [6] X Research source"

Separate your threads, placing six strands of the different colors on each side. Then, move them in such a way that the colors mirror each other. [7] X Research source If this is confusing, look at this example. On your left side, moving from the outermost thread to the innermost thread, you have red, then orange, then lavender, then green, then yellow, then blue. On your right side, the innermost thread would be blue. Blue would be followed by yellow, then green, then lavender, then orange, and ending on a red thread. [8] X Research source"

You're moving the outermost color inwards towards the middle thread. However, you'll be using what are called backwards knots instead of forward knots. Once again, you'll lay the outermost thread on top of the thread next to it. In our example, this means placing the red thread on the right over the orange thread on the right. Loop the red thread under the orange thread. This time, move downward when you loop the thread, moving away from the knot holding your strands of thread together. Pull tight into a knot. As with a forward knot, knot twice. As you did on the left side, continue moving inward with your outermost thread.

Use forward knots, remembering to knot twice, to tie the orange thread with all the other colors. On the right side, use the orange thread to tie backwards knots with all the other colors. Remember to knot twice. When you reach the center, tie the two innermost strands of thread together using a backwards knot.

Find the midpoint of all three strings. Fold all the strings in half along the midpoint. [14] X Research source Towards the end of your folded strings, tie them together in a tight knot to secure. This will make a small loop on the end of your stands of strings. Use a basic knot here, like you'd use when tying your shoes. You'll use the loop you create when your finish your bracelet. You will end up slipping your strings through the loop and tying them together. Make sure the loop is big enough to fit three threads through. [15] X Research source Slip a safety pin through the loop. Fasten the loop on a pillow or other firm surface. This will keep the threads organized and secure while you work. [16] X Research source"

Use one hand to gather two strings on the right. Use your other hand to create a loop with the string to the left. Lie the left thread over the two threads on the right, creating a circular loop with the slack from the left thread. It should look something like a backwards \"P.\" Slip the left string under your two right strings. Move it through the loop you created, moving upward towards the knot on the top. [17] X Research source Pull the left string, holding the other two strings loosely. You should be able to pull upward until the knot you created reaches the knot connecting the threads.

How and when you change colors depends on your personal preferences. If you want a bracelet with a more random design, change colors whenever you feel like it. If you want a more uniform design, make a rule for yourself. For example, you'll change color every 5 knots. [19] X Research source"

Remove the bracelet from the safety pin. Pull the excess strings through the loop at the top. Then, tie a knot with the excess strings to create a fully formed bracelet.
