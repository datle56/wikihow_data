      "content": "Get a haircut so your hair is 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) long. Visit your local barber to get your entire head trimmed. Waves need to be trained while they’re short in order to get the rippled effect in the end. Make sure they don’t cut your hair any shorter or longer, or else the process may be more difficult. You can get your hair faded in the back or near your sideburns if you want, but waves will not form there."

      "title": "Wash your hair.",
      "content": "Wash your hair. Work shampoo into a lather in your hair to clean and moisturize it. Use warm water in your shower to soften your hair. Rinse out the shampoo and pat your hair dry until it’s damp, but not dripping water. [1] X Research source Get a shampoo made for waves if you can find one. Otherwise, you can use regular shampoo."

      "title": "Work a coin-sized amount of conditioner or pomade into your hair.",
      "content": "Work a coin-sized amount of conditioner or pomade into your hair. Work the pomade or conditioner in your hands to warm it up before applying it to your hair. Spread the product evenly through your hair, working it down towards your scalp. This helps keeps your hair moisturized. [2] X Research source Don’t rinse out leave-in conditioner if you use it. Find a product meant for forming waves on your head, such as wave grease."

      "title": "Use a boar-bristle brush to comb your hair towards the ground.",
      "content": "Use a boar-bristle brush to comb your hair towards the ground. Brushing flattens your curls against your head to form a ripple effect. Comb the front of your hair forward towards your face. Brush the back and sides of your hair downwards with a stiff-bristled brush. Follow the direction that your hair naturally grows for the best results. Keep brushing your hair for at least 15 minutes to set your hair. Some brushes are made specifically for starting waves in your hair. Look at your local barbershop or online to purchase one."

      "title": "Wear a do-rag",
      "content": "Wear a do-rag for at least 30 minutes after you brush. Put on the do-rag and wrap the ties behind your head. Bring the ties back around front to tighten your do-rag before tying a knot in the back. Keep your do-rag on to keep your waves in place. [3] X Research source Do-rags can be purchased in department stores or online. You can also wear a tight-fitting stocking cap or scarf if you don’t have a do-rag."

      "title": "Brush your waves in 4 15-minute sessions every day.",
      "content": "Brush your waves in 4 15-minute sessions every day. Split your brushing sessions throughout the day to constantly train your waves. Do at least 1 session in the morning and 1 at night before you go to bed. Make sure to use a moisturizing product, such as conditioner or shea oil, every time you brush to keep your hair soft. [4] X Research source Remember to put on your do-rag for 30 minutes after each brushing session. Brushing your hair more throughout the day will help your waves develop faster."

      "title": "Sleep with your do-rag on so your waves stay in place.",
      "content": "Sleep with your do-rag on so your waves stay in place. After your last brushing session for the night, tie the do-rag around your head so your hair doesn’t move around while you sleep. Keep the do-rag on for the entire night so your hair doesn’t rub up against your pillow or bed. [5] X Research source Put a tight headband around your do-rag if you’re worried about it falling off in the middle of the night. Sleeping without your do-rag can make you lose progress when you’re trying to form your waves."

      "title": "Let your waves grow out for at least 3-4 weeks.",
      "content": "Let your waves grow out for at least 3-4 weeks. Let your curls and waves develop over 3-4 weeks. Make sure to brush every day or else your hair will start to over-curl and you’ll lose the defined edges on your waves. Continue to moisturize your hair with a light product, like shea oil, or else the product may build up. [6] X Research source This process is known as “wolfing.”"

      "title": "Get a haircut from your barber every 4 weeks.",
      "content": "Get a haircut from your barber every 4 weeks. Let your barber know that you are training waves into your hair so they know how to cut your hair. Get your hair cut back down to 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm), leaving 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64–1.27 cm) extra at your crown so your hair stays thick enough to continue forming waves. [7] X Research source You can add fades to the front, back, or sides if you don’t want a full head of waves."

      "content": "Wash your hair every other day. On one day, use shampoo and conditioner in your hair to keep it clean and moisturized. On the next day when you take a shower, only rinse your hair. That way, your waves have time to set between each wash. [9] X Research source Remember to brush your hair right after you wash it so it keeps its shape."
