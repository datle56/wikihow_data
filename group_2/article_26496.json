By replacing meat with nutritious, low-calorie, high-volume foods such as beans, tofu, or lentils, you can cut significant amounts of your daily calorie intake while adding many nutrients to your diet. Eat delicious fruit for dessert rather than a processed cookie or cake. This alone can save hundreds of calories per day. Swap potato chips and candy bars for snacks that are nutrient-rich and low in calories and fat. Try combining string cheese with a handful of grapes, spreading peanut butter on a few crackers, or dipping sliced red pepper into a few tablespoons of hummus. Try substituting vinegar and lemon juice for your regular salad dressing. Cook with a tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter.

      "content": "Calculate how many calories you can eat while still losing weight. Start by finding your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is how many calories you need just doing nothing all day. Then, use an online calculator to estimate how many calories you burn through activity and multiple your BMR by your physical activity level (PAL). Finally, subtract 500 calories for every pound you want to lose that week. [9] X Research source To calculate your BMR, first get your weight in kilograms by multiplying your weight in pounds by .45. Next, get your height in centimeters by multiplying your total inches in height by 2.54. Then, use this formula to find your BMR: (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) - 161. To estimate the calories you burn through exercise, try this calculator: https://caloriecontrol.org/healthy-weight-tool-kit/get-moving-calculator/ . For an easy way to estimate the number of calories you can eat, use an online calculator like this one: https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator . Calorie counting apps, such as My Fitness Pal, usually do this calculation for you. Never eat fewer than 1200 calories a day, unless your doctor is supervising you. Eating fewer than 1200 calories a day is dangerous for your health, and it can actually slow down your metabolism too much by activating the body's starvation mode and by causing a loss of lean muscle mass over time."
