She might gaze deeply into your eyes or make eye contact for several seconds before she looks away. These are both promising signs that she wants to make a connection. [2] X Research source Another good sign is if you catch her glancing your way from across the room. If you want to flirt back, hold her gaze. Is she glancing away a lot or does it seems like she's not giving you her full attention? This might mean that she's bored, uncomfortable, or wants to be somewhere else.

      "content": "She'll turn towards you while keeping her arms uncrossed. A lot of body language is subtle—she probably won't realize she's even doing these things! If she likes you, she'll angle her legs or shoulders toward you or lean in slightly so she's closer to you. [3] X Research source Crossing the arms and legs is usually a standoffish body signal. It means she's closing off to you or feeling vulnerable. If she's showing open body language, match her signals. This is called mirroring and it shows her that you're receptive to her, too."

      "title": "A young woman will usually break into a broad smile if she likes you.",
      "content": "A young woman will usually break into a broad smile if she likes you. It's hard for some people to hide their emotions so she may bust out a big grin when she sees you. This tells you she feels good around you and you make her happy. [4] X Research source She might also give you subtle, half-smiles if she's being flirtatious. Batting the eyes might seem cliche, but it is actually something that people do when they’re flirting. If a young woman is fluttering her lashes at you, she probably likes what she sees."

      "content": "A girl might be into you if she finds excuses to touch you. She may brush up against you or just stand near you when you're together in a group. If she doesn't initiate much physical contact, try this—try touching her arm briefly while you're talking. You can use her reaction to gauge how she feels about you. [6] X Research source If she smiles and doesn't pull back, great job! You might even find that she starts initiating more physical contact if she's interested in you. If she doesn't smile but doesn't pull away, keep flirting and continue to gauge her reaction. Of course if she backs off, make sure to respect her space and boundaries."

She may laugh at your jokes or just make really enthusiastic statements. [8] X Research source For example, if she says something like, “Wow, I’m so glad you’re here! Let’s have fun!” that’s a great sign that she’s flirting with you. Sure, a girl might smile even if she's not into you, but it probably won't be a big grin or the smile might not reach her eyes. A forced smile means she's probably not interested."

      "content": "She might be attracted to you because you're secure.
