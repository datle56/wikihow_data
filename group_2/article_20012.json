      "content": "Switching the side you part your hair on can provide immediate volume. If you always part your hair in the same spot, you probably notice that your hair just falls into place. Make a point of parting your hair on the opposite side or change the part in some way. Instead of going for a straight part, you could try a zig-zag. Adjusting your part gives instant volume since your hair isn't used to falling in that way. [1] X Research source If you're feeling like you're losing volume throughout the day, just flip your hair over to the other side to get a quick volume boost."

      "content": "Flipping your head upside-down helps gravity lift your hair for instant volume. This is a really simple but effective technique. Start with damp hair and flip your head upside-down. Blow-dry the hair near the base of your neck to add volume. Once your hair is almost completely dry, flip your hair back and finish styling. [2] X Research source For extra volume with soft waves, use a barrel brush while you're drying. If you want more volume when you push your hair back, you'll want to blow dry it forward toward your face."

      "content": "Rolling your damp hair can create a big, bouncy style. Work with your hair once it's about seventy-percent dry. Wrap a segment of hair around a roller and bring it close to your scalp. Roll up all of your hair and finish blow drying it. When you remove the rollers , run your fingers or a comb through your hair so it looks soft and full. [3] X Research source You might prefer to put your hair in rollers and sleep in them. Then, when you wake up, you just have to remove the rollers and you're good to go!"

      "content": "Teased hair won’t lay as flat on your scalp. Hold a section of your hair away from your scalp and brush back down to the roots. You only need to back brush 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) away from the scalp to create instant volume. Then, gently brush your fingers near your scalp to make the style look natural. [4] X Research source If you're worried that you'll damage your hair by teasing it with a stiff hairbrush, try using a soft toothbrush! The gentle bristles will still add volume to your hair, but they're not harsh like some brushes."

      "title": "Putt your hair up while you sleep gives you lift in the morning.",
      "content": "Putt your hair up while you sleep gives you lift in the morning. Clip your damp hair onto the top of your head. If you don't have a hair clip, you can put your hair into a bun on the top of your head and secure it with a scrunchie. Let your hair finish drying overnight. When you wake up, run your fingers through it. You'll notice you've got a lot more volume at the crown of your head! [5] X Research source It's a good idea to put your hair up every night even when it's not damp. By putting it up, your head won't press your hair flat against your pillow while you sleep."

      "title": "Straight hair tends to look thinner than hair with texture.",
      "content": "Straight hair tends to look thinner than hair with texture. To give your hair the appearance of volume, use a curling iron or crimping tool to make your hair wavy or curly. If your hair has got this natural texture, don't bother straightening it. Instead, just let your hair air dry and rock your waves! [6] X Research source If you prefer straight hair, try this trick: straighten your hair but go back with a crimping iron and crimp the hair near your scalp that's just under your part. It won't be visible, but it will create lift near the crown of your head. If you want body without the curls, curl your hair and then brush your hair with a boar-bristle brush. It will soften your look, but keep the volume in your hair."

If you're feeling more ambitious, get a short cut so your hair isn't weighed down. [7] X Research source Try a shaggy pixie cut or a textured bob for a low-maintenance style."

      "content": "Massaging your scalp can actually help stimulate hair growth. Spend about 5 minutes rubbing your fingers along your scalp every day to encourage your hair to grow thicker. Keep in mind that it takes a few months to see results, but you can still enjoy this relaxing habit that can make your hair look thicker and fuller. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Massaging your scalp can temporarily lift the hair near your roots. For extra staying power, spritz your fingertips with hairspray before you massage so you keep the volume for longer."

      "content": "Skip serums or oils that weigh down your hair. When you do wash, condition, or style, look for products that say \"volumizing\" on the label. If in doubt, reach for hair products designed for fine or thin hair since these will try to add volume. When you style, choose mousses and whips instead of creams or gels that are heavy on your hair. [9] X Research source Even though you’re using great products for your hair, residue can build up, which weighs your hair down. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo once every week or two to completely remove product build-up."

Since the ends of your hair tend to be dryer anyway, focus on them when you condition your hair. [10] X Research source When it's time to rinse, use cold water. It does a better job of removing the conditioner and gives your hair a nice shine. [11] X Research source"

Try to eat a variety in your meals so you're including fresh produce, lean meats, and whole grain. These contain protein, vitamins, and minerals like zinc and iron. [12] X Research source Although you may have seen advice that taking vitamin supplements can improve your hair’s health, this isn’t really supported by research.
