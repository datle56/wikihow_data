There are a couple easy ways to do this: Surround the table with a large square of bookshelves, leaving a gap in between. Leave one gap in the square to walk through. Or make a 4x5 L shape out of eight bookshelves. Place a second stack of eight bookshelves over the L. (This is one more than you need, so you can skip one from the second level.) It's best to have 30 levels of experience when you go to start enchanting. A level-30 enchantment usually only takes around 3 levels of experience from the user. Plus, level-30 enchantments always give you the highest chance at the strongest enchantments."
