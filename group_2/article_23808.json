      "content": "Follow “The Pursuit” quest and speak to Vex when prompted. If you’re following the Thieves’ Guild questline, you’ll pick up this quest after completing “Hard Answers.” To start it, meet Karliah at the Ragged Flagon in Riften. You’ll go through a cutscene where Karliah clears her name, and the guild discovers that Mercer has been stealing from them. From there, Brynjolf will task you with infiltrating Mercer’s house. [1] X Research source Be sure to exhaust all the possible dialogue options with Brynjolf before you leave. When you ask him for information, he’ll tell you to ask Vex for more details on Mercer’s house guard, Vald. Speak to Vex, too; she’ll explain that Vald is in debt to Maven Black-Briar and won’t betray her, but he might help if you clear his debt (or you could just kill him and take the key from his body)."

      "content": "Go to the gate behind Riftweald Manor. Riftweald Manor is in Riften, and it’s Mercer Frey’s house. From the point where you first appear when fast-traveling to Riften, Riftweald Manor is the fourth door on the left from the main gates. Use the following directions to get to the back gate behind the manor: [2] X Research source Continue past Riftweald Manor until you reach the opening in the wall to the left leading to the Temple of Mara. Enter the courtyard in front of the Temple of Mara. Go through the archway to the right of the temple that leads toward the cemetery. Go through the cemetery and follow the path to the left leading behind the temple. The first gate on your left after you pass the temple is the gate to Riftweald Manor. Note: You can’t get into Riftweald any other way—the front door has been barred."

      "title": "Get Mercer’s House Key from Vald.",
      "content": "Get Mercer’s House Key from Vald. Vald guards the property, and if he sees you trying to break in, he’ll attack. However, you can speak to him through the gate; if you have high enough speech skills, you can just convince Vald to run an errand to Markarth and get through the gate when he leaves. Otherwise, you’ll need to clear his debt with Maven, pickpocket him, or kill him. [3] X Research source Clearing Vald’s debt: Talk to Maven, who will want you to fetch the Quill of Gemination. You’ll find it in Vald’s Strongbox, a locked box in an underwater rowboat about halfway between the big boat outside the Riften Fishery and the docked boat at Goldenglow. Pickpocketing Vald: This is a tricky option since you’ll need to wait for Vald to stand against the gate with his back turned before pickpocketing him. You can grab the key from his inventory if he does (and your skill is high enough). Killing Vald: This is probably the most straightforward option; you can attack Vald from afar or shoot the mechanism under the balcony to bait him into chasing you. Run back to the marketplace, and the guards will attack Vald—so you can kill him and loot his body."

An arrow pointer can be seen on the underside of the wooden balcony on the second floor. If you look there closely, you’ll see a small, dark mechanism that you can target with an arrow or the Unrelenting Force shout. [4] X Research source If a Riften guard spots you in the area, they’ll try to question you about the “incident” (probably the manor being broken into). Just say you don’t know anything about the incident when prompted, and the guard will leave. If you refuse to answer the question, the guard will try to arrest you."

You can either sneak past them all or fight them—it’s your choice. Either way, your goal is to find the stairs down and, eventually, the tunnels in the basement. [7] X Research source If you’re sneaking, you’ll need to pass a bandit right after getting inside, go through the bedroom, then head down the stairs. On the ground floor, pass through a closed set of double doors and find a Suspicious Cabinet on the left side of the room. Open it, and you’ll find a second set of stairs down into the underground tunnels."

When you get down there, be careful: there’s a tripwire that’ll trigger a deadly trap, but you can set it off harmlessly if you spot it first. Turn right immediately, then just follow the tunnel until you get to a room with Mercer’s plans—they’ll be sitting right out in the open on his desk! Congratulations: you’ve successfully discovered evidence of Mercer’s location. [8] X Research source In the same room, you can also grab the Bust of the Gray Fox , which you can sell to Delvin. You can also take Chillrend , a unique glass sword that’s one of the strongest weapons in the game! Don’t leave until you’ve snapped up all the valuable loot in the area."

This will complete “The Pursuit” and start the next quest, “Trinity Restored.” [9] X Research source"
