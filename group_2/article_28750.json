Creative mode gives you access to all of the different blocks in the game in unlimited quantities, and you don't have to worry about monsters or surviving. You can start a game in Creative mode and then transfer it to Survival mode when you're finished building. If you've already started a Survival mode game, open the Pause menu, select \"Open to LAN,\" and then make sure cheats are enabled. You can then type /gamemode c in the chat window ( T ) to change to Creative mode. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a suitable location for your castle. A castle should be an imposing sight to behold, and were traditionally placed in highly defensible positions. You'll also want it near important resources, such as at the mouth of your main mineshaft, near your farms, or close to your Nether Portal. Scour your map for a good place to construct your new castle. You may want to build near a village so that you can act as their lord. Consider placing your castle high up on a mountain, or at the mouth of a river. Get creative with your castle placement. Suspend it between two mountains, build it in the treetops, carve it out of a cavern deep underground. The possibilities are essentially endless."

Use your tools to clear out vegetation and level the land. Take your landscape into consideration when getting ready to build your castle. Depending on your design goals, you may want to preserve some natural structures."

This can help immensely, as building from plans will speed up the building process and ensure that everything lines up properly.

You could look up castles in Europe for a traditional medieval style, or look at Japanese or Chinese castles and palaces. You can look up pictures of Lord of the Rings and other fantasy castles. Many real castles will have layouts available online, potentially as part of their tourism information. You can use these layouts as a guide when designing your own castle. Some real castles, such as the Dover Castle in England, have official Minecraft recreations and instructions. [2] X Research source Lots of Minecraft players have posted their own castle layouts online. Simply search \"Minecraft castle blueprints\" in Google Images to see a large number of layouts you can copy or use as a starting point."

Dig the moat at least three blocks deep and run it around the entire edge. Once you're finished digging the moat, you can use buckets to fill it with water. For a more intense moat, fill it with lava! Make sure you have a bridge over the moat before filling it so that you can access your castle. If you have access to redstone and some time to tinker, you can create an automated drawbridge. See Build a Piston Drawbridge in Minecraft for more details."

There's a whole lot you can do with a program like MCEdit, so you'll want to start with just the basics and practice creating blocks with the brush. You'll see the various tools displayed along the bottom of the screen. Click the Brush button (it looks like a gray circle in MCEdit). The brush tool options will appear in a new window, allowing you to select the size and shape of the brush, as well as the type of block you want to create with it. For example, to quickly make a huge castle wall, enter H 10, L 30, W 2. You'll see the cursor change into a very large wall section. You can switch directions by swapping the L and W values. Move your mouse around the world and click the left mouse button when you've found the spot you want to create the blocks. Larger brushes may take a few moments to appear in the world. By practicing with the brush tool, you'll quickly become adept at creating complex using any material available in the game. You can use the tool to create very small and very large brushes, allowing for a lot of control over your creation."

You can use the selection tool in MCEdit to highlight a portion of your castle and then copy and paste it over and over again. This is great for creating lots of similar rooms, or extending a piece of an elaborate wall. With the selection tool activated, click and drag to create a cube in the game space. This cube represents the currently selected blocks. Creating the box can be a little finicky in 3D space, but you just need to start it in the general area and you can easily resize it manually. To resize the selection, click and drag on one of the walls to move it in or out from the center of the selection. Do this to all of the walls until you have exactly what you want selected. Use the movement keys and the mouse to see all angles of your selection. Click the \"Copy\" button to copy the currently-selected blocks. Click the \"Paste\" button and your cursor will turn into a copy of your selection. You can then place this copy just like you would a brush. You can rotate, roll, mirror, and flip the piece by clicking the appropriate button in the tool menu."
