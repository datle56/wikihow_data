Figure out how you'll introduce yourself if someone else doesn't do it. Also, think of a few questions you might like to ask her. Then, take some time to practice saying them in front of the mirror. Use a calm, confident voice. [1] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Hi, I'd like to introduce myself. My name's Jessie. What's yours?\" If the meeting is planned, try to tailor what you'll say to the person. For instance, you might say, \"Hi, I'm Jessie. You must be Rebecca. I've heard so many good things about you!.\""

      "content": "Pick a snazzy outfit that makes you feel good. You don't have to dress up in a suit or a fancy dress to impress a girl. You should pick something you feel comfortable in, as that will make you more confident. However, whatever you choose should be clean and not too worn out. Also, try to pick something that fits you well; it shouldn't hang off of you nor should it be so tight it clings to you uncomfortably. [2] X Research source For instance, maybe skip the ratty jeans and the t-shirt with 3 holes in it. Of course, you never know when you're going to meet a girl you want to impress. The key is to always dress to impress! If you'd like to wear makeup or accessories, go for it! Try not to go overboard, but keep it simple and natural-looking. As far as accessories, aim for 2-3 of your favorite pieces. Any more than that, and it may come as too much."

Also, if you have facial hair, make sure it's neatly trimmed and combed into shape. Don't forget to brush your teeth and floss for a nice smile. [3] X Research source Brush and style your hair so that it looks neat. If you want to wear perfume or cologne, that's fine. However, keep it to a small spritz on your wrist or neck. If you spray too much, you can overwhelm the person you're meeting with the scent. Plus, some people are allergic to scents! Looks aren't everything, but putting your best foot forward is always a good idea. Women notice when you make an effort.

Hold out your hand for a handshake if it seems right in the situation and say your introduction. [5] X Research source Remember what you'd plan to say: \"Hi, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Jessie. What's your name?\" If someone else introduces you, try \"Hi, it's very nice to meet you, Rebecca.\" When shaking someone's hand, make sure to do it firmly with confidence. Grasp her hand with a firm grip and pump it up and down a few times before letting go. If she doesn't seem interested in talking, be willing to walk away. If she's not responding to you, looking elsewhere, or acting uninterested, politely bow out of the conversation."

Stand up straight and even puff your chest out a little bit. Even if you're not feeling it, fake it. Just faking it will make you feel more confident! [6] X Research source Try to pump yourself up as needed. Tell yourself you're an awesome person that anyone would like to get to know!

Plus, when you look at her eyes while talking, you show that you're engaged and you care about what she has to say. However, eye contact should be natural. That is, don't stare at her without blinking for 5 minutes straight. Just make sure to connect with her eyes from time to time when you're speaking to her. Both of these also display confidence."

If you're in a coffee shop, you could ask questions about the kind of coffee she likes or how often she visits this particular shop, for instance. You could also talk about a painting you see on the wall, the unseasonable weather, or the music that's playing. You might say, \"So, are you a coffee fiend like me or more of a tea aficionado? I can't get moving in the morning without a few shots of espresso.\" Be sure to listen to the answers she gives you.

People like talking about themselves, so when you are able to turn the conversation on her, you're already starting to make a good first impression.

Nod along to let her know you're listening and wait until she completely finishes her thought before trying to speak. When you do speak, say something that is a response to something she said. That shows you're thoughtful and that you actually heard her. [9] X Research source For example, if she's talking about her job working at a call center, you might say, \"That sounds like a tough position. How do you deal with all those angry customers all day long?\" If you don't quite catch what she said, ask for more information!

She'll probably want to know more about you, and if she asks you something about yourself, try to answer in a truthful and straightforward way. However, don't take over and talk about yourself for 30 minutes. Work on getting her to talk more about herself again. She'll think that you're a great conversationalist. [10] X Research source For instance, she may ask you what your passions are. You could say, \"I love music. I'm really into jazz, and I'm trying to learn the guitar. It's been tough, but I'm enjoying it. What kind of music are you passionate about?\""

If she says she can't, say thanks anyway and ask if she'd like to exchange phone numbers. That way, you can contact her again later. [11] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Watch her body language and get a sense of how she feels through the conversation. If she turns towards you, has her arms and legs uncrossed, and touches you on the arm occasionally, those are good signs. Also, if she seems really engaged in the conversation and enthusiastically answers your questions and asks some in return, it's likely going well. For example, you might say, \"Hey, I'm really enjoying talking to you. Would you like to grab a cup of coffee with me around the corner? If now's not a good time, how about another day? I can give you my phone number.\" If she gives you her number and you ask her on a date later, make sure to have specific suggestions for when to meet and what to do.
