      "content": "“IJBOL” was first used in 2009, but started gaining popularity in 2021. “IJBOL” first popped up online in 2009, where it was added as a definition on Urban Dictionary and used a bit on Twitter. However, this slang term didn’t catch on until 2021. Gen Z-ers started to use it in the 2020s, where it spread on X/Twitter and TikTok as a replacement for “LOL” and “LMAO.” [2] X Research source “IJBOL” was mainly popularized by Stan Twitter and K-pop fans. Many fans categorize their favorite members’ personalities using popular slang like: “IJBOL,” which refers to someone who laughs a lot. “ IDGAF ” (“I don’t give a f*ck), which refers to someone calm, cool, and collected. “DPMO” (Don’t piss me off), which refers to someone who is more serious. Ironically, “IJBOL” was also popularized by social media users who were confused about what this term meant—some even originally thought “IJBOL” was a Korean word (for the record, it’s not)."
