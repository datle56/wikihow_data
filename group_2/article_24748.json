      "title": "Wrap the celery tightly in aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Wrap the celery tightly in aluminum foil. Celery often goes bad fast because it releases ethylene, a ripening hormone. When wrapped in foil, foil allow the ethylene to escape. If celery is stored in a loose plastic bag, ethylene is trapped, which will cause the celery to get limp. Aluminum foil prevents celery from becoming overripe and losing crispness. [1] X Research source Ethylene is a hormone plants give off naturally. It's an aging and ripening hormone, which causes plants to ripen and then decompose. While ethylene is necessary to get plants ripe, it can cause decay and overripe plants after a certain point. Storing celery in a plastic bag traps ethylene, causing celery to go bad quicker."

After this, it will begin to go bad and should be thrown out. It can help to write the date you originally stored the celery down on the aluminum foil. Celery should not be eaten after it spoils. Celery that has gone bad will have a whitish color. It will also hollow out in the middle. The stalks will begin to bend away from the stem. [3] X Research source"

Ethylene is a ripening hormone that can cause celery to go bad faster. Wrap the bag around the celery tightly, as this will allow the ethylene to be released.

Once the leaves and stalks are removed, cut each piece of celery in half."
