Add 1 lb (450 g) of ground beef, 1 tbsp (15 g) of fresh minced parsley, 1 tsp (4.9 ml) each of liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp (5 g) of salt, and 0.5 tsp (2.5 g) of pepper. Stir the ingredients lightly with a fork just until they are evenly distributed. [2] X Research source You can instead use your fingertips to mix the ingredients if you wish. Just be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after you're done handling the raw meat. Seasoning early on helps infuse your burgers with flavor. If you only salt at the end, the seasoning will sit on the surface."

After 3.5 minutes of cooking, lift the lid and see if the tops of the burgers are cooked to your liking. If not, close the lid for another 30 seconds and repeat. [6] X Research source Don’t press down on the lid when you close it. Doing so will just further flatten the burgers. There’s no need to flip the burgers.
