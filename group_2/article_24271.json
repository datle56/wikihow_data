      "content": "Measure the distance between the studs on the left and right side of your vent. Use a tape measure to get an accurate measurement. When you’re finished, write the number down somewhere — you’ll need it to find the right size piece of plywood for your attic fan to be installed on. [1] X Research source Attic fans are usually installed under the gable roof. Basically, it should be away from anything that is protruding in the airspace or your crawlspace."

      "content": "Find a piece of plywood that’s at least as wide as the distance between the studs. You’re going to be mounting the plywood on the 2 studs, so it needs to be able to reach both of them. Look for plywood that's around 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. [2] X Research source For example, if the studs are 2 feet (0.61 m) apart, you’d need a piece of plywood that’s at least 2 feet (0.61 m) wide."

      "title": "Trace the circular body of your attic fan onto the center of the plywood.",
      "content": "Trace the circular body of your attic fan onto the center of the plywood. Don’t include the fan’s mounting bracket in the circle you draw. Make sure the circle isn’t bigger than the actual fan or the fan won’t mount properly in the plywood. [3] X Research source Check the box your attic fan came in to see if the manufacturer included a pre-cut circle that’s the same size as the fan’s body. If they did, you can trace that instead."

      "title": "Use a reciprocating saw to cut out the circle you traced.",
      "content": "Use a reciprocating saw to cut out the circle you traced. A reciprocating saw is a handheld power saw with a blade that rapidly moves in and out of objects as it cuts them. To cut out the circle, drill a pilot hole in the center of the circle so you have a starting point for the saw. Then, carefully follow along the circle with the saw until it’s completely cut out from the plywood. Dispose of the plywood circle once it’s cut out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mount the attic fan onto the plywood so it’s centered over the hole.",
      "content": "Mount the attic fan onto the plywood so it’s centered over the hole. Lay the plywood on a flat surface and line the fan up over the hole you cut out. Drill the screws that came with the fan through the screw holes on the fan’s mounting bracket and into the plywood. When you’re finished, the fan should be securely mounted on the piece of plywood.

      "title": "Nail the plywood into the studs on each side of the gable vent.",
      "content": "Nail the plywood into the studs on each side of the gable vent. When you position the plywood and fan over the vent, the back of the fan should be facing you and the front of the fan should be facing toward the vent. Center the fan over the vent before you nail the plywood to the studs. Once the fan is centered, nail the plywood into the studs to secure the fan over the vent. It might be helpful to have someone holding the fan while you hammer in the plywood."

The pilot hole should be in the center of where the hole will be. Make sure the hole you’re going to cut out will be centered between 2 rafters so the fan fits. [9] X Research source"

Use a tape measure to determine the diameter of your fan, or check the manufacturer's specifications. Then, get on the roof and draw the circle around the pilot hole with a piece of chalk. [10] X Research source Wear a hard hat and boots with good traction when you're up on the roof. Ask someone to be there with you when you get on the roof in case you need help for any reason. Don't get on your roof if it's wet or you could slip."

You need to loosen the shingles so you can slide the attic fan’s flange (the flat rim that extends off the body of the fan) between the shingles and the roof underneath them. If you encounter any nails or staples while you’re loosening the shingles, remove them with the pry bar. [12] X Research source Just loosen the 2 corners closest to the hole on each shingle.

As you’re sliding it up, the flange should slip underneath the shingles you loosened. Only the bottom 2 corners of the flange should be exposed. When you’re finished, the center of the fan should be centered directly over the hole you cut. [13] X Research source The open vent on the fan should be facing down into your attic, and the closed off top of the fan should be facing up."

Lift up the shingles you loosened and apply a generous amount of roofing adhesive between the shingles and the fan’s flange. Firmly press the shingles into the adhesive to reattach them to the roof. You can also apply a dab of roofing adhesive over the screws on the flange to protect them from water damage. You can find a roofing adhesive online or at your local home improvement center."
