If you want to color your sand, consider stirring in a few drops of liquid food coloring or liquid water color. To make glow-in-the-dark moon sand, consider stirring in a few drops of glow-in-the-dark paint into the water. To give your moon sand a scent, consider adding in a few drops of baking extract, such as lemon or vanilla. You can also add spices to your sand later on instead."

Colored sand will be more expensive, but plain sand will give you a clean slate to work with. If you hand plain sand and want a range of colors, you'll need to separate out the sand evenly into smaller containers and then add the different colors separately. Here are a few ways you can spruce up plain sand: [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Mix in a few teaspoons of glitter to the sand make it sparkly. Mix in a few tablespoons of powdered tempera paint, powdered watercolor, or powdered chalk to the sand to give it color. If you already colored the water, you don't need to do this. Keep in mind that powdered tempera paint will give you a brighter color. To give your moon sand a nice scent and color, consider adding in a few teaspoons of powdered drink mix, such as Kool-Aid).

If you have not already colored your sand, consider using pre-colored sand instead. You can find it in the children's crafts section or the floral section of an arts and crafts store."
