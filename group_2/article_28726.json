      "content": "Pull your hair back in the same way you’ll be wearing it under the wig. Some people like to create 1 to 2 French braids , while other people prefer cornrows . How you braid your hair now is very important, because it will affect the size and shape of the wig cap. [1] X Research source You need to take a mold of your head in order to modify the wig head. If you don’t do this, the cap for your wig will not fit you. [2] X Research source If you already own a canvas head for wig making that has the same measurements as your head, you can skip this part and click here to continue."

      "title": "Cover your hair with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Cover your hair with plastic wrap. Be sure to extend the plastic wrap past your hairline. This includes your ears, forehead, and nape. Extending the plastic wrap past your hairline will reduce the chances of the tape sticking to your hair in the later steps. [3] X Research source Use clear plastic wrap, if you can. It will make the later steps easier. If you have a nylon wig cap to wear under your wig, it would be a good idea to put it on first. If the plastic wrap is slipping around too much, secure it to your forehead with a piece of scotch tape."

      "title": "Cover the plastic wrap with 2 layers of clear packaging tape.",
      "content": "Cover the plastic wrap with 2 layers of clear packaging tape. Wrap the tape around your hairline first, taking care to avoid the skin. Cover the rest of the plastic wrap in overlapping rows of tape. Do this step twice. There should be no soft spots left. If you feel a soft spot, that means you missed the plastic wrap. Cover it with a piece of tape! [4] X Research source The taped plastic will have some give to it, which is fine. It should not be soft, like fabric. You need to use clear packaging tape, otherwise you won’t be able to see your hairline in the next step."

      "title": "Trace your hairline and ears with a permanent marker.",
      "content": "Trace your hairline and ears with a permanent marker. It would be a good idea to get someone to help you with this, especially when you reach the back. If you were to look at yourself in the mirror, you should be able to see your hairline through the taped plastic wrap. Trace all around your hairline, from forehead to nape. Be sure to include your ears as well. [5] X Research source Don’t worry about getting the marker on your skin or hair. This is why you extended the plastic wrap past your hairline! If you don't have a helper, turn your back to a mirror, and hold a smaller mirror up in front of you so that you can see the back of your head."

      "content": "Remove the tape-covered plastic wrap. You should be able to simply slide it off of your head. If you can’t, dip your finger in water, then run it along the inside edge of the cap to separate it from your skin. [6] X Research source If you still can’t get the plastic off, carefully cut a slit into it (preferably the back), then slide it off. If you put a nylon wig cap earlier, it may come off with the plastic wrap mold. Simply peel it away."

Make sure that you cut out the ears as well. When you are done, you should have a cap that fits perfectly on your head, and follows your hairline and ears. [7] X Research source"

Next, cut off smaller pieces of tape, and use them to cover the inside of the mold, overlapping them as you go. If you want a nicer finish, you can wrap tape around the cut edges of the cap.

It can be the tall kind that you put on your floor, or the shorter kind that you mount onto the table. If you don’t have a wig stand, insert a dowel into a Christmas tree stand, and use that instead. You can also insert it into a bucket filled with rocks. If you need a tabletop DIY wig stand, you can use a paper towel holder instead. You may have to break off the outer stick that touches the outside of the paper towel, however."

How much you pad it depends on how big your head is compared to the wig head. Most Styrofoam wig heads are small, so you may need to pad your mold a lot. [9] X Research source If you choose to use paper towels or even pieces of paper, be sure to crush them and not fold them. This will make it easier to insert the pins later on. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure the head mold to the wig head with pins. Place the pins right along the edges of the mold, below the drawn hairline. It would be best if you use the simple, all-metal pins that look like nails. If you use the kind with round, plastic or glass beads on the ends, you will have a hard time fitting the netting for the wig cap. Once you do this, you are now ready to make a wig cap. You can also secure the head mold to the wig head with tape. Masking tape will work the best for this. If you cover up your drawn hairline, be sure to re-trace it. [11] X Research source"

You can buy weaving nets online and from shops that sell wig making supplies. [12] X Research source If you are buying netting from a fabric store, you need enough to drape over your head and cover the hairline, plus a few inches/centimeters extra. You can also use French lace, or other types of lace used for wig making. If you will be ventilating your wig, you should get ventilating lace."

Drape the netting over the wig head, with the front edge 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below the drawn hairline. Pull the netting taut across the forehead, and secure it with sewing pins. You will need a pin at the front-center of the netting as well as a pin at each temple.

Make sure that the lace is going past the hairline. If it isn’t, it is either off-center or too narrow. [15] X Research source If the lace is too narrow, you will need to cut a larger piece and start again. If the lace is off-center, you need to re-position it and re-pin it."

You can also sew a stretch or ventilating panel to the top, then cut the netting out from under it. [19] X Research source If you are making a lace front wig , do not trim off the excess lace along the front hairline. You will need this to glue the wig down."
