      "title": "Place 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of dried mullein in a pot.",
      "content": "Place 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of dried mullein in a pot. Use 1 teaspoon (5 g) for weaker tea that has a milder taste. If you'd like stronger mullein tea , put 2 teaspoons (10 g) in a small pot or a heat-safe container that's easy to pour from. Use the leaves, the yellow flowers, or a combination if you're harvesting your own mullein. Brewing with just the flowers makes sweeter tea. It is possible to use fresh mullein leaves, but you'll need to steep the tea for 20 to 30 minutes and it won't be as strong. If you'd like to make a larger batch, feel free to double or triple the amount of mullein leaves. Just remember to add more water, too!"
