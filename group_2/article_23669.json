      "content": "Use the right bowl or pan. Before whisking, you want to make sure that the container is much larger than your starting product. This way, there will be enough room for the mixture to move around. [2] X Research source You should also be sure to use a container that can withstand the fork. If you are using a non-stick pan, it could be damaged by your fork-whisk."

      "content": "Get two forks. Use two forks that are approximately the same size. They should also have the same length handle."

      "title": "Tape the forks together.",
      "content": "Tape the forks together. Place them on top of one another with a folded paper towel in between the handles. This paper towel will simple add some space between your forks, which helps add air to the mixture like a standard whisk would. Use tape to connect them halfway down the handles."

      "content": "Use the forks like a whisk. Now that you’ve created your makeshift whisk, make sure that you use it correctly. Hold the bowl at an angle with your whisk in the mixture. Make very small circles very quickly, mostly using your wrist. Dip the whisk in and out of your mixture to help incorporate air. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the right container.",
      "content": "Use the right container. This makeshift whisk will make a big mess if you don’t have a large enough bowl. Make sure your mixture is in a bowl much larger than its volume. Chopsticks are less unlikely to damage your container, but be aware of your whisking so that you don’t scrape the bottom and ruin your container. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a pair of chopsticks.",
      "content": "Find a pair of chopsticks. Chopsticks are a great choice because they often come connected, saving you the step of taping them together. You’ll want to use the ends that have some separation in between them to get the most out of your whisk. The disadvantage of using chopsticks is that they don’t add as much air to your mixture as a traditional whisk or a makeshift fork whisk would."

    {
      "title": "Whisk your mixture.",
      "content": "Whisk your mixture. Take your chopsticks as-is and place the separated end in the mixture. Use your wrist to make fast, circular motions and thoroughly combine your mixture. Continue to whisk until the lumps have been eliminated. [5] X Research source"
