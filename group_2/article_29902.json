      "content": "Determine how much material you need. The following are general guidelines for fabrics in solid colors; patterns may need more in order to match the different pieces up. Note that fabric is sold by the yard, which is the measurement lengthwise. Bolts of fabric at the craft store have predetermined width, which you'll need to verify before purchasing. Typical widths range from 32 to 60 inches (81 to 152 cm), with 45 and 60 inches (114 and 152 cm) being the most common. The following measurements are based on fabric that is 54 inches (137 cm) wide. For a two-cushion sofa, use 16 yards (16 m) For a three-cushion sofa, use 18 yards (18 m) For a six-cushion sofa, use 22 yards (22 m) For a two-cushion love seat, use 13 yards (13 m) For a four-cushion love seat, use 17 yards (17 m) [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy the slipcover material. You can purchase it at a fabric store or online. Consider a fabric in a solid color. Matching patterns or stripes across large panels can be tricky, so unless you're ready to put in this extra effort, look for a cover material that's a single tone. Opt for a fabric with a lot of drape â€“ this will be much easier to work with. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash and dry the slipcover material.",
      "content": "Wash and dry the slipcover material. This softens the material and also accounts for any shrinkage that may occur. Don't skip this important step: the beauty of a slipcover is that it can be easily removed and washed, but you need to make sure it won't shrink after you've made it. [3] X Research source Be sure to follow care instructions for the particular fabric you're working with."

      "title": "Drape the sofa with cheap muslin or butcher paper and tuck in loosely.",
      "content": "Drape the sofa with cheap muslin or butcher paper and tuck in loosely. This mock cover should conform to the sofa's general shape. Since you're creating the pattern at this point, you can decide whether you want a close-fitting slipcover, or one that drapes more loosely. Note that it's okay if you need to use two or three large, separate pieces. In that case, you may need to secure sections to the sofa with safety pins. [4] X Research source The arm fronts don't need to be covered at this stage; see Step 3 for more details. If you're feeling confident, you can skip the mock-up and drape the sofa with the material you're going to use, wrong-side up (that is, the color or pattern should be facing down). In this case, you can trace the pattern onto the fabric itself with chalk."

You should have a few different sections: the outside back of the sofa the seating area (including the backrest and front section that drops to the floor) the sides of the slipcover, which start on the outside and come up and over the inside of the armrests"

Note that you need only make one pattern, which you can use to create both pieces. [5] X Research source Cut out one rectangular piece of paper or muslin, roughly the size of the arm front. Use pins to hold it to one of the arm fronts. Trace with chalk along the outline of the arm front. You'll use this piece for both armrests"

Mark the dimensions on the fabric with the chalk and cut out each section, allowing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam allowance for hemming. Seam allowance is a bit of extra fabric you leave so that you can sew the pieces of fabric together. If your arm fronts are asymmetrical, be sure to flip the pattern over before tracing the second one."

Use a sewing machine to stitch the sections together, using the chalk line as the \"road\" for the stitching. Remember to place the fabric into the sewing machine wrong-side up, so that your seams end up smooth on the right side. Remove the pins once you've sewn the pieces together."
