      "content": "Research the different types of nun uniforms. The traditional nun's outfit is black, but some orders use different colors. For example, some orders use dark blue, gray, or light blue. Other orders don't use dresses at all, but skirts and blouses instead. [1] X Research source This article will focus on the traditional black nun dress, but if you are basing your nun after a different order, you should use those colors instead."

      "content": "Find an ankle-length, loose-fitting black dress with long sleeves. A black graduation gown would work especially well, but you can use an actual dress too. Choose one with a simple cut and minimal seams. [2] X Research source Ask your friends or neighbors for clothing that you can borrow. You can also find similar dresses in thrift stores."

    {
      "title": "Consider a skirt and blouse ensemble.",
      "content": "Consider a skirt and blouse ensemble. Some nuns pair long skirts and long-sleeved shirts together. Depending on the order, the shirt will either be white or the same color as the skirt. Like the dress, the skirt should be long, and not too tight. Unless your order wears a different color, the skirt should be black. A turtleneck or a button-up blouse will work, depending on the order. You want something that is between a pencil skirt and an A-line skirt in terms of fullness. Avoid full-circle skirts."

      "content": "Sew your own dress if you want a DIY costume. Fortunately, nuns wear very simple clothes, so this should be an easy project even for a beginner. Go to a fabric store and find a pattern for a simple long-sleeved dress; Biblical costume patterns may also work."

    {
      "title": "Choose plain, clean fabrics.",
      "content": "Choose plain, clean fabrics. Cotton, linen, or polyester will work the best. Do not use shiny fabric like satin or silk, or fancy fabric like brocade or velvet. The color needs to be solid, without any patterns. Make sure that the fabric is clean; nuns may be simple in their attire, but they are also neat and clean. This goes for both store-bought, assembled, and homemade costumes."

Fold it in half lengthwise and sew it along the long edge. Turn it inside-out, then sew the narrow ends together to make a headband. Alternatively, cut a 2 to 3-inch (5.1 to 6-cm) strip out of white poster paper, then staple it into a headband that's big enough to fit over your head. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Slip the headband over your head. Slide the headband over your head so that it hangs around your neck. Pull your hair over the headband so that it is against the back of your neck. Pull the headband back over your head. The sides should be covering the tips of your ears, and the front should be at your hairline. Some orders expose the hairline by 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) while other orders cover the hairline."

      "content": "Find plain black fabric for the habit. A black pillowcase would work especially well here. It would be even better if you could cut open the bottom, but it's okay if you can't. [4] X Research source If your nun dress is a different color, then you should match the habit to the that color instead. Alternatively, you can use a plain T-shirt, a slip, or even a pencil skirt. [5] X Research source If you made your own dress, cut a piece of fabric wide enough to wrap around your head and long enough to reach down to your shoulder blades."

Keep the front edge about 1 inch (2.5 cm) behind the front edge of the white headband. Make sure that your hair is inside the habit. If you are using a pillowcase, gather the rest of the fabric at your nape and secure it with a safety pin. If you are using a T-shirt, be sure to tuck the sleeves into the shirt so that they don't stick out. If you are using plain fabric, drape the fabric over the top of your head, then pull the 2 front corners under your hair, right at the nape. Secure them with a safety pin."
