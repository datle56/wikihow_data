      "title": "Choose your hemp twine.",
      "content": "Choose your hemp twine. Hemp typically comes in a natural tan color, but there are many other colors to choose from. Hemp twine is most often 1mm, although you can find thicker cord. When you choose your cord, make sure that it is even and smooth—unless you prefer a coarser twine. [2] X Research source You can order hemp online or find it at an arts and crafts or hobby store."

      "content": "Decide what type of necklace you want. This method shows how to involve beads and a pendant into your necklace. You can choose to add more beads, or you can decide to only use twine for your necklace. If you decide to only use twine, continue knotting as usual and don't worry about stringing on the beads."

      "title": "Cut the hemp.",
      "content": "Cut the hemp. Using scissors, cut one 5-yard (4.5-meter) length of hemp. Then, cut another length, twice as long as the piece of jewelry, plus a few extra inches. This necklace will be about 1.5 feet (~0.5 meter) long, so a single yard (almost a meter) would be appropriate. [3] X Research source If you would like a shorter or longer necklace, you can measure the twine around your neck. Add several feet to the amount that you measure to allow space for knotting."

      "title": "Wax the cut cord.",
      "content": "Wax the cut cord. Rub your hemp thread with beeswax before starting. It helps keep the knots tight and also helps to protect the piece from getting soiled. You can usually find bars of beeswax at hobby stores. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold your cords in half. Fold these lengths in half with the shorter length on the inside and the 5-yard (4.5 meter) length on the outside. The longer 5-yard (4.5 meter) string will make up the “knotter” cords, which will be used to make the knots, while the shorter string will be the carrier cords that are used to anchor the knots. Make sure the ends of each string line up evenly. [5] X Research source"

Or, you can crimp the clasp around the cord if your clasps use a coil. Finish by adding jump to the clasp. [16] X Research source"
