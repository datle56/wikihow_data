You can also turn it off briefly before signalling your turn. For the safety of drivers and bicyclists around you, you should never begin your turn without signalling."

      "content": "Come to a complete stop. If there is a crosswalk, stop at the crosswalk. Otherwise, stop at the limit line. You must stop completely before making your turn. Do not coast through the turn, even if all appears to be clear. [2] X Research source"

If there is a bike lane or shoulder, you must signal and enter it just as you would a regular lane. [3] X Research source Oftentimes cyclists pull out further into the intersection, and may not be required to obey red lights. Keep this in mind as you check for them."
