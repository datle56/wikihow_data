      "title": "Exfoliate weekly.",
      "content": "Exfoliate weekly. Exfoliation makes your skin softer by removing dirt, oil, and dead skin cells. You can scrub your face with coffee grounds mixed with some mild soap, [1] X Research source or a store-bought exfoliation product. For relief of redness as well, look for something that contains green tea extracts and glycolic acid. Avoid exfoliating more than once or twice a week, as exfoliating too often can cause skin irritation."

      "title": "Wash properly.",
      "content": "Wash properly. Moisture loss and removing your skin’s natural oils can lead to dry and flaky skin, and bathing too often, bathing for too long, and using hot water can all increase moisture and oil loss. Bathe every other day if you can, use cooler water, use your hand or a soft cloth instead of a scrubber to apply soap, and limit your shower time to five or 10 minutes. [2] X Research source After your shower or bath, don’t rub your skin dry, as this can remove moisture and oil. Instead, gently pat or rub yourself with a fluffy towel. [3] X Research source When your skin is still somewhat damp, apply your favorite moisturizer."

    {
      "title": "Shave properly.",
      "content": "Shave properly. If you choose to shave, save shaving for last when you’re bathing, because this will give your skin time to soften up. Use a moisturizing shaving cream and sharp razors with multiple blades. It’s also important to shave downward, or with the direction of your hair growth to prevent irritation. [4] X Research source Don’t shave first thing in the morning when you’re retaining water, as you won’t get as close a shave. Treat razor burn with a warm compress, and always moisturize after shaving. To avoid the added cost of shaving cream, you can use hair conditioner as a substitute, but avoid soap as it won’t lubricate your skin enough."

      "title": "Moisturize daily.",
      "content": "Moisturize daily. Your skin doesn’t seem to mind what kind of moisturizer you prefer, as long as you use it often and regularly. [5] X Research source Always moisturize after bathing or shaving, before applying makeup, after removing makeup, and after doing dishes or getting your skin wet. Look for a moisturizer that has plant-based oils and hydrating ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin E, cocoa butter, shea butter, lavender, and chamomile. For particularly dry skin, try a deep overnight skin conditioning. Before bed, apply a heavy-duty moisturizing cream to dry areas like your hands, feet, and elbows. Then, put on cotton socks and gloves, and wrap your elbows with a soft cloth."

[7] X Research source Before bed, use a gentle cleanser, lukewarm water, and soft cloth to remove your makeup. Pat your face dry and apply moisturizer. Use makeup sparingly if you do choose to wear it, as it can dehydrate and dry your skin. Look for brands that don’t contain dangerous ingredients, and that are hypoallergenic. [8] X Research source"

Protect your skin from the sun with sunscreen, sun-protective apparel, and SPF makeups and moisturizers. Protect your skin from the cold and wind with gloves, hats, scarves, and other winter gear."
