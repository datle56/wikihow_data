      "content": "Put the party favors in the piñata first. Use scissors to cut a hole through the piñata's opening, which is usually on the back and covered by a sticker. Then, insert candy, toys, or other small prizes into the piñata by pushing the items through the hole. [1] X Research source Some examples of treats and toys you can use are gummies, hard candies, plastic rings, and tiny candy bars."

      "content": "Push a 10 ft (3.0 m) piece of rope through the loop on the piñata's top. Find the loop attached to the top of the piñata and thread the end of a piece of rope through the loop. Then, tie the rope in a double knot to secure it to the piñata. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a low-hanging location with plenty of open space around it.",
      "content": "Choose a low-hanging location with plenty of open space around it. Low-hanging tree branches are good options, or you can hang the piñata from a basketball hoop or patio beam. Make sure you choose something sturdy! For example, if you're hanging the piñata from a tree, choose one of the main branches and make sure there are no rotten spots. Make sure the location has plenty of open space around it so the kids have ample room to swing the bat or stick at the piñata. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Throw the loose end of the rope over the branch, hoop, or porch beam.",
      "content": "Throw the loose end of the rope over the branch, hoop, or porch beam. The piñata should be on one side of the branch and the loose end of the rope should be on the other. Pull the end of the rope to lift the piñata off the ground so that it's out of the children's reach. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure the loose end of the rope until it's time to play the game.",
      "content": "Secure the loose end of the rope until it's time to play the game. Tie the dangling loose end of the rope to something sturdy, such as a nearby pole or tree. Be sure to tie the knot loosely, since you'll soon need to untie it! Additionally, make sure the rope isn't in the way of your party goers. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Untie the loose end of the rope and lower the piñata to start the game. Take control of the other end of the rope and lower it so the blindfolded players can reach it with their bats. You can also lower and raise the piñata with the rope to change things up and challenge the partygoers! [6] X Research source Make sure the blindfolded child doesn't hit other children with the stick by accident!"

      "content": "Assemble the tripod's legs by connecting their pieces together. Assembly will vary, but it will probably involve snapping the leg pieces together before adding small screws to secure the legs in place. There will be tiny holes for the screws. [7] X Research source You can usually rent a piñata tripod from most party supply stores. Make sure you choose a large area with plenty of open space for the piñata, such as an open area of the lawn. Party goers should be able to swing at the piñata in any direction and not be remotely close to hitting anything other than the piñata."

      "title": "Stand the tripod upright on the ground.",
      "content": "Stand the tripod upright on the ground. Extend the legs evenly on flat ground to ensure it doesn't wobble or fall over when party guests are using it. Most tripods come with supporting feet at the bottom of the legs, so you don't need to insert the legs into the ground to hold them in place. [8] X Research source If the legs are uneven in height, readjust them by realigning their small holes with different screws."

      "title": "Allow the rope to dangle from the apex of the tripod.",
      "content": "Allow the rope to dangle from the apex of the tripod. A rope should already be attached to the tripod where the top of the legs come together at a point. The rope should have a hook on one end and a bar on the other end that allows you to pull the piñata up to the desired height. [9] X Research source Make sure the rope is dangling in the center of the tripod. Avoid pulling the piñata so high that it's out of reach for your partygoers.They should be able to easily hit the piñata with a stick or bat while standing on the ground."

Grab the other end of the rope by the handle bar and pull it until the piñata is at the desired height. [10] X Research source You can hold the rope during the game so that you can adjust the height and create a challenge for the players if you want to, but you don't have to. You can also tie the rope to something sturdy when the piñata is at the desired height."
