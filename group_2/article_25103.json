      "content": "Remove the mushrooms from the ground as soon as you see the caps appear. If you leave them for too long, they will release spores, which will lead to more mushrooms. When you see mushrooms appear, simply pull them out of the ground. You can also try mowing or raking over the mushrooms, but this will heighten the chances of them spreading spores across your lawn."

      "content": "Dispose of the mushrooms properly. Do not toss them into your compost pile. Instead, keep a plastic bag with you, and put them into the bag as soon as you pull them out of the ground. Once the bag is full, tie the bag up tightly, and toss it into a trashcan or incinerator. This will help prevent the mushrooms from spreading spores across your lawn. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a nitrogen fertilizer to deter mushrooms from growing in organic matter. The fertilizer will quicken the decomposition of the matter, which will leave the mushrooms nothing to feed off of. Plan on using 1 pound (453.59 grams) of nitrogen for every 1,000 square feet of lawn. Do not use slow release or water-soluble nitrogen fertilizer. You will need to do this annually. Consider adding some phosphorous and potassium as well. You will need 3 parts nitrogen, 1 part phosphorous, and 2 parts potassium.

      "content": "Take care with potted plants. Potted plants are often subject to mushrooms and other types of fungi. They are often subject to over-watering, and stay indoors, where the air is warm and still. This is a perfect environment for mushrooms. Here are some simple ways to keep your potted plants mushroom-free: [3] X Research source Pluck mushrooms as soon as you see them appear, and toss them in the trash immediately. Provide ample air circulation by keeping the plant near a window or fan. Avoid over-watering. Let the soil become dry at the top before watering. Use a watering bulb to keep the soil deep inside the pot moist, and the upper layer dry. Want tips on how to get rid of mushrooms in your yard?

      "content": "Make sure that your lawn has proper drainage. Mushrooms love damp and humid places. If your lawn holds too much water, you will need to make sure that it drains properly. Here are some ideas on how you can introduce proper drainage to your lawn: [4] X Research source If water is flowing down a slope, build up soil to redirect excess water to a more desirable location. Add a pond or water garden to catch excess water. They are easy to maintain and can act as a decorative feature to your garden. Place rain barrels beneath waterspouts to collect excess water during storms. This will prevent the water from soaking into your lawn. Consider adding an underground drain, such as a French drain (an underground ditch filled with gravel) to help disperse water and prevent it from becoming stagnant."

      "content": "Make sure that your lawn has well-drained soil. If your garden has a clay base, the water will have nowhere to go once it soaks through your lawn. It will sit and become stagnant. If you can, try mixing some sand or other well-draining material into your lawn to help disperse the water better. When watering your lawn, try to water it in the morning instead of at night. The sun will help the excess water evaporate instead of sit and become a breeding ground for mushrooms."

You can rent it from some hardware or home improvement stores. Once you are done power raking your lawn, you will need to use a regular rake to sweep up the debris. If you have cool-season grasses, de-thatch the lawn between late summer and early fall. If you have warm-season grasses, de-thatch in late spring."

      "content": "Make sure that there is enough air circulation by aerating your lawn. Not enough air circulation will lead to moisture being trappedâ€”and where there is excess moisture, there will be mushrooms. Get an aerator from a home improvement or hardware store, and go over your lawn with it. The aerator will pull out plugs of earth out of your lawn. This will help loosen the soil and let more air in.

Also keep your lawn clear of pet waste and any other decomposing matter the mushrooms could feed off. Keep grass clippings off your lawn by raking them up after mowing, or by attaching a grass catcher to your mower. Clean up pet waste. Have tree stumps ground and removed."

Go about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) deep. Once you have dug out the mushrooms, you will need to expand the ring you just dug by 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) to either side. 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) would be better. Some experts advise digging all the way to the center of the ring. As you dig, try to determine the cause of the fairy ring. Look for rotting wood, construction debris, or anything that could keep water from draining. Remove any of these causes as you go."
