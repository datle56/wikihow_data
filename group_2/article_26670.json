      "content": "Determine the era and age of the doll. Once you’ve identified your antique doll as a Madame Alexander, try to determine when it was produced. One way to figure out the doll’s era is to identify the material it’s made of. Generally, the Alexander Doll Company produced cloth dolls from 1923 to 1934, composition dolls from 1934 to 1946, hard plastic dolls from 1947 to the early 1960s, and vinyl plastic dolls after the early 1960s. [1] X Research source Once you’ve narrowed down the era, check the doll and its clothing for tags that may have the doll’s name or sometimes the year it was released. Refer to Madame Alexander collector’s guides or Doll Reference to help you identify your doll. Other resources to check are the National Antique Dolls Dealers Association (NADDA) , the United Federation of Doll Clubs, inc. , and Antique Doll Collector Magazine’s digital back issues."

      "title": "Research how rare your doll is.",
      "content": "Research how rare your doll is. Some Madame Alexander dolls were created as a part of a limited edition collection or were based on famous characters or historical figures, which tend to be worth more [2] X Research source For example, the Gone with the Wind and Little Women series are often highly collectible and demand higher prices. However, it’s important to remember that “rare” is a relative term in doll collecting. [3] X Research source One of the ways to determine whether your doll is rare is to look around to see if it’s available. If you see a lot of them on auction sites, they may not be as in demand. A doll may be rare because only a few were produced, or most were damaged or destroyed through daily use. It may also be rare because it has a unique feature that causes more demand, even though it was produced in normal quantities. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for the doll’s original outfit and accessories. After you’ve identified when your doll was made, look for the original outfit and accessories that came with it. Your doll is more valuable if you have these items and they are in good condition. Madame Alexander dolls were also sold with wrist tags and packaging. If you still have them, they also add value to the doll. Madame Alexander dolls were meant to be played with, so it’s possible your doll has been redressed in a different outfit. A redressed doll may still be valuable if the outfit is an original Madame Alexander. However, it may not have the value of a doll in the same condition with the correct outfit."

      "title": "Assess your doll’s overall condition.",
      "content": "Assess your doll’s overall condition. A doll in great condition is usually worth more than one that has been repaired or restored. Collectors are often interested in dolls that are as close to the original condition (or mint) as possible. [5] X Research source However, many vintage and antique doll enthusiasts may base their collection on sentimental value, so they’re still interested in less-than-perfect dolls. [6] X Research source First off, make sure the doll has all of its limbs. Sometimes, the strings inside the doll break or the limbs fall off, but they’re easy to repair and usually don’t affect the value. Check a composition doll for crazing, which is what fine cracks on the doll’s surface are called. While crazing is often inevitable, it can sometimes affect the value of the doll. The older the doll is, the more likely it is that the lips, cheeks, or eyebrows have worn off. The brighter and more complete the facial paint is, the more valuable the doll will be. See if the wig is still smooth and check for sparse places where the hair is missing."

      "title": "Look up retail prices and open market, auction, and insurance values.",
      "content": "Look up retail prices and open market, auction, and insurance values. Pricing antiques and collectibles is tricky because value can change drastically based on the current market. Once you know what doll you have, when it was produced, the condition, and how rare it is, start looking for it on auction sites like eBay or Ruby Lane to see what people are asking for your doll or ones like it. Check the upcoming auctions and sales results at Theriault’s , an auction house that specializes in dolls and other childhood toys. Search for doll shops that deal in vintage and antique dolls online or in your area and see how they’re pricing your doll. Other places to try are collector forums and insurance replacement values. However, collector forums can be unreliable, and insurance replacement values aren’t always available."

      "title": "Factors like condition and rarity affect the value of vintage and antique dolls.",
      "content": "Factors like condition and rarity affect the value of vintage and antique dolls. Identifying the doll’s name and series are often the first steps to determining its value. However, there are several other factors that can drastically change the value of a doll. Age & Era: Older dolls are usually worth more money. However, dolls from the 1940s and 1950s are popular and often demand higher prices. [7] X Research source Condition: Condition is very important when determining value. Collectors want dolls, clothing, and accessories that look new without damage, cracks, or wear. Materials: Dolls were made from different materials during different eras, and older materials are not always more valuable. Outfit & Accessories: A doll wearing its original outfit with all of the accessories is more valuable than one that has been redressed or is missing shoes or hats. Rarity: Usually, rarer dolls were issued in limited editions, which means there were fewer produced than more common dolls. Supply & Demand: A relatively common doll, like Madame Alexander’s Cissy, may demand a higher price because it’s extremely popular with collectors."

Alexander worked with her stepfather, a German-trained toy maker, in his doll hospital in Brooklyn during her childhood and into her adult years. She grew up seeing beautiful porcelain dolls that were too fragile for children to play with. After marrying, she obtained a loan for $1,600 to start the Alexander Doll Company with the goal of creating beautiful dolls that wouldn’t break so easily. [22] X Research source Madame Alexander dolls were handcrafted by artisans Alexander trained herself. Alexander was an innovator who introduced one of the first walking dolls, developed a durable hard plastic, and created a plastic mold that allowed dolls to have more expression. In 1955, she debuted “Cissy,” the world’s first fashion doll, beating Barbie by 4 years. She led her company for 65 years until she sold it in 1988."
