      "content": "Choose a pattern to guide you. Using a pattern to make your poncho will provide you with knitting needle and yarn recommendations. It will also give you specific instructions for how many stitches to cast on and how to work the stitches. However, if you prefer to design your own poncho without using a pattern, that is also an option. You can visit a craft supply store and purchase a pattern book or magazine that has a poncho pattern in it, or you can find a free poncho pattern online. Look for a beginner level pattern if you are new to knitting."

      "content": "Select yarn and needles for your poncho. You can use any color or texture of yarn for your poncho as long as it is compatible with the needles you are using. Check the label on your yarn for a needle size recommendation. If your pattern recommends a specific yarn type, such as medium worsted-weight or super bulky, then make sure to use that type of yarn for your poncho. To create the basic poncho described in this article, you will need 2 skeins of medium-worsted weight yarn and a pair of US size 9 (5.5 mm) knitting needles. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick a stitch to use for the poncho. There are many different knitting stitches that work well for making a poncho. You can knit your poncho in a basic knit stitch for a classic look, or use a special stitch to get a specific look. For example, if you want your poncho to have some texture, you could use the garter stitch , rib stitch, or moss stitch ."

      "title": "Cast on",
      "content": "Cast on the desired number of stitches. First, loop the yarn around your index and ring finger twice, and pull the first loop over the second loop. Then, tighten the tail around the base of the loop and slide it onto your right hand needle. Pull the tail to tighten the loop around the needle. For the next cast on stitch, loop your yarn around the left-hand needle and insert the right-hand needle into the loop. Yarn over, and pull through to create another cast on stitch. [2] X Research source Keep casting on until you have the desired number of cast on stitches. If you are following a pattern, use the recommendation in your knitting pattern to determine how many stitches you need to cast on. To follow the sample pattern in this article, cast on 150 stitches."

      "content": "Knit until the piece is long enough to cover the front of your body. To knit, insert your right hand needle through the first stitch on the left hand needle. Loop the yarn over the left hand needle and pull this through the stitch. Let the old stitch slide off the end of the needle as the new stitch replaces it. Continue knitting to the end of the row and knit all the rows after that. [3] X Research source If your knitting pattern features special instructions or if you are using a special stitch to knit your poncho, then follow those instructions instead."

This is optional, but if you want your poncho to taper down to a point at the bottom, you can work a decrease at the beginning and end of the last 6 to 12 in (15 to 30 cm) of the poncho piece. To do this, insert your right hand needle through the 2 stitches at the beginning of the row, yarn over, and then pull through both stitches to secure them. Repeat this on the end of the row. [4] X Research source Keep decreasing until you only have 2 stitches left and then knit through both stitches, yarn over, and pull through to finish the poncho piece."

Keep knitting until you are satisfied with the length of the piece. At the beginning of the next row, knit the first 2 stitches. Then, use the left hand needle to lift the first stitch you knit up and over the second 1. Then, knit 1 and lift the first up and over this stitch. Continue to knit 1 and lift 1 up and over the new stitch until you reach the end of the row. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that if you created a pointed edge, you will not need to bind off."

Make sure that the stitches are all going in the same direction, and the right (outer) sides of the knitting are facing each other. You will be sewing along the top seam of the poncho, which will be along the shoulders and arms. Sewing with the right sides together will ensure that the seam will be hidden after you invert the poncho."
