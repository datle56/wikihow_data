For example, individuals who cannot give informed consent, such as people with severe developmental disabilities, may not be able to marry. [1] X Research source Restrictions vary by state, so you must research your state’s requirements. In general, the following restrictions will apply: Age. In most states, the legal age to marry is 18. In some states, you may be able to get married if you are younger than 18 by providing parental consent (and, in some cases, the consent of a judge). [2] X Research source [3] X Research source In Mississippi, parental consent is necessary for applicants under the age of 21. [4] X Research source In Nebraska, the legal age to marry is 19. Persons younger than 19 must provide parental consent. [5] X Research source Family relationship. All US states prohibit marriage between ancestors and descendants, such as grandparents and grandchildren, aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews, or parents and children. 20 states currently allow first cousins to get married. 6 additional states will allow first cousins to marry under certain circumstances (e.g., above a certain age or unable to reproduce).

      "content": "Meet the age requirement of the state where you are marrying. The age at which you can legally marry will vary depending on the state in which you are applying for the marriage license. In some counties, you will need to bring your original birth certificate (or a certified copy) as evidence of your age. For example, some Virginia counties require an original birth certificate to apply for a marriage license. However, other counties in the same state will not accept a birth certificate as proof of identity, and do not otherwise require applicants to present one. Check with your county or municipal court’s office to make sure that you meet the state’s minimum age requirement and have the appropriate documentation of your age. Many states will allow applicants to marry if one or both applicants are under the minimum age with parental consent. In some cases, such as in New York , a family court judge may also need to provide consent. [8] X Research source Emancipated minors may also marry without parental consent."

In most cases, you will also be required to provide your Social Security Number if you have one. The types of proof required and accepted vary by state and by jurisdiction. Government-issued photo IDs, such as passports or driver’s licenses, are generally accepted as proof of identity. Many states require your original birth certificate (or a certified copy) and your Social Security card as proof of your identity. You and your partner must bring physical copies of these proofs with you when you apply for the marriage license. If your original documents are in a foreign language, you must usually provide a certified translation into English, along with the original copy. A certified translation should be signed, dated, and contain a statement that attests to the accuracy of the translation."

Some states require proof that your prior marriage has been terminated by death, divorce, or annulment. [9] X Research source In some states, however, you may certify that you are free to marry by signing a document or providing a notarized statement. If either you or your partner were previously married, you will likely need to provide information about those marriages on your application. For example, in the state of New York, you must be able to provide information regarding whether your former spouse is still living, and whether the marriage ended by divorce, annulment or death. [10] X Research source Bring copies of your divorce decree (sometimes known as a Final Order of Divorce) or other dissolution documents with you when you apply. In some states, such as Pennsylvania, widowed applicants must bring a copy of their deceased spouse’s death certificate. [11] X Research source"

Once your marriage is completed (also known as “solemnized” or “celebrated”), the name you provide on the license application will become your legal surname. Neither partner must change his or her surname, and surnames do not automatically change upon marriage.

      "content": "Determine if there is a waiting period. Many states have waiting periods before you can obtain your license, or before you can use that license to get married. [13] X Research source In many states, you can receive your marriage license immediately. Some states, however, have a waiting period between one and six days between when you apply for your license and when you receive it. For example, in Pennsylvania, there is a 72-hour waiting period before you receive your license. [14] X Research source In some states, there is also a waiting period between the time you receive your marriage license and when you can use it to get legally married. For example, New York has a 24-hour waiting period. [15] X Research source [16] X Research source If you do not observe these waiting periods, your marriage may not be legally valid. Waivers may be available under certain circumstances. For example, in New York, you may apply for a judicial waiver of the waiting period if your circumstances require you to get married immediately (e.g., your intended is being deployed in the military) [17] X Research source If you are in a huge hurry, you can look into getting married in a state where there is no waiting period, or get married in Las Vegas.

Your proxy must provide photo ID and a notarized copy of the Marriage Ceremony Proxy Power of Attorney form. In California, an applicant who is a member of the Armed Forces, is serving overseas in a conflict, and cannot return home to personally apply for a license, may marry by using an “attorney-in-fact.” Applicants must fill out a power of attorney form, and the attorney-in-fact must appear at the County Clerk’s office with the notarized POA. Texas makes certain exceptions for absent applicants in particular circumstances. The absent applicant must complete an affidavit and have it notarized. The third party must present the absent applicant’s photo ID and the notarized affidavit. Many counties have unique/different requirements.

For example, in Virginia, your officiant (or “celebrant”) must be authorized by a Virginia Circuit Court prior to performing your wedding ceremony. Online ordinations are not recognized by Virginia courts. These requirements may also vary by county or jurisdiction. For example, if you wish to get married in any of the five boroughs of New York City, your officiant must register with the City Clerk’s office in Manhattan. This requirement does not apply anywhere else in the state of New York. [22] X Research source Most states do allow officiants to become ordained online, through organizations such as the Universal Life Church [23] X Research source or American Marriage Ministries.

If your officiant is ordained by an online church then use the term \"Minister\" or \"Clergy\". The office will send you a marriage certificate, which is your proof that the marriage took place. Your marriage is deemed legal once the license is received and filed. Many states require the marriage license to be filed within a certain number of days (often 14-15 days). If the marriage license is not filed within that period, the marriage may not be considered legally valid unless a new license is issued and filed.
