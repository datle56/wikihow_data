      "content": "Pull your socks up over your shin pads to the middle of your thighs. Put your shin pads on first, then pull your hockey socks up over them. Stretch each sock up all the way to your mid-thigh, so they are tight and not bunched up around your shins. [1] X Research source You can use this method on its own or in addition to others to keep your hockey socks up securely during practice or a game. If you use this method with others, put the tape on last, after putting on a garter belt or jock shorts with Velcro tabs."

      "title": "Stick hockey sock tape to your socks just below the kneecaps of your pads.",
      "content": "Stick hockey sock tape to your socks just below the kneecaps of your pads. Peel up about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) from the end of a roll of hockey sock tape. Press it firmly onto your hockey sock, horizontally, right under where the kneecap starts on your shin pad underneath the sock. [2] X Research source Hockey sock tape is highly adhesive, usually clear, tape used for keeping hockey socks and shin pads from moving around during play. You can purchase it online or from a sporting goods store. Don't tear the tape yet. Wait until you are finished wrapping it."

      "content": "Wrap the tape tightly around your shins below your kneecaps 2 times. Pull the tape taut and wrap it 2 full times around your socks and shin pads to secure everything tightly in place. Don’t tear the tape yet. [3] X Research source Make sure the tape is wrapped as tightly as you can get it; otherwise, it won’t hold your socks and pads in place."

      "title": "Pull the tape diagonally down and wrap it 2 more times around your shins.",
      "content": "Pull the tape diagonally down and wrap it 2 more times around your shins. Pull the tape down and across to your lower shins, a little above your ankles, pulling it taut and sticking it to your socks as you unravel it. Wrap it 2 full times around your socks and shin pads, then tear the tape and stick the end down. [4] X Research source To make it easier to remove the tape when you’re getting undressed, you can fold about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of the end of the tape back under itself to create a little tab, so you can peel the tape up quickly when you’re done playing."

      "content": "Fasten a hockey garter belt around your waist. Wrap the belt tightly around your waist, just above the waistband of your jock shorts. Fasten the strap to secure the belt in place. [5] X Research source A hockey garter belt is a belt made specifically for holding up hockey socks. You can buy one online or at a sporting goods store."

      "content": "Pull your hockey socks up over your shin pads to your mid-thigh. Put a shin pad on each of your legs. Pull a hockey sock up over the shin pad on each leg to the middle of your thigh. It’s a good idea to wrap hockey sock tape around your shins in addition to using a hockey garter belt. Otherwise, your shin pads can still slide around inside your socks, since you’re only securing the tops of the socks with the garter belt. Put the tape on after you put on your garter belt."

Slide it over the middle of the top edge of your hockey sock on the corresponding side and release it to clip it in place. Repeat this for the other side. [6] X Research source Hockey garter belts have 2 clips on the front to keep your hockey socks up on your thighs and 2 clips on the back to keep your hockey socks up on your hamstrings. Each sock will be clipped once in the front and once in the back."

Put on your hockey socks and pull them up over your shin pads to your mid-thigh, where the Velcro tabs on your jock shorts are. You might still have to wrap hockey sock tape around the socks where they rest on your shin pads to keep your shin pads from sliding around underneath the socks. Do this after you secure the socks in the Velcro tabs on your jock shorts."

Wash your jock shorts with the Velcro tabs closed and separately from other items to keep the Velcro clean and sticky."
