      "content": "Talk with your vet. Before adding fatty acid supplements to your cat’s diet, you should talk with your veterinarian about the proper dosage.

      "title": "Provide a dosage based on your cat’s weight.",
      "content": "Provide a dosage based on your cat’s weight. Fatty acids have plenty of benefits for your cat’s health. That being said, there are a few negative side effects that can result from giving your cat too much fish oil. For example, it can reduce blood clotting abilities. If your cat begins to experience diarrhea it is a sign that you are over dosing."

      "title": "Determine the dosage based on the product guidelines.",
      "content": "Determine the dosage based on the product guidelines. Each product will have different dosing requirements, so read the packaging carefully. If you change brands, even if it's the same type of supplement, reevaluate your cat's dosage using the new brand's guidelines to make sure that you're giving your cat the correct amount. It's best to ask your vet to help you determine the proper dosage. They will be able to help you make sure that you do not accidentally harm your pet."

      "title": "Consult your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Consult your veterinarian. Fatty acid supplements are commonly used by veterinarians and their clients, and it is likely your veterinarian has a product that they know and trust.

      "content": "Ask about greenlip mussel oil. Greenlip mussel oil is harvested from mussels and is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids for cats. They contain 33 fatty acids, five of which are essential omega 3 fatty acids. Greenlip mussel oil comes in a small, easily digestible tablet and does not have as strong of a flavor as other fish oils. As a result, it is much easier to feed to cats. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Suggest cat krill oil.",
      "content": "Suggest cat krill oil. Cats don't process omega 3s from plant based sources and as a result they need to be given animal sources of fatty acids. Some cats may also be allergic to fish and unable to get their essential oils through fish oils. If this is the case, try giving your cat krill oil. This is a great source of omega 3 fatty acid and comes in both capsule and liquid form. Be sure to always give fish oils that are made specifically for pets."

      "title": "Avoid cod liver oil.",
      "content": "Avoid cod liver oil. Cod liver oil, which is considered an excellent supplement for humans, should not be given to cats. This oil, although full of healthy omega 3 fatty acids, also contains high levels of vitamin A and D, which can be toxic to cats. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Provide your cat with fish oil capsules.",
      "content": "Provide your cat with fish oil capsules. Some fatty acids can be given to your cat in the form of a capsule or pill. For example, Greenlip mussel oil comes in a small capsule that you can feed to your cat. Try hiding the pill in a treat so that your cat will easily take the pill."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give them liquid oils.",
      "content": "Give them liquid oils. You can also buy fish oils in liquid form. The best way to give liquid fish oil to your cat, is by putting a few drops on top of their food. This way they will consume the fatty acids while eating. Fish oil can have a strong smell and taste so it is best to start with a small dose and continue adding until your cat has become comfortable. You can also break open a capsule and squeeze the liquid onto their food."

    {
      "title": "Read food labels.",
      "content": "Read food labels. Some pet foods will list essential fatty acids in their ingredient list. Look for Omega 6 and Omega 3 fatty acids. That being said, due to the processing involved in making commercial pet foods, most of the nutritional value of the omega 3 fatty acids is lost during this process. As a result, it is still good to supplement omega 3 fatty acids in your cat’s diet. [4] X Research source Talk with your vet to determine the proper dosage for your cat."

      "title": "Try sardines.",
      "content": "Try sardines. Sardines are an excellent source of omega 3 fatty acid and can be given to your cat as a treat. Unlike salmon, sardines do not live long enough to store toxins in their body, making them a great source of essential fatty acids. It is not as easy to determine the appropriate dosage when providing cats with fatty acids through fish. Providing supplements is a much easier way to ensure that your cat is getting the proper dosage."

      "title": "Give your cat cold water fish.",
      "content": "Give your cat cold water fish. Fatty acids are readily available through a variety of cold water fish, such as salmon, cod, tuna, and sardines. You can try giving your cat water cold fish as a snack, to supplement their regular food. [5] X Research source"
