Most police scanner apps organize their channels into broad categories, such as “Police, “Fire,” and “EMS.” Within these categories, you'll find frequencies for each of your city's major emergency response services. If you have location services enabled for a mobile app, it should detect where you are automatically.

Another useful feature of police scanner apps is that you can often save your favorite channels to create custom feeds which you can cycle between at will."

      "content": "Listen for increased excitement surrounding urgent calls. It can be easy to tune out the routine talk when there's not much going on, but pay close attention when the exchanges between the dispatcher and responding officers get louder and faster. There will often be a noticeable shift in tone when a major incident, like a mugging or vehicle pursuit, is going down. If you're flipping through channels at random, be ready to stop when you hear activity pick up. These days, numerical codes aren't used as much, so it's not necessary to try to memorize them. Listening for subtle changes is a more reliable way to catch the big calls."
