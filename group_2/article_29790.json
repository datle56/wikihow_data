If the person is dealing with a recent event that's got them down, their sadness is likely only a temporary emotion that's perfectly valid and appropriate. Tell them you understand why they feel sad and that there's nothing wrong with feeling that way. [1] X Research source Sometimes when you're sad, it's hard to imagine that you'll be happy again. It's okay to remind the person that their sadness will eventually pass. [2] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Being aggressively cheerful or insisting that the person \"snap out of it\" or be more cheerful can alienate them. It's not up to you to decide how long is \"too long\" for someone to be sad. At the same time, if your friend or loved one is consistently sad for more than a couple of weeks, or if they're feeling hopeless and unmotivated, you might encourage them to talk to a professional."

This is easy if you happen to live with the person—just look around for something that needs to be done and do it! If you live apart from them, on the other hand, you might ask, \"What's something you've been putting off that I can do for you?\" [6] X Research source When people get sad and mopey, they often tend to let cleaning and basic errands fall by the wayside. Unfortunately, tasks can start to pile up and cause stress. By doing something for them, you take some of the pressure off."

If you're not much of a cook, order their favorite takeout for them and have it delivered to their house. [8] X Research source Comfort foods and sweets are always a good option. If the person has dietary restrictions or is sick, you might get herbal teas or soup to help them feel better. Reader Poll: We asked 1019 wikiHow readers how they prefer to comfort someone, and only 6% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by making their favorite food.

      "content": "Spending time outside, especially in nature, energizes the mind and body. Just the act of walking helps your body produce more feel-good chemicals that boost your mood. If the person you know who's sad is spending a lot of time churning negative thoughts and wallowing in their sadness, taking a walk out in nature can help. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source If the person is resistant to the idea of a walk at first, it's okay to try some gentle persuasion. Once they get going, they'll probably feel better and be grateful to you. But don't put too much pressure on them or try to force the matter—you could alienate them. Have the walk planned out to take pressure off the person. If you ask them to go for a walk and then have to figure out how long the walk is going to be and where you're going to go, they might just say \"Forget it\" and give up."

Stroking a friendly animal is a quick way to cheer someone up when they're down in the dumps (provided they're not allergic to pet dander). Studies show playing with a pet elevates levels of serotonin and dopamine, chemicals in the body that promote calm and relaxation.

Go to source If you don't have a pet, talk to other friends and see if you can connect them with an animal that way. This might not be the best idea if the person is sad because they're mourning the recent loss of their own pet. In that situation, playing with another animal might make them feel worse.

      "content": "This is a fun way to cheer someone up who lives or works with you. Get sticky notes and write encouraging or funny things on them, such as \"You deserve a smile\" or \"You've got this!\" Stick them in non-obvious places where the person will find them, then wait. For example, you might write a note that says, \"I'm proud of you\" or \"You can do it\" in their planner. They'll see it when they open their planner to start the day. You can do this with small toys or figures as well. For example, suppose you have a sad friend who loves ducks. You might buy a few small rubber duckies and hide them around your friend's home or office where they'll just happen across them as they go about their day. The mystery and whimsy are sure to bring a smile to their face. Be careful to respect the person's boundaries. Don't hide anything in a place that would require you to violate their privacy. For example, if you're trying to cheer up your roommate, you wouldn't want to hide a note in their underwear drawer."

For example, you might write, \"I know things have been tough for you lately, but you're the kindest person I know. I'm always here if you need to chat.\" You might also include a favorite inspirational quote—even better if it's a quote from a book or movie they love! If you're an artist, you might want to draw or paint something on the card as well. Even if you can't really draw, your attempt might still be good for a chuckle."
