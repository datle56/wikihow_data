      "content": "Bad communication, flirting, and flakiness will make him turn green. In general, if you show your Taurus beau disrespect (or anything less than total devotion), he'll be envious. Before you do something that might make him feel insecure, think it through carefully. And be sure to make him a priority—if you \"forget\" to text him back, he won't be satisfied with that excuse. Avoid things like: Going all day without texting/calling him back Making eyes at, complimenting, or touching another person in public Cancelling your plans, especially at the last minute Talking about your ex excessively Talking about how cute you think someone else is in front of him"

      "content": "He’ll want details on what you're up to. When he first starts getting those little pangs of jealousy, it’s natural that he’ll want to know more. He may start investigating—suddenly, he wants to know who you’re with, how long you’ve known them, and whether or not you two have a history. He may say things like: [1] X Research source “She seems cool…how long did you say you’ve known her for?” “Oh, right, Brian. Did I notice a little tension there last time you two hung out? Do you guys have a history or something?” “So your friend Axel, are they single? Or are they in a relationship?”"

      "title": "He’ll act a little possessive.",
      "content": "He’ll act a little possessive. Taurus men are big on commitment—and if you bring out the green monster in him, there’s a chance he’ll try to double down on this front. He may try to hold you close, so no other suitors could possibly steal you away. This may mean: He suddenly wants to hang out 24/7. He uses terms like “girlfriend” and “boyfriend” liberally around other people."

      "title": "He’ll give you the cold shoulder.",
      "content": "He’ll give you the cold shoulder. Taurus men are stubborn and actually very sensitive—if he really starts feeling insecure, he may begin to act a little prickly. This just means that his feelings are too much for him to handle or address, so instead, he’ll push you away so that he doesn’t have to deal. This could mean that he: [2] X Research source Looks hurt then walks away suddenly Gives you the silent treatment Ignores your texts"

      "title": "He’ll pack on the PDA.",
      "content": "He’ll pack on the PDA. Taurus is a sensual, committed sign. If he’s starting to feel territorial, he may very well try to mark his territory through public cuddles, kisses, and hugs—it’s the Taurus way! If you notice that he’s suddenly way more likely to toss an arm over your shoulder while you’re out and about, this could definitely be a sign that he’s jealous. When you’re talking to someone who could be into you, he may walk up and kiss you on the cheek. At a party, he may circle back every few minutes to give you a quick kiss. He may post a photo of you two cuddling close on social media."

      "content": "He’ll leave the relationship. If a Taurus feels too threatened or disrespected, eventually he’ll just hit the road. This is a sign that cherishes genuine commitment and serious relationships. If he’s always feeling jealous, he’ll start to wonder if a future like that is in the cards for you two. And he’s not likely to stick around and find out."

      "title": "Respect his needs and boundaries.",
      "content": "Respect his needs and boundaries. At the end of the day, all your Taurus crush really wants is to feel safe and loved. Prove that to him, and no amount of interested suitors or flirtations can keep him from sticking around. When he sets a boundary, make sure you respect it. He may not bring up these things himself, so take it upon yourself to ask him what he needs from you. [3] X Research source “Does it bother you when James flirts with me? I want to make sure you feel comfortable. Oh, it does? That’s good to know. I’ll make sure I shut down those flirty conversations when they happen. How does that sound?” If you mess up, apologize: “I’m sorry, that conversation really got away from me. I should’ve walked away, but I didn’t. That’s my fault.”"

      "content": "Remind him that he’s the one for you. You can ease a jealous Taurus’ mind by just explaining that at the end of the day, you choose him. Point out that he’s the one you buy take out with, he’s the one you save your funniest jokes for, and ultimately, he’s the one you want to be with. This will go a long way with your Taurus man. “I totally get why you’re jealous, but the thing is, you’re the one for me. I choose you every single day.” “I don’t want to be with anyone else—just you. If you ever need me to remind you of that, let me know.”"

This can be frustrating, but remember—it’s a sign that he cares, and he’s not trying to punish you. When you two discuss jealousy and emotions, stay positive, be empathetic, and if necessary, take the lead. “I’m not going to judge you for what you feel. When you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.” “I know it can be hard to talk about this stuff, but I think it’d be really good for us if we can do it.” “So, you’ve been feeling jealous. Can you tell me more about that? Is there something I can do to make it better?”"
