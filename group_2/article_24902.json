Avoid concrete perches, as they are hard on the bird's feet. Check that the wood is safe for the bird, such as eucalyptus. Dowel perches or plastic perches can cause foot problems due to the lack of foot exercises. Avoid perches and toys made out of Prunus or Oak trees as these may be harmful to to your cockatiel."

To help maintain proper beak length, make sure your bird has plenty of toys to play with. Play, using the beak, will help wear it down and keep it at a healthy length. Lava rocks and cuttle-bones are great things to offer your bird to help with beak maintenance."
