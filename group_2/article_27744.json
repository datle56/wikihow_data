      "content": "Mix the essential oils and 3 mL (0.61 tsp) of water in a small bowl. Measure 3.5 mL (0.71 tsp) of orange oil, 1 mL (0.20 tsp) of lemon oil, 1 mL (0.20 tsp) of nutmeg oil, 1.25 mL (0.25 tsp) of cassia oil, 0.25 mL (0.051 tsp) of coriander oil, 0.25 mL (0.051 tsp) of neroli oil, 2.75 mL (0.56 tsp) of lime oil, and 0.25 mL (0.051 tsp) of lavender oil into a bowl. Use a spoon to mix the oils and water until they are thoroughly combined. This mixture makes the flavouring for the cola. [1] X Research source If you find it difficult to source neroli oil, use petitgrain, bergamot, or bitter orange oil instead. Cassia oil is also called cinnamon oil. If possible, use pure essential oils, as these will have a superior taste. Purchase essential oils from a health store or online."

      "content": "Add sugar, water, citric acid, caffeine, caramel colour, and flavouring to a blender. Measure 15 mL (0.53 imp fl oz; 0.51 fl oz) of the flavouring you created, 17.5 ml (3.5 tsp) of 75% citric acid or phosphoric acid, 2.28 L (9.6 c) of water, 2.36 kg (5.2 lb) of granulated white sugar, 0.5 mL (0.10 tsp) of caffeine (optional), and 30 mL (6.1 tsp) caramel color (optional) into a blender. If you don’t have a blender, use a food processor instead. Don’t add extra caffeine to the recipe, as high doses can make you unwell. Caramel coloring doesn’t affect the flavour of the cola, it simply gives the colour a pale brown colour. Purchase caramel coloring and caffeine from a speciality foods store. Store any unused flavoring in an airtight container in the fridge."

      "title": "Measure 10 g (0.35 oz) of food-grade gum arabic into the blender.",
      "content": "Measure 10 g (0.35 oz) of food-grade gum arabic into the blender. The gum arabic acts as a thickener and helps to give the mixture a syrup consistency. Make sure to use food-grade gum arabic rather than art-grade gum, as the latter will make you sick. [2] X Research source Purchase gum arabic from a speciality foods store."

      "title": "Blend the ingredients for 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Blend the ingredients for 2 minutes. Turn the blender to the highest setting and blend the ingredients until the sugar is thoroughly dispersed amongst the liquids. This mixture creates the syrup base for the OpenCola. If you want to keep the syrup to use at a later date, place it in an airtight bottle or container in the fridge."

      "title": "Pour the syrup and soda water into a glass at a 1:5 ratio.",
      "content": "Pour the syrup and soda water into a glass at a 1:5 ratio. Multiply the amount of syrup by 5 to determine how much soda water to add. For example, mix 60 mL (12 tsp) of the syrup you created with 300 mL (61 tsp) of soda water to create a large glass of cola. [3] X Research source Carbonated water and sparkling water also work as mixers."

    {
      "title": "Stir the syrup and soda water with a spoon.",
      "content": "Stir the syrup and soda water with a spoon. Mix the liquids until the cola has an even color. Stop stirring the cola once the liquids are combined, as over-mixing will cause the drink to go flat quickly. [4] X Research source If you are using a thin glass, use a metal straw to stir the syrup and soda water."

      "title": "Add ice to the drink or enjoy it on its own.",
      "content": "Add ice to the drink or enjoy it on its own. Cola tastes best when it is fresh, as the bubbles disappear quickly. Add 3 or 4 pieces of ice to create a cool and refreshing drink. Alternatively, enjoy the rich and undiluted flavours of the cola by itself. Avoid leaving the cola in a fridge to cool, as it will lose some of its bubbles."

    {
      "title": "Store leftovers in an airtight bottle in the fridge.",
      "content": "Store leftovers in an airtight bottle in the fridge. Pour the cola into a bottle and tightly screw on the lid. This helps to minimise the number of bubbles that can escape from the cola. The cola tastes best the day you make it; however, the drink will still have some bubbles for up to 4 days. [5] X Research source Clean recycled soda bottles work well for storing cola."
