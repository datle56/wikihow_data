      "content": "Consider an H-brace fence. If the fence is not yet built, you can build it in an \"H-brace\" style, with single crossbeams and horizontal tensioned wires connecting the posts. For the gate posts, use posts 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the other fence posts, and attach them to the nearest fence post using a tensioned wire strung diagonally from the bottom of the gate post to the top of the other post.

      "content": "Dig a trench across the gate opening instead. If you are not building an H-brace fence, you can reinforce the gate posts with a concrete base instead. Begin by digging a trench 12\" (30 cm) wide across the gate opening, and at least 18\" (46 cm) deep."

      "content": "Brace the posts in position. Place the two gate posts in opposite ends of the trench. Plumb them with a bubble level to make sure they are as vertical as possible. Brace them in place by nailing two angled 2 x 4s onto adjacent sides of each post, stabilizing them against the ground. [2] X Research source"

Make sure that you have enough room for the post and a fence to be there. For example, if you want a gate that spans 36 in. (or 92 cm), cut the boards to 34 in. (or 88 cm). You can replace the 2\" x 4\"s with any 1\" or 2\" thick boards with a width that matches the rest of the fence. The thicker the board, the better, to make the gate sturdy and durable."

If your gate is very tall, a center brace beam may also be necessary. For a sturdier gate, add a diagonal brace across the square. Instead of nailing the boards together, drill holes and connect them with carriage bolts."

If the hinge placement does not need adjusting, screw the hinges onto one of the vertical boards of your gate. If your gate has a diagonal brace, the lower side of the brace should be next to the hinges."
