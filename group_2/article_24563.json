      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain how James has impacted you. Whether he inspired you to come out or start your own YouTube channel, specify what you love about him. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send an autograph , or answer one of your burning questions. [4] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality. To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps and stickers. Be genuine and specific to make your letter more meaningful. For example, instead of saying ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù you could say, ‚ÄúYour tutorials have inspired me to experiment more with my makeup.‚Äù If you‚Äôre requesting an autograph from James, send your photo in a properly stamped and self-addressed envelope. It can take 3+ months for a response, so try your best to be patient."
