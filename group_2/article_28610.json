You can drill as many or as few holes as you'd like, but try to space them evenly. Make sure that you are drilling all the way through the wood. Can't find any driftwood? Use a branch or a dowel instead."

[2] X Research source The best type of string to use would be nylon beading thread, fishing line, or beading wire. You will need one length of string for each hole that you made.

Use anything else that will make noise when clinked together. Metal charms, shells, and keys would all work great!"
