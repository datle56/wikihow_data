This is given every 10 minutes until the cat vomits, but can only be given a total of three times.

A measuring spoon will work in a pinch but plan on wasting some of the fluid. With one person holding the cat securely, pour or administer the solution into the corner of the mouth where there is a gap between the teeth. Slowly and carefully pour in the material waiting for the cat to swallow. You do not want the cat to breathe in the fluid. Have someone else help you. You should have one person hold the cat while the other administers the medicine. After the dose has been given, hold the cat until it starts to retch and then let it down on the floor to vomit."
