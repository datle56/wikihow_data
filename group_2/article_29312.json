      "title": "Set your objective for the lesson.",
      "content": "Set your objective for the lesson. At the beginning of every lesson, write your lesson plan goal at the top. The objective should be one sentence, contain a strong verb, and communicate what students will know or be able to do by the end of the lesson. If you want to add a bit extra, add how they might do this (through video, games, flashcards, etc.). [1] X Trustworthy Source National Education Association Union of professional teachers devoted to promoting the success of the public education system by advocating on behalf of teachers and students. Go to source An example of a good objective might be, \"Students will be able to analyze nonfiction texts by performing a close reading on a historical document.\" Most teachers will use Bloom’s taxonomy when choosing their objective verb. Teachers often abbreviate “Students will be able to” with “SWBAT” on their lesson plans. Many teachers start with the objective then work their way out from there, choosing class activities last. This is called “backmapping” and it’s the most widely accepted lesson organization style around today. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Include the standards that you’re covering in your objective.",
      "content": "Include the standards that you’re covering in your objective. So, you know what the students will learn, but why are they learning it? In all likelihood, you’re teaching in a state or district with educational standards—sets of info all students need to know before graduating. In almost all states, these are the Common Core Standards . Include the standard(s) on your lesson plan either above or below your objective. There will always be at least 1 standard, but a lesson may touch on 2-3 of them. [3] X Research source Our previous objective aligns nicely with the CCSS R.L.8.2, which reads “Determine a theme or central idea of a text and analyze in detail its development over the course of the text…” A handful of states, including Florida, Virginia, and Texas, refuse to adopt common core. They have their own state standards. If you’re still in school to become a teacher, you may not have specific standards you need to cover just yet. Many schools will allow teachers to cover the objectives in whatever order they’d like so far as they cover all of them. Some schools will map out the standards to cover in their curriculum, though."

      "title": "Provide an overview of the lesson’s activities.",
      "content": "Provide an overview of the lesson’s activities. Use broad strokes to outline the big ideas for the class and what you’re going to cover. Don’t worry about being super specific. This is just general info to help you and others get a sense for what the class will entail. [4] X Research source For example, if your class is about Shakespeare's Hamlet , your overview might be “Introduction to Hamlet . Historical context, biographical info , and preliminary information. We’ll cover the folio, character list, and assign reading roles. Start Act 1 if time allows.” A single overview may get you through multiple classes, so you may find yourself copy and pasting the same overview into multiple plans. That’s totally okay!"

      "title": "Map out your activities and timeline for the class.",
      "content": "Map out your activities and timeline for the class. Some schools won’t force you to map out every single minute of a lesson, but you’ll likely find it helpful to be specific when you’re just starting out. If there's a lot to cover in a fixed amount of time, break your plan into sections that you can speed up or slow down to accommodate changes as they happen. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Education Association Union of professional teachers devoted to promoting the success of the public education system by advocating on behalf of teachers and students. Go to source You might write: 1:00-1:10: Warm up . Bring class into focus and recap yesterday's discussion on great tragedies; relate it to Hamlet . 1:10-1:25: Present information. Discuss Shakespearean history briefly, focusing on his creative period 2 years before and after Hamlet. 1:25-1:40: Guided practice . Class discussion regarding major themes in the play. 1:40-1:55: Freer practice. Class writes single paragraph describing current event in Shakespearean terms. Individually encourage bright students to write 2 paragraphs, and coach slower students. 1:55-2:00: Conclusion. Collect papers, assign homework, dismiss class."

      "content": "Include the formative or summative assessments you’ll use. This may or may not be a separate section depending on the template you’re using. If there isn’t a separate section for it, mention it in your timeline. Every individual class should include an assessment of some kind. List the type of assessment you’re going to include or use in the class. [6] X Research source Formative assessments are instructional tools. They’re anything you use to check if students are learning so you can adjust your lessons. Examples include: class discussions, teacher questions, pop quizzes, group work, surveys, and self-reflections. Summative assessments are how you prove a student learned something. They occur at the end of lesson arcs, units, or sections. Examples include: tests, quizzes, essays, presentations, and final projects. All summative assessments (outside of tests and quizzes) have rubrics, which are the set of standards you’re judging students on. You do not need to include your rubrics in the lesson plan, but you should be making rubrics."

      "content": "List the instructional materials you need for the class. Provide a simple list of the materials that you and your students will need to complete the class. This is more for subs and department heads than you. Remember, any teacher should be able to pick your lesson plan up and complete your lesson for you. [7] X Research source You might list textbooks, worksheets, novels, calculators, or whiteboards. If you need to borrow a TV or need a link to a specific YouTube video, include that, too. Skip the basic school supplies every student needs. You don’t need to mention pens, pencils, etc. Need a worksheet or special materials for a class but don’t want to spend super long making them from scratch? Check out Teachers Pay Teachers .

      "content": "Script out what you’re going to say if you’re nervous. New teachers often find solace in scripting out a lesson. While this takes way more time than a lesson should, you might find it helpful. It may ease your nerves if you know exactly what questions you want to ask and where you want the conversation to go. [8] X Research source Over time, you’ll need to do this less and less. Eventually, you'll be able to go in with practically nothing at all!"

      "content": "Allow for some wiggle room in your timeline. Don’t treat your schedule like it’s some rigid set of rules you have to follow down to the T. If your timeline says you’ll change activities at 1:15 but the students are getting something valuable out of the what you’re doing, go ahead and push things back to 1:20 or 1:25! While you should try to stick to this plan within reason, it’s okay to deviate. [9] X Research source If you find yourself constantly running over your schedule, know what you can and cannot scratch. What must you cover in order for the children to learn most? What is just fluff and time killers?"

      "content": "Tailor your lessons to suit your students’ needs. What are your kids like? What is their learning style (visual, auditory, tactile or a combination)? What might they already know, and where might they be deficient? Focus your plan to fit the overall group of students you have in class, and then make modifications as necessary to account for students with disabilities, those who are struggling or unmotivated, and those who are gifted. [10] X Expert Source César de León, M.Ed. Educational Leadership Consultant Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. Odds are you'll be working with a pile of extroverts and introverts. Some students will benefit more from working alone while others will thrive in pair work or in groups. Knowing this will help you format activities to different interaction preferences. You'll also wind up having a few students that know just about as much as you do on the topic and some that, while smart, look at you like you're from another planet. If you know who these kids are, you can plan accordingly."

      "title": "Use a variety of different instructional styles to keep things fresh.",
      "content": "Use a variety of different instructional styles to keep things fresh. Some students do well on their own, others in pairs, and yet others in big groups. So long as you're letting them interact and build off each other, you're doing your job. But since each student is different, try to allow opportunities for all types of interactions. Your students (and the cohesion of the class) will be better for it! [11] X Research source Really, any activity can be manipulated to be done separately, in pairs, or in groups. If you have ideas already mapped out, see if you can revamp them at all to mix it up."

You're bound to have some students that can't sit through a 25-minute video and others who can't be bothered to read a 2-page excerpt from a book. Neither is dumber than the other, so do your students a service by switching up your activities to utilize every student's abilities. [12] X Research source Every student learns differently. Some need to see the info, some need to hear it, and others need to literally get their hands on it. If you've spent a great while talking, stop and let them talk about it. You will likely have some students with IEPs, or Instructional Educational Plans. These are legal documents for students with special needs that require specific instructional adjustments."

On the off-chance something happens and you can't teach the lesson, you'll want to have a plan someone else could understand. The other side of this is if you write it in advance and forget, it'll be easier to jog your memory if it's clear. Avoid using shorthand or acronyms that only you’ll be able to understand."

You'll also have days where tests got moved, half the class showed up, or the video you had planned got eaten by the DVD player. When these days show up, it helps to have a spare activity ready to go.

Ease your students into every lesson with a little warm up known as a bell ringer. These are 3- to 5-minute quick activities that serve as introductions to your lesson. The warm up can be a simple game (possibly about vocab on the topic to see where their current knowledge lies (or what they remember from last week!). Or, it can be questions, a mingle, or pictures used to start a conversation. Whatever it is, get them talking and thinking about the topic."

However, it's still new to them, so start off with an activity that has training wheels. Think worksheets, matching, or using pictures. You wouldn't write an essay before you do a fill-in-the-blank! [16] X Research source This is often explained by teachers as “I do, we do, you do.” In other words, you show them how to do it. Then, the whole class does it together. Finally, the students do it on their own. If you have time for two activities, all the better. It's a good idea to test their knowledge on two different levels -- for example, writing and speaking (two very different skills). Try to incorporate different activities for students that have different aptitudes."

You can move on, possibly adding more difficult elements of the concept or practicing harder skills. If they're not getting it, go back to the information. How do you need to present it differently? If you've been teaching the same group for a while, odds are you know the students who might struggle with certain concepts. If that's the case, pair them with stronger students to keep the class going. You don't want certain students left behind, but you also don't want the class held up, waiting for everyone to get on the same level."

That doesn't mean you leave the room! It just means they get to do a more creative endeavor that lets their minds really wrap around the information you've presented to them. How can you let their minds flourish? [17] X Research source It all depends on the subject at hand and the skills you want to use. It can be anything from a 20-minute puppet making project to a two-week long dalliance with the oversoul in a heated debate on transcendentalism."

This could start out as a discussion and morph into more probing questions on the issue at hand. Or it could just be time for clarification -- both will benefit your students. [18] X Research source If you have a group full of kids that can't be paid to raise their hands, turn them amongst themselves. Give them an aspect of the topic to discuss and 5 minutes to converse about it. Then bring the focus to the front of the class and lead a group discussion. Interesting points are bound to pop up!"

It's not bad...it's just sort of a strange, uncomfortable feeling. If time allots for it, sum up the day with the students. It's a good idea to literally show them they've learned something.
