      "title": "Distract yourself mentally.",
      "content": "Distract yourself mentally. As your bladder fills, nerve endings in the pelvis send signals to your brain that it is time to relieve yourself. Because the urge to urinate originates from these nerve signals, try to distract yourself by thinking of something else. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to think complex thoughts, like brainstorming ideas for a new project at work or coming up with a solution to a scheduling issue at home. If you think of simple thoughts -- like counting to 10 or going over the alphabet -- this will not fully distract you from your body's signals to urinate. If you can wear headphones and have access to your phone or computer, try listening to the news or a podcast with a complex story. Taking in outside information will help you ignore the urge to pee."

You will naturally feel the urge to cross your legs and keep pressure on your pelvis. While you can do this, you should keep the rest of your body relaxed as this will distract you from the discomfort of a full bladder. Roll your shoulders backwards and forwards. Roll your head from side to side. This will relieve pressure on your spine and neck that you might feel if you are keeping a tense posture. If you are sitting, cross your legs so you exert slight pressure on your bladder. Square your shoulders and extend your spine. This will help you sit up straight. Do not slouch as this will put extra, unnecessary weight onto your bladder. If you are standing, position yourself with your feet parallel and your toes touching. Distribute your weight evenly across each leg and stand tall. You might feel the urge to cross your legs while standing, but try to avoid doing this. Crossing your legs will feel awkward because it will put an uneven amount of weight on one leg."

      "content": "Breathe deeply. If you cannot access a bathroom when you need to urinate, this will cause a significant amount of mental and physical stress. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm, pushing out the muscles in your lower belly as you inhale and drawing them back in as your exhale. This deep, measured breathing will relieve pressure on your pelvis. It will also relax other muscles in your body that may feel very tense or constricted.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To complete Kegel exercises, tighten your pelvic floor muscles while you are sitting or lying down. Hold the contraction for five seconds and then release for five counts. Repeat this exercise four to five times.

You should generally aim for 9 cups of water (or 2.2 liters) every day. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

If you are currently taking medicine for another condition such as high blood pressure or depression, this could be negatively impacting your bladder. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your dosage or switching to a medicine with fewer side effects. You might be reluctant to talk to your doctor about your bladder issues because you think they are embarrassing. But you shouldn't hesitate to seek treatment; bladder pain could be the sign of something much larger, such as cancer or a problem in another organ such as your kidneys, so go ahead and talk to your doctor. Medicines such as Mirabegron and botox injections to the bladder are also sometimes used to treat incontinence.
