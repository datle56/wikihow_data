      "title": "Accept the fact that they are your beloved partner's family.",
      "content": "Accept the fact that they are your beloved partner's family. It means that your partner grew up in the family and loves the family more than anything. Keep that in mind and they become much easier to bear and everything will flow freely. [1] X Research source Consider them as family and not opponents: Many people end up spoiling their relationships with in-laws because they frame them as opponents, who always impose demands on them. The biggest culprit behind this kind of assumption is the information that we are getting access to. Try to see any given conflict from their perspective, too; treat them like family and give them the benefit of the doubt, as you enter into a disagreement. If you view things from their angle, you may understand where they're coming from."

    {
      "title": "Suppress your ego:",
      "content": "Suppress your ego: Most relations spoil due to this ever damaging ego factor. Stay humble and try to avoid any sort of conflict. The rule is simple and you just need to fill in empty spaces with love and abstain ego from getting in at any point of time. Avoid comparing your family to your in-laws. Each family dynamic is different, and your expectations of each other will always be different from those in your family of origin. Accept this, rather than fighting it, and your relationship will benefit."

      "title": "Make an effort to get to know them.",
      "content": "Make an effort to get to know them. After formal introductions, put some effort to know them. Make a special effort with the older people at home, then the siblings of your partner, their partners and their kids, if there are any. We tend to dislike or ignore people only when we don't really know who they are. Ask your partner to help you draw out a family tree and memorize it if you find it hard to remember all the names and various relationships in the family. Smile . A smile is a starter to many great things, including good relationships. Whenever you bump into your in-laws remember to give them a genuine smile. [2] X Research source Start a conversation. [3] X Research source Take steps to start the conversation since you are the newcomer. They might expect you to make the move first. Be ready to accept any kind of replies or response.

    {
      "title": "Approach kids.",
      "content": "Approach kids. Kids are always easy to be tackled compared to the adults. Try to play with or tell stories to the kids. Buy them chocolates or candies and let the elders realize that you are a friendly and jovial person. Respect the beliefs and practises of the families. If they don't allow sweets, avoid them like the plague. If they are deeply religious, praise their beliefs and join in as much as you possibly can, particularly in front of the children."

    {
      "title": "Respect the elders.",
      "content": "Respect the elders. Show respect when you talk, eat or even when you are just sitting idle in front of them. Playing with smartphones should be banned completely. Show attention to the conversation or the food you are eating. Attentiveness would reflect your well being to them. Don't feel afraid of asking about the family history.

      "content": "Be yourself . Just be yourself and you don't have to act to get a place their hearts. Show that you are sincere in every single thing you do and you really mean what you say in every conversation. Originality always attracts. No harm to share with them your drawbacks or weaknesses. Show your talents and abilities rather than tell. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Never compare.",
      "content": "Never compare. People are different. Your parents and the in-laws will never be the same. When you compare them, things will get worse. So accept them as they are and show love and affection to them. [5] X Research source Never brag about your maiden family. You may tell things about your parents or birth family but never ever brag or talk big about what you had in your home. This might irritate your in-laws or cause negative remarks."

      "content": "Stay in touch. If you are not staying under the same roof with your in-laws, find time to text or call them once in a while. They would be definitely touched and it would help a lot in the bonding of your new relationship. Make them feel that you acknowledge them. [6] X Research source Remember birthdays and anniversaries.
