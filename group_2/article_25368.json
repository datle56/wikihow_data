      "title": "Watch for episodes of excessive or intense worry.",
      "content": "Watch for episodes of excessive or intense worry. Perhaps the most characteristic feature of anxiety is a long-lasting or intense feeling of dread and tension. Sufferers of anxiety often find themselves worrying constantly, even when they have nothing in particular to worry about. Worrying is often accompanied by physical tension and jitteriness, and is characterized by a pessimistic attitude, and an anticipation of the worst outcome in the situation causing the worry.

      "title": "Identify feelings of blankness or being unreal.",
      "content": "Identify feelings of blankness or being unreal. One of the most bizarre feelings associated with excessive anxiety is a feeling of detachment, or unreality, especially in situations where the anxiety sufferer is overwhelmed by the source of their anxiety. During such episodes, you feel utterly disconnected from others, and from the world around you, and you may find yourself unmotivated to do much of anything. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source For example, feeling as if your emotions and motivations have been turned \"off\", as if by the flip of a switch, following an episode of intense worry or stress may be a sign that you are experiencing excessive anxiety."

      "title": "Recognize episodes of fear or panic.",
      "content": "Recognize episodes of fear or panic. The fear or panic may be associated with a real situation from your life, or may simply manifest as a general fear, such as of death, or loss of control. Alternatively, the fear may have no source you can identify. This fear may prove difficult to control, and difficult for others to comfort, which makes it one of the most debilitating symptoms of anxiety. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source If difficult or stressful situations — be they social, financial, or work-related — cause you to feel overwhelmed and incapable of dealing with your problems, you may be experiencing the effects of excessive anxiety. It is normal to sometimes be troubled by thoughts of death and dying, either your own or that of someone close to you, but if these thoughts begin occurring with such frequency or intensity that they distract you from important activities or prevent you from sleeping they may be a sign that you are experiencing an unhealthy amount of anxiety."

      "title": "Pay attention to your mood.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your mood. The symptoms of anxiety can be very difficult to cope with, especially if they are frequent or severe. The resulting strain can make it difficult to maintain a calm or happy mood, which can strain work, school and personal relationships, and making it a challenge to enjoy a normal social life. [4] X Research source Frequent anxiety sufferers often find themselves feeling irritable and display difficulty concentrating or participating in social interactions."

      "title": "Be attentive to avoidance behaviors.",
      "content": "Be attentive to avoidance behaviors. Regular sufferers of anxiety attacks will often find themselves fearful of situations which have, in the past, been triggers for stress or anxiety. If you find it very difficult to enter into situations which you associate with stress, or you often find yourself compelled to take significant steps to avoid such situations, this may indicate that you are experiencing an unhealthy level of anxiety. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source For example, if you find yourself often procrastinating school work, professional responsibilities, or social interactions because you fear being overwhelmed by the stress caused by these activities, you may be experiencing the effects of excessive anxiety."

      "content": "Be wary of drug and alcohol abuse. Self-medication, or use of unprescribed drugs and alcohol to treat the symptoms of illness, is common among chronic sufferers of anxiety. You should be honest with yourself regarding the role that drugs or alcohol play in your own relationship with anxiety. If you feel that your use of substances is out of your control, and is detrimental to you, it's important that you reach out to friends, loved ones, or medical professionals to help you deal with the problem before it impacts your health.

      "content": "Pay attention to unexplained discomfort and pain. Nausea, headaches, dizziness, and muscle soreness are all common symptoms of anxiety. If you regularly experience such discomfort, this may be a sign that you are experiencing excessive anxiety, especially if standard methods for relieving the discomfort are ineffective.

      "content": "Notice signs of physical tension. The body often manifests psychological strain physically, through symptoms like muscle tension, rapid heartbeat and breathing, trembling, and shortness of breath. Often experiencing such physical tension, especially in the absence of a non-psychological cause, such as vigorous exercise, may be a sign of anxiety. [8] X Research source Fidgeting behaviors, such as tapping your hands and feet, grinding your teeth, or clenching your jaw may also be signs of anxiety-related physical tension."

      "title": "Be mindful of changes in your sleep patterns.",
      "content": "Be mindful of changes in your sleep patterns. Anxiety often has a very noticeable effect on how well you sleep, how much sleep you get, and how energized and alert you feel after sleeping. Oversleeping and insomnia (a sustained problem getting to sleep and staying asleep) are both common anxiety symptoms. Oversleeping intentionally to escape worry, or being kept from sleep by an overly active, worrying mind are both classic problems for sufferers of anxiety. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Monitor your digestion. Your digestive system is very sensitive to changes in your physiology, including psychological changes like experiencing anxiety. Anxiety is often associated with frequent feelings of nausea, as well as frequent urination or diarrhea. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems.

      "content": "Be aware of fluctuating appetite and weight. Anxiety often affects what, and how much, you want to eat. If you notice that you are often not hungry, or simply not motivated to eat, this may be a sign of anxiety. Conversely, frequent overeating, especially as a distraction from worry, can also be a manifestation of anxiety. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch for episodes of snowballing or overwhelming worry.",
      "content": "Watch for episodes of snowballing or overwhelming worry. For sufferers of anxiety attacks, the feelings of worry and dread associated with anxiety can \"snowball\", becoming so intense that they overwhelm everything else, and leave the sufferer stunned, panicking, and unable to process what is going on. These episodes are often brought on by high-stress events or situations, are extremely unpleasant and bewildering, and can last from a few minutes, to hours or even entire days. [12] X Research source Anxiety attack sufferers often experience a \"deer-in-the-headlights\" feeling of being stunned and unable to decide how to respond to a stressful situation."

      "title": "Be mindful of obsessive thinking.",
      "content": "Be mindful of obsessive thinking. Anxiety attacks are often accompanied by obsessive thoughts, which are intense, and unwanted thoughts associated with a problem, worry, or stressful situation. During an anxiety attack, these thoughts may seem to engulf the sufferer, making it difficult or impossible for them to focus on anything else. [14] X Research source While these obsessive thoughts may be associated with a concrete problem in the sufferer's life, they can also be much more abstract. For instance, the obsession may be centered on a disturbing or stressful image or sound which becomes \"stuck\" in the sufferer's mind, preventing thought of anything else."

      "content": "Consult a medical professional. Anxiety attacks are painful, and often debilitating. The physical and emotional strain associated with regular, intense anxiety can also have long-term effects on your health. If you are struggling with anxiety, you should talk with a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or counselor about your symptoms, and possible treatments for anxiety.
