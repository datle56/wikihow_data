      "title": "Commit to your partner and your relationship.",
      "content": "Commit to your partner and your relationship. Put effort into the relationship and work hard to make it a success. Communicate openly with your partner about your goals for the relationship and where you see it going. Licensed Psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz says, “Healthy communication involves sharing how you feel, not bottling things up. It involves understanding and validating your partner's perspective.” Being committed to a relationship means you’re willing to put in the work even when things aren’t going smoothly. If you're only interested in a short-term fling, be honest. If you've got an eye toward serious long-term love, be honest. There's nothing wrong with either kind of love, but you need to make sure that your partner is equally committed to the same version of love that you are, says Love & Relationship Coach Nicole Moore."

      "title": "Be emotionally intimate with your partner.",
      "content": "Be emotionally intimate with your partner. The word \"intimacy\" is often associated with sex, but being emotionally intimate is a huge part of a loving relationship. Emotional intimacy involves allowing yourself to feel and express vulnerability around your partner. Signs of avoiding vulnerability are withdrawals, attacks, or accusations. On the contrary, intimacy looks like sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Emotions or situations that previously felt unsafe feel safer in an intimate relationship because of the vulnerability and trust you’ve developed. [1] X Research source When you begin to feel vulnerable (like experiencing fear, sadness, shame, or hurt), take a moment and pause. Be compassionate with yourself as you acknowledge whatever feelings come up. Allow yourself to feel them; don’t avoid them. Share your vulnerable moments and let your partner support you."

      "content": "Accept that love is dynamic. If you’re concerned that the initial attraction and strong feelings of love are wearing off, realize that love often occurs in waves. Sometimes, you feel overwhelmingly in love with someone, and other times, you feel like friends or roommates. Just because you hit a low point doesn’t mean it will last forever. Life happens in cycles, and it’s okay that love experiences highs and lows.

Love naturally changes over time. The initial rollercoaster of emotions and angst that comes with the early stages of a relationship tend settle into a more calm, lasting connection after 1-2 years together. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Be open to receiving love. You don’t have to be in control of the love in your relationship; let your partner express love toward you. Receiving love can feel vulnerable to some people because it requires letting go of control. Be open to receiving gifts, accepting compliments, and warm gestures. You may feel like you now owe something back, but let that go and enjoy the experience of receiving. Love doesn’t cause debts. It multiplies and expands. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Show affection to your partner through touch.",
      "content": "Show affection to your partner through touch. Showing affection through touch is one of the love languages. Touching doesn’t have to be sexual, but sex can certainly be a part of it. Touch also includes a sweet kiss on the cheek, engaging in a long, supportive hug, or reaching out for your partner’s hand to stay connected. Express your love for your partner by initiating and sustaining physical contact. Affection is one way to express care, appreciation, and other connecting, positive emotions. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Physical affection helps your partner feel loved, and also helps you feel as if you’re showing love. Try cuddling on the couch together or giving them a massage without using it to initiate sex. Don’t be afraid to touch your partner in public. A subtle touch on the back or putting your arm around them means a lot to someone who likes to receive love through touch."

      "content": "Express gratitude to your partner. Sometimes, the way we communicate with a partner is lost in translation, but gratitude is always understood. Affirm your appreciation of your partner by expressing gratitude for them. Thank them for the things they do and also for the qualities they embody. [6] X Research source When you think a nice thing about your partner – like that you think they look great or you admire how they interact with others – say it out loud and thank them for the effort they put into everything they do. If you find it difficult to express your feelings in the moment, write them a message of gratitude to share appreciation for them and thank them for loving you. Don’t fall into the trap of always complaining about your partner when they aren’t around. It’s tempting to join in when your friends are expressing frustration with their partners. Resist the impulse or turn it into a gratitude session about what you love about your partner. [7] X Research source"

In a true partnership, there are is no leader or follower. You work together to find solutions, solve problems, and comfort each other when times get tough.

Build a solid foundation with your partner and really understand their hopes, dreams, and goals…that’s actually linked to long-term romance.” Wanting to be seen, heard, and understood as an individual are basic human needs, so it’s important to have a partner who really cares about what you feel and think. [10] X Research source When they’re talking to you, be a good listener . Don’t try to think of a solution to their problem or about how you want to respond. Really listen to them and think about what they’re saying. Don’t get defensive if you disagree with what they’re saying. It’s okay to connect with what you feel, but try to see and understand their side, too. [11] X Research source This doesn’t mean you have to share all the same interests, Schewitz cautions. “There are plenty of healthy relationships where people don't share a ton of interest. So I would say that's just a bonus and not necessarily essential for a healthy relationship.”"

Schewitz recommends learning to speak your partner’s love language. “Some people find it really romantic when their partner brings them flowers because their love language is gifts. Somebody whose love language is words of affirmation is going to find it really romantic to hear: ‘I love you,’ or ‘you’re beautiful,’ or ‘I don't know what I would do without you.’” Schewitz says that your partner will appreciate you putting in quality time with them. “They’re going to really appreciate you planning an amazing date for them where everything's just handled, and they don't have to worry about a thing. You guys just have to sit there and connect with each other and have great conversations in an amazing atmosphere.” Don’t know what your love language is?

Do that throughout the day.” This extends to maintaining boundaries and saying “no.” If what you need is some relaxation, say no to getting together with friends.
