      "content": "Look for mercury in gas-fired appliances. A common element in many gas-fired appliances is a mercury heat (or flame) sensor. Also called automatic gas shut-off valves, these small gadgets are used in ovens, furnaces, and water heaters to stop the flow of gas if the flame does not produce heat. Inspect these devices in your home for the presence of liquid mercury.

      "content": "Check other gauges and meters. There are a wide variety of other specialty gauges and devices in which you might be able to locate liquid mercury. For instance, if you have a medical condition, you might own a sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure meter) that uses liquid mercury to measure blood pressure. Other gauges containing liquid mercury include: esophageal dilators, bougie tubes, or gastrointestinal tubes flow meters hydrometers psychrometers manometers pyrometers"

      "content": "Identify compact fluorescent light bulbs. Older incandescent light bulbs do not contain liquid mercury. But, some newer energy-saving compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs do. Check the packaging that the bulbs came in for warnings regarding their mercury content. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Energy-saving bulbs typically contain no more than 4 mg of mercury—just enough to cover the tip of a pen. Even if the CFL bulb contains mercury, it might be in gaseous rather than liquid form. LED bulbs don’t contain liquid mercury.

      "content": "Locate mercury in tilt switches. Tilt switches (sometimes called “mercury switches”) were used in older appliances to transmit an on/off signal. Appliances in the home that may contain mercury include chest freezers, televisions, thermostats, washing machines, space heaters, clothes dryers, and washing machines. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Contact the appliance manufacturer or check your user manual to confirm if a given appliance has mercury. Contact an appliance recycler or your local hazardous waste collection center for information regarding the best way to dispose of these appliances. You might be able to locate up to 3 grams of mercury in thermostats."

However, the smaller “button cell” batteries that are used in watches, hearing aids, toys, pacemakers, and other devices still contain mercury. If you can find a device containing these small batteries, you’ve probably found liquid mercury. [7] X Research source"

If you spill a small amount of mercury (the amount that you might find in an average mercury thermometer), alert others in the house that they should avoid the area until you’ve cleaned it up. Don a pair of disposable gloves and use a medicine dropper to suck up the liquid mercury. Place the droplets in a sealed container (for instance, an old medicine bottle).
