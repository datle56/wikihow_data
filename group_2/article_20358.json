Confidence is knowing that you have good qualities but not spouting off about them every chance you get. [4] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. If you know you have confidence in yourself, it will show in your mannerisms, so you don't have to talk about it. [5] X Research source One way to build self-confidence is to take some time to list your strengths, achievements, and good qualities. Try to consider all the good things about yourself. If you can't get started, ask a friend to help, or think about compliments you've received in the past. [6] X Research source Another way to build confidence is stop talking negatively about yourself or at least, try to change the conversation into something somewhat good. For example, if you want to say, \"I feel ugly,\" you could say instead, \"I don't feel very attractive today, but I'm thankful this body is living and breathing and is letting me enjoy life.\" Fake confidence. If you can't bring yourself to feel confident yet, start acting confident. Faking confidence is mostly about the way you present yourself, such as speaking clearly, talking in a loud enough tone for the situation, and looking people in the eye. Also, stand up straight, as slouching implies a lack of confidence."

Maintaining a good appearance tells other people that you are confident in yourself, even if you're not. [7] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. Confidence is a big attraction for most girls. [8] X Research source Part of taking care of yourself is just making sure you're practicing good hygiene. Take a shower once a day or at least once every other day, brush your teeth twice a day, floss, and clean under your fingernails. Presenting yourself as unkempt is often a turn off. Deodorant and cologne can also help. Take care of your hair. You don't need a trendy haircut. However, it's good to get regular haircuts to rid yourself of dead ends and to keep your hair from being unruly. In addition, make sure to comb and style it every day so it's not out of control. Pick clothing that fits you well and looks good on your body. Plus, make sure you are comfortable in whatever clothing you choose."

In fact, many people go out in the hopes of finding dates or new boyfriends or girlfriends, so the odds are in your favor. However, if you're going out dancing, make sure you stand out by learning some good moves for the dance floor. Girls will be so busy noticing your dance moves, they won't have time to notice if you're attractive or not. If you're not a very good dancer, ask a friend who is a good dancer to show you some moves. If clubs aren't your thing, go other places where people are social, like a coffee shop. You could also join local clubs, take a class at the community college, or join an athletic team. The main thing is you need to get out there and meet people."

If you're a bit shy about putting yourself out there, online dating sites can act as a bit of crutch, as you don't have to go up and talk to random strangers. In addition, it puts you in touch with many more people than you could actually meet in person.

[10] X Research source Consider your friendships. Are there any girls in your life who would make a good girlfriend, who you enjoy spending time with? Be flexible. If you find yourself less than attractive and still want love, you need to offer that same chance to the girls in your life. That is, even if you don't think the person is that attractive, get to know them before brushing them off. You may need to think outside the box when it comes to thinking about a girlfriend.

If you're at a park late at night and you see a woman walking alone, that is probably not the best time to go strike up a conversation. In fact, most of the time, daytime is probably better to talk to a woman no matter where you are, unless you're at a club or bar. [12] X Research source In addition, if you're alone with woman, especially in a small space, that can be off-putting if you start trying to flirt.

You may think she's out of your league, but you never know until you pluck up the courage to start a conversation. Be sure to do it as soon as you see her, as the chance you have to talk to her will close quickly. In other words, if you see a girl who looks interesting at a coffee shop, go try to strike up a conversation. If she rebuffs you, don't take it personally. Some people, particularly introverts, just don't like talking to random strangers. It may have nothing to do with how you look. Don't be afraid to laugh and joke with her. If you set her high above you, she won't feel like she can be herself around you, which isn't something that will attract her to you."

If you come on too strong, you may find yourself rejected, which probably wouldn't change even if you were the most beautiful person in the world. It's much better to get a genuine conversation going first. [13] X Research source For example, one way to get a conversation going is to ask her a favor, any small favor.

The best kinds of questions get the other person talking and are a little bit flirty but not overtly so. Basically, you want the girl to notice that you're there and start talking to you. [14] X Research source It may work better to get the person to evaluate themselves instead of you. For example, ask the girl if her watch is a designer brand. If you're watching game on television at a bar, ask her if she's any good at basketball, rather than saying you, yourself, are amazing. If you try to impress her too much, you can turn her off."

You may think you need to hide behind flirtatious questions, but really, most women appreciate when you're at least somewhat direct with what you want. Therefore, it never hurts to just ask, as the worst she can say is \"no.\" [20] X Research source For instance, if you've been talking for awhile, you could say, \"You know, you're fun to talk to.

However, they shouldn't be so form-fitting that they're uncomfortable. [21] X Research source If you've never done it, it can help to measure yourself. Take measurements at your shoulders, chest, waist, hips, and thighs, as well as your inseam. Use a measuring tape meant for measuring the body, which you can find in sewing kits or at craft stores. Your inseam is the line running from your crotch to where you want pants to fall on the inside of your leg. You can take an inseam measurement off a pair of pants that fits you well. Once you have your measurements, you can compare them to typical size charts to get an idea of what should fit.

Another option is a subscription service that sends you clothes once a month that match your tastes and body type, that you then choose to buy or send back. [23] X Research source If you don't have the money for either of these options, it's fine to ask employees at the store what they think. However, they are being paid to sell clothes, so they have a vested interest in getting you to buy. Plus, many have a wide variety of other duties, so don't take up too much of their time."
