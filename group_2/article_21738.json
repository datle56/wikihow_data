      "content": "Choose indoor hooks for fireplaces and outdoor hooks for exterior walls. Choose indoor adhesive hooks if you want to hang garland on something like a stone or brick fireplace. Opt for outdoor adhesive hooks if you’re planning to hang garland somewhere like an outdoor stone or brick wall. [1] X Research source Avoid using indoor hooks for outdoor applications because they aren’t designed to withstand the elements, especially winter weather, so your garland might fall down after some time. This method is not guaranteed to work on all types of stone surfaces. It works best on smooth stone, such as painted brick or cement. The hooks are not designed for raw brick."

      "title": "Peel off the backing and stick the adhesive strips to the backs of the hooks.",
      "content": "Peel off the backing and stick the adhesive strips to the backs of the hooks. Look at the adhesive strips to find the side that has the brand name or that says “hook” on it. Peel the backing off of this side of the strips and stick a strip to the back of each hook you’re going to use. [2] X Research source If you want to easily remove the hooks after you’re done displaying your garland for the season, orient the strips so that the tab, or the rounded end, is sticking out from the top end of each hook. If you want to leave the hooks up permanently, orient the strips so that the tab is hidden underneath the bottom ends of the hooks."

      "content": "Press a hook against the stone where you want to start draping the garland. Peel off the backing from the remaining side of the double-sided adhesive strip. Line up the hook on the surface so it’s straight, then press it firmly against the stone to stick it in place. [3] X Research source Note that the stone surface must be relatively flat for the adhesive strips to stick properly."

      "title": "Place additional hooks, spaced evenly, across the whole surface.",
      "content": "Place additional hooks, spaced evenly, across the whole surface. [4] X Research source Peel the backing off of each additional hook, one at a time, and press it firmly into place on the surface. Stick the hooks about 2 ft (0.61 m) apart or so. The spacing doesn’t have to be exactly 2 ft (0.61 m) apart, but that’s a good general guideline. Feel free to put them closer or further apart if the width of the surface you're working with is not evenly divisible by 2 ft (0.61 m)."

      "title": "Drape the garland across the hooks, drooping it evenly between each hook.",
      "content": "Drape the garland across the hooks, drooping it evenly between each hook. Tuck 1 end of your garland into the first hook on the surface. Let it droop down as much or as little as you like between the first hook and the next hook. Continue to tuck the garland into each hook until you reach the final one. [5] X Research source You don’t have to create droops at all if you don’t want to. Run the garland straight across the surface from hook to hook if you prefer to hang it in a neat straight line."

      "title": "Use brick clips to hang garland if you have brick or stone with recessed mortar.",
      "content": "Use brick clips to hang garland if you have brick or stone with recessed mortar. Brick clips are metal clips that hook into the gaps between bricks or stones where the mortar is. They work well for hanging garland on a brick fireplace or mantel or an exterior stone brick wall, for example. Brick clips are also known as mortar clips. Brick clips come in different sizes that fit bricks in various size ranges. Make sure you use the right size of brick clips for the bricks or stones you have."

      "title": "Push a brick clip onto the brick where you want to start hanging the garland.",
      "content": "Push a brick clip onto the brick where you want to start hanging the garland. Orient the clip so that the small hooks are pointing up. Hook the skinny bottom end is under the bottom edge of the brick or stone. Press the clip firmly onto the brick by pushing and sliding it upwards until the top end clips over the top edge of the brick. Note that brick clips can be used either indoors or outdoors."

      "title": "Space additional brick clips out evenly over the surface.",
      "content": "Space additional brick clips out evenly over the surface. Push another brick clip into place every 2 ft (0.61 m) or so, or put them closer together or further apart if the width of the surface is not evenly divisible by 2 ft (0.61 m). Each brick clip holds up to 25 lb (11 kg), so use at least enough to support the weight of your garland. For example, if you have a brick fireplace that’s 5 ft (1.5 m) wide, put 1 brick clip at each end and one brick clip right in the middle, or 2.5 ft (0.76 m) in from the ends. The number of clips you use also affects how many droops you can make in your garland, if you want to let it droop down between hooks to create a swooping look. Take this into account as well and use more or fewer hooks depending on how many swoops you want."

      "content": "Slide the garland's greenery into the little clips on each hook. [6] X Research source Tuck some of the greenery into the first brick clip. Drape the garland if you want to create a drooping look or run it straight across to the next hook if you want it to be straight. Tuck the greenery into the next hook and repeat this for each hook until you hang the garland across the whole surface. If you decide to let the garland droop down between hooks, make sure you drape it as evenly as possible for a neat look."
