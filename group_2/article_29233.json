      "title": "Find the base garment.",
      "content": "Find the base garment. The base garment is the item of clothing you wish to attach the hood to. It can be a coat, jacket, sweater, shirt, or dress. Ideally, the garment should have a neckline that sits comfortably around the base of your neck. It can have a solid, buttoned, or zippered front."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a coordinating fabric.",
      "content": "Choose a coordinating fabric. The fabric for your hood should coordinate with the base garment in both pattern and fiber content. If you're making a hood for a garment you're in the process of sewing, use the same fabric for both the hood and the garment. If you're making a hood for a prepared garment you already have in your possession, choose new fabric that looks and feels similar. If you cannot match the pattern, try to match at least one color within the pattern. Similarly, if you cannot find the same type of fabric, choose one that is similar in weight. Note that woven fabrics will work if you're adding the hood to a garment made with woven fabric and if the neckline opens at the front or breaks into a deep v-neck. Otherwise, you may need to use knit fabric. Also note that you can use the same material for both the exterior portion of the hood and the lining. If you choose to mix and match, though, you should keep both fabrics similar in weight and stretch."

      "title": "Measure the neckline of the base garment.",
      "content": "Measure the neckline of the base garment. Use a tape measure to carefully measure all the way around the neckline of the base garment. If the neckline opens in the front, start and stop the measurement at the edge of that opening. The bottom of both hood halves will need to be half the circumference of the neckline. If you do not have a base garment to work with, you can estimate the necessary circumference by measuring around the circumference of the wearer's neck. Add at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) to this measurement to prevent the hood from fitting too snug."

      "title": "Sketch out the bottom edge.",
      "content": "Sketch out the bottom edge. On a large sheet of blank newsprint or brown package paper, draw a slightly curved line (almost like a very gently sloping \"S\" with long tails). The total length of the line should measure half the circumference of your neckline. Since the back of a garment typically rises higher than the front, the left edge of this bottom line should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) lower than the right edge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the front opening edge.",
      "content": "Draw the front opening edge. This opening should be at least as tall as the distance between the top of your head and the front of your collarbone. Usually, the front opening will be around 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the bottom edge for child-sized hoods and between 3 and 5 inches (7.6 and 12.5 cm) for adult-sized hoods. Draw this line so that it extends straight up from the left end of the bottom edge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Estimate the back curve.",
      "content": "Estimate the back curve. The back curve will need a relatively flat top and side, but it should curve instead of meeting at a sharp angle. To make the process easier, draw one straight line extending to the right of the top front opening and a second extending up from the right end of the bottom edge. Continue until these two lines meet at an intersection. Starting within 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the point of intersection, lightly sketch a curve to the inside of the sharp corner. This new curve will be the final outline of the back curve. Note that the total length of this curved line should roughly match the distance between the wearer's shoulders and the top of the wearer's forehead. [1] X Research source"

If you plan to use the same material for the exterior and the lining, fold the fabric into four layers and pin the pattern piece to the top layer. If you plan to use different material for the exterior and the lining, fold both pieces of fabric in half to create two layers. Stack one on top of the other, and pin the pattern piece on top of the first layer."

Begin by matching the bottom center of the hood with the back center of of the garment's neckline. Fold the sides of the hood over, matching the corners to the center front of the neckline.
