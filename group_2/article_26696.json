If the cleaner comes with an applicator top, use it to rub the cleaner into the shoe. If it doesn't have one, use a soft brush or cloth to rub it in. Make gentle circles with the brush or cloth. [2] X Research source Use a little water when applying saddle soap or other similar soaps. [3] X Research source Saddle soap or any smooth leather cleaner will work for unfinished or finished leather. Smooth leather refers to any leather that isn't textured. For instance, suede is a textured leather, so it's not considered \"smooth.\" With finished leather, almost any mild soap will work, such as a laundry detergent meant for fragile clothing. [4] X Research source Don't use sponges, as they can contain chemicals that may damage your leather."

      "title": "Condition your shoes at least every 25 wears.",
      "content": "Condition your shoes at least every 25 wears. Conditioning helps moisturize the leather. As it dries out, it can crack, leading to damaged shoes. Use a clean cloth to rub the conditioner in using small circular movements. Remove any excess conditioner once you've conditioned the whole shoe. [9] X Research source If you live in a place with harsh weather, such as a place with icy winters and salty sidewalks or a very dry climate, you should condition your shoes after you wear them 5 to 10 times. In less harsh climates, do it every 15 to 25 wears."

Wipe any excess off. [11] X Research source A wax-based polish will provide more protection for your shoes. Make sure you match the color of the polish to the color of your shoes. Once you think you have a good color, apply a little polish in an inconspicuous place to see if it matches. [12] X Research source"

Apply the product to the shoe with a clean cloth or brush, and rub it in using small circles. Wipe off any excess, and let your shoes dry.

      "content": "Use plain beeswax for a cheap option. Melt plain beeswax in a wax warmer, and apply it to the boot with a brush. It will leave a thick, ugly layer because it dries quickly, but you'll use the heat gun or blow dryer to melt the layer again. [15] X Research source Use a heat gun or blow dryer to melt the wax on the boot, and rub it in with the brush. [16] X Research source Beeswax was a common waterproofing material before modern waterproofing pastes were created. Apply wax about once a season."

Hold the spray-on polish about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away from the shoe. Spray the product in a steady, even layer. Let the product dry before you wear the shoes. [17] X Research source These products don't waterproof as well or last as long as beeswax products so you'll need to reapply them several times throughout the season."

If you're worried about an expensive pair of leather shoes, then your best bet is to put galoshes on over your shoes, particularly if you live in a rainy climate where you're required to walk a lot. You'll be able to avoid the majority of the moisture and the salt. [18] X Research source Galoshes come in many shapes and styles so you can find a pair that fits your fashion sense and look."

Leather can lose its shape if it doesn't have support, particularly if it's wet at all. A shoe tree will draw out some of the moisture and help your shoe keep its shape at the same time. [21] X Research source Shoe trees are the inserts that are shaped like a human foot. Pick unfinished cedar inserts to wick water away, as plastic will not absorb the moisture. [22] X Research source Wadded up newspaper will work to absorb moisture in place of a shoe tree, but it won't work as well to keep the shoes in shape."
