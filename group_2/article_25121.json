      "content": "Cut small problem roots. Although labor-intensive, this directly addresses the issue with no risk to nearby plants. Dig out the soil around and under the root first, then cut with a root saw or loppers. Cutting roots aggressively can put the tree in a long decline, potentially killing it over many years. Follow these rules of thumb to prevent this: Multiply the diameter of the tree by eight. That's the minimum distance from the trunk you can cut with low risk of serious harm. Cut roots on one side of the tree only, especially if you're risking a cut closer than the minimum distance."

      "content": "Dig a trench to block roots . Cutting roots once is only a temporary solution. To maintain the area, you may need to dig a trench and cut away the roots annually — or up to twice a year for aggressive root systems. You can save yourself from this chore if you dig one deep trench (ideally through the entire topsoil), then install one of these barriers before backfilling: Galvanized metal roofing. Fold the top over to avoid a dangerous sharp edge. A double layer of HDPE plastic, Overlap sections of barrier by at least 12\" (30 cm) so roots can't slip through. sometimes available free from feed stores For best results, buy a commercial root barrier treated with herbicide. Trifluralin is a common option unlikely to harm nearby plants."

      "title": "Kill suckers with herbicide.",
      "content": "Kill suckers with herbicide. Some trees respond to cut roots or other damage by sending up new suckers from the root system. To kill these selectively, sever the root so the herbicide does not travel to the main tree. Apply an herbicide that contains glyphosate or triclopyr amine carefully to the sucker so it does not spray to nearby plants. [1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Many suckering plants grow aggressively. If you are not willing to kill the main tree, you will need to repeat this treatment or periodically dig up the suckers by hand. If you've cut down the main tree but suckers are still appearing in your yard, your only option may be to apply a broadleaf herbicide. This will kill all vegetation in the area. Repeat each time suckers appear until the roots run out of nutrients."

      "title": "Replace damaged pavement with crushed stone or mulch.",
      "content": "Replace damaged pavement with crushed stone or mulch. It may not be possible to kill large surface roots without killing the whole tree. If that's not an option, you can install a surface the tree cannot break through. Since this does not kill the roots, it will not protect garden areas or sewage pipes. Carefully remove any damaged concrete with minimal damage to roots. Cover the area with geotextile fabric. Leave 6\" (15 cm) of clear ground around the trunk, or 12\" (30 cm) for large trees. [2] X Research source Cover with 3–4\" (7.5–10 cm) of crusher run (a type of crushed stone aggregate) or 6–8\" (15–20 cm) of coarse mulch. Mulch is less effective, and may wash away in rain. Edge the material with stones to minimize shifting."

      "content": "Pour copper sulfate or rock salt down your toilet. This is the easiest treatment, but it risks killing the whole tree or surrounding plants. Flush either product down your toilet bowl (never into a sink or shower) in ½ lb (¼ kg) increments or less, until you've added 2 lb (0.9 kg). Avoid running water into the pipe for 8–12 hours so the salt has time to kill the roots. [3] X Research source Follow all safety information on the label. Both chemicals can cause major damage to aquatic life. Their use may be regulated by your state or country, especially near water treatment plants. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Treat your pipes with a foaming herbicide.",
      "content": "Treat your pipes with a foaming herbicide. Foaming herbicides expand to fill the pipe and take some time to break down, making them the best option for sewage line root removal. Contact herbicides kill the roots quickly, while systemic herbicides can take a couple weeks but may kill the whole tree. Different foam consistencies are appropriate for different sizes of pipe, so read the label before buying. Some herbicides are toxic to fish or other wildlife. The label should describe the environmental impact, and may include information on how to minimize it. For best results, hire a professional plumber to apply metam-sodium. This is a corrosive chemical that requires training and safety equipment to use."

      "title": "Have a professional clear clogged pipes mechanically.",
      "content": "Have a professional clear clogged pipes mechanically. If roots have clogged a pipe completely, they will block the flow of chemical treatments. Hire a plumber instead to clear the pipe with a Roto Rooter or similar mechanical tool. This also has the advantage of avoiding environmental impacts from herbicide."

      "title": "Repair the pipe.",
      "content": "Repair the pipe. Unless you're willing to repeat this treatment regularly, the cleared pipe will need structural repairs to prevent root regrowth. Installing a lining inside your pipe requires less digging and disruption, but a complete pipe replacement is often cheaper. You may also need to remove or relocate any large trees near the pipe, or the roots will keep growing into the sewer pipe."

      "title": "Research your tree first.",
      "content": "Research your tree first. Some tree species can produce root suckers, growing whole new trunks some distance from the stump. Removing the trunk will not kill the roots, and can even trigger new growth. Avoid this method with these species (not a comprehensive list): Elms, cherries, plums, and lilac trees can regenerate from roots after the trunk is damaged.

      "title": "Cut the tree to a stump.",
      "content": "Cut the tree to a stump. If the tree still needs to be cut down, cut it so about 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) of the trunk is still left above ground. This ensures that you have enough wood to grab onto to pull the trunk out of the ground. Warning: Felling a tree is very dangerous. If you do not have experience and the proper tools, the tree may fall in an unexpected direction. Hire a professional if you have not done this before."

      "content": "Excavate the stump. Dig around the stump using a shovel, mattock, digging bar, or backhoe. Cut through the largest roots with an axe or saw as you reveal them. Clear a radius of about 4 feet (1.2 m) around the tree, or as much as you need to detach the main roots. Before taking a chainsaw to a root, place a board underneath it. This protects the chainsaw from dirt and rocks. Once you've made some progress on the hole, spray the area with a hose or pressure washer to reveal more roots."

      "content": "Winch slowly. Even a hand winch can send a stump flying with lethal force when it bursts out of the ground. Pull in short, slow bursts to avoid this risk. If you are in a truck, alternate forward and reverse movement. Ideally, the stump should pull loose from the ground gradually, and fall gently on its side."

These are dangerous machines, so wear protective glasses and ask the rental agency to train you. Here's the basic process: [8] X Research source Clear away any rocks near the stump that could damage the grinding wheel. Position the wheel a few inches above the stump's front edge. Start spinning the wheel, then lower it slowly about 3 inches (7.5 cm) into the stump. Slowly move the wheel from side to side to cut away wood to a 4 inch (10 cm) depth. Repeat with the next section of stump until it is level. Repeat the process until the whole stump is ground at least 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) below the ground, or deeper if you want to plant a new tree.

Also, this may not work in springtime on trees that produce a lot of sap, since that tends to push out the herbicide. If neither of these are issues, apply herbicide with the \"hack and squirt\" system: [20] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Chop downward into the trunk at a 45º angle to make a wedge. Insert a spray bottle with a narrow nozzle directly into the wedge. Squeeze in a little herbicide, trying not to get any outside of the cut. Consult your herbicide label to find out how many cuts to make, and how much herbicide to place in each cut (usually 1 mL or less). Some extra-aggressive trees require girdling instead, with herbicide applied to the freshly exposed wood. [21] X Research source"
