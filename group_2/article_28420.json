      "content": "Use a natural lip scrub. The first step to getting red lips is getting rid of dry, flaky skin that builds up and hides their natural color. Sloughing away the dead skin brightens your lips, brings out their inner red color and prepares them to take on a stain. Here's how to make and use your own scrub: Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon brown sugar. Scrub the mixture into your lips in a circular motion. Rinse the mixture away with warm water. Repeat as necessary."
