[1] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Open up a passion fruit and remove at least 6 seed sacs from the inside, then place them in a colander. Under running water, rub the sacs with your fingers until they burst, and rinse away the residue. Passion fruits are somewhat difficult to grow from seeds, and can take years to flower and produce fruit this way, so prepare to be patient! Opt to grow your passion fruit from cuttings or seedlings for easier, faster results. To increase your chances of success, soak your seeds overnight in a bowl of warm water before planting them. If you’re not planting the seeds right away, place the seeds in an airtight plastic bag. Place the bag in the fridge, and plant them within 6 months."

After another week or 2, once these shoots have at least 2 leaf nodes (or joints on the stem where leaves emerge), it’s time to transplant them to their permanent home!

In the spring, while the vines are in active growth, choose a mature, healthy passion fruit plant to take a cutting from—your own, a friend’s, or a wild plant will work. With a pair of garden clippers, snip off a portion of the vine that contains at least 2 leaf nodes (the joints on the vine from which leaves emerge), and which is at least 6 cm (2.4 in) long.

Survey your garden for a place that receives full sun for 6-8 hours a day, then set aside at least 6–8 sq ft (0.56–0.74 m 2 ) to plant the passion fruit. [9] X Research source Then, build a trellis (or install a store-bought one) that spans 1 edge of the plot. Ideally, construct a trellis about 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) tall, to give the plant plenty of room to climb. Alternatively, choose a plot near a wire fence or a porch railing which the vines can climb. This can help make your vine more of a natural fixture in your garden. Go ahead and pull any weeds in the plot. Passion fruit vines need their own space, and don’t play well with competition."

Dig up the soil in your plot, about 1 ft (0.30 m) deep, and replace it with a sandy, loamy soil mixed with compost. Or, add this mix to a raised garden bed to promote soil drainage. Then, test and adjust the pH of the soil with a soil pH kit. [10] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Alternatively, add organic rotten manure, leaf mold, or other green plant waste instead of compost. If the soil is especially dense, lighten it by mixing in handfuls of coarse sand. How much to mix depends on the size of your plot, so refer to the instructions on the bag of garden sand. Add garden lime or wood ash (according to the instructions on the packaging) to raise the pH of the soil. Add sulfur or compost to lower the pH."

Make each hole about twice as wide as the current width of your plant, and dig at least as deep as the container your seedling currently rests in. Remove the seedling from the pot, place it in the hole, then cover the roots with soil. [11] X Research source To remove the seedling from its pot, set the pot on its side and gently grip the base of the stalk. Then, slide the seedling out of the pot. Handle the roots as little as possible during the transfer. The roots are very sensitive, and if you damage them during the process, you could destroy the plant."

Spread pellet chicken manure or another organic, slow-release fertilizer around the base of the plant to give it a boost of nutrients as it establishes itself. [12] X Research source Opt for a 5-10-10 fertilizer, which is low in nitrogen. Also spread an organic mulch, like straw or wood chips, around the base of the plant to help the roots retain moisture. Gently push or dig some of the fertilizer into the top layer of the soil around the plant's base to let all of the roots access it. Water the newly planted seedling just enough to moisten the soil, but not so much that pools or bubbles form."

      "content": "Keep the soil moist, but don’t flood the plant’s roots. Passion fruit vines need about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water per week, or about 6 US gal (23 L). [13] X Research source Use a watering can or garden hose to gently water the seedlings about once a week, or any time the soil looks dry. Water until the soil is very damp, but do not allow muddy puddles to form, which is a sign that you’ve provided more water than the soil can absorb and drain. Planting in raised beds helps promote soil drainage, keeping your passion fruit’s roots well-aerated and preventing diseases like root rot."

Only feed the plants during the spring and summer; they don’t need the nutrients in the winter.

      "content": "Weed as needed, and prune the vines in late February or March. Passion fruit vines can be easily crowded out, so pull any weeds you see immediately. Around March, snip away any excess shoots so the vines are well-spread and don’t have overlapping leaves from other tendrils. Throughout the year, cut away any dead or discolored (yellow or brown) shoots to the main vine to prevent diseases. [16] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Use shears to cut away branches that are below 2 feet (61 cm). Doing so clears away weak, old growth while also improving air circulation around the bottom of the plant. Make sure not to snip away the main, largest branch, which is the main source of growth for the vine."

[19] X Research source If you do see pests like aphids, mites, or mealybugs, apply food-safe or organic pesticides according to the instructions on the packaging to avoid damaging the plant and to keep the fruits safe for consumption. Discourage aphids by sprinkling liquid pesticide or red pepper flakes around the base of the plant. Hand-remove any large insect larvae or beetles. Wear gloves, and dispose of the insects in a plastic trash bag. Release beneficial garden nematodes into the soil to protect against harmful varieties of nematodes. The Gulf fritillary butterfly likes to snack on passionfruit. These start out as orange, spiky caterpillars who eat the leaves. Try to let these guys be if you can. They’re beneficial insects."
