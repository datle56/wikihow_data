      "content": "Remove 5 to 7 Mentos from the roll. The more Mentos you use, the better the explosion; however, you don't want to the Mentos to dip too far into the Diet Coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle."

      "content": "Cut a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) strip of masking tape and roll it around your finger, sticky side out. You'll use this piece to attach the Mentos to the bottle cap, so ensure that it's small enough to fit inside the cap."

    {
      "title": "Attach the rolled tape to the top of the Mentos.",
      "content": "Attach the rolled tape to the top of the Mentos. Take the 3-inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you've just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of Mentos. This will create a ”loaded” Mentos cartridge that you can place inside the Diet Coke bottle."

      "content": "Fasten the Mentos cartridge into the bottom of the Diet Coke cap. Put the cap on a flat surface, with its inside facing upwards. Place the Mentos cartridge, sticky-tape side up, into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there. Be careful not to press too hard, as you don't want any Mentos falling out of the cartridge!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Double tape the cartridge to the cap.",
      "content": "Double tape the cartridge to the cap. This step is optional. If you're worried about the Mentos prematurely falling into the Diet Coke, you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll, including the cap."

      "title": "Twist the “loaded” cap on to the Diet Coke bottle.",
      "content": "Twist the “loaded” cap on to the Diet Coke bottle. The cap should be securely on the bottle, but not closed too tightly. If it's closed too tightly, the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle, and the rocket won't work. As you twist the cap on, you'll also want to make sure that the Mentos do not touch the Diet Coke yet. If it seems like the Mentos will touch the Diet Coke, you can either dump a small amount of Diet Coke out before screwing the cap on; redo your Mentos cartridge to contain fewer Mentos; or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible."

      "title": "“Launch” it!",
      "content": "“Launch” it! There are several different methods for “launching” your rocket: A popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground (preferably hard ground, like cement). This is the best method if you're worried about getting hit by the rocket, as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. Another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground, the ground knocks off its cap. Yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90-degree angle, cap-first, on to the ground."

      "content": "Try again. You can skip this step if your rocket works right away. If the rocket doesn't go off when you throw it, pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. Just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far, otherwise you're likely to end up covered in Diet Coke."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enjoy the show.",
      "content": "Enjoy the show. When the bottle hits the ground, its cap should fly off and the Diet Coke-Mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle's opening. This should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. Depending on how you throw it, the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds. Side-angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. Vertical launches (in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground) tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. If the bottle is still full of Diet Coke and Mentos but it's stopped moving on the ground, you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it."

    {
      "title": "Clean up after yourself.",
      "content": "Clean up after yourself. Once you've finished your experiment, don't forget to pick up after yourself. Clean up any bits of tape or Mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. And pick up the rocket! Clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin (or bring it to the bottle depot)."

As with the original rocket recipe, stick the Mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug, fasten the lid, shake the container to release the Mentos into the Diet Coke, then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard."

      "content": "Buy 1 2-liter bottle of Diet Coke. For the purposes of this example, we're using Diet Coke, but you can actually use any type of diet soda (as long as it contains aspartame). Warm soda causes better explosions, so avoid using cold/refrigerated soda. For best results, purchase room-temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot (not boiling) water for a few hours before using it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy 1 package of Mentos.",
      "content": "Buy 1 package of Mentos. Experiments have shown that while the original Mint Mentos will give you a longer explosion, Mentos Fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion. Other experiments have shown that Mint Mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide's escape from the bottle, making for a more intense explosion. As the rocket is more of a fast-acting affair, you might want to go for Mint Mentos. If you have the time and money to do so, why not try one bottle with Mint Mentos and one with Fruit Mentos, and then compare the results?"

      "title": "Buy protective goggles.",
      "content": "Buy protective goggles. Wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda-Mentos concoction, but also from any other debris (for example, the lid) that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes."

      "content": "Find a wide-open space to build the rocket in. Your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy; make sure it has enough room to do that. If you're in a parking lot, make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50-foot radius, if not more. If there's a field or empty lot nearby, go there to make your rocket. You don't want to risk doing damage to anyone's car or home, as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair."
