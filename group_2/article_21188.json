[1] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. The curlier or kinkier your hair is, the more prone it will be to dryness and breakage, so these types of hair need extra TLC to grow long and healthy. Examine your hair to determine if it is: Type 1: This type of hair is naturally straight, without waves, curls, or kinks. Type 2: This kind of hair is wavy, between curly and straight in texture. Hair with the loosest waves is called Type 2A, with 2B and 2C having denser waves. Type 3: This type of hair is curly, with s-shaped or spiral strands. 3A hair has the biggest curls, while 3C hair is tightly spiraled and close to kinky. Type 4: This kind of hair is kinky, with very tightly-coiled strands and a fluffy texture. The curls in Type 4A hair are S-shaped, while the curls in Types 4B-C are z-shaped. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash your hair no more than once a week. Even if you’re using gentle shampoo, too much washing can strip the oils out of your hair and leave it dry and brittle. Try washing your hair once a week, and if that is too drying, space out your washes even more. If your hair gets greasy between washes, you can soak up excess oils with a dry shampoo. [3] X Research source If you work out regularly, you may feel tempted to wash your hair after every gym session. This can be damaging, however. Instead of using shampoo each time you exercise, wash your hair with conditioner (co-wash) and then add a little leave-in conditioner to lock in moisture. [4] X Research source"

Sulfates can dry out your hair, making it more prone to frizz and breakage. [6] X Research source Look for shampoos and conditioners that say “sulfate-free” on the bottle, or check the ingredients and make sure that “sodium lauryl sulfate,” “sodium laureth sulfate,” or “ammonium laureth sulfate” do not appear in the list. Using shampoo with sulfates once in a while can actually be beneficial, since it helps cleanse your hair and scalp of built-up oils and dirt that sulfate-free shampoos can’t break up. There are also some sulfate-free clarifying shampoos formulated for African American hair available. Use a clarifying or sulfate shampoo once a month to deep-clean your hair and remove stubborn buildup.

Every time you wash your hair, the shampoo strips away natural oils and moisture. Conditioner is essential for keeping your hair moisturized and healthy. Look for conditioners that are formulated for African American hair or for hair that is curly, dry, or prone to breakage. Most conditioners work best if they sit on your hair for at least a few minutes before you rinse them out. Follow the instructions on the bottle to figure out how long to leave your conditioner in. Rinse your hair with cool water after conditioning to seal up the cuticle and lock in moisture. You can also use conditioner by itself to wash your hair between shampoos (co-washing). This is especially common for those who have natural hair."

Deep conditioner penetrates further into the hair shaft than regular conditioner, helping to repair damage caused by regular washing, styling, and exposure to the elements. Apply deep conditioner to damp hair after washing, and follow the directions on the bottle to determine how long to leave it on. If you wash your hair frequently, you may need to deep condition more often (up to once a week). Deep conditioners containing ingredients like argan oil and keratin can provide extra protection and nourishment for your hair. Protein masks are also great for repairing and conditioning stressed or damaged hair. You can also make your own deep conditioner with mayonnaise. Rub it into your locks and leave it in for 15 minutes. Rinse with your regular shampoo and conditioner. Repeat this every 1-2 weeks for ultra-soft curls."

If every day is too much for your hair, try decreasing applications to every other day. Applying your moisturizer before bed instead of in the morning can help prevent your hair from feeling weighted down during the day. Start with a water-based moisturizer, then seal it in with an oil or butter. Finally, lock it all in and set your style with a moisturizing hair cream. Look for moisturizers containing ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, or grapeseed oil."

Because it takes such a long time for your hair’s natural oils to travel to the ends of the strands, it’s important to infuse your hair with oils to supplement those your scalp already creates. Massage the oil into your scalp to moisturize and promote healthy hair growth. [11] X Research source Avoid petroleum and mineral oils, and instead select plant-based oils. Castor oil (or Jamaican black castor oil) has been used for hundreds of years to increase the softness of hair and aid in faster growth. It may also help encourage thicker growth if you have thinning hair. Lavender oil is great for promoting hair growth, and can also combat hair loss. Argan oil penetrates the hair shaft to nourish your hair, add moisture, and prevent frizz and breakage. [12] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019."

Moisturize your hair and then carefully remove any tangles with a wide-toothed comb, boar bristle brush, or your fingers. Finger-combing is the gentlest method of detangling hair, so this may be the best option if you have fragile 4B or 4C hair. Always start detangling at the ends of your hair, and work your way up toward the roots. Try detangling your hair once a week, and adjust how frequently you detangle depending on your hair’s needs."

High temperatures make your hair dry and brittle, increasing the chances of breakage. If you must use heat on your hair, try to limit it to once a week at most. Allow your hair to air dry whenever possible. The heat from blow dryers can be especially damaging, as it is combined with a strong blast of air—another culprit for hair damage. Keep use of flat irons and curling irons to a minimum. Because these can heat upwards of 400 °F (204 °C), you are literally cooking your hair. If you have to use heat, apply a heat-protectant product before heating your hair. Never use a flat iron or curling iron on wet hair. Doing so can cause serious damage to your hair."
