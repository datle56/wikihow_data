Account for your arches. You'll need more or less support, depending on how high of an arch you have. The shape of the shoe itself will also need to change. Go to your local major shoe store to get help with this. Check your heel movement. Some people roll their heels, either out or in, as they run. This will also affect the type of shoe you need. Check some old shoes for wear to get an idea of how you move. Tie your shoes correctly. Did you know you can lace your shoes differently to make them fit better? There are methods to create more space in the toes, or support high arches. Even ways to keep heels in place if they tend to slip! [1] X Research source Get the right size! Correct fit is key in making sure your shoes are as comfortable as possible. [2] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021.

You'll also want clothes in shapes and materials that breathe well. [3] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. This can help reduce rashes and other skin problems. Factor in weather and temperature. You'll probably need more than one jogging outfit (depending on where you live). Have clothes that are warmer and provide more coverage for if you go running in the winter, for example. Don't forget about pockets. You'll want pockets in order to carry important things like your ID and your keys. Alternatively, though, you can use other things like your shoes or an armband. You'll also want to wear the right kind of socks. Look for socks specifically marketed for runners. This can help prevent blisters."

      "content": "Consider some entertainment. Get an mp3 player. Smaller players, like an iPod nano, are great for using while you're jogging. There are even several wristbands that they can be fit into. Find something to listen to. Music is the obvious choice, but you could even get something like a podcast or audio book too. This can be a great way to stay in touch with the news or fit in some \"reading\" if you're low on time. Choose songs that are dynamic; they will give you energy while you jog. Enjoy the quiet if you prefer: you don't have to listen to anything if you don't want to! Stay safe! If you do choose to listen to something, try to only have one ear bud in. Hearing an approaching car or other sign of trouble is crucial to your safety."

      "content": "Factor in safety. Be careful where you run. Choose locations that are safe, with lots of people around and as few cars as possible. Choose a good time to run. Running at night, or in the morning before dawn, is much more dangerous than running during the day. You run the risk of getting hit by a driver that can't see you or someone taking advantage of you when fewer people are around. Also, you could trip on an irregular surface and suffer a serious ankle sprain. Stay visible to drivers. If you do decide to run near a road, stay visible by wearing bright, reflective clothing. You can also get safety devices, like a blinking LED, to get even more attention. Jog with a buddy. Whether jogging with a person or even just a dog, this is significantly safer. This will help keep you safe from people who may want to take advantage of you!"

      "content": "Decide how far you want to jog. Do a test run. Do a basic jog and see how it makes you feel. Test how far you can get before you feel super gross. By setting realistic expectations, you'll be much more likely to succeed. Don't forget about getting back to your starting point. Factor in how long it takes you to run and leave in time to get back to your starting point. Yes, you may be able to get to that coffee shop down the road, but what about getting back? Slowly increase your distance over time. [4] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Remember, you'll be able to jog a greater distance once you're in better shape and can move farther, faster. Work your way up to it. Increasing will also give your body a better workout, so keep a longer route in mind. Try jogging to destination that is a reward for your efforts, such as a coffee shop or a restaurant, then return home by public transportation or taxi. This will give you motivation."

Some websites even have a social aspect, allowing you and other runners in your area to share and compare routes. Account for terrain. Changes in road types, terrain changes, and elevation changes can be a bigger hurdle than you give them credit for. Try to avoid things like having a steep hill right at the end of your run. You'll increase the chances of hurting yourself. Test it out. Once you think you've got a good route in mind, test it out before making up your mind. You can even choose a few different routes to cycle between during the week."

Don't let it become an obsession. This isn't healthy. There is such a thing as too skinny and working out too much can leave you injured. You also shouldn't push yourself too hard in a given workout.

Have a small meal before jogging: something which will give you energy and won't weigh you down. A banana and a couple of sticks of jerky are a good option, as both will help your body fill up on the nutrients lost through exercise. Don't forget to hydrate yourself too!"

Jogging is actually only one of a number of basic exercises. There are others which can be more efficient or are easier to fit into your day. If you're jogging mainly to lose weight, recognize that a combination of diet and simply being more active during the day (take the stairs, not the elevator) can be enough for many people."

You can say that you want to lose a certain amount of weight. You can decide to jog a certain distance. You can make it a goal to be fit enough to run a local marathon. There are all sorts of goals. Another good goal would be building up the ability to run a local race in a year's time. You can race for charity or even just for fun!"
