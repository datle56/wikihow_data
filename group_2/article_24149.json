Remove the handles, overflow drain cover, and the drain cover on the bottom of the tub. If you have a showerhead, remove that as well. [2] X Research source You may need to pry off a plastic cover to gain access to the screws. You may be able to reuse some of these accessories, so keep them if you don’t want to buy new ones."

      "content": "Remove the existing tub surround or tiles. You need to expose the studs in the wall in order to install a new bathtub, so you must remove the existing surround and the drywall behind it. Using a utility knife, cut through the drywall around the outside edge of the entire surround. Then, use a pry bar to pry the drywall and surround or tiles out of place. Be careful not to damage any pipes or wires! [3] X Research source Be sure to wear safety gear, including goggles and a dust mask, throughout this process. Work from the top of the surround down to the bottom."

[5] X Research source If your tub is acrylic or fiberglass, cut it into pieces with a jigsaw to make the removal process easier. If you want to try to keep the tub in one piece, use a jigsaw to cut away the tub flange that’s nailed to the studs, then tip up the tub and pull it out. [6] X Research source You may need to slice through the caulk that connects the tub and floor before removing the tub. Use a utility knife to do so. As you do this, check and see if you need to replace any damaged parts."

      "content": "Select a tub that will fit in the designated space. Measure the length and width of the alcove where you will install the tub. Also, measure the height and width of your bathroom doorway to make sure the tub will fit through the bathroom door! Take your measurements to a home improvement store to guide your purchase. If you’re replacing an old tub, choose a new tub with a similar configuration and make sure the drain and faucets are on the same side and in roughly the same location to make installation easier. Make sure your tub comes with all the faucets, drains, and accessories you will need. Typically, you’ll need a faucet, water handle(s), and the drain, which includes the drain chute, strainer, strainer cover, trip lever, stopper, linkage, and overflow drain cover. If needed, remove any toilets or sinks that might get in the way of the installation."

Measure the height of the lip, or flange, of the tub, then mark that height measurement on the back wall. Use a drill to screw the ledger board to the studs in the wall so that the top of the ledger board is just below the flange when the tub is sitting level in the alcove. A ledger board helps support the weight of the tub and ensures it can be securely attached to the wall."

Wrap the bottom of the strainer (the part of the drain you see on the inside of the bottom of the tub) with plumber’s putty and press it into the tub from the inside. Place a gasket around the strainer from the outside of the bottom of the tub, then screw the strainer to the drain chute, which a long pipe that includes the overflow drain.

The stopper and linkage go inside the pipe to stop or allow the flow of water. The overflow drain will prevent the tub from overflowing if you leave the water running as it directs the water into a drain pipe."
