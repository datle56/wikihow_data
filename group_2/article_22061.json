Take time to focus on your relationship outside of parenthood. On your dates, make sure to talk about something other than the baby. Talk to each other about outside interests. When you're a new parent, it's natural to focus on sleep schedules and breastfeeding, but don't forget that you and your partner are attracted to each other for other reasons."
