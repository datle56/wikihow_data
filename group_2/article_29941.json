This may take a few minutes. [1] X Research source We recommend using an Elmer’s brand glue for your slime, but the type and color is up to you! Get wild and use a liquid glitter glue or a colored glue. If you don’t have colored glue, we’ve got you! You can dye your glue mixture at this stage with a few drops of food coloring."

      "content": "Pour some of the borax solution slowly into your glue mixture. The slime will start to form in large clumps as you mix. When it seems like no more slime is forming, slowly add in more of the borax solution. [3] X Research source Stop adding the borax mixture whenever the slime reaches the consistency you want! For a softer stress ball, add less borax. For a firmer stress ball, add more borax. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the glue mixture and borax solution with your hands. Squish the slime together and fold in more of the borax solution if you need to. Your slime is done whenever you feel like it’s the perfect consistency. [5] X Research source For a clear slime, use clear Elmer’s glue and let the slime sit overnight. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a balloon with slime using a funnel. Wrap a party or water balloon around the end of a funnel, making sure it won’t slide off—you can use some tape to secure it if needed. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a funnel, no worries! You can easily make one with the top of a water bottle. Simply cut around a water bottle about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top. If you used glitter or colored glue to make your slime, we suggest using a clear balloon so you can see the fun!"

      "content": "Squish the slime into the balloon through the funnel. This may take some wiggling. You can use a marker or the back of a pen to help push the slime down into the balloon. Just make sure not to push too hard because you don’t want to puncture the balloon. [8] X Research source Section off the slime to make filling the balloon easier. Add one half and then the next. Hold onto the balloon at the funnel and knead the slime down into the balloon. Add a little more borax solution if your slime is too hard. Simply drip the borax solution into the funnel with the slime."

      "content": "Release any air from the balloon and tie a knot. Push out the extra air by gently squeezing the balloon—the balloon should be suctioned to the slime inside. Secure the balloon as if you were knotting a balloon you just filled with air. You may need to push some of the slime away from the balloon’s top to do this. [9] X Research source You can cut off the tip of the knot if you prefer, but this could lead to potential leaks if the knot slips in the future."

Secure the fishnet in place by twisting the end of the fabric around the balloon end or wrapping and knotting a piece of string around the fishnet and balloon knot. [10] X Research source Adding a fishnet will make lots of bubbles of slime pop up around the balloon when you squeeze. Now all that’s left to do is squeeze and have fun with your new DIY stress ball!"
