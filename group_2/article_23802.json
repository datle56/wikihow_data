      "content": "Adopt an irregular sleep cycle. Research has shown that there is a connection between irregular sleeping patterns and the likeliness of experiencing sleep paralysis, as well as a potential genetic influence. [2] X Research source People who work irregular shifts and have unusual and disrupted sleeping patterns are more prone to sleep paralysis. Generally sleep paralysis is more common among those who sleep less and are more sleep deprived. Remember that adults should aim for between six and nine hours of sleep a night, and frequently forcing yourself to have less than this is not advisable. Regular sleep deprivation increases your risk of serious health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. You will also find it harder to concentrate and will have reduced alertness which can make you more prone to accidents."

      "content": "Break up your sleep cycle with naps. There are no guaranteed ways to induce sleep paralysis. Although it is fairly common, the exact causes of the phenomenon are still not fully understood. [3] X Research source Disrupting your sleeping cycle with shorter sleeping periods at night and naps in the evening is one way to do this. It is not precise, but is reported as one way to upset your regular sleep cycle and potentially induce sleep paralysis. Get out of bed earlier than usual, before carrying out your daily activities as you would normally. You should be generally active during the day even if you feel tired. Then have a short nap in the evening, for not more than two hours, some time between 7pm and 10pm. After the nap stay awake and be active for at least another hour before heading back to bed.

      "content": "Lie in bed and relax. If you are trying to induce sleep paralysis it's important to lie down in bed in a comfortable position. Lying on your back when you sleep is one commonly reported factor that may help induce sleep paralysis. It is not really known what the causative connection is, but it is thought that a significant number of people who experience sleep paralysis sleep in a supine position. [5] X Research source Lie as still as you can and try to repeat a single word in your head, like a mantra. This will help you relax and clear your mind. Repeat the word again and again, and begin to imagine that somebody is speaking the word to you. Try not to become distracted if you sense lights and other sensations. Concentrate on the word, stay relaxed, and you may feel yourself moving towards the threshold of sleep paralysis. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wake yourself up in the night. An alternative way to disrupt your sleep and potentially help induce sleep paralysis is to wake yourself up during the night. Set your alarm for between four and six hours after you fall asleep, and then keep yourself awake for a short period of 15 minutes to half an hour. [7] X Research source Get your mind active by reading for this period. Then as you go back to bed, close your eyes but maintain awareness. To do this, repeat a mantra or focus on a particular point in your visual field. You may then slip into sleep paralysis as you return to sleep but your mind stays aware. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what it is. During sleep paralysis you will feel conscious and aware but unable to move your body or speak. This phenomenon could last just a few seconds, few minutes or in very rare cases longer. It is not unusual for people experiencing sleep paralysis to feel pressure on the chest or a choking sensation, as if something were pushing down on their chest. [9] X Research source The paralysis does not cause you any harm, but it can be a frightening situation, especially if you have not experienced it before. Some people will experience it a few times in their life, others more frequently, and some not at all. Typically, it is more frequently observed in teenagers and young adults, although it can affect anybody and is not thought to be influenced by gender.
