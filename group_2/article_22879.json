You will need to download the appropriate server software for whichever version of Minecraft you are running. To determine which version of Minecraft you are running, launch Minecraft and check the title screen. If it says \"Java Edition\" below \"Minecraft\" on the title screen, you are running Minecraft: Java Edition. If the title screen just says \"Minecraft\" with no text below it, you are running the Bedrock Edition. The server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is still in it's Alpha testing phase. It may be more buggy than Minecraft: Java Edition. Only players on PC and Mac can connect to Minecraft: Java Edition servers. Players on Windows 10, Android, iPhone, iPad, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PS4 can connect to a Minecraft Bedrock server. Alternatively, you can sign up for a free Minecraft server at Minehut.com. You can also subscribe to Minecraft Realms to host a permanent server."

The following are the recommended computer specs needed to host a Minecraft server, depending on the number of players connected: [1] X Research source 1-3 Players: 2 GB RAM, Intel Core-Based CPUs or AMD K8-Based CPUs and better, 10 GB empty hard drive space. 3-5 Players: 3 GB RAM, Intel Core-Based CPUs or AMD K8-Based CPUs and better, 18 GB empty hard drive space. 5-7 Players: 6 GB RAM, Intel Nehalem-Based CPUs or AMD K10-Based CPUs and better, 25 GB empty hard drive space. 8+ Players: 8 GB RAM, Intel Nehalem-Based CPUs or AMD K10-Based CPUs at 3.6GHz or higher, 35 GB empty hard drive space with high read/write speeds recommended."
