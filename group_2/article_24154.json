    {
      "title": "Check the kit.",
      "content": "Check the kit. Check the contents of your Brita filtration system kit before proceeding. You'll need to make sure that all necessary pieces have been included. The base system is the most crucial element. Your kit should also contain a replaceable filter cartridge and a packet with two sets of faucet adapters and washers. The adapters and washers may not be needed, but they should be in your kit nonetheless."

    {
      "title": "Remove the aerator.",
      "content": "Remove the aerator. Grab the aerator portion of your faucet between your thumb and first two forefingers. Twist clockwise to unscrew it. If there are any rubber washers beneath the aerator when you remove it, peel those off, as well. If you have difficulty removing the aerator with your bare hands, grab it with a dry, coarse towel and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean off any buildup.",
      "content": "Clean off any buildup. Check the faucet for any signs of limescale or rust. Clean off any buildup you spot before proceeding. The safest way to remove lime scale or to remove rust from a kitchen sink is with vinegar. Fill a plastic bag with white vinegar. Place the bag over the faucet, holding it in place with a rubber band. Make sure that the buildup is submerged in the vinegar. Let the faucet sit in vinegar for one hour. Remove the plastic bag and run warn water through the faucet. Scrub away any additional buildup with a recycled toothbrush or sponge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out if you'll need an adapter.",
      "content": "Figure out if you'll need an adapter. Look at the threads on your faucet. Faucets with threads on the outside do not usually need an adapter, but faucets with threads on the inside do need an adapter. When dealing with a faucet that has interior threads, use one of the adapters that come with your kit. If you do not need to use an adapter, skip the \"Attaching an Adapter\" section and begin directly with the \"Attaching the Brita Filtration System\" system. If your faucet has exterior threads but the filtration system does not fit on it directly, you will need to call customer service. Similarly, if none of the adapters fit on your faucet even though it has interior threads, call customer services. The company should send you a special set of adapters free of charge. See the “Tips” section for information on how to get in touch with customer support."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose an appropriate adapter set.",
      "content": "Choose an appropriate adapter set. There are two different adapter and washer sets provided with your kit. Examine your faucet and examine both adapters to determine which adapter should be used. You should be able to determine which adapter is correct by comparing the size of the adapter to the size of your faucet. If the first adapter you try does not work, however, try the second adapter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the washer in the adapter.",
      "content": "Place the washer in the adapter. Sit the appropriate washer into the recessed end of the adapter. Gently push the washer into the adapter using your index finger. It should fit snugly into the recessed portion of the adapter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the adapter onto the faucet.",
      "content": "Twist the adapter onto the faucet. Place the adapter beneath your faucet, washer-end up. Align the threads of the adapter with the threads of the faucet, then twist in a counterclockwise direction to tighten the adapter onto the end of the faucet. Continue twisting until the adapter feels snug and cannot be moved any further. You should be able to twist the adapter onto your faucet by hand. If you cannot adequately tighten the adapter by hand, place a coin into the notch at the bottom of the adapter and use the extra leverage to help twist the adapter in place. Do not use pliers to attach the adapter since doing so may cause damage to the threading."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position the base system beneath the faucet.",
      "content": "Position the base system beneath the faucet. Hold the base system beneath the faucet with the filter cup portion sitting to the left side of the faucet. This means that the Filter Replacement Indicator should be facing you. Note that these instructions are the same regardless of whether or not you used an adapter. If you used an adapter, the filtration system will be mounted to the adapter instead of the faucet itself, but the steps are otherwise identical."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist on the mounting collar.",
      "content": "Twist on the mounting collar. Hold the base system steady with one hand. Use your other hand to rotate the mounting collar at the top of the base system, twisting it onto the faucet or adapter until it feels snug. Tighten the mounting collar by hand. Do not use pliers since doing so could damage the threading. If you have trouble twisting the mounting collar in place, rotate the body of the base system back and forth while tightening the mounting collar. This may allow you to tighten the collar further. The mounting collar should be snug, but avoid over-tightening it since doing so could cause damage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the filter cartridge into the filter cup.",
      "content": "Insert the filter cartridge into the filter cup. Hold the filter cartridge over the filter cup on the base system. Push the cartridge down until it clicks into place. You should support the bottom of the base system with one hand as you insert the cartridge with your other hand. The insert groove near the bottom of the cartridge should line up with the filter replacement indicator and the front of the base system. Do not force the cartridge into the filter cup. If it does not glide into the cup smoothly, reposition it and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the cartridge.",
      "content": "Check the cartridge. Tug on the cartridge, gently pulling it up, to verify that it has been engaged in the system. Once the filter cartridge has been engaged, the filter replacement indicator should reset itself and turn on. You should see a green flashing light."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flush out the new cartridge.",
      "content": "Flush out the new cartridge. Move the filter handle toward you to activate the filtered water setting. Turn on your faucet and run cool water through it for five minutes. Only use cold to warm water. Do not use hot water. Flushing out the cartridge removes excess carbon dust and activates the filter. Do not be alarmed if you see carbon dust appear; this is normal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move the handle to change the filtration setting.",
      "content": "Move the handle to change the filtration setting. Adjust the handle on the base filtration system to activate and deactivate the filter. All Brita filtration systems have a basic filtered water setting. To activate it, move the switch to the setting labeled with the \"Brita\" symbol. Only use water that comes directly from the filter port when the system is in this setting. All systems also have a setting that allows you to access a stream of unfiltered water. Activate this setting by moving the switch to the single water drop icon. System Model FF-100 also has a setting that allows you to access a spray of unfiltered water. Access this setting by moving the handle to the rear position labeled by three water droplets."

    {
      "title": "Monitor the indicator.",
      "content": "Monitor the indicator. The filter replacement indicator will let you know when your filter cartridge needs to be replaced. This indicator sits at the front of the base system. The exact amount of time a filter cartridge lasts will depend on the system model you have. Model OPFF-100 filters last for 94 gallons (360 L). Model SAFF-100 filters last for 100 gallons (378 L). Model FF-100 filters last for 100 gallons (378 L) or four months, depending on which comes first. When your filter is in working condition, a green light will appear. A flashing amber light or mixed green and red light indicates that your filter has two weeks 20 gallons (75.7 L) (75 L) left before it needs to be changed. A red light indicates that your filter needs to be changed immediately."

    {
      "title": "Change the filter cartridge as needed.",
      "content": "Change the filter cartridge as needed. When the filter replacement indicator tells you that you need to change the filter cartridge, do so by lifting the old cartridge out and inserting a fresh cartridge in its place. With the water turned off, press the filter cartridge release button located near the back of the filter cup. While this button is depressed, simply lift the cartridge up to remove it. Insert a new cartridge following the same procedure used to insert your first cartridge."
