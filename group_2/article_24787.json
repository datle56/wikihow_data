      "content": "Cover exposed fresh ginger with aluminum foil. If you haven’t cut into your ginger yet, then you can store it as-is on the counter or in your pantry. However, once you cut a piece off, you’ll need to cover up the exposed inside area in order to keep your ginger as fresh as possible. Simply tear off a small piece of aluminum foil and wrap it around the exposed area. Then, put it back onto your countertop or in your pantry until you need to cut off another piece.

      "content": "Keep your fresh ginger in the pantry for up to 1 week. If you plan on using all of your ginger within the week, it will stay fresh and flavorful if kept in the pantry. However, if you store it for longer, it may no longer taste good or be safe to consume. [2] X Research source If you’re unsure, look at the ginger. Softness and moistness are the first major signs that indicate that your ginger is going bad, and it may begin to get moldy and inedible soon after this point. You can also ferment fresh ginger so it stays good and helps with digestion. To do that, peel it and slice it into thin slices. Pound it lightly to release some of the juices and pack it down into a quart-size mason jar, leaving at least an inch of space at the top. Gently heat 1 cup of filtered water with 2 tablespoons of sea salt—heat the water just enough to dissolve the salt — and pour it into the mason jar. Cover the jar tightly with the lid and keep it in a dark, room temperature environment for 3 days. Then, it’s ready to eat! Just a small amount with meals is plenty."

If you want to store your ginger at room temperature but you also want it to stay flavorful and safe to eat for a long time, buy it in these forms and keep it in the pantry. While ginger isn’t necessarily fresh in these forms, it should retain its flavor well for 2-3 years. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Submerge peeled ginger in a jar of vodka for up to 2 months. To keep ginger fresh in the refrigerator for the longest time possible, use a paring knife or a spoon to peel it and then put it into a glass jar. Fill the jar to the top with vodka and screw the lid on tight. Keep the ginger in the refrigerator for as long as 2 months. [4] X Research source When you want to use your ginger, unscrew the jar lid, pull the ginger out, and pat it dry before you slice off a piece. Then, put the remaining ginger back into the jar and close the lid. If you’re old enough to drink alcohol, you can also use the vodka in the jar to make a cocktail after you’ve finished eating the ginger."
