      "content": "Choose tension curtain rods if you want something easy to install. Tension curtain rods are straight curtain rods that go inside of window frames as opposed to above them. The ends of the rod will push against the sides of the window frame so the rod stays in place. [1] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 June 2021. Tension rods are cheaper than other curtain rods, and they don’t require any drilling to install them. [2] X Research source If your bay window has 3 window frames in it, you would need 3 tension rods. If you use tension curtain rods, you won’t need curtain brackets. Tension rods come in different size ranges, like 40–60 inches (100–150 cm). Measure the width of your window frames and make sure the width falls within the range of the tension rods you buy."

      "content": "Buy a bay window curtain rod if you want to use 1 long curtain rod. Bay window curtain rods are rods designed specifically for bay windows. They’re made up of 1 long rod that has bends in it so it fits the shape of a bay window. Bay window curtain rods are convenient because of how simple they are, but they only work if your bay window has 3 sections. If your bay window has more than 3 sections, you’ll need to get a different kind of rod. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Alternatively you can use a metal curtain track that will bend around the window. This will be compatible with curtains with heading tapes. They are simple to bend around the contour of the bay window. You can adjust the size of a bay window curtain rod so it fits your bay window."

      "title": "Get multiple straight curtain rods if your bay window has more than 3 sections.",
      "content": "Get multiple straight curtain rods if your bay window has more than 3 sections. Straight curtain rods are regular curtain rods that go in brackets above windows. If your bay window has more than 3 sections, get 1 straight curtain rod to go over each individual window in your bay window. [4] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 June 2021. [5] X Research source For example, if your bay window has 6 windows, you would need 6 straight curtain rods. Most straight curtain rods have adjustable sizes, but it's still a good idea to measure the width of your windows and choose rods that are close in width."

      "title": "Use single brackets if you want 1 layer of curtains over each window.",
      "content": "Use single brackets if you want 1 layer of curtains over each window. Single brackets are regular, wall-mounted brackets that hold up curtain rods. A pair of single brackets can hold up 1 straight curtain rod. Go with single brackets if you want just 1 layer of curtain panels over the windows in your bay window. [6] X Research source You can use single brackets with straight curtain rods and bay window curtain rods."

      "title": "Use double brackets if you want 2 layers of curtains.",
      "content": "Use double brackets if you want 2 layers of curtains. Double brackets are wall-mounted brackets that have 2 hooks for curtain rods to sit in. With double brackets, you can install 2 rows of curtain rods and have 1 set of curtains in the front and another set behind them. [7] X Research source Double brackets are a good choice if you want to have thicker curtains in the front and thinner curtains in the back. Double brackets will work for straight curtain rods and bay window curtain rods."

      "title": "Choose brackets that can hold and support your curtain rods.",
      "content": "Choose brackets that can hold and support your curtain rods. Measure the diameter of the rods you picked out before you buy brackets. Then, look for brackets that are slightly larger. If you get brackets that are smaller, your curtain rods won't fit in them. Also, if your curtain rods are heavy, choose sturdy brackets with multiple screw holes in them so they can support the weight of the rods. Make sure screws are included with the brackets you buy. If they're not, you'll need to buy them separately."

      "title": "Measure 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) above the window frames.",
      "content": "Measure 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) above the window frames. That’s how high you’ll want to mount the brackets. Hanging your curtains higher than the window frames will make your bay window look bigger. Mark your measurement on both sides of each window frame using a pencil. [8] X Research source Do this whether you're using multiple straight curtain rods or a single bay window curtain rod. Don't worry about this if you're using tension curtain rods. You can install tension rods in your window frames without brackets."

      "content": "Mark where you want to mount each bracket above the window frames. One at a time, hold the brackets up to the wall and mark on the wall where the screw holes on the brackets are. You should have 2 brackets above each window frame in your bay window, with one on each end. Use the height marks you made earlier to make sure all the brackets are the same height.

      "content": "Drill into the marks with a drill bit that’s smaller than the curtain screws. Make the holes deep enough that the screws will go all the way into the wall. Make sure you don’t use a drill bit that’s bigger than the curtain screws or the screws will be loose in the wall."

      "content": "Screw the brackets into the wall with a screwdriver. Hold the brackets up on the wall so the screw holes are lined up with the drill holes you made. Then, tighten the screws into the holes until the brackets are secure against the wall. [10] X Research source If you’re using a heavy curtain rod that came with wall anchors, hammer the wall anchors into the holes before you screw the screws in."

      "title": "Separate your curtain panels into pairs.",
      "content": "Separate your curtain panels into pairs. A panel is just 1 single curtain. It's traditional to use 2 panels per window frame, but you can use 1 panel per frame if you prefer a simpler look. Separating the panels into pairs beforehand will make it easier to keep track of how many you're putting on the curtain rods."

      "title": "Slide the curtain panels onto the curtain rods.",
      "content": "Slide the curtain panels onto the curtain rods. If you’re using straight curtain rods, put a pair of panels on each rod. If you’re using a bay window curtain rod, put 2 panels for each window frame on the rod and adjust the curtains so the bent corners of the rod are exposed. [11] X Research source If you’re using double brackets, put curtains on a second set of straight curtain rods, or on a second bay window curtain rod."

      "title": "Place the curtain rods in the brackets.",
      "content": "Place the curtain rods in the brackets. If you’re using straight curtain rods, hang 1 rod over each window frame, or 2 rods if you’re using double brackets. If you’re using a bay window curtain rod, line up the straight edges of the rod with the sections of your bay window. The bent corners of the rod should line up with the corners in your bay window. [12] X Research source Once the rods are in the brackets, adjust them as needed. To adjust the rods, pull the ends of the rods out to make them longer, or push them in to make them shorter. If you don't have brackets because you're using tension rods, just insert the rods into the tops of your window frames in your bay window. Extend the adjustable ends on the rods until the rods are snug in the frames."
