Keep your hand in between the grille (the head of the microphone) and the base where the antenna is located. This prevents feedback and allows the microphone to enhance your voice. Although you may see some famous musicians holding the microphone by the grille, this technique actually causes feedback issues and wreaks havoc with the sound. [1] X Expert Source Tanisha Hall Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020. To avoid this, never cup the microphone around the grille and always keep your hand around the middle of the mic. Don't hold the microphone near the bottom, especially if there's a wire. You could accidentally unplug the wire with your hand.

Make sure that the center of the grille is directly in front of your mouth. This angle is the best position for your breathing and for expanding your ribs. Never hold the microphone in a vertical position like an ice-cream cone, as this won’t enhance your voice. Each person has a slightly different angle for holding a microphone that works the best for them. Change the angle slightly while you are practicing to find the spot that creates a full, rich sound. If you notice that your breathing sounds too intense through the microphone, try shifting the microphone so the top is more parallel to the floor.

Although it differs from person to person, try to keep the microphone as close as possible to your mouth without actually touching it. Experiment with holding the microphone a few different distances away from your mouth to see what proximity works the best for you. The proximity effect is the idea that the microphone responds differently to your voice depending on the distance from your mouth. The closer you are to the microphone, the more enhanced the lower frequencies will be. Contrastingly, you will lose bass frequencies if you are further away. Move the microphone 1 in (2.5 cm) closer or further away depending on the sound that you are aiming for. If you hold the microphone further than 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from your mouth, it won't pick up your voice. [6] X Expert Source Tanisha Hall Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020."
