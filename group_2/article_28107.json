      "title": "Put on a pair of clean, dry socks.",
      "content": "Put on a pair of clean, dry socks. The cleaner your socks are, the better they will conduct electricity. If your socks are wet or dirty, they will not have as much traction with the floor and may not make static electricity. [1] X Research source Warm socks that just came out of the dryer are best for conducting electricity. While most socks can conduct static electricity, wool socks generally work best."

    {
      "title": "Shuffle lightly across the carpet.",
      "content": "Shuffle lightly across the carpet. Walk quickly while lightly scuffing your feet against the carpet. Avoid sliding your feet or walking with too much pressure, as this can cause the electricity to discharge prematurely and leave no energy for sparks. [2] X Research source Nylon carpets are generally best for conducting electricity, but most carpets can produce static sparks."

    {
      "title": "Touch another person or a metal object.",
      "content": "Touch another person or a metal object. After rubbing your socks against the carpet, reach your hand out and touch a nearby person or a metal object. You can tell whether you've made static electricity by whether you feel a shock or spark travel from yourself to the other person or object. [3] X Research source If you don't feel a static shock, keep scuffing your socks against the carpet and try again. Ask the other person's permission before touching them, as not everyone likes static shock."

      "title": "Avoid touching any electronic items.",
      "content": "Avoid touching any electronic items. Electronic items contain microchips that can malfunction or become permanently destroyed by static electricity. Before touching any electronic items, take off your socks and touch something else to discharge any static electricity. [4] X Research source Even if your electronic device has a protective case, it may still be vulnerable to static shocks."

      "title": "Blow up",
      "content": "Blow up a balloon and tie the end. Pinch the neck of the balloon's opening and hold it against your lips. Take deep breaths in through your nose and cover the sides of your mouth as you exhale into the balloon. You may need to blow hard at first to get the balloon started, but it will become easier to blow it up bigger after that. Once the balloon has expanded to an adequate size, you will need to tie the end of the balloon so that it stays inflated. This can be done most easily by wrapping the end around two fingers (index and middle) of your non-dominant hand. Then slightly separate those two fingers, pull it through that space, and remove your fingers to form a knot. [5] X Research source In this experiment, you have to use a rubber balloon. Metallic balloons will not conduct static electricity when rubbed with wool."

    {
      "title": "Rub your balloon with wool.",
      "content": "Rub your balloon with wool. Hold the balloon in one hand and the wool in the other. Press the wool against the balloon and rub them vigorously against each other for at least 5-10 seconds. [6] X Research source If you don't have any wool handy, you can rub it against your hair or a sweater/sweatshirt instead."

      "title": "Hold the balloon next to an empty soda can to test it.",
      "content": "Hold the balloon next to an empty soda can to test it. Place the can down sideways on a smooth, flat surface, then hold the balloon close to the can without touching it. If the can starts rolling away from the balloon, the balloon is conducting electricity. [7] X Research source You can also test the conduction by holding it near your hair. If strands of your hair lift up and touch the balloon, you've made static electricity. You can also try to get the air-filled balloon to stick to a nearby wall. (This experiment works better in the wintertime and in non-humid climates). You may want to keep track of the surface against which you previously rubbed the balloon, how many times it was rubbed, and how long the balloon stayed against the wall."

    {
      "title": "Discharge the balloon by rubbing it against metal.",
      "content": "Discharge the balloon by rubbing it against metal. Metal is a strong conductor and can remove the charge from your balloon. Just like you did with the wool, rub the metal against the balloon for about 5-10 seconds. Then feel free to repeat the experiment. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut 2 holes in the bottom of a foam cup and push straws through. Push a pencil or skewer through 2 locations in the bottom of a foam cup. The holes should be as far apart from each other as they are from the edge of the cup. Place a plastic straw through each hole so that it hangs halfway outside each one.

Roll 4 small, even balls that are 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 in (1.3 cm) long and wide with your fingers and attach them at equidistant locations on top of the cup's opening with tape. Then, flip the cup upside down and place it in the middle of an aluminum baking pan. [10] X Research source After placing the cup on the pan, the straws should be facing directly upward."

Tape the ends of the thread to hold them in place, then adjust the straws so the aluminum foil hangs down and just touches the edge of the pan.
