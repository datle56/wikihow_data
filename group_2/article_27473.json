      "content": "Cut a semicircle out of lightweight fabric based on your measurements. Use your arm span for the top, straight edge of the semicircle. Use your neck-to-floor measurement for height of the circle (straight edge to curved edge). Use a lightweight fabric with fluid movement, such as organza, lamé, silk, or chiffon. This will create 1 wing. You will need to do this entire section twice in order to create the second wing."

      "title": "Cut a 1⁄4 in (0.64 cm) thick dowel a to quarter of semicircle's length.",
      "content": "Cut a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) thick dowel a to quarter of semicircle's length. Measure the top, straight edge of the semicircle, then divide it by 4. Cut a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) thick dowel to this length. You can use scissors, a utility knife, or a hand saw . If the ends of the dowel are jagged, sand them smooth with sandpaper. Start with a 80- to 120-grit sandpaper, then finish with a 360- to 600-grit."

      "title": "Hem",
      "content": "Hem the edges of your semicircle with a straight stitch. Starting at 1 of the top corners, fold the fabric down by 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm), and place it under the sewing machine's foot. Sew around the curved edge of the semicircle, folding the fabric as you go. Do this step twice to get a clean, hemmed edge. Press the seams when you are done with an iron to make them nice and neat. Use a heat setting appropriate for the fabric that you are working with. In most cases, you will end up using a low-heat or synthetics setting. If you don't own a sewing machine, you can hem the edges with iron-on hem tape or fabric glue."

      "content": "Fold the top edge down 1 in (2.5 cm) to create a pocket for the dowel. For a cleaner finish, fold the top edge down by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) then press it with an iron. Fold it down again by about 1 inch (2.5 cm), then press it flat with an iron again. The will create a pocket for the dowel to slide into."

      "title": "Sew the top, straight edge down with a straight stitch.",
      "content": "Sew the top, straight edge down with a straight stitch. Sew the pocket down as close to the inside folded edge as you can. An 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) seam allowance would be ideal. [1] X Research source If you make the seam allowance too wide, the dowel won't fit into the pocket. If you don't own a sewing machine, you can use fabric glue instead. Don't use iron-on hem tape, or it will make the seam too thick and the pocket too narrow."

Insert the dowel into the pocket, then slide it towards the left edge. Sew the hem to each side of the dowel to trap it inside. [2] X Research source You can try doing this on a sewing machine with a straight stitch, but the dowel may get in the way. Consider sewing just the corner of the wing and leaving the other end open. This will make the dowel easier to remove."

      "title": "Repeat the process for other wing, but slide the dowel to the right.",
      "content": "Repeat the process for other wing, but slide the dowel to the right. Cut another semicircle out of matching fabric. Hem the curved and top edges exactly the same way you hemmed the first wing. When you insert the dowel, slide it towards the right side of the wing instead. Stitch down the hem to either side of the dowel, just like you did for the first wing. When you are done, you should end up with 2 identical wings, 1 with the dowel on the left side, and 1 with the dowel on the right."

This will give you enough room for seam allowances and overlap. For example, if your neck is 12 inches (30 cm), then your new measurement will be 16 inches (41 cm)."

Match the thread color as close as possible to the fabric, and backstitch when you start and finish sewing. Depending on your material, it may not hold creases well. It might be a good idea to secure the fabric with pins as you sew."

Sew 1 piece of hook-side hook-and-loop fastener to 1 end of the collar, and 1 piece of loop-side to the other end of the collar. Use a tailor's chalk to make a mark on dark fabrics, and a tailor's pen to make a mark on light fabrics. The hook-and-loop fastener should be a little narrower than the collar, about 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm). The length of the hook-and-loop fastener pieces should match the overlap length. If your collar overlapped by 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm), make the hook-and-loop fastener pieces 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) long.

These marks are important; you will use them to align the wings on the collar. Don't flip the collar over when you get to the loop-side hook-and-loop fastener.
