      "title": "Select multiple glass jars or bottles as your containers.",
      "content": "Select multiple glass jars or bottles as your containers. Ensure that the containers are completely free of cracks or nicks. The containers should be airtight and able to be sealed with a non-metal lid or cork. Wash the containers in warm, soapy water and rinse them out thoroughly. [1] X Research source Metal lids are not recommended since they may corrode. [2] X Research source If you only have metal lids, place a piece of parchment paper between the glass and the lid to prevent direct contact between the vinegar and the metal."

      "title": "Sterilize the glass containers.",
      "content": "Sterilize the glass containers. After washing, place your glass jars or bottles into a pot of boiling water. Let them boil in the water for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the containers from the water and invert them onto a clean paper towel. Allow it to dry. [3] X Research source The jars should still be warm when you fill them with vinegar. To avoid breakage, use a deep pot with a rack in the bottom. Fill the pot at least half full with warm water and place the containers upright on the rack.

      "title": "Check on the mixture in three weeks.",
      "content": "Check on the mixture in three weeks. Fermentation can take anywhere from 3 weeks to 6 months. After you’ve left the mixture alone for 3 weeks, open the container and smell it. If it smells like vinegar, taste it to check for the right flavor. If it hasn’t turned to vinegar yet, cover the container and let it set again. It’s normal for the vinegar to have strange odors during the fermentation process. The smell you should be looking for is the sharp, acidic scent of store-bought vinegar. The flavor should be sour, tart, and acidic like store-bought vinegar. It shouldn't taste like alcohol."

      "content": "Continue to test the mixture until it turns to vinegar. Depending on the smell and taste of the mixture when you initially test it, you may want to check on it weekly or monthly. When it has the scent and taste of vinegar, you’ll know that it’s ready. [8] X Research source You can't really ferment the vinegar too long. Its taste will change the longer that you allow it to ferment, so it's really a matter of personal taste when to stop. If you don't want a sharply acidic vinegar, you may want to allow it to ferment a little longer."

Once the vinegar has finished fermenting, place a cheesecloth over the mouth of another clean container and pour the vinegar through it slowly to filter out the rice and any other solid bits. Tightly cover the new container with a clean lid. [9] X Research source You may find it easier to place the cheesecloth over a funnel to pour the vinegar through so you avoid spills."

      "content": "Store the vinegar in the fridge for a couple of hours. The vinegar will be cloudy while it’s still warm, so it helps to cool it down. Chill it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours while it completes the fermentation process. [10] X Research source"

Always use freshly cleaned utensils or pour your rice vinegar directly into the bowl or condiment mixture you’re working with. Similarly, do not dilute your vinegar with water, which can encourage mold growth."
