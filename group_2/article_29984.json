    {
      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. Your top half is what you're most concerned about. For your legs, wear green sweatpants (that ideally match your t-shirt). Those will be left mostly alone, but the shirt will need to be turtle-fied. Here's what you need: A green t-shirt or sweatshirt Yellow and brown fabric paint Paper plates A foam paintbrush Cardboard"
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert your cardboard inside the shirt.",
      "content": "Insert your cardboard inside the shirt. This will separate the sides, keeping the paint from seeping through. If you don't have cardboard, use some other sturdy material that you're not worried about getting paint on. Lay the shirt flat and smooth out all the creases. The cardboard insert needs to be the just short of the width of the shirt when laid out. If you're using a t-shirt, consider wearing a sweatshirt underneath that is your turtle's color."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint a large yellow rectangle on the center of the shirt.",
      "content": "Paint a large yellow rectangle on the center of the shirt. For ideas or a template, go online and see artists' depictions of the Turtles or other costume designs. The yellow is the bottom of the shell -- make it fitting to your size. It's easiest to use a paper plate as your palette. You can just throw it/them away afterward and not worry about the mess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint brown shell lines on the yellow rectangle.",
      "content": "Paint brown shell lines on the yellow rectangle. Because there have been so many variations over the years, it's impossible to say 100% what the shell looks like. But a good standard design includes a thin line just inside the border of the yellow and lines separating the block into six squares, with one line down the middle. If you're going for super-strength turtle, you may want to make your lines look more like abs. Go work on the shell while you let the shirt dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clear an area and assemble your materials.",
      "content": "Clear an area and assemble your materials. This part is a bit ambitious and a little messy, so clear off the table, lay down some newspaper, grab a drink and sit down to work. Here's what you'll need: A large foil turkey pan Lots of newspaper (in addition to what's covering your workspace) Papier mâché supplies -- bowl, water, white glue or flour Scissors Brown and dark green paint (or duct tape) A drill (or something to poke holes through the pan with) Wide brown ribbon"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your foil pan into a shell shape.",
      "content": "Bend your foil pan into a shell shape. Basically, take the sides and push them out a bit and round out the inner edges, too. While you're at it, just round out the entire thing. Everything needs to be a bit more circular."
    },
    {
      "title": "Papier mâché",
      "content": "Papier mâché your pan. Using 2 parts glue or 1 part flour, make a paste with water and cut 2 in (5 cm) wide strips of newspaper. The length doesn't really matter. Cover the entire outside of your shell. Go in every direction, creating an even layer. If you'd like to add texture by bunching up your strips, you can -- but the shape of the pan should already be fairly shell-like. Let dry for a couple of hours."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the turtle shell pattern on your pan.",
      "content": "Draw the turtle shell pattern on your pan. If it's easier, paint your shell white beforehand. Grab a hexagonal template off the internet and trace it -- the shell sort of looks like a soccer ball...sort of. But ultimately the shell is up to you -- horizontal lines work, too. You'll be painting or taping over it, so don't worry if you have dark lines. They'll get covered up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint or apply duct tape to the shell.",
      "content": "Paint or apply duct tape to the shell. Use green duct tape and brown paint (or vice versa) if you'd like to go for a more textured look. Paint is much easier to work with, but duct tape makes it look sturdier. If painting, you may have to put on several coats. Be patient. Let dry after you've finished."
    },
    {
      "title": "Poke two holes in the top and bottom of your foil pan.",
      "content": "Poke two holes in the top and bottom of your foil pan. That's four in total. Straps are going to be attached through these holes, so place them like you would see them on a backpack. It's easiest to use a drill, but anything that can pop through the foil will do. If you don't use a drill, keep the hole to drill-size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thread the ribbon through the top hole.",
      "content": "Thread the ribbon through the top hole. Don't cut it yet -- you don't know how much you need. Place the pan on your back. Once you go through the top with the ribbon, put it over your shoulder and through the bottom. Leave 3 or 4 inches (7.5 - 10 cm) extra for making knots and cut. Then, take that length and cut another piece for the other side. Tie knots to the top and bottom. It's best if you have the pan on your back while doing this, so grab a friend to make the knots for you."

      "content": "Grab your materials for the belt and headband. A good TMNT costume is made up of in the details. Otherwise you're just a turtle. Grab the following: Wide brown ribbon A circle of cardboard White paper Marker in your turtle's color Wide ribbon in your turtle's color"

    {
      "title": "Measure a length of ribbon around your waist.",
      "content": "Measure a length of ribbon around your waist. Cut it so it fits like a loose belt."

      "title": "Cut small matching circles out of white paper and cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut small matching circles out of white paper and cardboard. They need only be about 3\" (7.5 cm) in diameter. Draw the letter of your turtle on the white paper (in the appropriate color) and attach to the cardboard."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the circle to the belt.",
      "content": "Attach the circle to the belt. Tape is easiest, though glue and staples will do as well. If you don't want a tie in your belt, use the circle to join (and hide) the ends together. The letter should be worn front and center. Make the belt tight enough that it doesn't rotate too much."

    {
      "title": "Cut a length of ribbon for your head, arms, and legs.",
      "content": "Cut a length of ribbon for your head, arms, and legs. You can identify which turtle you are by having a headband, armbands, and leg bands in your turtles color. Where the headband across your forehead, the armbands around your bicep, and the leg bands around your calf. If your ribbon is wide enough, you could always cut eye holes in it and use it as a mask instead!"

      "title": "Make a face paint mask around your eyes.",
      "content": "Make a face paint mask around your eyes. Again, do this in your turtle's color. This is a simple alternative to having to mess with a bandana wrapped around your head that you still have to see out of. Paint up to the eyebrow, just below the eye, a thin bridge around the nose, and lines to the ears. Their masks weren't that wide."

    {
      "title": "Put on your costume.",
      "content": "Put on your costume. Now it's time to go to town with quilt batting or pillow stuffing -- unless you already have the body of a body builder. Stuff your chest, biceps, and thighs. Sculpt it to your liking. Stuffing your costume isn't necessary, no. But it will make your costume even more noticeable than it already is!"
