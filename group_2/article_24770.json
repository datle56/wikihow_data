      "title": "Hang the cord over your ears.",
      "content": "Hang the cord over your ears. Instead of inserting your earbuds so the cord hangs straight down from your ear canal, insert them \"upside down\" and loop the cord over the back of your ear. This may feel strange at first if you're not used to it, but it will prevent the buds from slipping out every time the cord is slightly jerked or pulled."

      "title": "Insert the buds firmly into your ears.",
      "content": "Insert the buds firmly into your ears. Earbuds are meant to fit snugly into your ear canal. If your earbuds don't seem to sit comfortably in your ears, you may simply need to insert them more carefully. [1] X Research source Stretch your earlobe gently with one hand to open the ear canal while inserting each earbud, then release so that your ear cavity shapes itself around the earbud and forms a tight seal. The same goes for wireless earbuds . [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the attachments that come with your earbuds.",
      "content": "Use the attachments that come with your earbuds. Don't disregard those extra silicone tips that come packaged with your earbuds. Experiment with different sizes to see which is most comfortable for you. It's even possible that one of your ears is slightly larger than the other, and you may want to use two different sizes. Changing earbud tips is fairly simple, but be sure not to lose them as you're making the exchange."

      "content": "Use soft foam attachments to mold earphones to your ear. Similar to foam ear plugs, you can purchase soft foam attachments for your earphones. Once they're installed to your earphones, you'll need to firmly squeeze the foam between your fingers before putting them in your ear. The foam will expand slowly in your ear, making the fit perfectly snug."

      "title": "Use ear warmers or sweatbands to hold earbuds in.",
      "content": "Use ear warmers or sweatbands to hold earbuds in. This can be especially helpful if you're using your earbuds in cold weather. The ear warmers or sweatbands can physically hold the earbuds in place while you walk, run, or exercise. You could also use a beanie pulled down to your ears for a more casual look."

      "title": "Purchase special attachments.",
      "content": "Purchase special attachments. You can purchase accessories for your existing earbuds to customize the fit. These are great for improving the fit of those cheap round earbuds that came free with your device. A popular choice is Yurbuds, soft rubber attachments that create a more snug fit into the ear. They can even be made in custom sizes."

      "title": "Don't clean your ears with cotton swabs.",
      "content": "Don't clean your ears with cotton swabs. A buildup of earwax can cause your earbuds to fit poorly and fall out. Using cotton swabs to remove earwax can actually cause the wax to be pushed against your eardrum, causing a blockage and possibly resulting in discomfort while wearing earbuds. [3] X Research source Don't use cotton swabs, and see a doctor if you think you may have an earwax blockage. [4] X Research source You should also clean your earbuds if possible. Oil, earwax, and other debris can build in and around the earbud, and this may be causing them to fall out of your ear."

      "title": "Choose sport earbuds with ear hooks for working out.",
      "content": "Choose sport earbuds with ear hooks for working out. If you plan on using earbuds while exercising, basic circular earbuds might not cut it, no matter how well they fit. Invest in specialized sport headphones with features like ear hooks and bands that wrap around the head to ensure a safe and slip-free listening experience during your workout. Although earbuds with a hook that wrap around the back of the ear are a popular choice for athletes, some of these may cause skin chafing when worn for long periods of time. Consider well-fitting earbuds with smaller \"ear fins\" or wireless earbuds as an alternative if you have this problem. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy sweat-proof earbuds for exercise.",
      "content": "Buy sweat-proof earbuds for exercise. If you wear earbuds during vigorous exercise or in hot weather, sweat may cause your earbuds to slip out. Look for earbuds labeled as \"sweat-proof\" if you expect to sweat while wearing them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase waterproof earbuds for use in all weather.",
      "content": "Purchase waterproof earbuds for use in all weather. If your earbuds may be exposed to water, such as during long distance running or winter sports, choose waterproof earbuds to make sure that excess moisture doesn't cause your earbuds to fall out. Check for an IP (International Protection) rating on the package to ensure your earbuds are certified as sweat-proof or waterproof. Some brands may falsely advertise as such. For example, a rating of IPX4 is the standard for sweat-proof (but not waterproof) workout headphones. You can even purchase earbuds that are safe to use while swimming! These will have a rating of IPX8."

      "title": "Buy wireless earbuds if cord tugging is an issue.",
      "content": "Buy wireless earbuds if cord tugging is an issue. If your earbud slippage is caused by the cord being pulled or caught on clothing or other objects, try wireless earbuds. These are on the more expensive side, but if you use earbuds frequently they are a worthwhile investment. These days, a wide range of wireless bluetooth earbuds are available. Wireless earphones such as Apple AirPods don't offer a silicone tip on entry versions. This may contribute to losing them , so be sure the earbuds fit properly in your ears."

      "title": "Purchase earbuds designed for smaller ears if necessary.",
      "content": "Purchase earbuds designed for smaller ears if necessary. If you've tried everything and still can't keep your earbuds from falling out, you may simply have a particularly small ear canal. In this case, you may want to purchase earbuds designed for smaller ears. Women are more likely to have smaller than average ears, which can prevent earbuds from fully entering the ear canal. There are plenty of earbuds for sale that come with extra small attachments, and even many that are marked as being for women. [6] X Research source Certain people lack cartilage on the part of the ear that normally surrounds an earbud. This is sometimes called Ear Cartilage Deficiency Syndrome. If you have always found it very difficult to wear earbuds, you may want to examine your ears for this feature and purchase earbuds with extra support, such as those with ear hooks."
