      "content": "Use a screwdriver instead of a power tool. Don’t use a drill or power screwdriver to remove and drive screws. Using a screwdriver will reduce the risk of stripping screws or slipping and nicking your guitar. If you slip and thrust a drill into your guitar, you could scratch the finish or even damage its sound. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the existing strap button from your guitar’s base.",
      "content": "Remove the existing strap button from your guitar’s base. Locate the existing strap button on the base of your guitar, and carefully remove the screw that holds it in place. You’ll probably find a rubber or felt protective washer between the button and your guitar’s body. Set this aside and save it to reuse when you mount the new strap button. Your kit might also come with protective washers for the buttons. If it doesn’t, and if your existing buttons don’t either, you can pick up a pair at your local guitar store."

      "content": "Screw the new button into your guitar. Once you’ve found the right sized screw, line up the protective washer and the new button over the hole in your guitar’s body. Drive the new screw through the button and washer carefully to avoid slipping and damaging your guitar’s finish. Tighten the screw and make sure the button can’t spin."

      "title": "Insert a lock through the hole in your strap.",
      "content": "Insert a lock through the hole in your strap. If necessary, remove the nut and washer from the lock. Slide the lock through the hole from the inside of your strap. The part of the lock that fits into the button should be on the inside of the strap, and the threaded barrel (where you screw on the nut) should stick out from the outside of the strap. The lock is U-shaped, and the open side fits onto the button on the guitar’s body. Make sure the open part faces toward the center of the strap’s length."

      "title": "Cut away a bit of leather if the hole is too tight.",
      "content": "Cut away a bit of leather if the hole is too tight. Schaller locks are relatively thick, and you might find that the hole in your strap is too tight or folds up into dog ears around the lock. If necessary, use a small pair of wire cutters to carefully trim away leather so the lock sits flush against the strap. [5] X Research source Trim off as little at a time as possible. You can always trim more if you need to, but you can’t add back what you’ve already cut."

Use a 13 mm wrench or socket to finish tightening the nut. Make sure to keep the open side of the lock pointed toward the center of the strap’s length.
