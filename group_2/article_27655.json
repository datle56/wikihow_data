Not all jobs can be performed effectively from home so examine your strengths and experience to determine if you can make working from home effective for you and your family. Assess how much money you need to make. Determine how much money you’ll need to make in order to live comfortably. In some cases, you may need to factor in overhead costs, initial cash outlay to get the business started and the amount of time it will take to turn a profit. Tally your monthly bills to help determine the total amount you should make and decide how much money you would like to add to your savings account. Determine if you have the equipment/tools to make your home-based business a success. Knowing what you need in terms of tools should be included in the cost. In some cases a simple computer and certain software will do the trick. However, if you are running another type of business, such as an embroidery or catering company you may need to purchase certain equipment to get your home based business off the ground. Decide if you need assistance or if you can perform this task as a one man or woman show. Another cost to consider is whether you can do this on your own or if assistance will be required. For example, if you are starting a house painting company you may need to hire one or two employees to help you complete larger jobs. Find a specific space in your home that you can call your “office.” Even if you plan to do most of your business in the field, you’ll need to have your own space for paperwork and invoicing. Whether it’s the kitchen table or you can allot for an entire room for an office, identify a space before you begin work."

If you aren’t already an organized person you’ll have a rough road ahead. Use organizational tools and a solid day planner to keep you focused on your schedule. Obtain a comprehensive planner or use the organizational system software on your computer. No one else is going to keep you on track so you’ll need to write down every appointment and/or deadline in your planner. Avoid trying to just “remember” because you will only set yourself up for failure. Examine your day to determine which hours you will work. If you are a busy parent and need to leave the house throughout the day to drop off or pick up children, identify quiet hours during the day that you can dedicate to work. It may be possible that you’ll have to work well into the evening if you are busy with childcare during the day. Create an organizational system that will help you stay on top of work/clients. If you are juggling numerous clients, create a filing system that makes sense to you. In some cases, placing all paperwork and information in one large folder per client may help, whereas pinning information to a corkboard in your office regarding that client may work. Set up a professional invoicing system and send invoices either bi-monthly or monthly. Use your computer software’s invoicing templates or you can create an invoice using Excel. Decided when you plan to bill and be sure you send invoices on the same day of the month to ensure consistent payment. [7] X Research source [v161791_b01]. 1 June 2021.

In a topsy turvy economy you can never tell when one client may bail. Social media. Promote relevant information on social media channels--especially news or interesting information that would spark conversation. For example, if you are running an organic food catering business from home, post articles about the benefits of organic food or offer an easy recipe. Traditional advertising. While traditional advertising has its place, TV, radio and print can be expensive. Instead, consider using flyers or posting your business card at stores or places you visit. Networking. Join the local Chamber of Commerce or industry groups to attract new clients. For example, if you are a financial blogger, hit the bank and credit union expo or marketing seminars to build your network. Scanning online classifieds. Places like Zaarly or Craigslist may offer some leads, however consider Googling your profession. For example, if you are a writer, Google “writer jobs” or “writing jobs” for job boards."
