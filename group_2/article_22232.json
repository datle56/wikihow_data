      "content": "Stop feeling guilty. Speaking up for yourself may cause you to step out of your comfort zone. You may feel leery about doing so because you don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. However, if you look out for your well-being, while still being respectful towards others, you have every right to take care of your needs. [1] X Expert Source Christy Irvine, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 April 2021. When you say “no” to someone, don’t focus on what you said no to, but instead think about what you said yes to. For example, if you refused to let your friend borrow your car because they are too lazy to find a job, don’t think about how guilty you feel for saying no. Rather, think about how you are helping your friend by not just giving them something, and how you are honoring your hard work by not sacrificing your vehicle for someone else."

      "content": "Practice being assertive. The art of assertiveness is not only about verbal communication, but non-verbal communication, as well. You can practice how you’re going to be assertive when alone. Taking the time to practice can help you gain the confidence you need when it comes to putting it into use. For instance, practice standing up straight, looking someone in the eye, and displaying clear and direct emotions. Also, speak in a relaxed and sincere voice and practice talking without any hesitation. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Feel confident using power poses. You can also practice your body language skills to enhance assertiveness. There are a few stances called power poses that convey confidence and authority when speaking. What's more, practicing these poses doesn't just influence how others see you, they will actually change how you feel about yourself, too. [3] X Research source Practice your power pose while looking in the mirror before entering a situation where you may need to speak up. Stand like a superhero with your feet wide and firmly planted and your fists at your hips. Lift your chin and channel your inner strength. You will naturally appear more confident and feel that way, too. Another power pose involves sitting with one leg casually slung over the other and your arms forming a \"V\" shape with your hands resting at your nape. Try these poses for a few minutes each day and see if you feel a difference in your confidence."

      "content": "Avoid using combative language. You can be assertive without being argumentative. The key is to use the proper language. You can get your point across effectively without coming across as aggressive, which increases your chances of being taken seriously. [4] X Expert Source Christy Irvine, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 April 2021. Instead of pointing blame at someone by saying “You always do this” or “You need to stop doing this,” use “I” language instead. For instance, begin with “I feel upset when…” or “I think we can...” By focusing on you, the person you are speaking with may not feel attacked."

      "content": "Start in less stressful situations. You don’t want to assert yourself for the first time in a high-stress situation. Instead, use your new skills initially in a situation that is low-key. Doing this can help you build your confidence and cause you to become comfortable standing up for yourself. For example, implement your assertiveness on your friends or loved ones in small settings before you go for something big. Tell your friends “no” if you can’t watch their kids or let your partner know you don’t want to go to a party. Get some practice before you take on a bigger issue, like turning down a project at work.

      "content": "Point out unacceptable behavior. If you witness someone speaking negatively about someone else, bring up what they are doing. Don’t attack them; simply say back to them what they said. You’re not doing anything but letting them hear what they said, which can make them aware of what they did in a non-confrontational way. For example, you could say, “From what I hear, you are saying that this person doesn’t deserve to work here. Is that correct?” By repeating what they say back to them, you make them aware that you heard what they said in a non-aggressive way, and that you aren’t going to let their negative opinions slip by you.

      "content": "Understand that silence is often interpreted as acceptance. Someone you know is bashed by the people around you, and you don’t think it is appropriate. If you sit in silence, however, you are basically agreeing with what is being said. You may withhold because you don’t want to start an argument, but your lack of opinions will likely be seen as approval of what was said. Get the courage to speak up by asking yourself if you would want someone to allow what is being said to be said about you. If not, then you should say something. [7] X Research source"

Going into battle unarmed and without a plan will not only cause you to doubt yourself, but can make your attack seem weak. Go into this discussion with a well thought-out course of action and you’ll increase your chances of being effective. Include what you find offensive about what is being said or done, examples of when the injustice took place, and why the person who is being attacked doesn’t deserve it. You can also discuss what you plan to do if the attacks don’t stop. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Remember your values. When you doubt your confidence about speaking up, remember what you hold dear. If you aren’t comfortable with what is being said to someone you care about or how they are being treated, think about your values. If you won’t be able to live with yourself by not stepping in, then you should. Also remember your character when you decide to speak up for the person. Don’t react in a way that wouldn’t make you feel proud about yourself. Speak in a calm and rational voice and refuse to let things escalate. It may be difficult, but you are capable of getting your point across without stooping to insults and bad behavior.
