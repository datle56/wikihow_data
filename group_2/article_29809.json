      "content": "Track how long it takes you to do routine activities. Keep a log of how long it takes to get ready in the morning, eat, do laundry, go grocery shopping, respond to emails, do homework, and complete other routine tasks. Track these times for about a week in a notebook, spreadsheet, or notepad app. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Tracking your routine over the course of a week will help you accurately estimate how much time you should budget for specific tasks. Additionally, you might find ways that you can become more productive. For example, you might have spent 10 hours playing a video game and should have spent more time studying."

      "content": "Experiment with using a notebook, planner, and scheduling apps . Play around with different written and digital methods when you begin making your first schedule. If you want to start with a blank slate, try using a notebook or a notepad app. If you want a ready-made grid with dates and time slots, go with a planner or calendar app. [2] X Research source Choose a method that suits your personal preferences. If you hate dealing with paper, use an app. If writing by hand helps you stay on track, go with a pencil and pad. You’ll get a sense of your likes and dislikes as you use your schedule. When you find the right method, stick with it. Keep all of your tasks organized in 1 place, be it a notebook, planner, or app. Some people prefer digital planners while others prefer scheduling on paper—choose whichever option best motivates you. Reader Poll: We asked 943 wikiHow readers about how they organize their time, and 68% agreed that they like to make paper timetables . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Write down dates and days of the week, if necessary. If the dates and days of the week aren’t automatically included, fill them in at the top of your schedule's pages. Dedicate an entire page for 1 day so you can focus on current tasks and jot down notes when necessary. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Including the day of the week helps you keep track of activities that happen on specific days, such as music classes on Mondays and Wednesdays. If you’re using a blank notebook, you could use the page on the left for a chronological schedule, and write daily priorities and other notes on the right page."

      "title": "Fill in your fixed blocks of time.",
      "content": "Fill in your fixed blocks of time. Classes, regular meetings, and other fixed tasks are your schedule’s framework. Begin by filling in fixed blocks of time, such as “8:30 a.m. - Intro to Psychology” or “4:00 p.m. - Yoga class.” [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source If you’re using a blank notebook or spreadsheet, it’s helpful to fill in time slots in half hour intervals on the left side of the page. Leave 2 or 3 lines between each half hour interval so you have room to jot down bullet points under a task. If you're using a planner or scheduling app, it probably already has time slots."

      "title": "Make a list of tasks on a separate sheet of paper.",
      "content": "Make a list of tasks on a separate sheet of paper. Filling in your fixed tasks is easy, but structuring the rest of your time can get tricky. Start by writing down everything you have to accomplish on a blank sheet of paper or in a new document on your phone or computer. Prioritize tasks by writing a number or letter next to each one. [5] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source For example, write 1 (or A) next to your most important tasks. These will be the tasks you'll write on your schedule first. Write 2 (or B) next to your middle-priority tasks, and 3 (or C) next to your low-priority items. When you write a task in your schedule, you could mark the priority level next to it, or just make an asterisk or exclamation point next to your top priorities. If you’re planning out your week , make a list of your weekly tasks. Write down your daily tasks if you’re planning a single day."

      "content": "Assign the most important tasks during times when you’re most alert. Fill in your schedule starting with the most important tasks. Estimate how long each task will take, and schedule your top priorities during times that you’re most alert and free of distractions. To call attention to high-priority tasks, draw asterisks, underline them, or highlight them. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source For example, if you’re most productive in the morning, schedule high-priority projects before lunchtime. Save paper filing and deleting emails for later in the day. Do your best to set reasonable expectations. Don’t try to squeeze homework or a meeting with a client into 30 minutes when you know a full hour is more realistic. After you’ve entered the most important items, you can fill the smaller tasks, like doing laundry or going grocery shopping."

If you just jot down shorthand, you might not remember what you meant by “Go to meeting,” or “Do research.” [7] X Research source If you have to go to a meeting, include the time, location, and who will be attending. You might also want to add bullet points on the meeting's topic. Keep in mind you don’t want to write an essay for each task. Just include the necessary details that will help you stay on track."

You’ll have a better idea of how your day will go and where you’ll be at specific times. [8] X Research source For example, you might have to prepare an outline from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., go to class from 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., have lunch at 12:30 p.m., and have a meeting from 1:00 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. Remember to set reasonable expectations.

      "content": "Set aside time for fun, family time, and relaxation. You can’t be 100% productive around the clock, so make time for loved ones, hanging out, and having fun. If you’re the type of person who forgets to take time off, including reminders to relax and have fun is especially important. [9] X Research source For example, include entries such as, “Tuesday, 6:30 p.m. - Have dinner with Sam and Phil (finish up at work by 5:45!)” or “Saturday, 12:00 p.m. - Take Joey to the park.”"

      "content": "Leave about 25% of your time open. Filling up your day with back-to-back tasks doesn’t leave any room for revisions. Instead, budget some time to deal with interruptions or delays. Leaving at least 15 minutes between tasks is a good way to work some wiggle room into your plans. If you have to drive somewhere, remember to leave an extra 10 or 15 minutes in case you run into traffic. Even if you don’t run late or get distracted, you can use chunks of wiggle room to take breaks, exercise, or to do some extra work."

Marking off a completed task can give you a sense of progress and help you keep a bird’s-eye view of your responsibilities. Don’t panic if you don’t complete all your tasks.

For example, if you have a full day of presentations, meetings, and deadlines, reward yourself with breaks, an ice cream cone, or another small treat. [12] X Research source In addition to small rewards for completing individual tasks, give yourself a big treat after a productive day.

Additionally, you’re not going to perform well if you run yourself ragged. Set aside time off to make your workload more manageable and to refresh your body and mind. [14] X Trustworthy Source Darmouth University Academic Skills Center Center within Dartmouth University dedicated to assisting students achieve academic goals by providing pedagogical resources Go to source For instance, it’s great to use a weekend day to get things done around the house. However, if you mow the lawn, catch up on laundry, and clean the house on Saturday, take most of Sunday to relax. Each evening, do your best to schedule at least 1 to 2 hours to unwind before bed. Use that time to read a relaxing book, take a bath, or listen to soothing music."
