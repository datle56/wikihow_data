      "content": "Combine plain Greek yogurt and self-rising flour to form your crust. A good ratio is 1½ cups (170 g) of self-rising flour and 1 c (240 mL) of plain Greek yogurt—it’ll create the perfect amount of dough for a 12 in (30 cm) pizza. [2] X Research source If you’d rather make a bigger, 16 in (41 cm) pizza, increase the dough recipe so you’re working with 3 cups (340 g) of self-rising flour and 2 c (470 mL) of plain Greek yogurt instead."

      "content": "The kneading process helps give the pizza dough structure. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and press into it with the base of your palm. Then, grab the back edge of the dough and pull it toward you, folding it over the rest of the dough. Dust the top of it with flour, and then continue alternating between pressing and pulling. Keep kneading until the dough has a smooth texture. [3] X Research source If the dough feels too sticky, add a little more flour to it."

As you roll and manipulate the dough, try to keep the thickness as consistent as possible. You don’t want one section to be super thin and crunchy and the other to be thick and doughy!

      "content": "Mozzarella is a classic, but you can branch out, too. Grab a bag of pre-grated cheese and sprinkle as much or as little as you want over the surface. Parmesan, cheddar, Monterey jack, provolone, and other cheeses can be delicious additions to your homemade pie as well, so don’t be afraid to experiment! [9] X Research source Keep in mind that pre-grated cheeses tend to have additives. If you want even fresher ingredients, there’s no harm in grating the cheese yourself."
