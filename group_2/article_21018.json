      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions invite your date to share their thoughts and feelings about things, rather than just providing a one word answer. [4] X Research source For example, instead of asking “What’s your favorite song,” try asking “What kind of music do you like to listen to?” The first question only requires a simple answer, but the second question gives your date a chance to open up and share more, which can help the conversation flow better."

      "content": "Don’t treat the conversation like an interrogation. If you ask too many questions in a row, the conversation can start to feel like a stressful job interview, rather than a fun way to get to know the other person better.

      "title": "Practice active listening.",
      "content": "Practice active listening. Active listening shows your date that you're fully engaged and interested in getting to know them better, which is key for a good conversation . It involves things like making eye contact, nodding and reacting to what they’re saying with your facial expressions, and asking thoughtful follow-up questions to delve deeper into topics. For example, if your date tells you that their favorite travel destination is Italy, don’t just leave it at that and move on to the next topic. Follow up with something like, “Wow, I’ve heard Italy is amazing! What do you love about it? Do you usually go to a specific city when you visit?” According to dating coach Lisa Shield, it’s essential to take the time to really explore each topic, rather than skipping around from subject to subject. “Really great conversation happens when you take one topic and go deeper with it,” she says."

      "content": "Be careful not to talk about yourself too much. Most people find it a pretty big turn off if their date goes on and on about themselves, without showing an equal interest in the other person, explains dating coach Judith Gottesman. In fact, she says this is one of the most common complaints she receives from clients after first dates! If you notice that you’ve been monologuing or hogging the conversation for a while, shift your focus to your date and focus on asking them questions about themselves."

It’s just to determine if you’re having fun.” In other words, don’t stress yourself out trying to ask every question to figure out if your date is your soulmate—there’ll be plenty of time for that down the line! “Just let the conversation organically happen,” says Avgitidis."
