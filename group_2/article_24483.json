Sharing your Cash App tag gives out too much information, like how to easily contact you (like if you post your Cash App tag on a social media platform , anyone who sees that post can get in touch with you). Scammers can use false identities and pretend that they are someone close to you in order to gain your trust and get into your wallet."

      "content": "If something sounds too good to be true, it's likely a scam. Keep that in mind since scams can take many different forms. The main goal of a scam is to get your money without giving you anything in return. Here are some common scams that you should avoid: Sweetheart Scams and Sugar Scams rely on emotional relationships so one person can get money out of another person. Cash Flipping and Clearance Fee Scam. In this case, you're told that if you put X amount down, you'll get double that in no time. These scammers will accept the money you give them and disappear. Payment Claiming. You're told that you have to put down a deposit to claim a payment that you \"deserve\" [1] X Research source . However, the person scamming you will take your deposit and not give you the payment you tried to claim. Puppy/Pet Deposit Scam. Scammers will use fake pictures of a new litter to reel you in. You'll pick a puppy or kitten and the scammer will ask you to send them a deposit to ensure that no one else gets the puppy or kitten that you've chosen. They won't respond to phone calls, texts, or any means of communication after you've sent the money and you won't end up getting a new pet. Apartment/Home Rental Scam. In this case, a scammer will offer you a rental at an amazing price with great benefits. They may even present themselves as the owner of the rental property and make extravagant promises to get you to send money as a deposit for the home. However, you didn't actually get the apartment/home and that scammer has disappeared with your money. Accidental Payment Scam. You'll suddenly get a large deposit in your Cash App from a random person , and they will ask for it back. Once you \"Refund\" the money by creating a new transaction, it will go back to them and their initial deposit will eventually decline. All in all, you've financially lost the initial amount since the \"Refund\" came out of your pocket as the original transaction was still processing. Fake Giveaways. Be cautious of fake Cash App social media accounts requesting an initial transaction for your Cash App tag, PIN, login details, or to download an app to claim a prize from a giveaway. Know that the real Cash App team will never ask for any of this information."
