      "content": "Cut a piece of satin ribbon approximately 12 in (30 cm) long. You'll also need a needle and thread, a pair of scissors, and a hot glue gun. Find something to use as the center of the flower, such as a button."

      "content": "Sew a threaded needle along one long edge of the ribbon. Weave the needle, in and out, all the way through the length of the ribbon. This is called a basting stitch and will allow you to scrunch the ribbon into a flower shape later. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pull the thread to make the ribbon into a flower shape.",
      "content": "Pull the thread to make the ribbon into a flower shape. Once you have woven the needle all the way along the ribbon, remove the needle and pull on the extra thread. When you do this, the ribbon will bunch up and take on a flower shape. Cut the thread and tie it off with a double knot to prevent it from coming out of the ribbon. Stitch or hot glue the two ends of the ribbon together. Glue might be neater, but be sure to apply glue on the side of the ribbon you want to be on the back."

      "title": "Glue a button to cover up the hole in the middle of the flower.",
      "content": "Glue a button to cover up the hole in the middle of the flower. If you glued the ribbon ends together, leave the flower to dry before flattening it out. It should now look like the petals of a flower. Next, place a button over the hole in the center of the flower. Use the glue gun to adhere it to the ribbon, taking care to wipe up any excess glue that seeps out from under the button. For added security, use two buttons – one on either side of the flower – and glue them together."

      "content": "Purchase a heavy double-faced satin ribbon that will keep its shape. You'll also need a button for each flower you want to make, a needle, and thread. Alternatively, you can use a hot glue gun if you have one. [2] X Research source If you want to make the optional stem, get floral wire and floral tape."

    {
      "title": "Cut the ribbon into several pieces in your desired length.",
      "content": "Cut the ribbon into several pieces in your desired length. The length will depend on how big you want your flowers to be. Try 13 in (33 cm) long strips for a large flower and 6 in (15 cm) strips for a small flower. [3] X Research source The number of strips you use will depend on how many loop petals you want it to have. A simple flower could be made from just 4 strips, but 8 strips will work better for a fuller flower."

      "title": "Lay the ribbon pieces out on a flat surface in a star pattern.",
      "content": "Lay the ribbon pieces out on a flat surface in a star pattern. Start by placing one ribbon in a vertical line and then placing a second ribbon horizontally across the middle of the first ribbon to form a cross. Then lay the other ribbons diagonally over the cross to create the star pattern. Once you have them in a position you like, stitch or glue them together in the center where they all join. [4] X Research source If you're struggling to visualize the pattern, it might help to think of the asterisk symbol."

      "content": "Fold the ribbon ends toward the center to make petal loops. Pick up a ribbon by the end furthest away from the center and fold it up and in toward the center of the flower. Depending on how many ribbon strips you're using, you may need to secure a few of the loops before moving on to the next one. If possible, just hold all the loops in place until you have made them all so that you can secure them at the same time. For extra security, sew some stitches through the center of the flower to secure all the ribbon loops in place before adding a centerpiece."

      "content": "Glue a button to the center of the ribbon loops to make a centerpiece. You can either stitch it into place or attach it with hot glue. Stitching it will make it easier for you to tie all the loops together and secure them more effectively, but the hot glue will hold up just fine, as well. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a stem for your looped ribbon flower with floral wire. Bend the wire in half and slide it under the stitches at the back of the central part of the flower. Now the wire should extend down from the center of the flower and look like a stem. To finish it off, wrap the wire in floral tape. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut a length of ribbon between 18–24 in (46–61 cm) long. You will also need some quick drying and strong glue, such as a hot glue gun. Use a chipboard circle for the base of the flower and a button for the centerpiece. [7] X Research source The diameter of the chipboard circle will depend on the size of flower you want to make. A diameter of 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) is ideal for a length of ribbon that is 18 in (46 cm) long."

Add more glue to the chipboard backing as you go and stick the ribbon down. This is tricky work, so glue small sections of ribbon at a time to make it easier. When you're done, trim off the excess ribbon to finish your rose."

Thread a needle and stitch directly underneath the bottom of the flower to keep the folds in place. Hold the folds tightly in place as you work and keep the stitches tight and neat. Make a series of flowers like this of different shapes and colors to make a satin ribbon bouquet. Attach the flower to a floral wire \"stem,\" if you wish, using floral tape."
