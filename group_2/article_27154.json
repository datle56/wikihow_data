      "title": "Transcription",
      "content": "Transcription Transcription is relatively simple work. Basically, you just listen to an audio recording or live event and type out everything that is said so that people can refer to the record of events. You can also typically do this from home and on your own schedule, which makes it ideal work if you don’t feel like running around or following a strict schedule. [1] X Research source Requirements: You must have a good ear and the ability to type (ideally between 60-80 words per minute), but that’s about it! Where to get this job: Any job hunting board (like Indeed or Monster) is chock-full of transcription work. There are also dedicated transcription gig sites like TranscribeMe! and Speechpad that hire often. How much can you make? It depends on how fast you can type! You typically get paid by the audio minute—usually around $0.25-2.50. A good transcriber can work at a 4:1 ratio, so it comes out to around $5-10 an hour depending on the gig. Level of effort required: It can actually be a little tiring to listen closely to boring audio, so you have to focus relatively well, but the freedom is really nice for a side gig."

      "title": "English Tutoring",
      "content": "English Tutoring There are a lot of online tutoring gigs where you can teach English—even if you don’t have a college degree. Lokenauth points out that since the countries hiring English tutors are often in Asia (tutors are in extremely high demand in China and India), you can pursue this work after a traditional 9-5 would be finished, which makes this the perfect side gig for full-time workers. Requirements: Lokenauth thinks this is one of the easiest jobs you can have. You just need to be fluent in English and you’re kind of good to go. Where to get this job: Job hunting boards are full of these gigs. You can also check out websites like Preply , Chegg , or Cambly . How much can you make? Lokenauth says, “These gigs typically pay anywhere from $18-25 an hour.” Level of effort required: You must have good people skills, and tutoring sessions often require planning, but the work itself isn’t too difficult if you know a lot about English."

      "title": "Selling Used Items",
      "content": "Selling Used Items Got a lot of stuff in your home and need to do some Spring cleaning? Congratulations, you just landed yourself a side gig! Selling things you no longer need may not technically qualify as a job, but it’s an easy way to earn some fast cash if you’re looking for some! [2] X Research source Requirements: None, beyond being a bit of a pack rat. Where to get this job: Lokenauth explains that “there are a bunch of popular sites like eBay , Etsy , and Facebook marketplace where you can sell things you no longer need.” How much can you make? Depends on how much stuff you have and how in demand those items are. Level of effort required: You’ll need to put the work in to write listings for your items, post them online, and coordinate for pickups, but we’re not talking about anything complex here."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pet Sitting",
      "content": "Pet Sitting If you love furry friends and you’ve got a relatively open (or flexible) schedule, pet sitting is a very simple gig that can earn you serious money. The hardest part here is getting your foot in the door since people looking for pet sitters typically want references. Consider pet sitting for some friends or family for a discount to get started. [3] X Research source Requirements: Technically none, but you do need to be very reputable and it helps if you have a clean criminal record. Where to get this job: Rover and Care are the two biggest platforms for pet sitting, although you’ll likely want to advertise your services in social media neighborhood groups to find local clients. How much can you make? Expect to charge around $15 an hour for shorter sessions, or $40-80 a day for overnight stays. Level of effort required: The work itself is pretty easy—you just hang out with a dog or cat and relax. The legwork getting started can be relatively hard early on, though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dog Walking",
      "content": "Dog Walking Dog walking is a little less time-intensive than pet sitting, and it’s a good way to get paid while hanging out with pups and getting some fresh air. You do have to be mobile, though, since everyone is likely to ask you to pick their dog up from their home when they’re at work. [4] X Research source Requirements: None, other than being reputable and able to travel from pet to pet. Where to get this job: Like pet sitting, Rover and Care are the two biggest platforms for dog walking. You’ll also likely find some work if you post online in local social media groups. How much can you make? Expect to make around $15-20 per walk. Level of effort required: You must travel a bit, but the work itself is pretty tame so long as you know how to properly walk a dog ."

      "title": "Rideshare Driving",
      "content": "Rideshare Driving Lokenauth says that Uber and Lyft are easy ways to make some money if you have a car you can use. Ridesharing is a great side gig because you get to set your own hours and work at your own convenience. Requirements: You must have a clean driving record, a valid driver’s license, 3 years of driving experience, and access to a 4-door vehicle that is 6 years old or newer. You also have to have a clean criminal record. Where to get this job: Just sign up with Lyft or Uber online. How much can you make? Expect to make around $30 an hour if you’re working back-to-back rides. [5] X Research source Level of effort required: Driving is tough work! You must be a healthy, focused, and defensive driver. People are trusting you with their life when they get in your car, and you must respect that."

    {
      "title": "Grocery Shopping",
      "content": "Grocery Shopping If you like the idea of gig work but you don’t have a car that qualifies for ridesharing or you’re just not all that into sitting for long periods of time, grocery shopping and delivery is a great alternative. [6] X Research source Requirements: You typically just need a driver’s license, access to a working car, and a clean background and criminal record. Where to get this job: Lokenauth says there are a few reputable apps you can use to get paid to deliver groceries. Instacart is the big one, but there are a lot of local alternatives depending on where you live. How much can you make? It really ranges depending on where you live, but anywhere from $10-100 per order, most of the time. An order can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours, though, so it’s hard to estimate a “standard” pay. Level of effort required: You’ll have to lift some heavy bags, but other than that, this is a pretty laid-back gig."
    },
    {
      "title": "Delivering Food",
      "content": "Delivering Food If you have a way to get around, Lokenauth points out that this is pretty easy work to obtain. It can be extremely profitable, too! You just pick up people’s food orders and deliver them. Requirements: Access to a bike or car. That’s about it. Where to get this job: “If you have a bike or a car, you can do things like DoorDash , Grubhub , or Postmates .” How much can you make? It varies depending on where you live, but expect to earn around $20 an hour. [7] X Research source Level of effort required: You’re handling food, which requires some caution and respect, but it’s not tough work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Selling Crafts",
      "content": "Selling Crafts If you’re into the arts at all, perhaps you could sell a specialty craft that people want. Ceramics, jewelry, woodworking stuff, knitted items, and other knick-knacks are all popular options. However, you must have a passion for whatever craft you plan on selling. This is a really tough side gig if you don’t enjoy making whatever you’re selling. [8] X Research source Requirements: None, other than your personal talents and gifts! Where to get this job: You’re basically going to be running a small business, so it’s really up to you on how you do this. You could sell locally on things like Facebook Marketplace or set up your own Etsy or eBay shop. How much can you make? It totally depends on your goods and the demand for them. Level of effort required: The effort here is directly tied to how much effort you want to put in and how much “work” it is for you to make the stuff you’re making."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cleaning",
      "content": "Cleaning House cleaners and car detailers are always in demand and these are the kind of jobs you can do yourself with some cleaning supplies. You can also either do this yourself or join up with a crew that occasionally needs help if you prefer a little more structure in your work. Just keep in mind that cleaning can be pretty tiring, so if you have a day job that involves a lot of physical labor this might be a tough gig. [9] X Research source Requirements: You’ll likely need to spend $20-40 on cleaning supplies to get started, but other than that, this is a pretty low bar to entry. Where to get this job: You can advertise your services online or join a platform like InstaMaids or Homeaglow to pick up cleaning gig work. How much can you make? Anywhere from $10 an hour to $300 per job depending on how you structure your pay. Level of effort required: Cleaning isn’t complicated, but it can be backbreaking work if your technique is no good. You also must have an eye for attention to detail."

    {
      "title": "Handyman Services",
      "content": "Handyman Services If you’re good with your hands and know your way around a drill or saw, you can always pick up odd jobs as a handyman. These jobs aren’t for newbies, though. People will be hiring and paying you to perform potentially dangerous and important work, so this isn’t the kind of gig where you can get your sea legs as you go. [10] X Research source Requirements: You must have tools for the type of work you want to do and the ability to get around. Where to get this job: Lokenauth recommends signing up for TaskRabbit if you’re in the US and want to land some simple handyman gigs. Bellhops is a newer platform comparable to TaskRabbit that focuses only on manual labor and moving, if that’s more your speed. How much can you make? It really depends on the work and the level of demand for it in your area. Movers may only make $10 an hour, while custom carpentry work can earn you $30-50 an hour! Level of effort required: Handyman work is tough, but if you know what you’re doing, it may not be that difficult."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freelancing",
      "content": "Freelancing Lokenauth explains, “The only other one I can think of that might be pretty easy to get into is selling services or talents or skills you have by being a freelance consultant. You have to have the skills for something like graphic design or social media management, but it’s a great way to earn some money.” Requirements: It helps to have a college degree and a portfolio of your work in whatever field you want to freelance in. Where to get this job: Lokenauth recommends websites like Fiverr and Upwork . How much can you make? It depends on how often you work and what field you’re in, but freelancers can earn serious money doing this kind of work! Level of effort required: Freelancers operate in a realm where their clients are incapable of doing the work on their own, so you must have some talent and knowledge to succeed here."
    },
    {
      "title": "Completing Surveys",
      "content": "Completing Surveys This is a tough one because there are a lot of scam websites out there that claim they’ll pay you to complete surveys, but this is something you can actually do if you pick a solid platform and set your expectations appropriately. Just be wary about the info you share with these survey sites—a lot of them are known to sell user data. [11] X Research source Requirements: Access to a computer, but that’s about it. Where to get this job: UserTesting, Respondent, Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, and Inbox Dollars are all supposedly reputable platforms for survey-taking. How much can you make? These sites don’t make it easy to figure it out because they often pay you in the form of a proprietary point system that needs to be converted to dollars. You’re likely to earn $0.50 per survey on the low end and $5 per survey on the high end. Level of effort required: This is easy work, but that easiness is reflected in the pay. Don’t expect to make a killing here."

    {
      "title": "Renting Your Car Out",
      "content": "Renting Your Car Out If you want to make some money by doing basically nothing, renting your car out to qualified drivers is a great way to do it. This does take some setting up, and you’ll put some miles on your car, but it’s hard to beat getting paid for doing nothing while you hang out at home or work your full-time job! [12] X Research source Requirements: You must own a car. That’s about it! Where to get this job: Turo , Getaround , and HyreCar are all popular platforms where you can rent out your vehicle. How much can you make? It really ranges depending on demand for rental cars in your area, but if you rent out your car around 10 times a month, you can expect to make around $500. Level of effort required: You’ll have to clean your car periodically, and you need to talk to your insurance company before you can start, but this is about as easy as it gets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Renting Your Home",
      "content": "Renting Your Home Got a spare bedroom? If so, listing it on a home rental site and giving people the opportunity to book your place can earn you some great cash. You do have to be comfortable sharing your home with strangers, and you either have to own the place or talk to your landlord ahead of time, but this is a very simple gig that gives you plenty of space to work another full-time gig. [13] X Research source Requirements: You have to have access to a rentable space, but that’s about it! Where to get this job: “You can rent a space in your home or even a bedroom or even your garage on websites like Airbnb or VRBO ,” says Lokenauth. How much can you make? It really depends on where you live, but the average host pulls in about $14,000 a year! [14] X Research source Level of effort required: You’ll have to manage bookings and clean/set up for each stay, but it’s not too bad."

    {
      "title": "Babysitting",
      "content": "Babysitting Babysitting is a simple way to get paid without putting in a ton of effort in your spare time. This is also a great option if you work a full-time job with atypical hours (or you work remotely and can get stuff done while the kiddo naps). It can also be tough to get your foot in the door because people need to trust you around kids, but once you’re in, your references will take you far. [15] X Research source Requirements: It helps if you’re a younger (or much older) woman, but other than a clean background check and references speaking to your ability to watch children, there isn’t a high barrier to entry here. Where to get this job: Post in local neighborhood groups on Facebook or NextDoor to find a local family looking for some help. How much can you make? Anywhere from $10-30 an hour. Level of effort required: Kids are a lot of work!"

    {
      "title": "Car Detailing",
      "content": "Car Detailing While a lot of businesses require a ton of investment upfront, car detailing really only requires a few cleaning supplies and the ability to reach clients. It’s also the kind of gig where you can easily complete a job in an hour or so, which makes it a good option for a side gig. [16] X Research source Requirements: None! You just need to buy $20-40 worth of cleaning supplies. Where to get this job: You’ll run your own business here so it’s up to you. Most detailers will advertise in local social media groups, though. How much can you make? Anywhere from $100-250 a car. Level of effort required: Detailing isn’t super difficult, but it does require plenty of elbow grease and sweat!"

      "title": "Notarizing",
      "content": "Notarizing Mobile notaries travel to clients who need them to certify important documents (think home loans, apartment verification, wills, etc.). You do have to get a license, but after that you’re basically in the clear to work as frequently as you’d like. [17] X Research source Requirements: You must become a licensed notary, but that’s it! Where to get this job: Once you’re licensed, market yourself in local social media groups and set up a personal website where users can see a breakdown of your services. How much can you make? Notaries typically make around $30-100 per document depending on the level of complexity. Level of effort required: The licensing component will require some tests and studying, but the work itself isn’t too bad. You do need a really high level of attention to detail, though."

      "title": "Flipping on eBay",
      "content": "Flipping on eBay If you have any kind of niche knowledge about collectibles or quality goods (designer clothing, Pokémon cards, electronics, etc.), pilfering thrift shops can be a fun way to make some great money. Basically, you go to thrift stores and look for items that are severely underpriced. You buy them, then sell them online for a higher amount, which nets a profit. [18] X Research source Requirements: You only need enough money to buy items and the knowledge of what you’re buying. Where to get this job: You can do your buying wherever you’d like, but you’ll want to do your selling on eBay. How much can you make? Anywhere from pocket change to several grand a shopping session. It all depends on the goods you’re buying and selling. Level of effort required: You only have an edge in this game if you know something about items that are commonly sold in thrift shops. It can also be very capital-intensive because you’ll often buy things and then have to wait for a seller to purchase them."

      "content": "3D Printing It’s surprisingly easy these days to get into 3D printing. Devices like the Ender 3 can be purchased for as little as $50 during sales, and it’s easy to design and print things to sell. You do need to learn how to operate the printer, but that doesn’t actually require a ton of effort if you’re into tech stuff to begin with. [19] X Research source Requirements: You need to buy a 3D printer. That’s it! Where to get this job: Once you learn how to print, set up a shop at sites like Etsy or Shapeways to sell your prints. How much can you make? It depends on what you’re selling and in what volume. Level of effort required: Getting a shop running can be tough, but if you enjoy 3D printing it won’t feel like that much work!"

      "content": "Typical Part-Time Job The world is always looking for more bartenders, baristas, servers, and sales reps! Yes, it’s boring, and yes you’ll need to go to your second job on a regular schedule, but it’s probably the most consistent option if you’re just looking to make extra money and you don’t mind working longer hours. Requirements: It depends on the gig, but these kinds of jobs are typically very easy to find and land. Where to get this job: Pop on any job board site and search for the role of your preference. You shouldn’t have a ton of trouble finding something near you. How much can you make? Anywhere from minimum wage to $30 an hour (or higher, if the tips are good). Level of effort required: A part-time job is just a full-time job with fewer hours. They require just as much effort as a traditional full-time job when you’re working, though."

      "content": "Jobs are formal roles while hustles and side gigs are less rigid. A lot of people use these terms interchangeably—and they basically are interchangeable, more or less—but there are a few nuances that you may be interested in: A “job” typically refers to employment. You’ll have a boss, set hours, and clearly defined rules about what’s permissible at work. A “hustle” or “side hustle” can be anything you do to make money on your own. You are your own boss, set your own hours, and you control how much you work. A “side gig” can refer to either a job or side hustle."

A full-time job on its own requires plenty of energy, so it’s even more important that you take care of your body if you have multiple jobs. As tempting as it can be to come home after a very long day of working two jobs and stay up late playing video games or hanging with friends, it really is key that you get enough rest. Always make sure you get at least 8 hours of sleep a night.

Resist this temptation and try to stick to a rigid schedule. It’s okay to take time off when you need it, but if you overdo it you won’t end up making very much money.
