      "content": "Reopen if you discover an asset. This is the most common reason for reopening an estate.

For example, vehicles, boats, bank accounts, and investment accounts should have a title or other documentation identifying the owner. However, other assets don’t. Also look to see who the beneficiary is. Some assets, such as retirement accounts, have designated beneficiaries. If so, then the asset doesn’t need to pass through probate, so you won’t need to reopen the estate. Other assets won’t have a designated beneficiary, which means you will have to collect it for the estate."

      "content": "Consider reopening an estate if you discover a new debt. Someone who lent the deceased money might appear to make a claim for payment from the estate. Be sure to check the validity of the claim, as these are often fraudulent debts. But, in some situations, you may need to reopen the estate. Analyze whether or not the claim is timely. During administration, the personal representative should have given notice to possible creditors via publication in a newspaper or by direct mailing. Creditors then had a certain amount of time to file a claim against the estate. If they file too late, they are typically barred from attempting to collect on the debt. Laws vary by state, so consult a probate attorney and find out if the estate is responsible for the debt."

It should have been signed according to your state’s formalities. The rules differ by state, but generally at least 2 people must witness the signing of the will.

If a new heir steps forward, you’ll have to analyze whether to reopen the estate. Generally, the heir should be mentioned in the will. If not, they usually can’t inherit. Most states don’t require that a person name every heir they are intentionally disinheriting. However, spouses in community law states do not have to be mentioned in the will. If there was no will, then the heir could inherit under the state’s intestacy laws, which apply in the absence of a will. Analyze your state law. For example, in Texas, you can only reopen the estate if property was omitted from the will or not administered in probate. [3] X Research source Look if the personal representative gave the heir notice of the probate proceedings. If not, then you may need to reopen the estate for further administration. However, if the heir did receive notice, they should have pressed their claim during the time prescribed."
