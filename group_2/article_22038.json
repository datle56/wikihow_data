      "content": "Play board or card games. If you’re not alone in the hotel room, and especially if you’re there with children, a board game can be a lot of fun. Even if you’re alone, you could play a game. If you have a deck of cards, try Solitaire ! You could also play Solitaire online. There are many card games you can play if other people are in the room, like poker or gin rummy. You could also make up your own board game ! Some hotels even have board games you can borrow. Ask at the front desk! If not, make sure to bring some along! If you’ve forgotten a board game, you could just play Pictionary with paper and pencils or pens. The goal is to draw a picture that the other people have to guess. Another fun game is the dictionary game. All you need is a dictionary. You choose a word, and all of the other players try to guess what it means. Then you read them one-by-one, including the real definition, and people guess whose definition is the right one. You get points if people guess your definition, even if it's fake, and you get points if you know the meaning of the word."

There are some games you can play without anything special, as long as there is another person in the room. Try playing Charades. You write down movies, books, things and places on pieces of paper and the person who draws it, has to act out what is on the paper, for other people to guess. Charades can work with large families if you divide everyone up into teams. You’re not allowed to speak words when playing Charades. You could play I Spy. Choose an object. The other person must ask you a series of questions to try to guess what it is. Or you could sing 99 bottles of beer on the wall. \"Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" And so on, until you get to 0. [1] X Research source"

Even if you’re there with another adult, a playful pillow fight might be a great way to lighten up the mood and have fun with each other. You could also ball up socks and try to see who can throw most of them into the garbage can."
