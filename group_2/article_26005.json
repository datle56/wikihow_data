      "content": "Get highlights to lighten the color and add dimension. The most fool-proof way to lighten hair is by using bleach. Grey hair is fragile, though, so bleaching your whole head isn’t ideal. Bleached highlights are the way to go if you want to subtly lighten your hair and add natural-looking dimension without damaging it. [1] X Research source You can do your own highlights at home using a bleach kit from a drug or beauty supply store. If you've never done highlights before, you might want to head to the salon for your first time. Highlighted grey hair doesn't need root touch-ups as often as pigmented hair, which is a big plus!"

      "content": "Bleach all of your hair and use a silver toner to adjust the color. Apply bleach to get rid of all pigment—you want your hair to be almost white for this. Then, wash your hair with a silver toning shampoo to introduce gorgeous light grey or silver pigments. Use the shampoo every 2-3 weeks to maintain your new color! [2] X Research source If you want a sparkling light grey color, use silver toning shampoo. If you want light grey without the metallic pigments, look for a toning shampoo in a shade like \"slate.\" [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, apply a high-lift permanent or semi-permanent silver hair dye. Read the instructions for specifics, but you usually saturate your hair with the dye just like you would any other colored dye. Leave it on for the recommended amount of time, rinse it out thoroughly, and follow up with moisturizing conditioner. [4] X Research source “High-lift” means the dye can lighten hair 1-2 shades without bleaching it first. They usually have shade names like “Silver Fox” or “Icy Blonde.” [5] X Research source"

Silver toning shampoo deposits pigments on your hair to enhance and brighten the color, but it doesn't have dye or bleach in it. You apply toning shampoo exactly like normal shampoo, so it’s super easy! Purple toning shampoo can also brighten grey hair, especially if there are yellow tones in there.

      "content": "Use clear or ice blonde hair gloss once a month. Clear glossing products don’t deposit any color, but they do make hair look extra shiny, seal in moisture, and smooth out the shaft. [9] X Research source Semi-permanent glosses deposit silvery or ice blonde pigments to refresh and brighten the color while also boosting shine. [10] X Research source Instructions vary by brand, so be sure to read the packaging insert for more information. Generally, though, you apply and rinse them out just like hair dye."

Build-up on your hair makes it look dull; a clarifying shampoo strips out that unwanted build-up and leaves you with clean, shiny locks. Apply clarifying shampoo, lather it up, and rinse it out thoroughly just like you would normal shampoo. [11] X Research source Build-up is totally normal! It's usually caused by hard water, pollution, and styling products."
