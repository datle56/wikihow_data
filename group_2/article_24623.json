      "content": "Start honing a skill. Circuses have many different acts – and that opens up many different jobs. What’s more, there’s different types of circuses, creating even more opportunities. In order to join a circus, you will need one or more specific skills or talents that a circus would find valuable. This might be Silk aerials, trapeze, acrobatics, juggling, trampolining, tightrope, diabolo, clowning, stilt walking, or anything else remarkable and unique. Most circus work is very strenuous, and you will not be able to learn a skill overnight. It will take dedication, commitment, and practice to become stage ready. If performing isn’t your thing but you still love the thrill a circus brings, there are lots of jobs in circuses that don't require acrobatics or strenuous physical activities. You could work backstage, with costumes, with animals, or set design and production. However, for the purpose of this article, we will be concentrating on circus performers."

      "title": "Be fit and in shape.",
      "content": "Be fit and in shape. Most circus acts, while they look easy and flawless, often need months of practicing and working out before getting it to look right and before it becomes physically safe to do. If you're doing acrobatics, aerials or anything similar, you will need to be very flexible and know how to rely on your body. For trapeze and similar acts, you'll need a lot of upper body strength to keep yourself up and swinging. Most acts will result in the performers getting injured at one point or another; the stronger your body is, the more it can take it. If you're doing something like clowning or juggling, you won't need to be in marathon-running shape, but you'll need to at least be fit enough to do things quickly, or, for example, to keep your arms up and juggling."

      "title": "Think about what kind of gig you want.",
      "content": "Think about what kind of gig you want. There are circus performers that don't work for a single circus, but instead audition to be part of a show, like an actor does for different movies. They don't need to stick with just one company, but can be part of their shows anyway for a select period of time. Alternatively, you might want to be part of an official circus. You'll need to constantly be able to perform, and constantly be doing your best, so you can remain in your circus, too. There are ups and downs to every argument – it’ll come down to a matter of personal preference. Do you want to work for something like Cirque du Soleil? Something more traditional, like Barnum & Bailey’s? Would you rather do something on a smaller level, like performing at fairs and festivals? Ultimately, it’s up to you. Just remember that with bigger gigs and more glory comes more responsibility and commitment, too."

      "title": "Create the basics of an act.",
      "content": "Create the basics of an act. Before attempting to find a circus that will take you on, you'll need to have an act ready to pitch to your potential employers. Having a background in dance, gymnastics, or something similar really helps, but isn't necessary. This way you have a developed routine that you can bust out at the drop of a hat. This will essentially be a job. You'll need to find a coach, get the right equipment (for safety, for example), and set aside time each day to be the best in your field. This has to be a priority to be on circus-level."

      "title": "Perfect your act.",
      "content": "Perfect your act. In order to attract talent scouts and to get recruited onto a team, you’ll need an act to attract the right person. Whether you’re practicing with your brother in the backyard or with your coach at a first-class gym, keep practicing. It should be something you can practically do in your sleep, where you know you won’t hurt yourself and mistakes aren’t common. You want it perfect so when you're called up, you can audition or be a substitute on a second's notice. When you get the circus they may change it as they see fit, but it has to get you there in the first place."

      "title": "Make a demo tape.",
      "content": "Make a demo tape. To apply for worldwide gigs (like Cirque du Soleil), you’ll probably need to make an audition tape, showing your skills. Bigger companies often have online submission forms that you can submit during certain times of year. Showcase the best of your act, follow the appropriate guidelines, and make sure your tape is as professional-looking as possible. Many circus acts have agents and work through recruiters, too. The more time you spend in the field, the more networked you'll be, making it easier to make and find connections."

      "title": "Consider going to circus school.",
      "content": "Consider going to circus school. Though they don’t get a lot of press, there are legitimate, credible circus schools out there that are looking for students to teach with skills they can help hone. If there’s one in your area (or even if there’s not), look into it – it’s a great way to meet people that are already established in the field. There’s a great job outlook, too. Most schools tout one of their biggest selling points as placing 100% (or nearly 100%) of their graduates in jobs."

      "content": "Start with corporate events, private parties, and halftime shows. Most people don’t start out playing with the big boys – they do small gigs and then get noticed, breaking in through making a name for themselves. To do this, take whatever opportunities you can. Your high school talent show, your dad’s business luncheon, or the halftime show at a local football game. if you build up your resume, more people will look at your act and take it seriously. Tell your friends and family members to talk to their friends and family members about your act. You may get booked into private parties and local events just by word of mouth. This is one of the most reliable ways to market yourself and it can spread like wildfire."

      "title": "Consider doing long-term gigs, like on cruise ships.",
      "content": "Consider doing long-term gigs, like on cruise ships. In addition to small, one-off gigs like private parties, think of less traditional semi-related gigs like on cruise ships. You work in a show put together by the cruise line for 6-9 months and then that’s that. This is a great stepping stone to getting to one of the bigger, official circuses around. Consider websites like Workaway [1] X Research source , too, where you can sign up for a period of time and be part of the circus in exchange for room and board. It’s not glamorous, but it’s a step in the right direction!"

      "content": "Participate in circus festivals. Yep, those are a thing. The American Youth Circus Organization holds the Youth Circus Festival every year in August, just as one example. [2] X Research source Some people are asked to perform and others get lucky enough to nab a slot – but either way, you’ll be able to showcase your stuff and get seen. Apply as early as you can, talk to your coach, agent, or recruiter, and get your name in the ring. It may, at least initially, cost you money for travel and what not, but it's a small sacrifice to make to be showcased."

      "content": "Apply to and join a circus troupe. Now that you’ve built up your resume and have an act you can rely on, go for the big leagues. Apply to the next variation of Cirque du Soleil or Barnum & Bailey’s and get ready for the life of a circus performer. Can you believe you made it happen? Sometimes you'll apply and won't hear for months. If you don't hear back automatically, don't give up hope, but keep applying elsewhere. Don't shy away from international gigs, too."

      "title": "Live on the road.",
      "content": "Live on the road. The one brutal fact that most circus hopefuls don't really think about is the fact that they'll be away from home, constantly living out of a suitcase. Life onstage will be glamorous, but life offstage means hotels, vending machines, and sleeping in cars. Some people find this life rewarding, but others find it very challenging. To make it, you've gotta be the kind that thrives in this setting. It can be very lonely, too. You'll develop a circus family definitely, but your real family may even be thousands of miles away. This, of course, depends on your contract. Only sign up for a period of time you know you can handle."

      "title": "Understand what you're getting yourself into.",
      "content": "Understand what you're getting yourself into. Life in a circus isn't all glamorous as it's made out to be. If you're working with a traveling circus, you might have to deal with moving around a lot, and you will probably have to do your own makeup and need to buy or make your own costumes. Working with circuses requires a lot of dedication just to stay optimistic for shows. If you're working for a legitimate, big business circus, most odds and ends (like costumes) will be handled for you. But if you're working on a smaller circuit, you may need to take certain expenses on yourself. Consider it the price to pay for doing something you love."

      "title": "Be determined.",
      "content": "Be determined. You will, without a doubt, run across people that will say \"No.” You will be told to give up, people won't hire you, and you will get injured or run the risk of being injured if you are a performer. It's very important you be able to push through these walls – or perhaps trapeze your way over them. If you are dedicated and love performing, you will find a job that works for you, and you will be able to continue performing. No one makes it on their first try. You have to hear a chorus of rejections before you finally \"get your break.\" It could take months, it could take years, but you've got to trust that eventually it'll happen. If you don't believe in you, no one else will."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be ready for the physical demands.",
      "content": "Be ready for the physical demands. Being a circus performer is almost like being an athlete – your career will be over well before you feel like you're \"old.\" And when you do near the end of your run, your body will have been rung through the wringer. You could be in tiptop shape or you could need two knee replacements. It won't be easy, but hopefully the physical stress is worth it. In fact, your body basically means your job. If you don't take care of it, you could be out of a gig in no time. It's important to sleep, eat right, stay healthy, and, above all, stay safe. The last thing you want to do is compromise your career because you made poor decisions."

    {
      "title": "Don’t do it for the money.",
      "content": "Don’t do it for the money. How does circus work pay? Although it differs from circus to circus, it mostly depends on the job, the show, and the length of which you're working. For example, a circus might pay their performers at the end of each week, or (although it's less common) after the show closes. If you're a performer that hires out to circuses, then you'll mostly be paid after the job ends, although they can choose to pay you weekly, sometimes even after each show (although that is highly uncommon, too). This aside, you should probably want to work in a circus for your love of the work first, the money second. What’s more, every role gets paid differently, too. If you’re at the bottom of the ladder, you may be getting $300 bucks a week; if you’re a featured performer like an acrobat or a contortionist, you could be making between $40,000 to $70,000 a year. Don’t forget – you’re getting free room and board, too. [3] X Research source The perks just keep on coming."
