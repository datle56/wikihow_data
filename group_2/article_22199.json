      "content": "Be careful not to offend people. As you develop your sense of humor , make sure you avoid jokes that are highly offensive to others. Keegan says that “everyone has their own sense of humor. And when you're getting to know someone, you want to feel them out…when you're putting your humor out there, start soft, but start subtle and see how the person responds to it. And if they're responding well to it and they're laughing, you can amp it up.” Think about whether a joke is appropriate for work, a date, or the group of people you are with. Know the difference between punching up and punching down. Punching up challenges the status quo by poking at a powerful group. Punching down reinforces the status quo by making fun of a vulnerable or oppressed group. Racist, sexist, and crude humor can be extremely offensive. Joking about a person's religion, political beliefs, and other belief systems may also cross into offensive territory. Save the tasteless, offensive jokes for your head or for those \"anything goes\" friends. Don't use others to get a laugh, and don't laugh when people make fun of others. If people seem quiet or uncomfortable, switch to a new topic.
