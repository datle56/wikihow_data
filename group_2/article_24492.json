For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.” Psalm 1:1-2: “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law, and he meditates day and night.”"
