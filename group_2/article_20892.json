Drugs can have interactions that create negative side effects.

Let your doctor and dentist know if you have jaw problems while on Prolia. You may need a dental exam before you can begin Prolia as well. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a demonstration from your healthcare provider. It’s important that you don’t attempt to inject yourself (or someone else) with a shot of Prolia unless you’ve been trained by a professional. Ask your doctor to show you how to use it before you attempt to administer the injection at home. If you feel uncomfortable administering the injection yourself, simply go to your healthcare provider each time you need a dose. They will be happy to do it for you."

      "content": "Remove the pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator 30 minutes before use. A room-temperature injection will be more comfortable than a cold one. Take the medication out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes or so before you administer the shot. Don’t try to warm the syringe by using a heat source (like a microwave or hot water). Let it warm up naturally. Heating up the syringe can compromise the medication or even cause the syringe to crack. Be sure that you don’t expose the syringe to direct sunlight while you wait for it to warm up as sunlight can contaminate the medication inside the syringe."

Don’t use the syringe if the medicine inside is cloudy or has particles in it, if any part of the syringe appears cracked or broken, or if the needle cap is missing or not fully attached. Instead, grab a new syringe from your packet, or contact your healthcare provider if you are out of syringes. You should also discard the syringe if the medicine is past its expiration date, which will be printed on the syringe label."
