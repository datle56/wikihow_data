      "title": "Varre's questline will take you directly to Mohgwyn's Palace.",
      "content": "Varre's questline will take you directly to Mohgwyn's Palace. Inside the Palace is where you'll find Mohg. It's a very long quest line that you can easily lose track of, so there's another way that you can get to Mohg in Mohgwyn's Palace. This might be the faster option if you have many sites of grace unlocked and can just port to different places. The questline used to require PVP to continue, but since August 2022's patch, there's now a PVE option. Varre's questline overview includes: Speak to Varre when you first enter Limgrave. (exhaust his dialogue options) Speak to Varre when you first get to Roundtable Hold. Speak to Varre in Rose Church when you get your first Great Rune (from Godrick the Grafted) in exchange for a Festering Bloody Finger. You have 2 options next: Option 1 (PVP): Invade 3 players using the Festering Bloody Finger. You don't have to kill the invasion targets. OR Option 2 (PVE): Find the invasion sign in Writheblood Ruins and defeat Magnus the Beast Claw, an NPC. Speak to Varre after either of these options to get the Lord Blood's Favor. Use the Lord Blood's Favor at the maiden corpse in the Church of Inhibition to get a reusable Bloody Finger. You can also find a maiden corpse at the Church of Anticipation. Return to the Rose Church to speak with Varre again and get a Bloody Finger and a Pureblood Knight's Medal. The Medal transports you to Mohgwyn Palace, so you can go to Mohg or continue with Varre's questline."

      "content": "Get both halves of the Haligtree Medallion. If you don't already have the full medallion, read this wikiHow article to learn how to get both parts. Getting to Mohg this way is better for those without many sites of grace unlocked or if you've missed parts of Varre's questline."

      "content": "Go to the base of Grand Lift of Rold. This is the lift you use to travel between Forbidden Lands and the Mountaintops of the Giants. Use your D-pad's left or right buttons to select the \"Hoist secret medallion\" option. This initially says \"Hoist medallion\", but you want to make sure it says \"Secret\" for this to work. The lift will take you down to Consecrated Snowfield. This is also called the \"Hidden Path to the Haligtree dungeon\"."

      "content": "Mohg is double resistant to fire and normally resistant to physical damage. Since he isn't damaged as much by these two types of damage, you'll want to use another type of damage if you can, like Gravity Magic. Breaking his Poise is the best way to deal damage. You also want to use medallions or armor to build up your resistance to fire and physical damage."

      "content": "Use Mohg's Shackle. You can use this tool while his health is pretty full, which is during the phase when he's not very mobile. However, Mohg's Shackle guarantees a free crit, so you can at least cause some free damage. You can use Mohg's Shackle 2 times. You can find these Shackles in the Subterranean Shunning Grounds."

      "content": "Watch out for Bloodflames. During the first phase, you're able to wail on Mohg since he is immobile. He doesn't move for the beginning part of the fight, but Mohg still attacks with his spear. Avoid the attacks and don't get hit by the Bloodflame Talons, an attack that leaves three claw marks in the air. Also don't stand in any Bloodflame attacks on the ground, since stepping into these flames results in Blood Loss build-up, a mechanic for this fight that factors into how much health you lose during the battle."

      "title": "Strike from behind during Mohg's Ritual Countdown.",
      "content": "Strike from behind during Mohg's Ritual Countdown. You'll see circular red marks around your character and that should prompt you to attack Mohg from behind. Mohg will begin counting down from three in Latin (Tres, Duo, Unnus) before his main spear attack, so make sure you aren't in the way and are safely behind him. Use heavy attacks to try to break his Poise, but he will continue to perform Ritual Countdown 3 times. When Mohg reaches 50% health, he will start the Bloodboon Ritual. He shouts, \"Nihil,\" which means, \"Nothing.\" This is an unavoidable mechanic of the fight. Your character will lose health (depending on the accrued Blood Loss in the previous phase), and the boss will gain health. Mohg will repeat this unavoidable attack two more times."

      "title": "Watch Mohg's wings and stay close.",
      "content": "Watch Mohg's wings and stay close. After the Bloodboon Ritual, Mohg grows wings and is more mobile. He will occasionally jump up and swoop down, unleashing spurts of Bloodflame that you need to avoid. The camera lock-on is a nice feature to keep track of Mohg when he flies out of view but also makes it difficult to see the Bloodflame patches. If you find that you're consistently dying to Bloodflame, consider turning off the camera-lock so you can see more of the floor and Bloodflame areas to avoid. This is his last phase! You've made it past \"Nihil\" and can finally finish him!"
