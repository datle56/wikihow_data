      "content": "Measure the circumference of your head using a tailor’s tape measure. Wrap the tape measure around the top of your head, so that the measurement goes horizontally across your forehead. Then, jot the measurement on a scratch piece of paper. If you do not have a tailor’s tape measure, take a piece of string and wrap it around your head and then measure the length of the string. If you are helping someone else make the crown, measure the head of the person who will be wearing the crown."

      "content": "Cut a 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) wide strip of poster board to fit around your head. Use a ruler and a pencil to draw a line across the poster board that matches the head measurements. Add at least 2 in (5.1 cm) of extra length to the strip so you will be able to overlap the ends and secure them. This will be the interior band of the crown. Make the strip 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) wide to give the base ample support. Then, use a pair of scissors to cut out the measured strip. [1] X Research source If you do not have a poster board, use a thin piece of cardstock or glue 2 pieces of construction paper together. Use a washable glue stick or liquid glue."

      "content": "Cut a 5–6 in (13–15 cm) wide strip of construction paper to fit around your head. Pick a color of construction paper that you want the outside of your crown to be, as this strip of construction paper will be the exterior of your crown. Then, measure and cut a strip that is 2 in (5.1 cm) longer than your head measurement, and about 5–6 in (13–15 cm) wide. The wider the strip is, the taller the points will be on your crown. [2] X Research source Since a standard piece of construction paper is only 12 in (30 cm) long, you may need to use 2 similarly colored sheets to accomplish this. Simply overlap the 2 sheets of construction paper and secure with clear tape or washable glue."

Make sure the bottom edges and both sides line up. Then, use washable glue or double-stick tape to secure the pieces together. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use scissors to cut a zigzag across the exposed top of the construction paper.",
      "content": "Use scissors to cut a zigzag across the exposed top of the construction paper. Only cut into the width of the exposed construction paper, as cutting the cardstock will lessen the sturdiness of the crown. Make the points of each triangle as wide or as narrow as you want. Alternate between wide and narrow points, or have every triangle equilateral. To better visualize your particular design, use a ruler and a pencil to draw it along the construction paper before cutting it. Add little embellishments to the top of each triangular point. For instance, you can cut out little circles, crosses, or fleur-de-lis at the top of each point around the crown. Instead of the traditional triangular points, have fun creating a design unique to your crown. For example, create a wave around the crown to make the design more fluid like water."

      "content": "Decorate the outside of the crown to reflect your personality or costume. Use stickers, markers, crayons, rhinestones, glitter, or small shapes cut from construction paper to decorate the outside of your crown. Try to lay out all of your decorations before gluing them down. This way you can play around with the design. Glue heavier items like beads or rhinestones along the bottom half of the crown that is supported by the interior cardstock band. Otherwise, the weighty items will bend the construction paper points."

      "content": "Design a traditional yellow crown that has colored rhinestones for gems. Encircle the crown with a line of brightly colored rhinestones. Place them about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the bottom edge of the crown, and leave 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of space between them. Use clear tape or washable glue to attach a circle of red felt into the center of the crown. This will make the crown look even more regal."

      "content": "Glue some fabric leaves onto a green colored crown to make it nature inspired. Use various green, orange, and red colored leaves. Arrange the fabric leaves around the base of the crown to make them the focal point. Then, use a brown marker to draw branches along the points of the crown. Alternatively, place the leaves just beneath the points of the crown. Then, use fake moss to frame the base of the crown. Purchase an assortment of inexpensive fabric leaves and fake moss at a local craft store, or online through major retailers. Instead of fabric leaves, cut some out of green, red, and orange construction paper."

      "content": "Make an oceanic crown by decorating it with seashell cutouts. Draw and cut variously shaped seashells from white construction paper. Use them to line the base of a blue crown. Add additional cutouts of red coral or green seaweed to finish decorating the points of the crown. If you have access to real seashells, you can use those to decorate the crown instead. Just make sure to only glue the real seashells around the base of the crown to avoid bending the points."

      "content": "Add some sparkle to your crown by outlining it with glitter glue. Place a piece of newspaper underneath the crown to keep your work surface clean. Then, carefully apply your favorite color of the glitter glue to the crown. Outline the crown to give it dimension or draw simple shapes to represent glittering jewels. Purchase glitter glue either in a squeeze applicator or a jar at a local craft store or online with major retailers. If you get glitter glue that is in a jar, make sure to also get a paintbrush so you can easily apply it to your crown."

Then, allow the crown to dry for another 30 minutes. If you did not use any glue to decorate your crown, you do not have to let it air-dry."

      "content": "Join the ends of the crown so it forms a ring and secure it with washable glue. The ends of the crown should overlap about 1 in (2.5 cm) or less with your design facing outwards. Use a washable glue stick or liquid glue to secure the overlapped ends. Hold the seam closed for 1-2 minutes to give the glue a chance to dry. [4] X Research source If needed, reinforce the inside of the seam with clear tape."
