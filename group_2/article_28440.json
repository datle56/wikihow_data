To get the egg white, you will need to separate it from the yolk first, and then add it to the rest of your ingredients. Here is how you can separate the egg white from the egg yolk: Crack open an egg and let the yolk settle into one of the shell halves. Hold both halves of the shell over a bowl, and pass the yolk back and forth between each one. Each time the yolk lands in a shell, a little bit of the egg white dribbles into the bowl. Do this until all of the egg white is in the bowl. You can discard the egg yolk or you can save it and use it for something else, such as cooking or a hair mask ."
