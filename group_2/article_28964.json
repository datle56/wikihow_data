The stud can be made of jewels, beads, sequins, or anything with a tiny, flat surface. For the adhesive, fake eyelash glue is recommended, as it is soft and doesn't harm the skin.

Place your materials on a flat surface covered in paper towel, ideally close to a mirror. The paper towel will prevent eyelash glue on any surfaces, and will catch your nose stud if you accidentally drop it. If you're not sure what type of gem you'd like to use, hold a few in place to see which you like the most."

      "content": "Gather your materials. Whereas making a stud relies on glue, making a hoop requires a bit more effort. You'll need a pair of pliers, a pen or pencil, a file, and either some wire or a headpin. Use wire or a head pin depending on how you want your nose ring to look. For example, do you want your hoop to be thick (head pin) or thin (wire), gold or silver. Florists wire works well if you're interested in a thin hoop. These supplies can be purchased at any craft store. It may take a few tries to get your nose ring just right, but once you become comfortable working with these materials, you'll be rocking a unique hoop in no time."

Once the wire/pin is properly bent, you should see a tiny \"O\" or closed \"U\" shape at the end of your wire. This round end will make your piercing safe and prevent it from scratching your nose. The \"O\" end will go on the inside of your nose. File the other end of the pin/wire. Using a file on the other end of your wire/pin will prevent it from scratching the outside of your nose.

You should be able to bend your hoop fairly easily, and your nose ring should stay in place until you take it off. Remember, this is not a real piercing, and could potentially slide off at anytime. For this reason, it's best to take off your nose ring while sleeping, showering, swimming, or doing anything overly active."
