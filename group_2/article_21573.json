      "content": "Avoid spending your startup gems. Clash of Clans starts you off with a large sum of gems; while you'll have to spend around half of them in order to finish the tutorial, you'll be left with the remaining gems. It can be tempting to blow these gems on as many items as possible, but remembering to be frugal is a great way to start off your game on the correct foot. [2] X Research source Gems also shouldn't be used to purchase resources or decrease building times. Again, patience is your friend when attempting to build up your gem inventory."

This will award you various amounts of gems ranging from 0 to 6. Some obstacles, such as trees, will respawn every 8 hours. Rocks do not respawn, so consider removing them after removing an obstacle for which you received 0 gems. This will almost always ensure that you receive at least 1 gem for removing the rocks."

Pouring elixirs into building the Gem Mine may seem like a strange way to spend your hard-earned resources, but the Gem Mine will automatically reward you with at least 2 gems per day whether or not you play. [3] X Research source You'll need to retrieve your gems periodically depending on the Gem Mine's level. For example, a level 1 Gem Mine can hold a maximum of 10 gems before it will stop producing them. Retrieving your gems will allow the Gem Mine to resume production. At its highest tier, the Gem Mine can store up to 18 gems. [4] X Research source"

Completing enough surveys will give you the cash needed to purchase more gems. This isn't a hack, but it's a relatively quick way to earn a small, disposable amount of money with which you can feel comfortable buying gems. Google Opinion Rewards can be downloaded for free from the Google Play Store."
