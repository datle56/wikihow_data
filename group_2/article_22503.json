      "title": "Turn your shirt inside out.",
      "content": "Turn your shirt inside out. If you don't already know how short you want to cut your shirt, put it on, and make a mark on it where you want the new hem to be. You can use a dressmaker's chalk, dressmaker's pen, or even a sewing pin for this. Take the shirt off when you are done, and keep it turned inside out. This may also work on other shirts made from stretchy material. It is not recommended for shirts made out of woven material, such as linen, due to fraying."

      "title": "Cut your shirt ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) longer than you want it to be.",
      "content": "Cut your shirt ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) longer than you want it to be. If you want to be extra neat, draw a line using a dressmaker's chalk or pen first, so you will know where to cut. Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt as you draw the line. This will ensure that the shirt will be the same length all around."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the hem up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).",
      "content": "Fold the hem up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). This will be the inside of your hem. Your shirt should now be the exact length you want it to be. You don't have to double-fold or finish the raw edge, because T-shirt material does not fray much, if at all. If you want a nicer finish on the inside, then you can serge the raw edge, but it is not necessary."

      "title": "Press the hem flat with an iron.",
      "content": "Press the hem flat with an iron. Make sure that you use a heat setting that is safe for the material your shirt is made out of. This will give your shirt a nice, crisp edge all along the bottom."

    {
      "title": "Secure the hem with sewing pins.",
      "content": "Secure the hem with sewing pins. If you do not own a sewing machine, or if you do not know how to sew, slip some iron-on hem tape into the hem first. The results will be stiffer, but at least you won't have to do any sewing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sew as close to the raw edge as you can using a zigzag stitch or a stretch stitch.",
      "content": "Sew as close to the raw edge as you can using a zigzag stitch or a stretch stitch. Use a color that matches your shirt, and remove the pins as you sew. For a more professional finish, you can use a double-pointed needle. Alternatively, you can sew a second line right beneath the first one; this only works with the stretch-stitch, however. If you are using iron-on hem tape , simply iron over the hem following the instructions on the package. Be sure to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing a few times to prevent unraveling. Try to start sewing at one of the side seams. This will help conceal the start and end of your sewing better."

Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt every so often. This will ensure that your shirt is the same length all the way around. If you can't find a dressmaker's chalk or pen, you can make the line using sewing pins instead; just be careful not to pin both sides of the shirt together."

This method may work with other non-button-up shirts made from woven material, such as tunics and peasant blouses."

Spread your shirt out on a flat surface in front of you, with the inside facing you. Draw a line along the bottom edge of the shirt. Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt to the line that you are drawing. This will ensure that the line is an even distance from the bottom edge of the shirt. Most button-up shirts have a curved hem, so your line should curve as well. If you want your shirt to have a flat bottom, simply draw a line straight across the bottom of the shirt. Align it with the shortest part of the shirt, usually at the side seams."

An easy way to do this is to align the edge of the sewing machine's foot with the bottom edge of the shirt. Remove pins as you sew, and be sure to use a thread color that matches the fabric of your shirt. Remember to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing. If your shirt is not a button-up shirt, start sewing at one of the side seams. This will conceal the beginning and ending of your sewing better."

If you have a light blue shirt, and can't find any matching bias tape, get some light grey bias tape instead. This method works great on shirts that you are sewing from scratch!"
