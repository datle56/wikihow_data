      "content": "Place the flour, ground pepper, cumin, and salt in a bowl. Put 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp. of ground pepper, 1 tsp. of ground cumin, and 1/2 tsp. of salt in a large bowl. Though Urad flour is the most traditional flour used for making poppadoms, it can be a little difficult to find if you don't have any luck at your local Indian or Asian markets. If you can't find it, you can use garbanzo bean or chickpea flour instead."

      "content": "Toss in 1 minced garlic clove and mix well. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly stir the ingredients together until they are blended. Make sure that the garlic is fairly well distributed throughout the dough. Once you've stirred the dough for at least 30 seconds to a minute, make a little depression in the top of the dough for the water you'll add."

      "content": "Mix the ingredients together until a firm, dry dough forms. At first, you should use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together, if you wish. As the mixture gets a bit more formed, you can start using your hands. Alternately, you can just use your hands to incorporate the water right away."

Now, just use your hands to knead the dough in the bowl until you've made a nice, substantive mixture that you can work with and all of the ingredients are incorporated. The water should help everything stick together."

      "content": "Break off one walnut-sized piece of dough at a time and then roll it. Use a roller to roll each piece back and forth until it is nice and thin. You should use a lightly floured, lightly oiled surface for best results, so that the poppadom pieces are easier to cook. Many poppadom recipes call for you to actually shape each piece into a circle, using either a shaper or an old CD or DVD to get the shape you're going for, though it doesn't really matter because the shape won't perfectly stay as it is. You can also brush a bit of extra oil or ghee on each piece of dough to make it even easier to cook."

      "content": "Sprinkle each thin circle with cayenne pepper. This can add an extra spicy kick to your finished poppadoms later on. You can turn the poppadoms over and even sprinkle them with the spice on both sides if you really want to go for the full effect."

      "content": "Transfer the thin pieces of dough onto 2 large baking sheets. Now that you've prepared your poppadoms for baking, all you have to do is carefully place them on a baking tray lined with foil. You can even oil it a bit to keep the poppadoms from sticking. Make sure you leave enough room between each piece of dough so they don't stick together when they expand a bit during cooking. You may need to fit several baking sheets in the oven at a time, or to bake your poppadoms in several shifts if you only have one sheet."

Keep an eye on your dough after the first 10 minutes or so to make sure it doesn't burn too fast. The finished product should be crisp and dry, but not so dry that it instantly breaks at the touch."

If you don't want to fry your baked poppadoms and enjoy the crisp and dry baked version, then you can stop before frying them. However, frying your poppadoms after baking them will give you that delightful, authentic taste you may be craving."

Carefully watch over it as it fries. Of course, you can deep fry more than one poppadom at a time if you're getting really impatient, but this can lead to problems because they may fuse together, or you may lose track of one of them and lead it to burn a bit. The poppadom will begin to \"pop\" out a bit, and will take on a more full, airy texture."

It won't need to cook for as long on the second side as on the first, though you should watch to make sure it is cooked evenly on both sides and cook it for a bit longer or for a bit less time on the second side if necessary.

To do this successfully, of course, you need to find a warm place with direct sunlight, with a temperature that should be ideally at least 80-85ºF (25-30ºC), if not much warmer. The warmer it is, of course, the more quickly your poppadoms will bake. Alternately, you can dry them in the oven at the lowest possible setting, for around 4-6 hours. [2] X Research source"
