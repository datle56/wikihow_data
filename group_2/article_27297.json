      "content": "Combine the egg whites and lemon juice in a large bowl to make royal icing . Beat the egg whites on a high speed until they are white and frothy. Add powdered sugar 2 tablespoons at a time to combine gradually, on a speed just high enough that the sugar doesn't fly up all over the counter. The icing should have the consistency of stiff peanut butter by the time all the sugar has been combined. The icing will secure the graham cracker walls of the house and stick the candy decorations to the surface. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place large spoonfuls of the royal icing into quart-size zipped style freezer bags. Avoid regular thickness sandwich bags because the plastic is too thin and will not hold up to the punishment of being used as a pastry tube. An unzipped plastic bag the size of a bread bag will also work, and it will hold more icing. Approximately 1 cup of icing each small bag is enough. If decorating with friends or family, make sure that each gingerbread artist has his or her own bag of icing."
