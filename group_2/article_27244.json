      "content": "Start with 8 slices of slightly stale or toasted bread. The texture of your French toast will be best if you have day-old or slightly stale bread. The bread will be more firm, so it will hold up better when you dip it into the liquid mixture. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Whisk eggs, milk, sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a shallow, rimmed dish.",
      "content": "Whisk eggs, milk, sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a shallow, rimmed dish. Measure out 2 eggs, 1 cup (240 mL) milk, 1 tbsp (12 g) of sugar or your favorite sugar substitute, and a pinch each of salt and cinnamon. Then, add them to a shallow dish. Your cleanup will be easiest if you mix all your ingredients into the same dish you're going to dip your bread into. Once everything is added, use a whisk to mix all of the ingredients together thoroughly. [2] X Research source You can use any kind of milk, from skim to whole, or you can make the dish a little more indulgent by using heavy cream instead. You can also use a non-dairy option, like almond milk or coconut milk, if you prefer. A cake pan or serving dish would be perfect for this. Whatever dish you choose, make sure it has a rim so your ingredients don't spill. Also, it's best if the dish has a flat bottom so you can dip the bread easily."

      "content": "Include a vanilla substitute or omit the vanilla entirely, if you'd like. Your French bread will be perfectly delicious if you decide to just skip over the vanilla and continue making your French toast as-is. However, if you'd like to incorporate a little more flavor into the dish, you can try replacing the vanilla with a substitute like maple syrup, bourbon, or almond extract. [3] X Research source Keep reading for a more detailed list of vanilla substitutions, as well as the measurements you'd use for each one!"

      "title": "Melt a pat of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.",
      "content": "Melt a pat of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Swirl the pan as the butter melts to help it spread across the pan evenly. Exactly how much butter you need will depend on the size of the skillet you're using—you want the butter to lightly coat the bottom of the skillet when it melts. [4] X Research source About 1/2-1 tbsp (7-14 g) of butter should be enough to cook 2 pieces of bread at a time. If you are making 8 pieces of bread, you'll need this amount of butter 4 times."

      "content": "Dip one slice of bread in the dish, then flip it and dip the other side. Once the butter in your skillet is melted, work quickly to dip the bread for the first batch. Take one piece of bread and place it flat into the shallow dish with the eggs and milk. Immediately flip it over to dip the other side, but don't leave either side in the mixture or the bread will get soggy. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the bread in the skillet and cook each side for 2-3 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the bread in the skillet and cook each side for 2-3 minutes. Once you dip the bread, quickly transfer it to the skillet with the hot butter. You should hear a sizzle as the egg mixture hits the hot pan. Allow the bread to cook for about 2 or 3 minutes, then flip it over with a spatula and cook the other side. [6] X Research source If you're cooking 2 pieces of bread at a time, quickly dip the second piece and add it to the pan as well. You want the bread to be a rich golden brown on each side. Continue cooking the bread in batches until it's all finished."

      "content": "Serve the French toast hot with the toppings of your choice. French toast is best eaten right away, so once it's finished cooking, place it on a plate and add your favorite toppings. For instance, you might drizzle maple syrup over your toast, or you might add sliced fruit and powdered sugar. [7] X Research source Other toppings might include jam, honey, caramel syrup, apple butter, or peanut butter. If you won't be serving the French toast right away, place it on a baking sheet and keep it in a 250 °F (121 °C) oven for up to 30 minutes."

      "content": "Keep leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days. While your French toast will have the best texture right after it's cooked, if you have leftovers, you can place them in a sealed container or freezer bag in the refrigerator for 2 days. Reheat it in the microwave or your toaster. [8] X Research source If you need to store the French toast longer, freeze it in an airtight container for up to 2 months. If you want, you can make French toast healthier. [9] X Research source Use a whole-grain bread. [10] X Research source The bread should be low in added sugar and high in fiber.

      "title": "Use maple syrup or honey in place of vanilla for a rich, sweet taste.",
      "content": "Use maple syrup or honey in place of vanilla for a rich, sweet taste. Maple syrup is a common substitute for vanilla because they have a similar flavor profile. Honey is also often used in place of vanilla, although it has its own unique taste. Luckily, you can substitute either one in a 1:1 ratio, so if you needed 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of vanilla extract, you could use 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of maple syrup or honey, instead. [12] X Research source Both honey and maple syrup are sweeter than vanilla, so you may want to cut back on the sugar in the recipe, or omit it entirely."

      "title": "Try using half the amount of almond extract instead of vanilla.",
      "content": "Try using half the amount of almond extract instead of vanilla. Almond extract has a sweet, complex taste similar to cherries. Since almond extract is a strong flavor, you only need half the amount that you would need if you were using vanilla. [13] X Research source For instance, if you need 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of vanilla extract for your French toast, you would use 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of almond extract, instead."

      "title": "Replace the vanilla with bourbon or brandy for boozy French toast.",
      "content": "Replace the vanilla with bourbon or brandy for boozy French toast. Bourbon has a natural smoky vanilla flavor, and brandy typically has a sweet, fruity taste. Either way, if you have them in your liquor cabinet, you can add a splash to give your French bread a richer flavor. [14] X Research source Similar to maple syrup, you can use these replacements in a 1:1 ratio, so you'll need 1 tsp (4.9 mL) to replace the vanilla in your French toast."

For instance, if the recipe calls for a pinch of cinnamon, you might increase it to 1 1/2—2 tsp (3—4 g) instead. [15] X Research source You don't need to adjust any of the other ingredients in the recipe."
