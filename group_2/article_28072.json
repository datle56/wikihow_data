      "title": "Convince your friend that the trick will work.",
      "content": "Convince your friend that the trick will work. Explain to your friend that the motions you are about to perform will make them feel like a string is being pulled from their hand, even though it isn’t there. Speak without a shadow of a doubt in your voice because a lot of this trick is mental, so you really have to project confidence. [1] X Research source To make your explanation more convincing, use big words, like saying the trick uses psychological principles to create tactile illusions."

      "title": "Ask your friend to clench their fist hard with their palm facing up.",
      "content": "Ask your friend to clench their fist hard with their palm facing up. Really emphasize the importance of squeezing their fist as hard as they can. Ask them to do it harder once or twice, just to drive the point home. It shouldn’t hurt though, so if your friend has long nails don’t make them clench their hand super hard."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub your fingers over their fist for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Rub your fingers over their fist for 30 seconds. Rub your fingers over their fist as though it were covered in something sticky you were trying to peel off. Be gentle but firm. Count to 30 out loud as you do this. It will make the process feel a bit more ritualistic. Remember that the point is to convince your friend that this will work, so be confident in your movements."

    {
      "title": "Ask your friend to open their fist very slowly, palm down.",
      "content": "Ask your friend to open their fist very slowly, palm down. It should take at least 15 seconds, but there is really no such thing as too slow here. If they move too quickly, gently remind them to slow down. Tell them the trick will only work if they don't rush it—that way you have an out if they don't feel anything. [2] X Research source When their hand is fully open, flip it over so their palm faces up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run your pointer finger over each of their fingers.",
      "content": "Run your pointer finger over each of their fingers. Starting at the center of their palm, run your pointer finger softly and slowly up the length of each of their fingers. Stay very solemn and focused as you do this. You can also squeeze the tips of their fingers, as an alternative."

    {
      "title": "Pretend to pull a string out of their palm.",
      "content": "Pretend to pull a string out of their palm. Pinch your thumb and index fingers together so there’s no space between them. Place these fingers on the outsides of your friend’s palm and drag them softly toward the middle in a pinching motion. Slowly lift your fingers into the air above their palm in a pantomime of pulling string. Practice this motion on your own hand a few times before you actually perform the trick so that you can pull it off smoothly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respond to your friend’s reaction.",
      "content": "Respond to your friend’s reaction. If the trick works they will probably look surprised, gasp, or make some sort of exclamation. If they don't seem to react, you can ask, “Do you feel that?” in an expectant voice. If they don't feel anything, casually explain that it doesn’t always work on everyone, and suggest they may have opened their fist too quickly, or not clenched it tightly enough in the first place. [3] X Research source Some people are more susceptible to this trick than others, so try on a few other friends if it didn’t work the first time."
