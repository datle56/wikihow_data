      "content": "Make sure your guinea pig is healthy. Lethargy and inactivity can be a sign of illness, as can the refusal to eat or drink. It's important to confirm that your guinea pig is simply bored and mildly depressed - which can be treated with increased stimulation and socialization - and not seriously ill. [1] X Research source Lethargy, for example, often accompanies misaligned teeth, infection, and obesity, all of which are dangerous for guinea pigs. [2] X Research source Assess whether your guinea pig is suffering from other signs of illness, such as drooling, loose stools, puffed-up coat, and frequent coughing or sneezing. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should consult a veterinarian who has experience with guinea pigs. If you don't notice these other signs, then consider the following steps to make life happier and more exciting for your guinea pig."

      "content": "Make sure your guinea pig has a companion. Guinea pigs are social animals that thrive with companions. A bond between a guinea pig and a human can never compete with the bond between two or more guinea pigs. In fact, in Switzerland, it is illegal to own just one guinea pig! Unless specifically instructed by a veterinarian, every guinea pig needs to be kept with a companion. Two guinea pigs actually don't require much more work than keeping one. The space requirements are the same; either one or two guinea pigs will need 7.5 square feet. Multiple guinea pigs will keep each other company when you are unable to socialize with them. Having a companion can help build your guinea pig's confidence and be more comfortable around you."

      "content": "Ensure that your guinea pig's cage is large enough. The Humane Society of the United States has noted that most commercial cages available for guinea pigs are too small. Guinea pigs are animals that love to move around. The happiest guinea pigs have ample space in their cages to run, exercise, and play. Guinea pigs need a minimum of 7.5 square feet of floor space in their cages, but more space is even better. If you have one guinea pig, aim for a cage about 30\" x 36\"; if you have two guinea pigs, try to get a cage that is 30\" x 50\". As a general tip, there should always be room in any cage for exercise space, a food bowl, a tunnel or box for your guinea pig to hide in or under, and a place for your guinea pig to go to the bathroom. A good rule to determine how many square feet you need is to take the number of guinea pigs and multiply it by four."

      "title": "Place the cage in an ideal location.",
      "content": "Place the cage in an ideal location. Guinea pigs like to be near other beings, so consider putting the cage in a living room or family room where your guinea pig can be part of the family and can be seen and heard. Do keep in mind, however, that guinea pigs have sensitive ears and they do not like loud noises. Keep the cage away from stereos, televisions, and anything else that emits loud sounds. Also, place the cage in an area that is neither too warm nor too cool. Guinea pigs don't like extreme temperatures; moreover, extreme cold or heat can cause the animals to become ill. Aim for an area that is about 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit and away from any heat sources or drafty spaces."

      "content": "Organize the cage appropriately. Try to keep food dishes, water bottles, houses, and toys away from the walls of the cage so that your guinea pig has lots of space to run and play. Place all cage accessories in the centre of the cage to create a perimeter around the cage that is free of obstructions for your guinea pig to run around.

      "title": "Feed your guinea pig well",
      "content": "Feed your guinea pig well . To make sure your guinea pig has a well-balanced and nutritious diet, provide them with ample hay. Fresh hay provides the fiber your guinea pig's digestive tract needs and grinds the teeth down to keep them in good shape. Guinea pigs can eat, run, and play in the hay so this is key to keeping them healthy and happy. It is important to provide an unlimited source of grass hay because food pellets don't contain enough fiber to help the digestive system fully function properly. [5] X Research source In addition to hay, provide your guinea pig with 1/8 of a cup of food pellets and about 1 cup of vegetables per day. Vegetables are a key source of vitamin C for guinea pigs; good choices include bell peppers and leafy greens like spinach, kale, and parsley. Try to vary your pet's meal choice to make eating more exciting. Experiment to see what your guinea pig likes. Other vegetable options include celery, brussel sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, peas, and tomatoes. Add fruit to your guinea pig's diet. Guinea pigs love fruit! Try to choose fruits high in vitamin C, such as cantaloupe, strawberries, and kiwi. However, make sure that you are only giving fruit as a special treat no more than a few times a week because of its high sugar content. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Make the food fun! You can cut up your guinea pig's favorite vegetables and thread them together with twine, making a kabob you can hang on the side of their cage. You can also buy a little metal pole for the kabob from pet stores. [7] X Research source Keep the food fresh. Check the cage frequently and remove anything uneaten, wilted, or decomposed. In general, avoid giving your guinea pig spoiled or wilted vegetables; don't feed them anything you wouldn't eat. A common reason for illnesses such as scurvy in guinea pigs is a lack of vitamin C. Make sure your guinea pig is eating 25mg of vitamin C a day, either through natural or commercial supplements."

      "title": "Make sure the bedding in the cage is soft.",
      "content": "Make sure the bedding in the cage is soft. Guinea pigs have very delicate feet, so they must have soft and abundant bedding. Make sure to provide about 2-3 inches worth of bedding so that there is sufficient padding and absorption. The ideal bedding material are wood shavings or fleece, since it's warm and absorbent. If you use hay as bedding, make sure the hay is of high quality and soft nature. Straw-like hay can injure guinea pig's eyes. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Be sure to change the bedding if it ever becomes wet or sodden. Spot clean every day by removing wet patches and replacing with clean bedding. Damp bedding can cause health problems and is also greatly disliked by the guinea pigs themselves. In general, guinea pigs prefer clean, dry bedding and will feel more comfortable in cages that provide this comfort. Do not use cedar and pine shavings as bedding. Even though these are widely available as bedding for small pets, These materials have phenols, which can be harmful to guinea pigs. Only use aspen or kiln-dried pine. Avoid wire bottom cages. These can lead to health issues such as bumble foot."

      "content": "Clean the cage regularly. In general, cages should be cleaned quickly every day (spot-cleaning) and thoroughly washed and cleaned once a week. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source At the end of every day, remove any uneaten food from the cage and droppings. At least once a week, replace and/or clean the bedding in the cage and remove everything from inside the cage so you can give it a good scrub with warm water. Because guinea pigs like dry surfaces, make sure the cage is fully dry before putting the bedding back in."

      "content": "Give your guinea pig toys. Remember that safety should be your top concern and that many commercial toys can fall apart and leave small pieces behind that your guinea pig could choke on. You'll need to experiment to decide which toys your guinea pig likes, as they don't always enjoy the same thing. A good rule of thumb is that the simpler the toy, the better. [10] X Research source Make sure to only add large toys into the cage that cannot be swallowed by your guinea pig to ensure that there are no choking hazards. Wooden blocks or dowels are good choices because guinea pigs like to chew on things. This is because guinea pig's teeth never stop growing, and chew toys can help gnaw the teeth down to a comfortable length. Make sure with any wooden toys you purchase that the wood is untreated and unpainted. A good toy to include is a tunnel (or even more than one). Guinea pigs love running through and sleeping in tunnels in their cage. You could purchase a tube or tunnel at a major pet store, but you can also make one easily at home using an empty container."

      "title": "Create \"hidey houses\" for your guinea pig.",
      "content": "Create \"hidey houses\" for your guinea pig. Guinea pigs are naturally timid animals. They love to hide under things and have a little privacy. Hidey houses and tunnels make them feel safe, secure, and comforted. You can purchase some commercial hidey houses at any main pet supply retailer or make them inexpensively at home. [11] X Research source As a general rule, a guinea pig should have at least one wooden structure in their cage, whether that be a little wooden house or a tunnel. Wooden structures give the guinea pig something to chew on, which help ground down their teeth and keep them safe. If you have more than one guinea pig, you should have one extra house beyond the number of guinea pigs in the cage. For instance, if you have three guinea pigs, you'll want to have four hidey houses. Having one seemingly \"neutral\" house not designated for any particular guinea pig helps maintain peace in the group. [12] X Research source To make a little DIY-house where your guinea pig can hide, use an old, plain (i.e. no dyes) shoebox. Your guinea pig will love the little house, and it's safe for chewing. You could also use paper bags that you lay on their sides to create a cave for your guinea pig. To make it extra fun, you could also stuff some hay in the bag - toy and hay all-in-one! [13] X Research source You can also make towel tents for your pig to hide under. Cut up or fold old bath towels (make sure to remove any tags or loose threads) and drape them over a corner of the cage. You can loop the towel through the wires of the cage or use pins or other clips to secure the towels in place. This is a great alternative for a hiding spot because you can wash and reuse the \"tent\" as needed. [14] X Research source"

Give your guinea pig some additional exercise by letting them run around a small room or other enclosed space; this should be part of your guinea pig's daily routine to help keep them happy and healthy. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source [16] X Research source Make sure to only let your guinea pig out in rooms that have no small openings through which your guinea pig could escape or become lost. Also, make sure to avoid areas where there is furniture or appliances that your guinea pig could get stuck in, such as underneath sofas, behind ovens or refrigerators, etc. [17] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You'll also need to keep a close eye on your guinea pig because they will chew on anything they can, including dangerous items like electrical wires and cords. Make sure any wires are not just unplugged but are inaccessible to your guinea pig when they are let out of their cage. [18] X Research source Do not let your guinea pig outside where they could become easily lost or considered as prey by larger animals."

      "content": "Keep at least two guinea pigs together. Guinea pigs are social herd animals that are happier in groups of two or more. [19] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you only have one guinea pig, consider adopting another and you'll see the benefits, including higher levels of activity and increased exercise. In some countries, it is even illegal to buy single guinea pigs; you have to buy them in pairs. If you do get another guinea pig, make sure it's of the same sex as the guinea pig you currently have or that it's neutered or spayed if it's of the opposite sex. This is important because if a male guinea pig and a female guinea pig are housed together, they will likely mate and the female guinea pig will become pregnant, which is quite dangerous. [20] X Research source While guinea pigs are naturally found in herds in the wild, do not house more than two boars together. Boars can become territorial, especially with limited space. Sows, however, can co-exist peacefully in large groups of three or more."

      "title": "Handle your guinea properly and with care.",
      "content": "Handle your guinea properly and with care. Always make sure to support the entire body since guinea pigs are small animals with delicate bones. Some guinea pigs also tend to jump, especially when they are being returned to their cages. Such falls can result in broken bones, serious injuries, and even death. To handle your guinea pig properly, wrap one hand around their chest and use the other to support their hind feet and bottom. Hold your guinea pig against your chest for extra security. [22] X Research source Talk to your guinea pig gently as you pick them up and handle them and make sure to approach your guinea pig from the front so as not to frighten them. If you have a jumpy guinea pig that likes to squirm around, you can train your guinea pig to not struggle when being held or put back in their cage. Hold your guinea pig firmly, but gently. When you move to put them back in the cage, hold them a few inches above the floor. Do not put them down as long as they continue to squirm while in your hands. Be careful not to squeeze them too tight or you could damage their back and cause paralysis. Only place your guinea pig onto the cage floor once they stop squirming and struggling against you, but don't let go since they will probably try to run away. Hold them yet again until they stop moving. After several training sessions, your guinea pig will learn that they can be free once they stop squirming. Young children should not be permitted to carry a guinea pig in their hands because they may inadvertently squeeze the guinea pig too hard or drop them. [23] X Research source"

      "title": "Teach your guinea pig tricks.",
      "content": "Teach your guinea pig tricks. Guinea pigs are very smart. You can teach them to stand on their hind legs, spin, run in a circle, stand on a pedestal, jump, and respond to their name. In general, guinea pigs aren't as easy to train as other rodents, but you can be successful with a bit of patience. [24] X Research source Tame guinea pigs tend to be more receptive to training and learning tricks. Before you train your guinea pig, strengthen your bond with them by taming them. [25] X Research source To teach your guinea pig tricks, you'll need to rely on a method known as operant conditioning, which means that you have to reward your guinea pig each time they complete a task. Start by rewarding small movements and then put the whole trick together. For example, if you want your pig to run in a circle on command, you'll need a pocket full of natural treats (such as little bits of carrot– avoid store bought treats) and something that makes noise, like a clicker. Issue the command \"turn\" and if your guinea pig even turns his head the littlest bit, click the clicker and reward him. This will help him learn that when they hear the clicking sound they have done something right and that there will be a reward. Repeat the signal until your guinea pig has it mastered and then make it more difficult to earn the reward (e.g., only give them the carrot bit if they do a quarter-turn and then a half-turn and then so on, until they do the full action). You should train with your guinea every day in short sessions for results. [26] X Research source"
