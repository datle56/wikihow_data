      "content": "Choose a plastic tube large enough to fit the intake valve on your powerhead. The tube does not need to be very long, since the powerhead will be going under water. Plan on getting something at least twice the height of your sponge. When choosing a powerhead, get something that will pumps twice as much water per hour as what's in your tank. Sponge filters are ideal for delicate tanks."

      "content": "Choose a filter sponge and cut it down to fit your tank. What brand you use does not matter, but it needs to be the type of sponge used in aquarium filters. The easiest shapes to work with are a triangle or a cylinder. A triangle would fit the easiest in the corner of your fish tank. A cylinder may look neater, however. Whatever shape you choose, make sure that it is wider than your plastic tube. [1] X Research source You can find filter sponges in pet stores and fish tank stores. Consider getting a sponge with larger pores. They are better at housing the good bacteria, which help clean your tank. Sponge filters are ideal for shrimp and betta tanks. They are bio efficient, but don't create a lot of suction or water movement. [2] X Research source"
