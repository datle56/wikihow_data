Instead, purchase a pre-made succulent or cacti potting mix or combine 2 parts of potting soil, perlite, and sand to make your own. [2] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If you are worried about your plant draining well enough, use a clay pot instead of a plastic pot. Ensure there is a drainage hole on the bottom where water can escape. Dump out any excess water in the saucer beneath the pot."

If you already have a large jade plant or know someone who does, take a sharp knife or clippers and choose a thick stem with healthy leaves.

All you have to do is leave the cutting on a clean paper towel and wait until the stem is dry or scabbed over. [5] X Research source The larger the cutting, the more time this will take. It will also take longer if you do this in the winter instead of during the warm summer months."

[8] X Expert Source Melinda Meservy Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. In three to four weeks, you should notice new growth on top of the plant. This is a good sign that your plant has successfully rooted. [9] X Research source Avoid the temptation to water your plant while it is rooting. This will increase the chance that the stem will rot and kill your rooting plant altogether. Once your jade plant has rooted, you can consider moving it to a larger pot if you want to. If your plant isn't rooting, and it's only been a few weeks, try waiting a bit longer. Succulent plants root easily, so it's a possibility the plant didn't have enough time to root. Alternatively, gently remove the cutting from the pot to see if the roots are growing. Don't do this too often, though, as it only slows the process."

Instead, move your plant in stages. For instance, if you've kept your jade in a shadowy corner, move the plant to an area with an hour of indirect sunshine. This will help the plant adjust so the leaves don't burn and fall off. [13] X Research source Do this for a few days before moving it to an area with more sunshine."

However, south-facing windows should be avoided to prevent wilting or sun-bleaching of the leaves because that’s where they’ll be most exposed to the sun. [14] X Research source During the night, temperatures should be between 50 to 55 °F (10 to 13 °C). When winter hits, move your plants indoors (if they’re outside) and keep them away from the windows.

[17] X Research source During the winter, your plant will likely need even less watering than normal, so always check the soil. [18] X Research source Many people recommend watering succulents by soaking the entire pot in a tub to soak up the water from the bottom. However, you can also water the plant by pouring water into the pot through the top. The most important thing is allowing the excess water to drain completely from the pot. Do not leave the jade plant sitting in water. If you notice excess water, empty it from the saucer. Try to avoid getting the leaves wet when watering."

Apply a half-dose strength fertilizer to the soil and wait to see if growth resumes. [20] X Research source"

[21] X Research source When looking for bugs, look for small, fluffy, white deposits on the leaves. These are a sign that there are bugs. Additionally, you can use a magnifying glass to identify red spiders, which are too small to see with the naked eye.

Though you can leave the plant in the same pot for many years, as long as you are not overwatering it, changing the soil with fresh, pre-made succulent potting soil every two to four years will allow you to inspect the roots for any damage or rot. Additionally, giving the plant some fresh, dry soil will make sure the plant continues to flourish. If you notice that a Jade plant you've had for many years is not doing well, replanting it may help it spring back."

However, repotting every two to three years is sufficient during its early life stages. Four years or more is safe for mature plants, so long as it's done in early to mid-spring so the plant can recover successfully. [24] X Research source Jade plants can live for 50 to 100 years when taken care of properly. To repot a jade plant, carefully pull the plant from its current pot, taking care not to damage the leaves. Loosen the roots and lower the plants into a new pot onto a layer of soil. Fill in the gaps with additional soil. Wait one week before watering."
