      "content": "Encourage him to talk openly with you about what he's feeling. It's really common for men to feel embarrassed or ashamed if they're struggling with ED. It will likely help him a lot if you let him know that he can talk to you about whatever he's going through. Even if he isn't ready to talk about it, assure him that you're there to help him work through the problem. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source It might also help if you have a conversation about what you both like during sex. That can help you feel closer as a couple, which can help take some of the pressure off when you are intimate. [2] X Research source It's also helpful if you offer to go with him to the doctor—not only will it will help you have a good idea of what to expect from treatment, but the support might make him feel more comfortable with making the appointment.

      "content": "Try bringing up the subject outside of the bedroom. It might seem tough at first, but try to approach the subject in an empathetic but matter-of-fact way. Be reassuring that you're willing to work with them to find a solution, and bring up the subject of talking to the doctor. [4] X Research source For instance, you might go for a walk together, then say something like, \"I know you don't like to talk about it, but I hope you know it's normal for men to sometimes have trouble with sex. I can tell it bothers you—would you like me to go with you to your doctor to ask about it? I care a lot about your health, and I'd love to see you feeling more confident again.\" Having the conversation when you're not being intimate can help take some of the emotion out of things. If you mention it in the bedroom, your partner might be more likely to get defensive or embarrassed."

      "title": "It doesn't have to, as long as you communicate well.",
      "content": "It doesn't have to, as long as you communicate well. Chances are, you'll notice some impacts on your relationship—if a man can't have sex, it can really affect his self-confidence. He might also feel embarrassed or frustrated. That might cause him to pull away from you, fearing that if he attempts to have sex, he'll fail at it. However, it's a hurdle that many couples are able to overcome, as long as they're open with each other and patient with the treatment options. If your partner pulls away, it's normal for you to feel lonely or frustrated. If these feelings persist, it might help you to talk to a therapist. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes a while for ED treatments to work. Reassure your partner that you're willing to keep trying until you find what works for him."

      "content": "No, erectile dysfunction isn't anybody's fault. If your partner has ED, it's normal to think that you might be the cause—you might think you must not be attractive enough or that he's not interested in you anymore. You might even think he's having an affair. Luckily, the problem usually doesn't have anything to do with this, so don't blame yourself. Instead, focus on how the two of you can overcome the problem together. [5] X Research source Sometimes, relationship problems can contribute to ED. That doesn't mean it's your fault at all! However, if you're arguing a lot, the two of you should strongly consider couple's counseling so you can go back to feeling intimate and affectionate towards each other."

      "content": "Many men feel embarrassed and frustrated about ED. Virility is often an important part of a man's self-image, so being unable to get or keep an erection can be a deep hit to his confidence. Your partner might also feel nervous about trying to have sex again, so be patient if you feel like he's starting to pull away. Your support will be essential in helping him maintain his confidence throughout this process. However, don't be surprised if he is resistant to your reassurances, especially if the problem persists over time. Just try to remain understanding, and remind him that treatment can take time to work."

      "title": "Spend plenty of time on foreplay, and don't focus on penetration.",
      "content": "Spend plenty of time on foreplay, and don't focus on penetration. If your partner is nervous about being able to maintain his erection long enough to have sex, he might try to rush through foreplay. However, that can make the problem worse, since neither of you will be quite as aroused. Make foreplay into a game—talk about what both of you like, then spend more time doing that! [6] X Research source Try kissing, cuddling, touching, stroking, and teasing—those are all great ways to help both of you get and stay aroused. Let him know it's okay for both of you to climax doing those things. If you can have a few successful sessions that aren't about penetrative sex, it might help your partner regain some of his confidence. If your partner is able to get an erection but tends to lose it during sex, consider using a penis ring to trap the blood inside the penis. When he's semi-erect, put it around the base of his penis and around his testicles. Then, take it off when you're finished having sex.

      "content": "Narrowed blood vessels are often to blame for ED. If blood can't get into the penis, an erection can't form. Similarly, reduced blood flow can mean that the penis can't trap enough blood to maintain an erection if one does form. Conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arteriosclerosis, and long-term smoking can cause the blood vessels to narrow. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Other medical causes of ED might include: Nerve-related issues due to diabetes, stroke, spinal cord injury, or heavy alcohol or drug use.

      "content": "Situational issues can be a factor, as well. Sometimes, there's not a specific medical issue to blame for ED. For instance, a man might have a hard time getting an erection if he's nervous or stressed, or if he's had too much to drink. [9] X Research source Other emotional causes of ED might include depression, anxiety, relationship problems, or being insecure about their sexual performance. [10] X Research source Sometimes, frequently masturbating to pornography can lead to performance issues in the bedroom, because real sex isn't always as stimulating as porn. It might help if your guy takes a break from porn for a while—have an honest conversation with him if you think that's the problem. [11] X Research source"

He might feel apprehensive about bringing this up to his doctor, but taking the first step can be as simple as saying, \"Hey Doc, I've been having trouble having sex.\" From there, his doctor will decide which tests are appropriate to figure out what's causing the problems. Some of those tests might include: [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A physical exam of your partner's penis and testicles. Blood or urine tests to check for signs of diabetes, hormonal imbalances, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. An ultrasound examination to check for blood flow problems inside the penis.

If your partner is just starting to struggle with the symptoms of ED, making healthy lifestyle changes might make a difference. Also, if he's a smoker, encourage him to quit, as smoking can be a factor.

      "content": "Doctors commonly prescribe oral medication for ED. There are several types of prescription medications available for ED, but they all work in the same general way. They help relax the muscles of the penis, making it easier to get an erection during sex. However, they typically won't cause an erection on their own—your partner will still need to become aroused, so these medications aren't as effective if the cause of ED is something like stress or anxiety. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Common ED medications include sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), avanafil (Stendra), and tadalafil (Cialis). These medications may not be safe if you take certain medications, like nitrates for chest pain, or if you have heart disease, heart failure, or low blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about these and any other health concerns. Avoid herbal treatments for ED unless your doctor recommends them—these aren't regulated by the FDA and can sometimes lead to dangerous side effects."
