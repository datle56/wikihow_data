If you have esophagitis, you might feel a burning sensation in your chest (particularly after eating) or experience painful or difficult swallowing. Your doctor might perform an endoscopy and/or prescribe antibiotics, antivirals, or acid blockers.

      "content": "Heal esophageal ulcers with medication, dietary changes, or surgery. Esophageal ulcers are essentially sores that have formed on your esophageal lining after being exposed to lots of stomach acid. If you have GERD, you’re more likely to get ulcers. Your doctor might recommend proton pump inhibitors (like Prevacid or Prilosec—both available over-the-counter) or, if those don’t work, suggest fundoplication surgery. [2] X Research source Fundoplication surgery is a common treatment for esophageal ulcers and the procedure is minimally invasive (meaning only small abdominal incisions are necessary). It involves tying a small bit of stomach muscle around the base of your esophagus to strengthen the esophageal sphincter. Changing your eating habits and avoiding GERD trigger foods (like spicy foods, mint, and chocolate) will help your esophagus heal along with medication. Barrett's esophagus is caused by acid reflux.

Pills and capsules can sometimes get stuck in your throat, especially if you swallow them dry or with only a little bit of water. This means the pill can start dissolving in your throat, irritating the lining of your esophagus.

Luckily, amifostine (brand name Ethyol) can help lessen your risk when taken about 30 minutes before chemotherapy. You’ll need to ask your doctor for it ahead of time because it can only be administered intravenously. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Make sure you’re eating nutritious foods and avoid anything super hot or spicy to help manage radiation esophagitis. Unfortunately, there’s no cure for this kind of esophagitis, but symptoms should start to go away about 2 to 4 weeks after your last chemotherapy treatment."

      "content": "Choose soft proteins with high moisture content. Soft, boneless fish fillets or tender ground meat with sauces or marinades are easier to swallow and won’t scratch your throat. Plus, the protein and amino acids will help heal your esophagus faster. Casseroles and stews are great options because the moisture will help the meats go down easier and ease digestion. Soft scrambled eggs are a great breakfast option. However, be wary of eggs if you think you might be allergic. Avoid fibrous or stringy meats that have bristle or peppercorn (like steak, spare ribs, sausage, and bacon)."

Avoid chewy bread rolls, tough meats, hard bread crusts, and crispy chips. Cereal, granola, and seeded bread slices aren’t going to feel good going down, so choose well-cooked oatmeal instead (and make sure the oats have no added seeds or nuts). If you still want to eat bread, crackers, or chips, soften them up by putting them in soups or broths first."

Potatoes (without skins), squash, carrots, and spinach are all nutritious options that won’t irritate your throat. Cook vegetables with broth to add some flavor and help soften them up. Avoid fibrous vegetables like okra, artichokes, and celery. If you have GERD, alkaline veggies like asparagus, spinach, kale, and Brussels sprouts will help lower the amount of acid in your stomach. Avoid cooking your vegetables with onion or garlic as these are common triggers of acid reflux. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for fruits and vegetables that are rich in soluble fiber.",
      "content": "Opt for fruits and vegetables that are rich in soluble fiber. Fiber helps manage symptoms of acid reflux and GERD by speeding up gastric emptying and increasing pressure on the esophageal sphincter (which means stomach acid can’t easily travel up your esophagus). [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Root vegetables like potatoes, beets, carrots, and parsnips are a great source of fiber. Bananas are low in acid and contain pectin, a type of fiber that helps push food through your digestive system. This is helpful because food that stays in your stomach too long will create excess acid that might travel up your esophagus. [12] X Research source"

Canned pears, peaches, and lychee are all throat-friendly options that will provide some fiber and vitamin C for digestion and healing. Applesauce is delicious and easy to make at home! Avoid dried fruits because they’re too chewy (or crispy depending on the fruit) and might get stuck in your throat. You can still enjoy harder fruits if you juice them or blend them into a smoothie with milk or yogurt. Avoid citrus fruits (like oranges, tangelos, grapefruit, lemons, and limes) as they are highly acidic and might further any inflammation."

Wait for coffee and teas to cool down a little and, if you must use ice, only use a few chunks. Carbonated drinks can also irritate the lining of your esophagus. If you have GERD, you should avoid both carbonated and caffeinated drinks. Switch to decaf!"

Highly fatty foods (specifically trans fats) will cause your stomach to produce more acid, making it more likely for those gastric juices to irritation your esophagus. You can still eat fats, just stick to the good (monounsaturated) kinds. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Eat healthy fats like avocado, olives, olive oil, flax seeds, chia seeds, nuts, and nut butters. However, some of these foods (particularly avocado and nuts) can trigger acid reflux if you’re allergic or have GERD.

While everyone digests at a different pace, wait about 2 to 3 hours before laying down after meals. [22] X Research source Go for an easy 10- to 20-minute walk after meals to help speed up digestion and send gastric juices flowing as they should (down, not up!). Sit upright during and after meals. Prop your head and shoulders up with extra pillows when you sleep to create a slope that makes it harder for acid to travel upwards."

Just be sure to choose gum that isn’t mint flavored (like peppermint or spearmint) because mint relaxes the flap at the base of your esophagus.

While there are no medications specifically approved to treat EoE, topical steroids (like fluticasone or budesonide) can be used to manage inflammation and symptoms during an elimination diet.
