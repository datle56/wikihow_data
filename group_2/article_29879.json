      "title": "Find a sturdy, Y-shaped piece of wood.",
      "content": "Find a sturdy, Y-shaped piece of wood. Keep an eye out for fallen branches that can be broken or whittled into the correct shape. You can use just about any type of wood to make a slingshot, provided it’s strong enough to hold up when you pull back the sling. A piece that’s roughly 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) long and 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) thick, however, will be the easiest to use. [1] X Research source Search the ground near heavily wooded areas for the best sticks and branches. Strong, supple woods like oak, ash, hickory, and maple make some of the best slingshots. They’ll provide just enough flexibility to keep from breaking, but not enough to decrease the force or distance of your shot."

      "title": "Dry out the wood over a fire or stove.",
      "content": "Dry out the wood over a fire or stove. Hang the frame of your slingshot over a heat source, such as a campfire or a portable stove, and turn it occasionally. Allow it to dry for several hours. As it heats up, the moisture inside will slowly release. This will ensure your slingshot frame has less give and is more sturdy. [2] X Research source Be extremely careful not to burn yourself when working near an open flame. Alternatively, you can also dry the wood in the microwave. Wrap the wood in a towel and microwave it for 30 seconds at a time until it’s dry."

      "title": "Carve a notch at the top of each prong.",
      "content": "Carve a notch at the top of each prong. Use a pocket knife or a rock with sharp edges to cut a shallow groove all the way around the arms of the Y. Make each notch about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the prongs. This provides a neat little slot for the bands. [3] X Research source If the notches are higher up on the prongs, the tension from the sling could cause them to snap. If they’re too low, the projectile you’re shooting could clip the bottom of the frame. Ask an adult for help when cutting the wood. Never use a pocket knife without parental supervision."

    {
      "title": "Cut an elastic band for the sling.",
      "content": "Cut an elastic band for the sling. Any thick, stretchy material you have on hand can be used as the firing mechanism. Heavy rubber bands, strips of latex sheeting, and even medical tubing are all good options. [4] X Research source Once you’ve gotten your hands on a suitable material, double it over and cut it into two identical pieces. Make each piece approximately the same length as the frame. [5] X Research source The exact length of the sling depends on your preferred shooting style, as well as the materials you have to work with. A shorter sling generates more power, but can also be more difficult to draw back. Leaving the bands a little longer allows you to adjust the slack or start over if you make a mistake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the sling to the frame.",
      "content": "Attach the sling to the frame. Take one of the two cut bands and wind it around one of the notches you carved in the prongs earlier. Then, tie it down securely. Do the same with the remaining band. Trim the short ends of the bands to remove the excess length. [6] X Research source To ensure your slingshot fires accurately, make sure the loose ends are as close to the same length as possible. Otherwise, the sling will be lopsided."

      "title": "Create a pouch with cloth.",
      "content": "Create a pouch with cloth. Get a piece of strong cloth and trim it to a size of about 4 inches (10 cm) wide by 2 inches (5.1 cm) high. About 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from each end of the rectangle, open up a hole just large enough to fit the ends of the sling through. The resulting pouch creates a nest for the projectile, holding it in place until it leaves the sling. [7] X Research source A stiff fabric that offers some resistance, like leather or thick canvas, is ideal. Use the point of a pocket knife or a similar tool to bore holes in the pouch. You can also cut a small slit in the fabric, though this may tear after a few uses. Consider wrapping the handle of your slingshot with the same cloth for a more cushioned grip."

    {
      "title": "Tie the sling to the pouch.",
      "content": "Tie the sling to the pouch. Thread the end of one band through one of the holes you punched in the pouch. Knot it tight to the outer edge. Repeat with the opposite hole. The sling should now be one long piece, with the bands on either side and the pouch in the middle. [8] X Research source If you want, you can reinforce the ends of the pouch by wrapping the bands in dental floss, then tying them off. [9] X Research source Use a slingshot to fire small stones, marbles, or metal BBs. Slingshots are useful tools, but they can also be dangerous weapons. Never fire your slingshot at another person, even if you're just playing around."

      "content": "Cut a toilet paper roll in half lengthwise. Run a pair of scissors up one side of the roll so that it uncurls into a single sheet. Be sure to make only a single cut—you still want the roll to be in one piece, just open. [10] X Research source Try not to bend or crumple the cardboard tube as you cut through it. The smoother the edges stay, the more manageable it will be. If you don’t have a toilet paper roll on hand, you can also cut a longer paper towel roll in half and then cut it through the center to open it. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll up the toilet paper roll and tape it to create the plunger.",
      "content": "Roll up the toilet paper roll and tape it to create the plunger. Put the ends of the roll together so that they overlap, then roll it up like a newspaper. When you’re finished, it should be about half the diameter of the original roll. Wrap a long strip of tape around the roll to secure it, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cardboard exposed on one end. [12] X Research source This piece will work as the internal plunger for the slingshot, where you’ll load the projectiles. The inner toilet paper roll must be narrow enough to hold whatever sort of projectile you’ll be firing without it falling through. You may want to compare the sizes of both objects before taping up the tube. If it’s too wide, roll it up a little tighter until you get it just right."

      "title": "Punch two opposing holes on one end of the plunger.",
      "content": "Punch two opposing holes on one end of the plunger. These holes should be just big enough to stick a pencil through. Position them directly across from each other, not at opposite ends of the roll. It may help to get a top-down view of the roll to make sure they’re lined up properly. [13] X Research source A manual hole punch makes the cleanest openings; however, you can also use scissors or the tip of a pencil to make the holes."

      "title": "Insert a pencil through the holes in the plunger.",
      "content": "Insert a pencil through the holes in the plunger. Guide the pencil into one hole and straight out through the other. It should be perfectly centered inside the roll. Keep pushing the pencil until there’s an equal length sticking out of both ends. [14] X Research source A short, stubby utensil, such as a golf pencil, works best, since there is less chance of it breaking. Be careful not to damage the holes when you’re inserting the pencil—they should be just large enough to accommodate the pencil. If either of the holes tears, simply turn the plunger and punch out two new ones."

      "content": "Cut a series of slits into one end of a second toilet paper roll. Use a pencil to draw two vertical lines extending about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) inward from the rim of the roll. These lines should be roughly a finger’s width apart. Rotate the roll and make two identical marks on the opposite side, then cut over the lines carefully with a pair of scissors. [15] X Research source This second tube functions as the body of the slingshot and fits over the plunger."

      "content": "Loop a rubber band around either side of the roll. Drape the rubber bands over the notched flaps so they sit at the bottom of the slits. Then, repeat on the other side. For this type of slingshot to work, you’ll need one rubber band on each side. [16] X Research source You’ll get the best results using two rubber bands of the same kind, so try to ensure they are similar in size and thickness."

      "title": "Stretch the rubber bands over the ends of the pencil.",
      "content": "Stretch the rubber bands over the ends of the pencil. Pull the rubber bands down carefully, one at a time, to avoid bending the flaps. Now when you load a small projectile into the outer tube and draw back on the plunger using the pencil as a grip, it will sail across the room! [18] X Research source Keep in mind that pulling too hard on the slingshot may break it—after all, it is made of cardboard. Your homemade slingshot can launch marshmallows, foam pom-poms , or other soft, small items."

Then, run a carriage bolt through the center hole of the plates. Screw a washer and hex nut on either side of the bolt. For the best results, work on one side of the bolt at a time. Always make sure to put on the washer first and then screw on the nut. [19] X Research source There will be one longer end of the bolt. This will later become the handle of your slingshot."

Secure them in place with a washer and hex nut. [20] X Research source Make sure the height of your eye bolts is even, as this is where you’ll secure the sling part of your slingshot. Ensure the open part of the eye bolt loop is facing away from the direction you’ll be pulling back on the sling. Try putting a drop of super glue between the eye bolt threads to keep them in place."

The left end of the band ties to the left eye loop, and the right end of the band ties to the right eye loop. [21] X Research source Use glue or wire to help secure the band in place on the eye loops. This type of slingshot works best with a heavy-duty, industrial slingshot band. Most slingshot bands already come with a pouch to place your ammo on, so there’s no need to make one."

      "content": "Wrap the handle with tape or string, if you’d like. While this step isn’t necessary, it can make holding your heavy-duty slingshot more comfortable. Wrap tape, string, or tape and string over the longer end of the carriage bolt to create a thicker, softer handle. It may take around 5 layers of tape to create a soft cushion. Similarly, you can also use a moldable clay to craft your handle. Simply mold the clay around the carriage bolt with your hands and let it dry according to the clay’s instructions.

[23] X Research source The bottom end of the T-plates faces toward you, with the top of the T aiming toward your target. Pull back and away from the T, letting the band and ammo shoot between the eye loops over the T-plates. Think of the middle of the T-plates as a runway. The ammo should shoot through it."
