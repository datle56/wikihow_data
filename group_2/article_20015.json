Keep an eye on Pokémon news and the Poké Portal News in-game for a rerun of these Tera Raid Battles.

However, if you have Pokémon Violet, you'll need to connect to the internet and find Walking Wake Tera Raid Battles online. If you already caught a Walking Wake during a previous Tera Raid Battle event, you can't catch another one. You can, however, repeat the Tera Raid Battle for other rewards ."
