You will need: 1 rectangular vanilla or chocolate cake (bought or homemade) (around 30cm/1\" in length) 5 x round cookies (biscuits), chocolate coated Smarties or similar candy-coated round candies Butter icing/frosting (red and white) Length of black licorice/liquorice (soft round lengths that are easily bent)"

      "content": "Mark window shapes on the cake. Use the tip of a sharp knife to carve out a window at the front of the cake (an oval is ideal) and small round or square circles, two each per side of the car. Leave the back windowless, as there's a cheat for this one."

      "content": "Repeat with the white icing or frosting. This time, spread it only in the window spaces. Once again, place in the freezer for a few minutes to harden.

Cut two small lengths and attach at even spaces just under the top line of licorice on the front window. These serve as the visors of the car. Cut two small lengths. Place diagonally across the front window, upwards, to look like windshield or windscreen wipers in use."

      "content": "Outline other areas of the car with licorice lengths. These portions make the car look realistic, so work with care. If you cannot use licorice, use any other sort of bendable candy length. If you can't find candy, use a dark colored icing or frosting, and pipe in place. Run a length each side of the car from the front the very back of the car. This should be at the edge of the cake on each side and provides the top of the car doors, as well as defining the car. Add a small length down the middle of each side window. This makes the doors. Run a length across the front end of the cake. This marks the end of the hood or bonnet. Run a length around the entire base of the car. This just neatens it up and gives definition."

      "title": "Choose a cake topper decoration.",
      "content": "Choose a cake topper decoration. There are a few ways you can decorate this car cake: Frosting the shape and design of a car across the top of the cake. Use differently colored frosting to denote the car, its features and the background. Features can also be made using candies, etc. Use royal icing to cover the cake. Make a road of black royal icing; have it curving across the cake. Add a model car on the road; either made from sugar paste or similar edible modeling food, or chocolate, or a clean plastic model car, which is removed once the cake is cut. Frost the whole cake. Make a border of clean plastic toy cars or foil-wrapped chocolate cars around the cake. When the cake is cut, each guest also gets to keep the car that came with his or her piece of cake."

      "content": "Add car-related items. For example, add Smarties in traffic light formation and colors; add road signs and barriers (use clean model toys); and even add some plastic people to the top. Frost the cake. Make a giant number for the child's age and use this as the road. Add cars to the number road, either edible or plastic ones. Include racing flags for a finish line."
