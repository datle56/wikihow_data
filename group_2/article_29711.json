      "content": "Choose your green location. You'll want your green to be located in an open area in your backyard that gets plenty of sunlight. Your future green should receive plenty of airflow, without any blockage of wind from buildings, bushes, or trees. Low spots in your backyard or areas that drain poorly should also be avoided, but after you've found the ideal place for your green, you should: Imagine the overall dimensions for your green. After you have a feel for the features of your soon-to-be putting green, take a piece of paper and sketch out the general design, including desired measurements. Then, measure and stake out your planned putting green area. Keep in mind, the larger your green, the more effort it will take to maintain and the greater the cost of its installation."

      "content": "Evaluate your soil. For the turf of your green to flourish, its roots will need the right kind of soil. Most soils are suitable for the roots of your grass, though the ideal soil composition will be sandy loam soil. If your soil has a high concentration of clay, your turf will suffer greatly, and may not be able to grow well enough for you to putt."

      "content": "Perform a soil test to check for clay. A percolation test can give you a good idea of the whether your soil composition is good enough for the roots of your grass and is relatively easy to perform. You will need to dig a hole 2' deep with the width of about a foot. Now, fill your hole with water and allow it to drain over the course of a day. Then, note the time, and fill the hole with water again. Holes that drain in less than 12 hours have a rate of percolation that will support plants the require well-drained soil, which includes your putting green grass. Holes that drain in 12 - 24 hours are suited for plants that live in heavy or clay soil. Holes that drain in over 24 hours are unsuitable for most plants."

      "content": "Appraise your surface drainage. The contours of your green-to-be should allow water to drain quickly and easily, otherwise your green could fail. Low areas where water can collect will also bad for your green. Try to provide multiple drainage routes to keep the grass from becoming waterlogged. [1] X Research source You can improve drainage conditions by installing drainage tiles below the surface of your green. It is advised that you place these close together, at a maximum spacing distance of no more than 10 feet (3 m)."

      "content": "Research grass seed by region. There are two dominant types of grass used to build putting greens, Creeping Bentgrass and Bermuda. Depending on region, you may want to use one over the other, or you in certain areas, a hybrid might flourish.

      "content": "Ready the soil. You'll need to tear up any original sod where you plan to make your green. After sod removal, you should rake rocks and other debris to create optimal drainage, aeration, and seeding conditions. Using a tiller for the soil will loosen and aerate the soil even more, promoting even better growth and soil consistency. Keep in mind that spring is the best time to plant a putting green."

      "content": "Add some drainage, if necessary. The best way to ensure that your putting area stays sufficiently drained is to install drainage tiles or vented plastic pipe. Dig a trenches that are roughly 24 inches (61 cm) deep and 12 inches wide, that lead from the edges of your green and through it, with the trench sloping downward away from your green leading water away from it. To install drainage, you should: Place filter fabric around the bottom of your trench so it reaches up the sides. Lay your perforated/vented plastic pipe in the trench. Fill your trench with 12 inches (30.5 cm) of coarse, clean gravel. Fold the ends of your filter fabric on top of your gravel. Refill the remainder of your trench with soil. [3] X Research source"

An extra degree of separation can not only keep your putting green more weed free, it can also keep your yard from getting invaded with Bentgrass or Bermuda. Using a plastic lining is a good way to protect your green from your yard and your yard from your green."

This can be helpful if you have a bird problem, though if you notice birds feeding heavily on your seed, you may want to scatter extra. In principle, a pound of seed should cover about 2,000 square feet, though there will be some variance depending on the kind of grass on which you decide."

You will need to be careful when walking behind your greens mower. Walk with gentle, flat footed steps, as the top layer of your green will still be loose. As a good root system grows, the ground will firm up. Mow the putting green often. By cutting your grass 3 or 4 times per week, it will maintain a height of around ¼\" - a perfect putting height.

From mid-September to mid-November, use at least 1 pound of nitrogen. [8] X Research source You should also look into special fertilizer formulated for your type of grass and/or putting greens. Many companies have special blends of fertilizer. You'll need to research for yourself to find what works best for your situation."
