Then, draw a line onto the wax paper going around the outside of the image. Make sure to draw a line that is 0.5 in (1.3 cm) or more past the edges of the image. This will help to ensure that you do not cut through the image. [1] X Research source Skip this if you plan to use a solid-colored shirt to make the pillow."

If it is, draw a shape around it on the wax paper in the desired shape of your pillow. [2] X Research source For example, you could draw a square, circle, triangle, star, hexagon, or other shape that encloses the tracing on the wax paper."

Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the sleeves off of the shirt. Then, cut along the side seam and shoulders. This will leave you with 1 front and 1 back piece. [3] X Research source"

Then, place a piece of fusible fleece interfacing over each of the pieces. Iron across the surface of the fusible fleece to attach it to the backside of each t-shirt piece.
