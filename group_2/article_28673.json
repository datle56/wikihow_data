Hold the tube in place with your thumb and forefinger. This will make the center loop of your ribbon. [7] X Research source Keep your thumb inside the tube, and your forefinger behind the overlapping ribbon. This method will make a looped bow, like the kind used on floral arrangements and wreaths."

For 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) wide ribbon, plan on using 1 yard (91.44 centimeters) of ribbon. If your ribbon is thinner, you could try using less."
