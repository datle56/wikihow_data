      "content": "Scan the room for sloppy dealers. If you’re a regular at the casino, you will get to know the dealers. Look for new dealers or dealers that look unsure of themselves. This is a sign that they are new at dealing and may make mistakes. Sloppy dealers will deal cards high off the table or may even flash a portion of the card to the players. Walk around different tables and make a mental note of any tables that have sloppy dealers. [1] X Research source An experienced dealer will deal every hand deliberately and low to the table. If a dealer looks like a seasoned veteran, move to a different table."

      "content": "Watch the dealer before making a bet. Once you locate a sloppy dealer, make sure to watch them for a couple of hands before you sit down and put bets on the table. Pick up on bad habits and repeated bad tendencies. Walk around the table and see if you can get a glimpse of the hole card at different angles. [2] X Research source When watching the dealer, make it look like you're concentrating on what the players are doing, not what the dealer is doing. You don't want to raise any suspicion by being too obvious."

      "content": "Look for a shuffling machine that is in view of first base. A table that has a shuffling machine near first base, or the rightmost player, can be seen more easily than a shuffling machine that is out of view of the players. If you do see a shuffling machine that is in front of where a player sits, take that seat. There is a greater likelihood of you being able to see the hole card as they deal it because you'll be closer to the cards as they are dealt and may be able to get a good vantage point.

      "title": "Look for a shuffling machine that holds the cards high off the table.",
      "content": "Look for a shuffling machine that holds the cards high off the table. Some older models of card shufflers will hold the card higher off the table, increasing the chances of you seeing the hole card while the dealer is dealing. Look for shufflers that hold the cards a couple of inches off the table. These shufflers will usually have a base that holds them up, which makes seeing the hole card easier. [4] X Research source Older model ACE shufflers hold the card 3 inches (7.6 cm) off the table. These are the most exploitable shuffling machines. Look for a black shuffling machine with the logo ACE on the side of it."

      "content": "Stand on the side of the dealer’s dominant hand. Dealers are more likely to flash their cards on the side of the table that they are dealing from. So, if there is a left-handed dealer your best bet would be to sit on first base, or on their left-hand side. If they are a right-handed dealer, it’s best if you sit furthest to their right, or third base. This may give you the advantage of being able to see if the dealer flashes the occasional hole card."

      "content": "Look at the corners of the dealer’s hole card as it is being dealt. It's easiest to see the dealer's hole card while it's being dealt. Look at the closest corner facing you and see if you can get a read on which card it is. If you can spot the corner of the card and it doesn't look like a number, you can assume it's a face card. [5] X Research source Don't lean in or change levels and make it obvious that you're trying to read their card. If a pit boss sees this, they may kick you out of the casino. You can wear sunglasses to obscure your eyes if you're afraid of being caught."

      "content": "Get an angle on the card when they check for blackjack. If you're in a blackjack game and the dealer is dealt an ace, face card, or a ten, they will peek at their hole card to see if they have blackjack. In these circumstances, you may be able to catch a peek of their hole card if they are lifting it up too much. Look at the corner of the card while they lift it up to look at it. [6] X Research source If the dealer doesn't cover the side of the card with their hand, it may be easier to see. Don't lean in or turn your head or you'll make it obvious that you're trying to read their card."

      "content": "Play with a friend to increase your odds. Two people sitting at one table increases the odds that one person can read the hole card. When you have the advantage, your friend can use a signal and you can bet a lot of money. You should also create a different signal when the dealer has a very strong hand, like a 19, 20, or 21. Being able to get different angles on the dealer will open up opportunities to read the hole card. Act like you and your friend don’t know each other when you gamble at the casino or you'll get kicked out. After you hit a couple of big hands, cash out so that no one catches on that you are working together."

While getting information on the hole card due to sloppy dealing isn’t illegal, it will still anger the management and pit boss if you’re making a lot of money from the casino. Lose a bet here and there to conceal the fact that you can see the hole card. Try to keep your bets within a reasonable range, or the dealer or pit boss may realize that they are showing the hole card. If they realize this, they can ask you to leave, switch dealers, or change their shuffling and dealing techniques. Do not try to read the hole-card in an obvious way when the pit boss is looking at you."

If you think you saw the hole card but aren’t confident, stick to the basic strategy.

If you know that the dealer is stuck on a hand that's 12-16 and there are a lot of high cards left in the deck, you can assume there's a higher likelihood of them busting."

      "title": "Hit if you know that the dealer must stand and is beating your hand.",
      "content": "Hit if you know that the dealer must stand and is beating your hand. One of the most obvious ways to take advantage of a hole card is to hit when you know that the dealer has a hard 17 and you have a worse hand. If the dealer has a hard 17, they have to stand and there's no chance that you can beat them if you have under a 17. Therefore, it's best to hit even if you think you'll bust. For example, basic strategy says to stand when you have 17 and the dealer is showing an 8. However, if you know for a fact they have an ace as their hole card, you should hit anyway because there's no way for you to win or tie unless you increase your score. A hard 17 is a blackjack score that's achieved without an ace. For example, a 10 and a 7 would be a hard 17. A soft 17 is when the dealer has an ace and a 6. This means that they will continue to hit until they hit 17 or above. Different casinos will have different policies on if the dealer should hit on a hard or soft 16 or 17. Make sure to read the rules before you bet at a table."

      "content": "Stand if the dealer is likely to bust. If you see that the dealer has a 12-16 and it's more likely for a high card to come out, this is known as a “stiff” hand or a hand where the dealer must hit but will likely bust. If you believe that they will bust, stand on your hand, even if you have a bad hand, like a 12-15. If the dealer busts, you will still win the hand."
