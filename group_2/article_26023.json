      "content": "Mix the crushed tablets and 3 to 4 tablespoons (44 to 59 ml) of shampoo in a bowl. Use clarifying shampoo that does not contain any dyes. If you have very long hair and crushed a higher number of Vitamin C tablets, you may need to use 5 to 6 tablespoons (74 to 89 ml) of shampoo. Combine the crushed tablets and the shampoo with a spoon until it forms a thick paste that has the consistency of glue. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wet your hair with water and apply the paste. Use a spray bottle filled with warm water to wet your hair until it is damp to the touch, but not soaking wet. Apply the paste to your hair with clean fingers, massaging it in from root to tip. Make sure you cover your entire head with the paste. [3] X Research source If you have a lot of hair or long hair, you may need to apply the paste in sections to ensure every strand is covered. Just part your hair into 4-8 sections before beginning. Do at least 1 coat of the paste on your entire head so your hair is well covered."

      "content": "Put a shower cap over your hair and let it sit for at least 2 hours. This will give the Vitamin C paste enough time to absorb into your hair. [4] X Research source You can also sit under a hooded dryer or direct heat from a blow dryer at your hair to speed up the process."

      "content": "Rinse out the paste with water for at least 5 minutes. Put your head over a sink or stand in the shower. Make sure you rinse out the paste completely, as this will help the Vitamin C strip the color out of your hair."

If you notice your hair feels dry once you rinse out the paste, you can massage in moisturizing conditioner to give it a bit more moisture. This can also be a good precautionary measure if your hair tends to get frizzy when you dry it, especially when it is dyed."

If you prefer to let your hair air dry, let it hang loose for several hours or overnight. If you blow dry your hair, use a heat protectant product to limit heat damage."

      "content": "Repeat the process again if you want your dyed hair to appear lighter. You can apply the Vitamin C paste again if you want to lighten your hair further. It is safe to apply it 3-4 times in a row to lighten your hair, though the paste may dry out your hair and cause your scalp to flake or itch. Always follow up the paste with a moisturizing conditioner if you are using it multiple times in a row to protect your hair and scalp. [5] X Research source You can also try leaving the paste on your hair for longer than 2 hours at a time, though this can cause irritation if your have a sensitive scalp."
