Before you operate the nail gun, review the loading instructions so you don’t injure yourself or load the nails incorrectly. When reviewing the instructions, determine where the magazine is and what type of nail strip to purchase. Typically, the magazine is located along the bottom of the machine. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source The instructions also detail where the pusher or latch is and whether or not you should connect the gun to an air compressor. In general, nail gun loads roughly the same way but the location of the magazine and type of nail strip may vary from model to model. For instance, some models have the magazine along the top of the machine, while others may be located near the handle. The pusher is usually located at the end of the magazine. Make sure to follow the instructions in the manual to properly lubricate the nail gun before you use it."
