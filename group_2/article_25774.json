These languages are especially useful for beginners, as they teach basic concepts and thought processes that can apply to virtually any language. [3] X Research source Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, since it's object-oriented with an easy-to-read syntax. It's also incredibly useful and is used in many real-world applications. \"Object-oriented\" means that the language is built around the concepts of \"objects\", or collections of data, and their manipulation. This is a concept that is used in many advanced programming languages such as C++, Java, Objective-C, and PHP."

There are countless tutorials for every programming available online, including many on wikiHow: Python : A great starter language that is also quite powerful when you get familiar with it. Used for many web applications and a number of games. Java : Used in countless types of programs, from games to web applications to ATM software. JavaScript : Despite having a similar name, JavaScript differs greatly from Java. It's used on websites alongside HTML and CSS (which are considered markup languages, not programming languages). SQL : If you're interested in databases and analytics, SQL—which stands for Structured Query Language and is pronounced \"sequel\"—is where you should start. C : One of the older languages, C is still a powerful tool. It's mainly used for writing operating systems or applications. C++ : C++ is a more difficult language to learn, but it's certainly not impossible. C++ is used mainly for embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT). C# : C# is a general-purpose language used for several things, including software, web applications, and even video games."

      "title": "Learn the core concepts of the language.",
      "content": "Learn the core concepts of the language. While the parts of this step that apply will vary depending on the language you choose, all programming languages have fundamental concepts that are essential to building useful programs. Learning and mastering these concepts early will make it easier to solve problems and create powerful and efficient code. Below are just some of the core concepts found in many different languages: Variables: A variable is a way to store and refer to changing pieces of data. Variables can be manipulated, and often have defined types such as \"integers\", \"characters\", and others, which determine the type of data that can be stored. When coding, variables typically have names that make them somewhat identifiable to a human reader. This makes it easier to understand how the variable interacts with the rest of the code. Conditional Statements: A conditional statement is an action that is performed based on whether the statement is true or not. The most common form of a conditional statement is the \"If-Then\" statement. If the statement is true (e.g., x = 5), then one thing happens. If the statement is false (e.g., x != 5), then something else happens. Functions or Subroutines: The actual name for this concept may be called something different depending on the language. It could also be \"Procedure\", a \"Method\", or a \"Callable Unit\". This is essentially a smaller program within a larger program. A function can be \"called\" by the program multiple times, allowing the programmer to create complex programs efficiently. Data input: This is a broad concept that is used in nearly every language. It involves handling a user's input as well as storing that data. How that data is gathered depends on the type of program and the inputs available to the user (keyboard, file, etc.). This is closely linked to Output, which is how the result is returned to the user, be it displayed on the screen or delivered in a file."

      "title": "Install any necessary software.",
      "content": "Install any necessary software. Many programming languages require compilers, which are programs designed to translate the code into a language that the machine can understand. Other languages, such as Python, use an interpreter that can execute programs instantly without compiling them. Besides installing any software necessary for your desired language, you should install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). IDEs usually contain a code editor, a compiler and/or interpreter, and a debugger. This allows the programmer to perform any necessary function in one place. IDEs may also contain visual representations of object hierarchies and directories. Depending on what language you're using, you might want to download a specific IDE. Here are some popular IDEs used by programmers across the industry: Visual Studio Code (all-purpose) Notepad++ (all-purpose) NetBeans (Java) Phoenix Code (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) Oracle SQL Developer (SQL) JetBrains (suite of IDEs for many languages)"

This is a very simple program that displays the text \"Hello, World\" (or some variation), on the screen. This program teaches first-time programmers the syntax to create a basic, functioning program, as well as how to handle displaying output. By changing the text, you can learn how basic data is handled by the program. Below are some wikiHow guides on creating a \"Hello World\" program in various languages: Hello World in Python Hello World in Ruby Hello World in C Hello World in PHP Hello World in C# Hello World in Java"

    {
      "title": "Examine the syntax.",
      "content": "Examine the syntax. The syntax is the way the language is written so that the compiler or interpreter can understand it. Each language has a unique syntax, though some elements may be shared across multiple languages. Learning syntax is essential for learning how to program in the language, and it is often what people think of when they think about computer programming. In reality, it is simply the foundation upon which more advanced concepts are built."

      "content": "Experiment with changes. Make changes to your example programs and then test the result. By experimenting, you can learn what works and what doesn't much quicker than by reading a book or guide. Don't be afraid to break your program; learning to fix errors is a major part of any development process, and new things almost never work right the first time. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Start practicing debugging.",
      "content": "Start practicing debugging. When you're programming, you're invariably going to come across bugs. These are errors in the program and can manifest virtually anywhere. Bugs can be harmless quirks in the program or major errors that keep the program from compiling or running. Hunting down and fixing these errors is a major process in the software development cycle, so get used to doing this early. As you experiment with changing basic programs, you're going to come across things that don't work. Figuring out how to take a different approach is one of the most valuable skills you can have as a programmer."

    {
      "title": "Comment all of your code.",
      "content": "Comment all of your code. Nearly all programming languages have a \"comment\" function that allows you to include text that is not processed by the interpreter or compiler. This allows you to leave short, but clear, human-language explanations of what the code does. This will not only help you remember what your code does in a large program, but it is an essential practice in a collaborative environment, as it allows others to understand what your code is doing."

      "content": "Study math and logic. Most programming involves basic arithmetic, but you may want to study more advanced concepts. This is especially important if you are developing complex simulations or other algorithm-heavy programs. For most day-to-day programming, you don't need much advanced math. Studying logic, especially computer logic, can help you understand how to best to approach complex problem-solving for more advanced programs."

Try to think of a basic application, such as a calculator, and develop a way to make it. Use the syntax and concepts you've been learning and apply them to practical uses. Software engineer Jessica Andzouana says the best thing to do when learning to program is to always be working on a project while you're reading and leaning how the language works. \"It's not just memorization and just trying to understand the concepts in an intellectual, theoretical way,\" she says. \"I think having the application is both motivating and rewarding and reinforces the learning.\" [8] X Expert Source Jessica Andzouana Software Engineer Expert Interview. 1 August 2023."

Finding and participating in a community can do wonders for your learning. You will gain access to a variety of samples and tools that can aid you in your learning process. Reading other programmers' code can inspire you and help you grasp concepts that you haven't mastered yet. [9] X Research source Check out programming forums and online communities for your language of choice. Make sure to participate and not just constantly ask questions. These communities are usually viewed as a place of collaboration and discussion and not simply Q&A. Feel free to ask for help, but be prepared to show your work and be open to trying different approaches. Once you have some experience under your belt, consider attending a hack-a-thon or programming jam. These are events where individuals or teams compete against the clock to develop a functional program, usually based on a specific theme. These events can be a lot of fun and are a great way to meet other programmers."

      "content": "Learn another programming language. While you can certainly get by with mastering one language, many programmers help their chances of success in the field by learning multiple languages. Their second or third languages are usually complementary to their first ones, allowing them to develop more complex and interesting programs. Once you have a good grasp of your first programming language, it may be time to start learning a new one. You will likely find that learning your second language goes much quicker than the first. Many core concepts of programming carry over across languages, especially if the languages are closely related."
