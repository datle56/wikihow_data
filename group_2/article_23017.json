      "content": "A week gives the person enough time to thoughtfully respond. The person you’re chatting with could still be interested even if they’ve gone dark for a little while. It may feel like a long time waiting for them to reach out, but keep your hopes up that they’ll text you back. They could realize that they miss talking with you and send a message. Even though it’s a little old-fashioned, some people will wait 3 days after a date to text you back to make you miss them more. Waiting any longer than a week could be a sign they’re not interested, and it might be best to let the conversation die out."

      "content": "The person may have truly been busy or missed your text. Rather than jumping to conclusions, give your texting partner the benefit of the doubt if they haven’t responded yet. You can’t be sure what came up in their life or if they’ve been caught up with something really important, so stay optimistic that they aren’t ignoring your messages.

      "content": "The person you’re chatting with may not like to communicate over text. Scroll back through your messages and see how frequently the person texted you. If there was always a lot of time in between your messages and their responses, then the amount of time you’ve waited might be normal. [2] X Research source If they normally messaged back and forth without a break, then it could be a sign that something came up or that they’re losing interest."

      "content": "It’s a good sign if the person puts effort into their past messages. Read through your text messages again and check how the person worded their messages. Even if they don’t send a lot of texts, long and thoughtful messages that keep the conversation going mean that they like talking to you. They may have just gotten distracted and missed your last message. [3] X Research source If they sent short messages or didn’t feel very involved in the convo, then it’s a sign they aren’t really invested. Reader Poll: We asked 1015 wikiHow readers about why they would stop texting their crush first, and only 9% of them said if they only text first when they want something . [Take Poll] People generally see short replies and long delays between texts as a lack of interest, so they might be more likely to stop texting first when they notice these behaviors, instead."

Your texting partner might not feel the need to reply to texts that confirm information or don’t give them a lot to build off of. Instead of worrying about getting a text back from them, think about them smiling when they see your text. Some texts that aren’t the best for getting replies are: [4] X Research source “Hey.” “That’s cool!” “Okay see you then!”"

      "content": "Start a new conversation in case the person missed your message. If you’ve already waited a few days or a week, you’ve put in enough time between now and the last message. Go into a new topic rather than bringing up your last message. Just don’t bring up that they didn’t respond since it sounds passive-aggressive. [6] X Research source “Hey there! Hope you’re doing well! What was an exciting thing that happened today?” “OMG I just had the craziest day at work. Hopefully it hasn’t been too busy for you!” “Hi 😊 I finally saw The Batman . You were right, it was so good!! I have to hear your thoughts.” Avoid sending a wall of texts since it could be overwhelming for the person to read and catch up. [7] X Research source"

Let them explain what they’ve been up to and how they’re feeling without getting upset that they haven’t texted you. If they sound sincere and apologetic, then it’s a good sign that they still care and want to stay connected.

Even if you thought they were attractive, think about how you connected with them on a deeper level and if they have the same values as you.

If the person you’re texting doesn’t give you enough respect to communicate their feelings with you, then they’re not going to be worth your time in the long run. [10] X Research source Remember—every person you have a special connection with can be used as an opportunity for increasing your awareness, growth, and empowerment. They can also be used to review any areas where you may need to adjust your approach to romantic relationships. Try reconnecting with the end goal you have for your love life. Let that initiate your next move in your dating experience and let it drive you forward."
