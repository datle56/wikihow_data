The way you begin the conversation can set the tone for the whole exchange. Approach the beautiful girl with confidence, assured that you have the qualities to attract her. [2] X Research source Don’t take it too far and act cocky or arrogant. Just be yourself and believe that being yourself is enough to the girl's attention. For example, make eye contact, walk over to her and say, “Hi, I’m Tony. How are you?” She will most likely respond back positively. If you are already a bit nervous, you may want to wait until she is alone to approach her. This way you won’t be worrying about what her friends are thinking. Don’t wait too long to introduce yourself because you might lose your confidence. Also, girls think it’s creepy if you keep staring at them without saying anything. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use what you have in common. Beautiful girls aren’t just beautiful; they have interests, hobbies, and opinions. Finding something that you both have in common gives you something to talk to her about. [4] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. You don’t have to stalk her, just look around to see what you have in common that you can use to initiate a conversation. Make a statement about the commonality and then ask her a question so that conversation continues. Comment on your setting. For example, if you are at the park, you might say, “The pond looks really peaceful today. Have you ever fed the ducks?” Talk about something she said or did. For example, if she made a comment during a discussion, try saying, “Your comment was really thought-provoking. How did you learn so much about the topic?” If she’s reading a book or has the latest phone, then comment on it. [5] X Research source For example, “That book looks intriguing. What's it about?”"

      "title": "Take it slow.",
      "content": "Take it slow. Don’t ask her out the first time you meet a beautiful girl. Doing this can make her feel pressured and nervous; she’ll be more likely to turn you down. It can also make you feel super nervous to just be meeting her for the first time and ask her out all out once. Instead, take it slow. Just focus on introducing yourself and talking with her briefly to give her a sense of you and get comfortable with you."

      "title": "Get her contact information.",
      "content": "Get her contact information. Don’t ask for her phone number; girls are more likely to say yes if you just ask, “Is it alright if I contact you sometime?” She can decide whether she wants to give you her phone number, email address, or other contact information. Remember your goal isn’t to get her phone number, but to get to know her. However she wants you to contact her is fine."

    {
      "title": "Leave first.",
      "content": "Leave first. When you first meet a beautiful girl, this helps you in a lot of ways. The first meeting is often a little awkward and you might be nervous and say something that makes her reject you. Leaving first cuts down on the chances of this and can help the girl feel less pressured. [6] X Research source It also keeps you from appearing desperate and makes you seem a little mysterious. After you have her contact information, you might say, “Well, it’s been a pleasure talking to you, but I’ve got to go get back to work. I’ll contact you soon.” Or try saying, “Well, I’ve taken up enough of your time right now. I’ll let you get back to what you were doing. I’ll call/email/text you soon.”"

      "content": "Always look your best. You never know when a beautiful girl is going to cross your path, so try to always look as good as possible. You don’t have to change your style or buy a new wardrobe or even dress up, but you do want to make sure you practice good hygiene and present yourself well. Make sure your hair is combed, breath fresh, face clean. Sometimes you might not look your best (maybe you just came from playing soccer) but you can still present yourself well by your attitude."

      "content": "Rehearse. Practicing how you will approach a beautiful girl makes it easier to do once the time presents itself. Think about what you will say and how you will say it. Rehearse the exchange in your mind and out-loud until you are comfortable. Practice in the mirror or with a close friend. Video tape yourself to hear your voice tone and pace. Try different variations of what you want to say. For example, you might practice, “Can I contact you sometime?”; “Is it okay if I contact you?”; “How can I contact you?”; “Is it alright if I contact you?” and figure out which one feels most comfortable for you to say."

      "content": "Go shopping. You are bound to see beautiful girls at the mall, boutiques, and even grocery store. [10] X Research source Instead of ordering the things you need online, actually go to a store and shop. Not only will you stock up on the things you need, but you might meet the perfect girl for you in the checkout line. If a beautiful girl is in line before or after you and she only has one or two items (and you can afford it) pay for her purchase. You don’t have to necessarily buy anything, even browsing and window-shopping gives you the opportunity to meet beautiful girls."

      "content": "Chat online. You can find tons of beautiful women on social networking sites and apps, forums, and chat rooms. Meeting them this way reduces some of the pressure of getting to know them face-to-face. Be careful when you are meeting an online friend for the first time in-person. Make sure you let someone know where you are going, who you are going to be with, what time you should be home, etc. Represent yourself honestly on your social network profile. Make sure all your pictures are actually of you and that things you post about yourself are true. When making a profile on a dating app or social media platform, avoid using too many group photos so potential matches know what you look like. A nice selfie works wonders.

Beautiful girls don’t like it when you treat them like that’s all they are — remember that she's a person with a personality and not an object for you to win or show off. [11] X Research source Show her that you know that she is more than just beautiful. Get to know her just like you would any other person. Learn about her hobbies and talents.

[12] X Research source Acting jealous will make her feel like you don’t trust her. It may also cause unnecessary problems with other people. Be confident and remember that she chose to be with you.

Talk about your common interests and do things together that you both enjoy. Plan a date exploring your neighborhood or city. Take her to eat somewhere neither of you have been. Play games together. You could play tag, kickball, or even a board or video game."

      "content": "Give each other space. You might want to spend all of your time with her, but don’t be clingy or smother her. Spending time apart gives you time to miss each other. It also gives you time to develop your own interests and have something to talk about when you are together. Spend time with your friends and family so that those relationships stay strong. Plan an un-date. A time where each of you plan to do something on your own. Keep doing the things you were doing before you met her."
