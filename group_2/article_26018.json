      "content": "Apply foods containing lactic acid. Lactic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid, which is a group of acids naturally occurring in certain foods.

Only use lactic acid products at night, as it can make your skin even more susceptible to UV damage. [1] X Research source Apply a thin layer of plain yogurt to your hands and feet before bed. Leave the yogurt on for five to 10 minutes, and rinse with warm water. Repeat a couple times per week.
