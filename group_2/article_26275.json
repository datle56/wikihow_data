      "content": "Keep a regular sleeping schedule so you get plenty of rest . Sticking to a regular sleep schedule can help you get a better night's sleep, so try to go to bed at the same time every night, and wake up at the same time each morning. When you're well-rested, you're going to look refreshed, youthful, and energetic, so you’ll look great even if you run into your crush first thing in the morning! [2] X Research source If you can, try to stick to the same schedule every night, even on the weekends. However, if you stay up late one night, try to make yourself wake up at your normal time so you don't disrupt your schedule more than you have."

      "content": "Maintain your personal hygiene every day. If you want your crush to find you attractive, it's important to make sure you keep your body clean and cared for. Each day, take a shower or a bath, brush your teeth and floss, and wear deodorant. You should also wash your face and apply a lightweight facial moisturizer twice a day. Choose face products that are formulated for your skin type, like a gentle cream cleanser for dry skin or a foaming cleanser for oily skin. To make sure your hands look nice, keep your nails clean and trimmed."

      "content": "Try wearing the color red to catch your crush’s eye. If you know you’re going to be around your crush, try grabbing an eye-catching color from your closet. For instance, you could go bold with a bright red top, or you could wear a neutral shirt with red accents for a more toned-down look. Red is the color of passion and love, so it’s a great way to send a signal to your crush! You can still impress your crush when you wear other colors besides red, especially if you see your crush every day. Try to pick colors that look good with your skin tone. For instance, if you have a warm skin tone, you might complement that by wearing colors like orange, yellow, and beige. If you have a cooler skin tone, you might look best in blues and greens. Remember, no matter what your personal style, you'll look your best if your clothes are clean and wrinkle-free. Also, opt for clothing that skims across your figure for the most flattering fit. If your clothes are too tight, you might seem uncomfortable, and if they're too baggy, you may come across as sloppy."

      "content": "Take the time to style your hair before you see your crush. While the way you do your hair will depend on your haircut and your personal style, you'll look your best if you take at least a little time in the mirror each morning. If you need to, use a product like mousse or hairspray to help your hair hold the style you choose. If you’re in a hurry, at least use your fingers to smooth down any flyaways. [3] X Research source For instance, if you have short hair, you might use gel to create a spiky hairstyle if your style is edgy, or you might comb it behind your ears and hairspray it for a put-together look. If you have long hair, you might tie it in a neat braid or ponytail to keep it out of your face, you could straighten it so it lies flat, or you might use a curling wand to create beachy waves."

      "content": "Use accessories to show your personal style. When you’re getting dressed, try to pick at least one accessory to jazz up your outfit. Sometimes the smallest touches can elevate your look from basic to amazing! For instance, even if you're wearing a basic jeans-and-tee combo, you could change the whole feel of the outfit just by adding a pair of bold earrings, a choker, a cocktail ring, or a thick belt. [4] X Research source Try to pick accessories that you feel reflect your personality. For instance, if you're independent and rebellious, you might look for rockstar-inspired pieces, like a leather or canvas cuff bracelet, a flashy belt, or a studded choker. If you're reserved and polished, you might prefer tasteful, classic jewelry, like pearl earrings, a pendant on a chain, or a nice watch."

      "content": "Opt for natural-looking makeup if you wear any. It's fine to use a little makeup to hide any blemishes or accentuate your favorite features. However, keep in mind that you want your crush to like you for you, so if you do wear makeup, it's a good idea to keep it light and natural. For instance, for a simple everyday look, you might dot a little concealer on any blemishes and under your eyes, then fill in your brows with a brow pencil. Use your fingers to swipe a little highlighter across your cheekbones, then define your lashes by brushing on a light coat of mascara."

Practice making different faces and shoot the pictures from different angles until you find the most flattering shots. Seeing cute pictures of yourself is a great way to improve your confidence, so you’ll seem more self-assured when your crush is around. [5] X Research source For a bold approach, try sending your favorite selfie to your crush. If you’re not quite ready for that, post it somewhere you know they’ll see it! If you choose to share your selfies on social media, just pick 1-2 of your favorites. If you share too many pictures of yourself, you might seem self-centered."

      "content": "Smile and make eye contact when you see the person you like. Even if you’re talking to someone else, whenever you see your crush, try to glance their way to see if you can make quick eye contact. If you do meet eyes, give your crush a brief smile, then go back to what you’re doing. This will show that you're confident and self-assured, and it will also show your crush that you noticed them. [6] X Research source If you notice your crush is looking at you, make eye contact and hold their gaze for a few seconds, then smile and look away. Smiling can actually make you feel happier, so it might be worth it to force a smile even if you aren't having the best day. Having a good sense of humor can make you seem cuter, too. When it's appropriate, tell jokes or funny stories to get other people laughing, and don't be shy about laughing at other people's jokes!"

Whether you're around your friends, your crush, or someone you hardly know, try to give others your undivided attention when they're talking. Use active listening techniques like saying, \"Yeah?\" or \"Go on\" to show them that you're following along with what they say, and follow up later to show them that you remember what they were talking about. [7] X Research source For instance, if your crush says, \"My aunt is having surgery on Thursday and I'm really worried about her,\" you might text them early on Thursday to say something like, \"Hey, I'm thinking about you and your family today.\" Being a thoughtful person toward others—not necessarily just your crush—will make you seem more likable to your crush."

Whenever you get the opportunity, try to point out when you notice something nice about the person you like, whether it's their outfit or a great personality trait. If your crush sees that you're generous with compliments, they may see you as a positive, kind person. In addition, constantly focusing on the best attributes of people can make it easier for you to see those qualities in yourself and others. [8] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"Jenny, I can't believe how hard you worked on that presentation yesterday! You did so amazing!\" You might also say something like, \"Hey Chris, I love that haircut!\""

Sometimes when you like someone, it can be tempting to try to relate to the things they like to try to impress them. However, you'll seem more confident—and therefore more attractive—if you have your own unique interests. [9] X Research source If you hate avocados and your crush loves them, don't pretend to like them. Instead, show your independence by telling the truth. For instance, you could say, \"I just can't stand plain avocados, but I do love guacamole!\" If you do have some of the same interests as your crush, try to focus on those, rather than things you might have different opinions on. It’s okay to hold a little bit about yourself back, too, so don’t feel like you have to tell your crush everything about you. Acting a little mysterious might even make your crush more interested!"

If you want to put yourself right in your crush’s line of sight, try making friends with people who are friends with your crush. Strike up a conversation with them in class, for instance, or sit by them while you eat lunch. As you get to know them better, you’ll likely come across more chances to hang out with your crush, so the two of you can get closer, too. Only do this if you actually like the other people. Otherwise, there’s a chance it could backfire, since they might annoy you or talk bad about you to your crush. Try not to give the impression that you might be interested in dating any of your crush's friends! For instance, you might avoid being too physically affectionate with them, especially in front of your crush."

Even if you seem cool and confident on the outside, sometimes you might notice that you get butterflies when your crush is around. Whenever you start to feel a little anxious, inhale slowly so the breath goes deep into your belly as you count to 4, then count to 4 again as you exhale. If you need to, repeat this several times until you start to feel calm. When you breathe deeply, it sends a signal to your body that everything is okay, so it will be easier to relax."
