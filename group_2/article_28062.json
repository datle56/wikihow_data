      "title": "Mix your essential oils in a small dish to try out your scent.",
      "content": "Mix your essential oils in a small dish to try out your scent. Before you dedicate an entire dish of perfume to one smell, you might want to test it to see if you like it first. Grab a small dish and use it to test out different scent combinations until you find one that you like. You can try different scents and ratios to experiment with your scent. [1] X Research source Ramekins are a great size for this, but you can use any small container that you have on-hand."

    {
      "title": "Pick 10 drops of a long-lasting essential oil as a base note.",
      "content": "Pick 10 drops of a long-lasting essential oil as a base note. Base notes are the longest lasting scents in your perfume due to its slow evaporation rate. You can pick cedarwood, frankincense, ginger, jasmine, or vanilla for this note. Pour in 10 drops of your choice as a base. [2] X Research source You need the most of your base note so it sticks around on your skin the longest. Pick sandalwood for a sweet and subtle perfume. Try frankincense for a woody scent. Pick jasmine for a floral note."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 5 to 10 drops of a middle note that is slightly more subtle.",
      "content": "Add 5 to 10 drops of a middle note that is slightly more subtle. Lavender, lemongrass, orange, and rosemary all make great middle notes. These scents won’t last quite as long and help to support the base note. [3] X Research source Try lavender oil to round out a sweet and subtle perfume. Pick rosemary for a more cologne-like scent. Try rose oil for a floral perfume."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose 3 to 5 drops of a top note that’s uplifting.",
      "content": "Choose 3 to 5 drops of a top note that’s uplifting. Top notes are what you’ll smell first, but they’ll also go away super quickly. Choose from grapefruit, juniper, lime, pine, and tangerine as a short but sweet top note. [4] X Research source Try bergamot for a citrus scent. Mix in cedarwood essential oil for a woody note."

    {
      "title": "Put a glass bowl in a saucepan half full of water over medium heat.",
      "content": "Put a glass bowl in a saucepan half full of water over medium heat. Grab a large saucepan and fill it up with water from your tap so it’s about half full. Place a glass bowl in the center of the saucepan and turn the stove to medium to create a double boiler. [5] X Research source If you have a double boiler, you can use that instead. Beeswax doesn’t melt down well in the microwave, and you probably won’t get an even, smooth mixture. The stovetop is your best bet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour your beeswax and carrier oil into the glass bowl.",
      "content": "Pour your beeswax and carrier oil into the glass bowl. Carrier oil is a fragrance-free oil that will thin out the beeswax. Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of beeswax and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of your carrier oil to the glass bowl. [6] X Research source You can use almond oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, or olive oil for your carrier oil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the carrier oil and beeswax mixture for 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Heat the carrier oil and beeswax mixture for 2 to 3 minutes. The carrier is already a liquid, but beeswax is solid. Heat the mixture for a few minutes until the beeswax melts into a pourable liquid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the bowl from the heat and stir the mixture.",
      "content": "Remove the bowl from the heat and stir the mixture. Use oven mitts and carefully take your glass bowl off the sauce pan. Use a wooden stick to combine the wax and the oil together until they look smooth and shiny. [7] X Research source Your wooden stick will get wax on it, so don’t use anything that you’d like to cook with later on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir your chosen essential oils into the hot mixture.",
      "content": "Stir your chosen essential oils into the hot mixture. Gently pour your essential oil mixture into the wax and oil, then use your wooden stirrer to combine all of your ingredients. Try not to spend too long on this, or the wax could start to harden up. [8] X Research source The essential oil will probably smell really intense at first, but that’s okay! It will spread out in the wax mixture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the perfume mixture into 3 to 4 small containers with lids.",
      "content": "Pour the perfume mixture into 3 to 4 small containers with lids. Pick out a few 2 in (5.1 cm) containers that can be sealed with a lid to store your perfume. Carefully pour a small amount into each container, being careful not to spill any of the wax. [9] X Research source You can use empty mint tins as a cute way to store your perfume."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the wax cool and harden for 1 to 2 hours.",
      "content": "Let the wax cool and harden for 1 to 2 hours. Once your mixture hardens, you now have perfume! You can give some of the containers away as a gift or keep them all for yourself to stock up on a great scent. [10] X Research source Don’t use your perfume until it’s fully dry, or you could burn yourself."

    {
      "title": "Rub a cotton swab or your finger over the perfume.",
      "content": "Rub a cotton swab or your finger over the perfume. You don’t need to press down very hard to pick up the scent of your perfume. Gently dab your finger or a cotton swab onto the waxy surface until you see a slight indent in the perfume. [11] X Research source The more perfume you pick up, the stronger the scent will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dab the perfume onto your wrists and behind your ears.",
      "content": "Dab the perfume onto your wrists and behind your ears. Perfume smells the best and lasts the longest on your wrists, your neck, and right behind your ears, since you emit more heat from those areas. Gently rub it into your skin for a soothing, pleasant aroma. [12] X Research source Solid perfume isn’t quite as strong as liquid perfume, so you don’t have to worry about applying too much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store your sealed perfume in a cool, dry place for 6 to 12 months.",
      "content": "Store your sealed perfume in a cool, dry place for 6 to 12 months. Keep a lid on your perfume container whenever you aren’t using it. If you used grapeseed as a carrier, use your perfume within 6 months. If you used olive oil, jojoba oil, or almond oil, you can keep it around for 12 months. [13] X Research source Grapeseed oil breaks down faster than other types of oil, which is why it doesn’t stay as fresh."
