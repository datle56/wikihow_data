      "content": "Shape your own e-collar out of sturdy paper for a temporary fix. This collar works best on smaller dogs but if you swap poster board for cardboard, this can work for larger dogs too. Follow these steps to make your own e-collar: [1] X Research source Measure the top of your dog’s head from the tip of their nose to the back of their collar with a fabric measuring tape . Add 1 in (2.5 cm) to your measurement. Using a compass, cut out a circle of poster board or cardboard with a diameter 2 times your measurement. Cut through half of your circle, stopping in the middle. Measure your dog’s neck, and divide the number by 2. Cut a smaller circle out of your large circle that has the diameter of your previous measurement. Place the cone around your dog’s neck and tape the ends shut."

      "content": "Just one paper plate can keep your small dog from irritating their injury. Say you notice your tiny puppy chewing or licking a cut on its paw. Try sliding a paper plate over their head to keep them from aggravating the wound until you can get a regular dog cone. Here’s how to make this quick e-collar: [2] X Research source Place 3 thin paper plates on top of each other and fold them in half twice. Cut off the corner of the plates in a half circle. Open 1 of the folds and cut the bottom folded edge of the plates. Unfold the plates completely, and set aside 1 plate (this will be the base of your cone). Trim off the remaining folded edge of the 2 plates so you have 4 halves. Wrap the first plate around your dog’s neck, stapling the 2 ends together to hold it in place. Attach 3 of the halves to the cone's rim to give it more length."

      "content": "Wrap a makeshift collar around your dog’s neck for injuries behind the head. Not only is this dog cone alternative simple to make, but it’s also super comfortable for your pup. All you have to do is roll or fold a towel or cloth lengthwise, gently wrap it around your pup’s neck, and secure it with duct tape. [3] X Research source For smaller dogs, use a kitchen or tea towel . For larger dogs, use a beach or shower towel . Don’t be afraid to play around with the size and shape. If the towel isn’t thick enough to limit neck movement, keep folding it in halves or thirds. No towel? No worries! Use an old T-shirt instead. Know that this method won’t work if your pup has a wound on their front paws, as they could still lick it with the towel wrapped around their head."

      "content": "String pool noodles around your large dog’s collar to limit scratching. Unlike regular dog cones, this DIY collar restricts your pup’s movement without obstructing their view or eating habits. Simply cut a pool noodle into 2 in (5.1 cm) sections using a serrated knife, and string the sections through your dog’s unfastened collar, [4] X Research source Use your knife or scissors to make the pool noodle’s hole bigger if the “beads” don’t fit through the collar. If you don’t want to use your dog’s everyday collar, try using a piece of twine or string the same length as their collar instead. Make sure your pup can move their head around with the collar on, and that you can slide a finger easily between the beads and their neck."

      "content": "Cut a hole in a bucket to create an e-collar fit for dogs of all sizes. This is a great alternative to a regular plastic dog cone, and it only requires some measuring and cutting. Measure around your dog’s neck and head to the store to look for a plastic bucket with a bottom rim around an 1 in (2.5 cm) larger than your measurement. Cut out the bottom of the bucket with scissors or a knife, and slip it over your pup’s head. [5] X Research source Don’t have a measuring tape? Bring your dog’s collar to the store with you. If it sits comfortably inside the bottom rim of the bucket, it’s the right size. Sand down the edges of the bucket with sandpaper, so your pup doesn’t get cut. Don’t have an extra bucket? Try using this method with a cleaned-out butter tub. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Sew hook-and-loop fastener to a strip of carton foam to wrap around your dog’s neck. Now, this DIY may be sturdier than other methods, but it does take a few more crafty skills. Measure around your dog’s neck and add a couple of inches to your measurement. Then, find a piece of soft egg carton foam the same size. Sew velcro to the shorter ends, and wrap the foam around your pup’s neck. [7] X Research source Can’t find a piece of foam the exact size? Buy a larger piece and cut it down to size. Eyeball your DIY collar and make sure the foam is long enough to trap your pup’s nose inside. Otherwise, they may be able to lick their paws. If you’re not handy with a needle and thread, try super gluing the hook-and-loop fastener to the foam."

Dog cones have gotten a bad rap over the years, so many companies are trying to break the stigma and make e-collars dogs don’t hate wearing. Here are some of the best ones out there: [8] X Research source Soft e-collars have cushions around the inside sides for a more comfortable fit. Inflatable e-collars don’t block your pup’s vision and are much comfier to wear and play in. Surgical recovery suits keep your pup from chewing or licking wounds without a hindering cone."
