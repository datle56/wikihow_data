      "content": "Choose goals that are meaningful to you. Your bucket list should contain items that are deeply meaningful to you. Don’t include items simply because you feel you should, or because others would find them impressive. What are your dreams? What brings you fulfillment? [2] X Research source Consider childhood passions that have fallen to the wayside. These can be a good indicator of things you value, but haven’t had the time or resources to pursue. Think about achievements that have given you the greatest confidence, and activities or moments that have brought you the most passion or joy."

      "title": "Find a common theme.",
      "content": "Find a common theme. As you brainstorm within these categories, look for a common theme and use it to guide the creation of your list. For example, if your happiest moments have been helping others, then choose bucket list items, like starting an after-school program for underprivileged kids, that align with that theme."

      "title": "Cast off expectations.",
      "content": "Cast off expectations. Don’t worry about others judging you, or not achieving certain items. Listen to what you truly want. Are there any goals that you’ve secretly wanted to pursue, but never have because you were embarrassed? Consider including those. [3] X Research source If you don’t achieve all of the goals on your list, that’s fine! A bucket list is a guide, not a binding document."

      "content": "Talk to others for inspiration. If you are feeling stuck, reach out to friends and family. Ask them about the items on their bucket lists and their favorite life experiences. [4] X Research source Ask, “What is the coolest thing you have ever done?” or “If you could do one thing before you die that you’ve never done before, what would it be?” Feel free to research online for fun ideas, too!"

Not only can smaller goals be rewarding, by they’ll make your list more manageable, inspiring you to get out there and check some items off! [8] X Research source You can think of small goals as those that can be accomplished without leaving your town on a budget of less than $100. For example, a small goal might be making pasta from scratch."

      "content": "Break big goals down into easier and harder variations. You might want to host your own television show one day. Put that down. Then, include an easier variation of that goal, like hosting a YouTube show that gets 5K views. The easier variations can act as stepping stones to the harder goals. [10] X Research source Do you want to write a novel? Start with publishing a short story in a local literary magazine. If one of your goals is to open a bakery, you could start by running a successful baked goods stand at your local farmer’s market."

Short-term goals are less daunting, so try breaking up your list by time periods. You can break it up by decades, years, or seasons. [11] X Research source For example, you might have mini bucket lists for your 20s, 30s, and 40s. Or, you might make a bucket list just for the summer. It’s completely up to you.

That being said, you should remove any items that are completely unrealistic. Your list should contain items that are hard, but not impossible, to achieve. [12] X Research source For example, if you are a 50-year-old man with limited athletic experience, you will probably never be a professional basketball player. However, you might be able to win the championship in a local club league with practice. You shouldn’t remove an item just because it is expensive. Expensive goals can be achieved in creative ways."
