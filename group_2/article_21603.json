However, half of a quarter cup is also equal to 2 tablespoons or 6 teaspoons of any dry ingredient. [1] X Research source If you’re converting wet ingredients, then 1 fluid ounce (30 ml) is the equivalent of a halved ¼ cup."

      "content": "Dry ingredient amounts can vary if they’re packed or compressed. If you’re using flour, brown sugar, or powdered sugar, measuring cups fit different amounts depending on if you compact the ingredients. Using too much or too little of an ingredient when you’re baking can affect the recipe’s consistency, so it’s important to check if the cup should be loosely or tightly packed. [3] X Research source Use dry measuring cups with a flat brim. Scoop the ingredient into the cup with a spoon and level off the excess with a butter knife. If you’re worried about inaccuracies using measuring cups, measure the ingredients by weight instead. Use a kitchen scale and make simple conversions."

      "title": "Wet ingredients have the same volume no matter what tool you use.",
      "content": "Wet ingredients have the same volume no matter what tool you use. Wet ingredients don’t change in volume because they can’t be compacted. Just make sure you use a liquid measuring cup for your ingredients so you can have the most precision. Avoid using dry measuring cups for wet ingredients because they’re more difficult to fill correctly without spilling."

      "content": "Make conversions before you start cooking. Instead of trying to do math on the fly, look through the recipe and cut all of the ingredients in half before you begin. That way, you can pull out the right amount of ingredients and don’t have to worry about making a mistake while you’re cooking. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use smaller cookware for your recipe.",
      "content": "Use smaller cookware for your recipe. Since you’ll have less batter or dough from a halved recipe, using a large pan can make cakes, brownies, or breads flatter or have the wrong consistency. Opt for cookware that’s about half the size so your recipe still turns out. [5] X Research source If you’re making single-serve foods, such as muffins, cupcakes, or cookies, you can use the cookware listed in the recipe. You just won’t be able to make as many as if you were making the full recipe."

      "content": "Avoid cutting ingredients for coating cookware. Even though you should halve the other ingredients in your recipe, use the same amount of oil, butter, or flour to line a pan. Cutting these ingredients could cause your food to stick inside a pot or pan, so it’s best to stick to the written recipe."
