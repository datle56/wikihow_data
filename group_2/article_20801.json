      "content": "Make eye contact and touch them to communicate your support. Turn toward the person and open yourself to them so they can tell that you're supportive. If you're close to the person and they're open to physical touch, resting your hand on their arm or leg can show them that you care. [7] X Expert Source Michelle Joy, MA, MFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 26 June 2020. Making eye contact also lets the person know that you're focused on them.

If you've misunderstood, they can correct you and they'll feel more supported than they would if you made assumptions. [8] X Research source Paraphrase what they said rather than repeating it back word for word. This helps them see that you actually understand the feelings behind their words. For example, you might start with a phrase such as \"It sounds like you're saying\" or \"What I'm hearing is.\" Then continue with your paraphrase of what you understand. Be careful not to interrupt or talk over the person. Give them all the time and space they need to talk, then reflect back when there's a natural pause in the conversation and it feels appropriate for you to say something."

You can even say that you would feel the same way if you were in their shoes. It helps the person feel as though they're not overreacting or handling things in a weird or unusual way. Here are some things you could say: [11] X Expert Source Michelle Joy, MA, MFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 26 June 2020. \"It's normal to feel a mixture of emotions right now.\" \"It makes sense that you would be upset about that.\" \"Anybody would've gotten angry at them for saying that.\" \"Hey, if I were you I'd feel hurt too.\""

[14] X Expert Source Michelle Joy, MA, MFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 26 June 2020. For example, if the person is going through financial difficulties, you might say, \"What if you talked to your supervisor about a pay raise?\" Avoid giving the person advice or telling them how to fix the problem—even if you think you know how to do that! Instead, let them find the best solution on their own. [15] X Research source If you want to provide some sort of concrete assistance, you can frame this as a \"what if\" statement as well so that it doesn't sound like you're trying to fix things. For example, you might say, \"What if I bought you groceries this week?\""
