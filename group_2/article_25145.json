      "title": "Gather the necessary materials.",
      "content": "Gather the necessary materials. There are a few things that you'll need in order to make it to The End and defeat the dragon successfully: 15 Eyes of Ender - You can make an Eye of Ender by combining Ender Pearls and Blaze Rods (found in The Nether ). You'll need at least 11 to activate the End Portal, though you'll need more if you don't know the location of a nearby Stronghold. Ender Pearls - Ender Pearls drop when you kill Endermen. Aside from being necessary components of Eyes of Ender, these items can also be thrown to cause the player to teleport to wherever they land. If you aren’t too interested in killing loads of endermen or if you are playing on peaceful difficulty, you can still get ender pearls by bartering with piglins, trading with cleric villagers, or raiding naturally generated chests. A bed - Once you reach the Portal room in the Stronghold, you can place the bed in a safe place in order to save your game before going through the End Portal. Trying to sleep in a bed in the End will cause a large explosion(skilled enough players and speed-runners may use that to one’s advantage while taking down the dragon, though), so resetting your spawn point here is crucial. Cooked food - This will serve as your healing source. Place some raw meat in a furnace to cook the meat. You should have enough food to restore your entire health bar several times over. Consider bringing golden apples and, if you are lucky enough to find it, enchanted golden apples as well. Armour - Strong armour, like iron, diamond or netherite, will help you survive Ender Dragon and Endermen attacks. It is recommended to enchant your armour."

      "content": "Make sure that you have the proper weapons and tools. Ideally, you'll have a diamond or netherite sword with a level V Sharpness enchantment , but you'll probably also want to have a bow and some arrows with you in case you need to fend off the Ender Dragon's early attacks. You'll also need a pickaxe (preferably diamond or iron)—there is a chance that you spawn underground, and if that is the case for you, you need a pickaxe to mine a way out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Equip armor.",
      "content": "Equip armor. The Ender Dragon can do a staggering amount of damage, so having armor on is crucial. You can equip armor by opening your inventory and selecting the armor from there. If you haven't yet created armor, make some out of the strongest material you have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find",
      "content": "Find or build an End Portal. You'll find End Portals in Strongholds, which can be located by throwing an Eye of Ender in the air and then following it until it stops over a certain point. End Portals are usually in their own room in the Stronghold. If you build the End Portal in creative mode, you won't be able to get an achievement for killing the Ender Dragon (even if you switch to Survival Mode after building it)."

    {
      "title": "Place your bed and set your spawn point before proceeding.",
      "content": "Place your bed and set your spawn point before proceeding. This will save your game, meaning that if you die in the Ender Dragon fight, you'll respawn just outside of the End Portal area. This is easiest if you first clear the Stronghold of all enemies and loot it as needed. You may have to section off a part of the Portal room to serve as a safe space."

      "title": "Add the Eyes of Ender to the End Portal.",
      "content": "Add the Eyes of Ender to the End Portal. Once you've added one Eye of Ender to each square of the End Portal's frame, you should see the Portal light up. If the End Portal is already lit up, you don't need to add any Eyes of Ender. The chance for getting a 100% fully lit end portal is very, very rare though—1 in 1,000,000 statistically."

      "content": "Avoid the Endermen during this part. Upon reaching The End, you might be dismayed to see countless Endermen milling around the arena. Thankfully, Endermen won't attack you unless you look at them for an extended period of time, so just ignore them for now. If you do end up in a fight with an Enderman, try to kill it before the next part of the fight . Wearing a pumpkin on your head will prevent Endermen from attacking you if you look at them. However, doing so will make your field of vision smaller in the game and in a \"pumpkin\" like shape."

      "content": "Mine some End Stone. End Stone is one of two blocks that won't break when the Ender Dragon flies through it (the other is Obsidian); for this reason, you'll use End Stone to create a platform from which you can actually reach the End Dragon once you get to the next part. You'll need at least 12 End Stone, but mine as much as possible without attracting the attention of the Ender Dragon."

The Ender Dragon will most likely fire off an attack toward you after you break an End Crystal, so be prepared to dodge. End Crystals cause the Ender Dragon's health to regenerate. Once you break all of the End Crystals, the Ender Dragon will cease to be immortal. If your Ender Pearl teleported you into the End Crystal, the End Crystal will break automatically."

Since the End Crystal will explode and knock you back, you may want to do this by equipping an Ender Pearl, hitting the Crystal until it breaks, and then immediately teleporting back onto the pillar with the Ender Pearl to avoid getting knocked off of the pillar.

The Ender Dragon will fire an Ender Charge—a fireball which results in a purple mist—at your location, meaning that you'll need to run over to your other staircase and wait for the purple mist to dissipate. If you like, you can collect the mist in the bottle to make the cloud dissipate faster and obtain dragon's breath You can collect the purple mist by using a glass bottle to get Dragon's Breath.

Put a torch two blocks below it and break the block in between so that the egg drops onto the torch and breaks into a collectable item. Don’t worry if the dragon egg teleports into the portal! If that happens, go to your world spawnpoint (the world generation point, NOT the last bed you slept in) and collect it there just like how you would otherwise do in the end."
