      "content": "Put on protective googles, a dust mask, and disposable plastic gloves. The chemicals used to make Izal are strong, so it's important to take proper safety precautions. Cover your nose with a dust mask so that you don't breathe in the harmful vapors. Additionally, wear plastic eye goggles and put on disposable plastic gloves to protect your skin. [1] X Research source Keep a fully stocked first aid kit nearby in case you need to treat minor chemical burns. Bear in mind that serious burns should be treated by a doctor and may need to be neutralized. Working with these chemicals is not advised if you have asthma or other breathing problems.

      "title": "Set up your workspace in a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Set up your workspace in a well-ventilated area. Mixing ingredients for Izal creates potent chemical fumes. Be sure to set up your workspace on a flat, stable surface near an open window, or in a large room with plenty of air circulation. You can turn on a ceiling fan or place a box fan in the open window to improve air circulation. Don't work near open flames. These chemicals are highly flammable. Choose a workspace that children can't access. Store unused chemicals out of reach of children. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use proper lab equipment, mixing utensils, and well-packaged chemicals.",
      "content": "Use proper lab equipment, mixing utensils, and well-packaged chemicals. You will need a 10-15 liter plastic bucket, measuring utensils, and a variety of chemical-safe stirring utensils for this project. You can buy the required chemicals and tools from reputable suppliers or chemical wholesalers. Always buy chemicals that are quality-control tested and packaged properly. If you don't have a good working knowledge of a basic lab setup or previous experience mixing chemicals together, you may want to reconsider this project."

      "title": "Combine Texapon and water in a plastic bucket.",
      "content": "Combine Texapon and water in a plastic bucket. Measure out 4 liters of water and pour it into the plastic bucket. Add 2 grams of Texapon to the water and stir the mixture carefully with a chemical-safe spoon or lab stirrer. Keep stirring until the Texapon is completely dissolved. [4] X Research source The mixture will get slightly frothy as you stir it. Texapon is a sodium laureth sulfate frequently used in detergents, soaps, and shampoos. It is usually white and comes in crystal, flake, or powder form. Texapon can severely irritate the skin, eyes, lungs, and nasal passageways."

      "title": "Add the Phenol to the mixture and stir thoroughly.",
      "content": "Add the Phenol to the mixture and stir thoroughly. Carefully measure out 140 ml of Phenol and pour it into the mixture in your bucket. Stir the ingredients with your chemical-safe stirrer until they're well combined. The mixture will continue to look frothy and may get frothier as you stir in the Phenol. [5] X Research source Phenol is commercially available in liquid form and is commonly used in disinfectants and other consumer products. It's usually clear or light yellow in color. Phenol can cause respiratory irritation, headaches, and eye irritation. Contact with skin can cause chemical burns.

      "content": "Add the Lysol liquid to the mixture and stir continuously. Measure out 130 ml of Lysol and add it to the mixture in the bucket. Stir continuously as you add the chemical so that it combines completely with the other ingredients. [7] X Research source Lysol liquid is commonly available in grocery stores. It is a powerful germicide, and the liquid may look light pink or yellow in color."

      "content": "Pour the carbolic acid into the mixture and keep stirring. Measure out 140 ml of liquid carbolic acid and add it to the mixture in the bucket. Keep stirring so that the carbolic acid combines with the other ingredients. Continuous stirring is crucial, since it encourages the necessary chemical reaction to take place quickly. [8] X Research source Carbolic acid is highly corrosive and toxic. Breathing in the vapors can damage the upper respiratory tract and skin contact may cause chemical burns. [9] X Research source"
