      "content": "People are combining the walker 🚶‍♂️and climber 🧗emojis. Some people think the hiker emoji is a trick of memory that combines the walking emoji with the climber. The climber is wearing a red shirt and helmet that many remember. The walker is walking to the left, the same direction most people describe the hiker traveling. This is a reasonable explanation for why some people believe there was a hiker emoji, but there’s no proof one way or the other."

Examples are often misremembered marketing images or dialogue from iconic films. Here are a few examples: Rich Uncle Pennybags’ Monocle: One common example of the Mandela Effect is that people believe the Monopoly mascot has a monocle. This may be because they associate a monocle with wealth. But Rich Uncle Pennybags has never had a monocle. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Sinbad’s Shazaam : Some people who grew up in the 1990s insist they remember a movie called Shazaam , starring the actor and comedian Sinbad. In fact, a Reddit community is devoted to finding out what happened to the film. However, Sinbad has denied starring in any such movie. There’s some thought that people are a 1996 movie starring Shaquille O’Neal called Kazaam for a Sinbad film. “Luke, I am your father.”: Darth Vader’s iconic line in The Empire Strikes Back is commonly misquoted as, “Luke, I am your father.” Even James Earl Jones, the actor who voiced Darth Vader, remembers it that way.

Running shoe👟: A running shoe suggests moving by foot. Also, some hiking shoes look more like running shoes than hiking boots. Backpack🎒: The backpack is a common thing hikers carry, so it’s a perfect emoji to use when talking about your hike."
