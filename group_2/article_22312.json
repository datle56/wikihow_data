      "content": "Rest immediately after hurting your knee to prevent further injury. While bruising may not appear directly after injuring your knee, you can help prevent a more severe bruise, additional swelling, and pain by resting right away. Not only should you rest right away after the injury, but you should continue to rest your knee (and leg) until the bruise and injury are healed. [3] X Research source Resting won’t just help with the look of the bruise, swelling, and pain, but continuing to use your knee after it’s hurt may cause even more damage to your knee. This, in turn, may mean an even longer recovery time."

      "content": "Elevate your knee above your heart to prevent swelling. Once you’re off your feet, lie down and prop your injured leg up on a pillow or cushion. This will help control the swelling to your knee and could also make the bruise look less severe. [4] X Research source Lying on a couch with your injured leg propped up on the arm of the couch is a great method to use to elevate your knee."

      "title": "Put ice on your knee for 15 minutes each hour.",
      "content": "Put ice on your knee for 15 minutes each hour. Ice is the best option for preventing or reducing swelling and will help a bruise heal faster. Don’t put the ice directly onto the skin of your knee, instead, wrap it in a towel first. Keep the ice on your knee for 15 minutes, once an hour, until the swelling is reduced or the pain has subsided. [5] X Research source Ice packs or other frozen items (such as a bag of peas or corn) can work as well. Just be sure to wrap them in a towel before putting them on your knee. [6] X Research source You may want to continue to use ice for a couple of days after your bruise becomes visible. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean and treat your wounds. Bruises don’t usually result in external bleeding, but some knee injuries, such as falling on a rough surface (like gravel), may also cause cuts and scrapes to your knee. In addition to treating the bruise (and associated pain), you may also need to clean and treat the cuts and scrapes on your knee . [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Clean the cuts or scrapes on your knee with warm water and soap. Dry the area by blotting it with a clean towel. And then put on a bandage, if needed."

      "content": "Wrap a compression bandage around your knee to reduce the amount of swelling. To help prevent excessive swelling to your knee, you can wrap your knee with a compression bandage . You don’t want to wrap your knee too tightly as to cut off blood flow or make your lower leg or foot go numb. Just apply the bandage enough to keep your knee stable and apply a comfortable amount of pressure. [9] X Research source Compression bandages can be found in a typical first aid kit. You can also purchase compression or elastic bandages at your local drug store or pharmacy."

      "content": "Take medication to relieve pain, as needed. Most knee injuries and their associated bruises are going to hurt, some more than others. If the pain becomes uncomfortable, you may want to take some pain medications to help reduce the pain. Follow the instructions on the bottle to determine how much and how often to take the medication.

      "content": "Allow your bruised knee to fully heal before resuming regular activities. A bruised knee affects more than just your skin. Your whole knee may be sore or painful while the injury and bruise are healing. Take care not to use or walk on your injured leg more than absolutely necessary while it heals. [13] X Research source While your knee heals, avoid activities like running or playing sports. If an activity causes your knee to feel painful, it’s a good sign that you should stop doing that activity until you can do so without pain."

If your knee injury resulted in a bruised bone, you may also require a knee brace or crutches to help protect your knee while it heals. If your bruise is taking longer than 2 weeks to heal, or if you’ve experienced similar injuries previously, make an appointment and ask your doctor if your injury is severe enough to require a brace or crutches. [14] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source If you need to use crutches, it means your doctor doesn’t want you to use your knee or leg at all for a certain period of time.

Stretching both your leg and your knee will help loosen up the muscles and tendons, which, in turn, will help prevent further injury to your knee. Stretching will also help improve the flexibility and range of motion in your knee that may have been lost while your knee was healing.

While your knee is healing, after the initial swelling has gone down, you may find it helpful to apply gentle heat to your knee on a regular basis. The heat will help reduce the pain in your knee and will allow you to regain some range of motion. Heat may be particular useful if you’ve used your knee that day and it’s sore. [16] X Research source Heat can be applied using a heating pad on a low setting or using a cloth or towel soaked in warm water. Use heat for only 15 to 20 minutes at a time.

Regardless of what type of knee injury you sustained, you’ll want to take it slow when you start to perform regular activities again.
