      "content": "Save space with a basic half fold. Fold your jeans in half lengthwise so the legs are together. Slide the waistband of the jeans through the opening in a standard clothes hanger, and pull the jeans through until they’re folded in half, with the waistband and bottom hems lined up about even. [1] X Research source This fold keeps the jeans nice and flat, so they don’t take up much space in the closet. It doesn’t matter if you fold the jeans with the back pockets in or out. If your jeans tend to slide off of the hangers like this, pull the leg portion down so it’s longer than the waistband side. The jeans will take up more vertical space, but the weight will be more balanced on the hanger. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a fancy half fold to keep your pants from sliding off. Spread your unfolded jeans on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles. Pull one pants leg through the opening of a clothes hanger and fold that leg in half so the bottom hem is against the waistband of the jeans. Then, fold the pants in half lengthwise so the folded leg is against the other pants leg. Take the remaining pants leg and pull it through the hanger as well. [3] X Research source The two folded pants legs end up on opposite sides of the hanger, so they’re better secured—meaning your jeans won’t slide off the hanger while they’re in the closet."

      "title": "Do a 1/3 fold for an aesthetically pleasing display.",
      "content": "Do a 1/3 fold for an aesthetically pleasing display. Fold your jeans in half lengthwise with the back pockets facing out. Slide about 1/3 of the pants legs through a hanger, starting with the hem. Then, fold the waistband of the pants up and hook the back belt loop over the hanger’s hook. [4] X Research source Looping the belt hook over the hanger makes it easier to see the label on your jeans, so you can quickly find the pair you’re looking for without having to pull anything out of the closet. The triple fold makes the pants a little wider, so this may not be the best option if you have lots of jeans and limited closet space. But they’ll also be shorter, so it’s useful if you want to hang your jeans on a low bar in your closet."

      "title": "Hang your jeans upside-down with the Savile Row fold.",
      "content": "Hang your jeans upside-down with the Savile Row fold. Fold the pants in half long ways and put the clothes hanger between the pants legs near the hem (so there’s one leg on either side of the hanger). Pull about one leg through the hanger and fold it over until the hem is about at the crotch of the pants, then do the same with the other leg. This creates enough tension to keep the pants from sliding off of the hanger. [5] X Research source The weight of the waistband will pull the jeans down, helping prevent wrinkles. Your jeans will be a little longer on the hanger with this fold, but they won’t be as wide at the top, so it’s a good space-saving option."

      "title": "Prevent creases by folding your jeans over the top of the hanger.",
      "content": "Prevent creases by folding your jeans over the top of the hanger. Fold your jeans in half with the back pockets facing out. Slide one angled side of a clothes hanger between the pants legs so it rests along the crotch of the jeans. Fold one pants leg up and over the other angled side of the hanger, then repeat with the other leg. [6] X Research source This unconventional fold leaves the top half of your jeans hanging almost sideways, while the pants legs are pointing mostly downward. This can make it easier to quickly browse the labels on your jeans when you’re choosing a pair to wear. Because the weight of the jeans is held on the crotch seam and along the thighs, it helps prevent creasing further down the pants leg like you’d get with other folds."

      "title": "Regular or velvet hanger with a straight bar",
      "content": "Regular or velvet hanger with a straight bar This is what most people think of when they picture a clothes hanger —a triangle-shaped hanger with a straight bar on the bottom and a hook on the top. This is a great option for jeans because you can fold the legs over the straight bar, and the weight of the jeans will help keep them secure on the bar. Don’t use wire hangers from the dry cleaner for hanging jeans—the hanger will bend under the weight of the jeans, and the thin bar can leave a crease in the denim. [7] X Research source If your jeans tend to slide around on regular clothes hangers, velvet hangers add a little texture to help them stay in place. To save space and stop your jeans from sliding back and forth, try hanging your jeans on sturdy kid-sized hangers—they’re not as wide as regular hangers, so there won’t be as much space on the bar for the jeans to move."

      "title": "Clip or clamp pants hangers",
      "content": "Clip or clamp pants hangers For a more secure hold, choose pants hangers with either two clips or one big clamp for your jeans. You have a lot of options for how to use these—you can clip the hanger to the waistband or cuffs of your jeans, or you can fold them in half and clamp them at the knees. [8] X Research source Make sure the waist of your jeans is smoothed out straight so your jeans don’t wrinkle. [9] X Research source Pro tip: Place folded cardboard under the clips to avoid leaving indentations on your jeans. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Vertical hangers",
      "content": "Vertical hangers Vertical pants hangers have several bars stacked on top of each other, so you can hang multiple pairs of pants on the same hanger. This is a great option for saving space—just make sure you pick a sturdy hanger since jeans are heavier than other types of pants. For these hangers, it’s best to use a basic half fold."

      "title": "S hooks or pegs",
      "content": "S hooks or pegs You don’t necessarily have to keep your jeans in the closet. If you want to hang your jeans without hangers, loop S-hooks on a bar or rod, install a peg rack , or use over-the-door hooks . Then, just slide the waistband or belt loop of your jeans over the end of a hook or peg. This is a great option if you like to re-wear jeans—hang them up to air out overnight, then put them on again the next day."

      "content": "Hang jeans by the cuffs to remove wrinkles while they dry. If you have a clothesline or a drying rack, use clothes pins to hang your jeans upside-down. Or hang them upside-down from a clip hanger and hang them so they aren’t touching other clothes. The weight of the waistband will pull down the legs of your jeans, helping get rid of wrinkles. [11] X Research source If you live in a humid area, pull the pockets of the jeans out before you hang them so they’ll dry more quickly. If you need to save space, fold the jeans in half lengthwise before you hang them—but keep in mind they will dry faster if you hang them unfolded. [12] X Research source Lay vintage jeans flat to dry to avoid damaging them—especially if they’re already distressed."

      "content": "Wash your jeans inside-out in cold water, and only when they really need it. To extend the life of your jeans, don’t wash them every time you wear them. In fact, some jeans collectors only wash their jeans every few months. When it is time for a wash, turn them inside-out and wash them in a washer or by hand, using cold water and mild detergent . [13] X Research source You’ll know it’s time to wash your jeans when they develop a funky odor, lose their shape, or are visibly dirty. Some people believe that putting your jeans in the freezer will help kill the bacteria that causes odors, but home freezers don’t actually get cold enough to kill bacteria—it’s best just to wash your jeans when they smell bad.

Instead, dry your jeans by hanging them up on a clothesline or air drying rack , or spread them out flat to dry. This will help them hold their shape and last longer. [15] X Research source"

This will help prevent them from developing a musty odor like they’ll get if you just toss them onto the floor. [16] X Research source If you can, let them air out near an open window—the fresh air will help dispel odors."
