      "content": "Determine why you are compiling a personal data sheet. Are you sight-impaired and intending to provide useful information for a scribe? Are you compiling a medical history for yourself or your child? Do you plan to use your personal data sheet as a foundation for job applications?

      "title": "Understand how a personal data sheet differs from a resume.",
      "content": "Understand how a personal data sheet differs from a resume. Job resumes are targeted toward a specific position opening. While you may use the same basic format for each job to which you apply, you'll adapt the objective, and possibly some of the supporting information, to the specific characteristics of each position. A personal data sheet, on the other hand, is a compendium of information about you. This document is not generated to \"sell\" your qualifications to a specific audience, but rather to provide complete, accurate, and clearly presented information about you and your life experiences. Note that while you may target your information to a broad type of audience -- medical professionals, potential volunteer opportunities, etc. -- the same personal data sheet should serve to introduce you to any audience of the targeted type. If you opt to include your personal data sheet with a job application you should always provide a resume, as well."

    {
      "title": "Begin with your name and contact information.",
      "content": "Begin with your name and contact information. Any personal data sheet should contain your full name at the top of the first page. If your personal data sheet is more than one page in length, include your last name in the header on subsequent pages. Add your current or local address, as well as a permanent address if it is different. Include all of your phone numbers, including home, work, and cell. Provide an email address, as well."

      "title": "Provide emergency contact information.",
      "content": "Provide emergency contact information. List the name, address, and phone numbers of at least one person who should be reached in case of an emergency. Be sure to keep this information accurate and updated at all times. This information may also be used if you cannot be reached for some reason."

      "title": "Support your identity with a driver's license number or social security number.",
      "content": "Support your identity with a driver's license number or social security number. People are often hesitant to give out sensitive and private information such as a social security number. However, the purpose of a personal data sheet is to gather all of your information into one place, and this information is commonly requested on job applications and other forms. Include the state in which your license is registered. If you do not have a driver's license, contact your local department of motor vehicles about obtaining a personal identification card. This card is an official form of identification just like a license, but does not grant driving privileges."

    {
      "title": "List your education and experience.",
      "content": "List your education and experience. Include complete information about your schooling and where you currently work or have worked in the past. List the names of past work supervisors. If you are still in school or recently graduated, put your education first. If you have been out of school for a while and you have a lot of work experience, list that information ahead of your educational credentials. List your most recent job first, then work backward through time. The same principle applies to listing your education -- start with the highest level of education you have completed and work backward. When in doubt, err on the side of extra information. Not all job applications, for example, may require a complete work history, but if you go ahead and provide one you'll be prepared for whatever you encounter if you or a scribe is making use of your personal data sheet to fill out forms."

      "title": "Provide references.",
      "content": "Provide references. Include at least three references from various jobs and schools. List the reference's name, contact information, position title, and the number of years you have known the person. (Always ask potential references if they are willing to serve in this capacity before you list them on your personal data sheet!)"

      "content": "Include data specific to the type of personal data sheet you're writing. If you plan to use this sheet for medical purposes, for example, provide information regarding your medical history -- immunizations, past procedures, and a list of current medications."

      "title": "Proofread carefully.",
      "content": "Proofread carefully. One of a personal data sheet's chief advantages is that it provides a compendium of useful, accurate information that you or a scribe can employ to fill out other forms. Ensure names are correctly spelled and all details are correct."
