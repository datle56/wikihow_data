  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Start with an empty dispenser.",
      "content": "Start with an empty dispenser. Double-check to make sure that there are no spent rolls or remnants of tape inside the chamber of the dispenser. These obstacles can prevent a new roll of tape from unwinding smoothly. The plastic at the center of most office tape is white, which makes it easier to spot inside black and colored dispensers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the tape core.",
      "content": "Remove the tape core. The tape core is the small cylinder in the middle of the dispenser that allows the roll to rotate freely as it’s pulled. Most standard desktop dispensers have a button or latch you can press to disengage the core. Others simply slide out from one side. [1] X Research source Removable cores will be the easiest to load, as you can simply slide the core through the new tape roll and replace it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a new roll of tape onto the core.",
      "content": "Place a new roll of tape onto the core. Make sure the loose end of the tape is on the top of the roll with the sticky side down. Otherwise, the tape will be facing the wrong way and you’ll have to start over. Guide the roll onto the core so that it sits right in the middle. Tape comes in many different styles and widths. Be sure to buy tape in a size that fits your dispenser."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the core back into the dispenser.",
      "content": "Insert the core back into the dispenser. On a dispenser where the core is removable, lower the loaded core into the chamber until it clicks into place. For dispensers with one-piece sliding cores, push the core from the end through slot on the opposite side. [2] X Research source If the core isn’t reinserted into the chamber all the way, it won’t be able to turn."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull out the loose end of the tape.",
      "content": "Pull out the loose end of the tape. Begin unwinding the tape a few inches to get the roll started and test the dispenser. Take note of how fluidly the roll moves. If it’s getting jammed or you’re struggling to budge it, you may have loaded the dispenser incorrectly. Avoid touching the underside of the tape too much. This can cause the adhesive to wear off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape the tape over the blade.",
      "content": "Drape the tape over the blade. Keep stretching the end of the tape until it hangs over the teeth-like blades at the end of the dispenser. Pull down sharply on the piece you’re holding to remove the excess. The tape will now be in the right position to grab and shear quickly.

      "title": "Set the tape gun on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Set the tape gun on a flat surface. Lay the gun on its side with the open wheel compartment pointed upwards. It will be easier to load if it’s not moving around constantly in your other hand. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide a fresh roll of tape onto the tape wheel.",
      "content": "Slide a fresh roll of tape onto the tape wheel. Press the roll onto the spokes of the wheel (or the round roller, if it’s a single-piece design) until it comes to a stop. Be sure to load the tape with the loose end on top so that the sticky side is facing down. [5] X Research source When properly loaded, the wheel should hold the roll firmly in place, which will prevent it from wobbling while you’re using it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Line the tape up with the roller.",
      "content": "Line the tape up with the roller. Rotate the tape roll until the loose end is hanging just under the roller at the front of the gun. You’ll need to thread the tape through this small opening to finish setting up the dispenser. As you pull back on the gun, the tape wheel will turn and feed the tape into the front roller, causing it to unwind as it sticks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Guide the tape up and over the roller.",
      "content": "Guide the tape up and over the roller. Take hold of the tab at the end of the roll. Pull it down first, then out the front of the gun and up. The tape should rest flat against the roller with no folds or wrinkles. Keep your hands clear of the blade while pulling the tape through. Some tape guns have a small lever near the handle that helps hold the tape in place. You may need to hold this lever down with your free hand until you’ve successfully loaded the dispenser. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off the excess tape.",
      "content": "Cut off the excess tape. Continue stretching the tape until it’s level with the blade. Press the tape against the blade and rotate the gun downwards to remove the section of tape you’re holding. The dispenser will then be ready to use. Be careful not to come into contact with the blade while shearing the tape. Test the dispenser on a disposable surface nearby, like a piece of scrap paper or unused cardboard box."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the tension knob.",
      "content": "Adjust the tension knob. The tension knob determines how easily the tape unwinds. If you want to tighten it, twisting it clockwise will add a little extra resistance. To loosen it, twist it counterclockwise and the wheel will rotate more quickly. Perform a couple of trial runs with the gun to get it calibrated just the way you want it. Not all handheld dispensers come equipped with adjustable tension knobs. You may have to make do with the standard settings on inexpensive models."
