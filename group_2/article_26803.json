      "title": "Add moleskin to your shoes.",
      "content": "Add moleskin to your shoes. Because of their design, some ballet flats will dig into the sides of your feet. Cut a piece of moleskin padding to fit the area of the shoe that gives you the most problems. Pull off the protective backing and stick the moleskin, sticky side down, directly to your shoe. This should give you some extra padding and make the shoe more comfortable. You can pick up moleskin padding from most drug stores."

      "title": "Use gel dots for serious rubbing.",
      "content": "Use gel dots for serious rubbing. If your flats rub against a specific area of your foot constantly, try adding a gel dot to the shoe. Take the protective backing off the back of the dot and stick it adhesive side down on the problematic area of your shoes. These give you a bit more cushion than other products, and should give your feet some relief. You can find gel dots at most drug stores."

      "title": "Use a wooden shoe stretcher for shoes that are too tight.",
      "content": "Use a wooden shoe stretcher for shoes that are too tight. If you run into the problem that you’re between sizes on ballet flats, get the smaller size. Then use a wooden shoe stretcher to stretch the shoe out a bit. It gives you a perfect fit and also prevents the shoe from rubbing on the sides of your feet."

    {
      "title": "Use slim fit insoles if your heels hurt.",
      "content": "Use slim fit insoles if your heels hurt. Most ballet flats don’t have a lot of support for your arch or heel. Slim fit insoles will give you some much-needed arch support without changing the way your shoes fit. Simply slip it inside your shoe and press down on the insole so the adhesive connects to the shoe. Slim fit insoles are available at most drug and medical supply stores."

      "content": "Wear your shoes at home to break them in. Before you throw on your brand new ballet flats and wear them all over town, break them in at home first. Wear them inside only for a few days so your feet can get used to them. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Take care of your skin to prevent calluses.",
      "content": "Take care of your skin to prevent calluses. You might think that have calluses on your feet will protect them against chafing in a ballet flat, but they can actually cause more harm to your feet. Make sure you moisturize your feet and use a pumice stone to remove any calluses. Soft, supple skin will feel better in ballet flats. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear no-show liner socks to protecting your feet.",
      "content": "Wear no-show liner socks to protecting your feet. These socks will give your foot some protection against the shoe, preventing blistering or rubbing. No-show liner socks will give you this protection without the sock showing over the edge of your ballet flat. [3] X Research source Socks that are a combination of cotton and acrylic are the best for these types of socks because cotton will absorb any moisture and the acrylic acts as a wicking material."

      "title": "Try a friction block stick if you don’t wear socks with your flats.",
      "content": "Try a friction block stick if you don’t wear socks with your flats. A friction block stick looks like a small tube of deodorant, but its designed to be applied directly to your foot. It reduces the amount of friction between your foot and your flat, reducing blisters if you don’t wear socks. You can find friction block sticks at most drug stores."

      "title": "Protect your feet against blisters by using blister pads.",
      "content": "Protect your feet against blisters by using blister pads. They’re designed to go directly onto your feet and act as a barrier between your foot and your shoe. If you’re wearing ballet flats, it’s best to wear the blister pads on your heels, where blisters are likely to form. [4] X Research source You can find blister pads in most drug stores."

      "title": "Make sure you’re wearing the correct size.",
      "content": "Make sure you’re wearing the correct size. Measure the bottom of your foot from the back of your heel to the end of your longest toe. If that length is 8.5 inches (21.5 cm), you’re a size 5. For every quarter of an inch (.63 cm) after 8.5 inches, add another half size. Your flat should be tight enough that it doesn’t flip when you walk, but loose enough that it’s not cutting in on the side. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose quality materials for your flats.",
      "content": "Choose quality materials for your flats. Leather, cotton, patent leather, and suede are all good quality materials that are also comfortable. Flats made from these materials will tend to stretch to match the shape of your feet and should be the most comfortable. [6] X Research source Avoid ballet flats made from any kind of plastic material – they tend to fall apart and be the least comfortable."

      "title": "Test the flexibility of the shoe.",
      "content": "Test the flexibility of the shoe. A good, comfortable ballet flat should only be bendable from the middle of the shoe to the toe. If you can bend the entire shoe, including the heel, they won’t have enough support for your feet. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the width of the sole.",
      "content": "Check the width of the sole. The sole of your ballet flat is where all of the support for your foot will come from. When you choose a ballet flat, take a look inside – the sole should be wide enough that your entire foot is supported. Otherwise, your foot will only have the support of the material of the sides of your shoe, which can lead to foot pain. [8] X Research source"
