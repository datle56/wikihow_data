      "title": "Start off with your tortilla.",
      "content": "Start off with your tortilla. If you really want to get authentic, you could make your own tortillas with Masa Harina (used in huaraches, a classic street food) and water. Although it sounds like an ordeal, the process is actually quite simple. Mix water and Masa together in ideal proportions, press out, and fry up quickly over a hot surface. Flour or corn tortillas — which to choose? Flour tortillas tend to have a softer, sweeter flavor. Yet the classic Mexican taco calls for homemade corn tortillas, where the meat takes center stage. [1] X Research source Then again, the only thing that matters is what tastes good to you. Experiment with both and choose for yourself. Crispy or soft taco? Again, the choice is up to you. It's easy to make a taco crispy by frying it in oil, but many authentic Mexican recipes call for soft tortillas. Adding two tortillas or just sticking with one? Many places in Mexico will serve two tortillas per taco. It's more filling, it helps keep the ingredients from breaking through a single tortilla, and it's an easy way to get rid of staler tortillas. If you're sticking to the more calorie-conscious meal, opt for only one tortilla."

      "content": "Assemble your meat. When it comes to tacos, this is definitely to most important decision. The meat will make or break your tacos (unless you're making vegetarian tacos, in which case it will do neither). Which is why this tutorial gives you plenty of options (see below) when it comes to which meat to use. There are several different kinds of kinds/preparations of meat you can use in your tacos: Carne asada (\"grilled meat,\" e.g. beef) Carnitas (literally \"little meats,\" e.g. pork) Al pastor (literally \"shepherd's style,\" e.g. pork) De pescado (literally \"of fish\") De camarones (literally \"of shrimp\") Other cuts like lengua (tongue), sesos (brains), cachete (cheeks), trompa (lips), etc."
