      "title": "Yes, Cupshe is a legitimate company and not a scam.",
      "content": "Yes, Cupshe is a legitimate company and not a scam. There are a lot of scam companies out there on the internet these days, but Cupshe isn’t one of them. It’s a real company that used to manufacture all sorts of women’s clothing, but these days they focus exclusively on women’s swimwear. There have been some complaints about the company for sure (more on that later), but the TLDR is that Cupshe is 100% legit. [1] X Research source Cupshe was founded in 2014 and if you look at reviews from back in their first few years, there are a lot of scam allegations. Cupshe had trouble with their logistics, orders would go missing, and things were not working well. All of those issues seem to have been largely solved now, though."

      "title": "Cupshe seems to be a solid brand but customer reviews are a mixed bag.",
      "content": "Cupshe seems to be a solid brand but customer reviews are a mixed bag. Cupshe, like Temu and Shein, is absolutely a fast-fashion company, which means they mass produce their swimsuits quickly using inexpensive materials. They aren't built to last. [2] X Research source Some customers are happy with the quality of their products, but some customers aren't. Because Cupshe's swimsuits are so cheap, some buyers are okay with lower quality. [3] X Research source Compared to other fast fashion brands, Cupshe does seem to do a better job of updating its designs and putting out trendy products. They rotate their products out pretty often."

    {
      "title": "Buyers seem to generally be happy with Cupshe’s products.",
      "content": "Buyers seem to generally be happy with Cupshe’s products. A bathing suit at a store like Nordstrom may run $80 or more, while Cupsh’s bathing suits generally cost $15-30. So the prices are really competitive, no question about that. In terms of the quality of their swimwear, most reviews seem to reflect a positive experience. [4] X Research source The biggest complaints from customers seem to revolve around customer service or size issues, not problems with the quality of the suits."

    {
      "title": "The bottoms seem true-to-size, but the tops do appear to run small.",
      "content": "The bottoms seem true-to-size, but the tops do appear to run small. It’s hard to get a really clear picture of their sizing discrepancies because there’s no hard data out there, but looking at reviews, it appears that most customers find their bikini bottoms run pretty close to true-to-size, but the tops (specifically the cup sizes) are a little small. [5] X Research source Their one-piece swimsuits seem to have the biggest ranges when it comes to sizing issues. Some buyers report them being too tight, while others say they run big."

      "title": "We’re not going to sugarcoat things—it’s not great.",
      "content": "We’re not going to sugarcoat things—it’s not great. The single biggest complaint most consumers seem to have is that it’s nearly impossible to get a hold of anyone helpful at Cupshe if you have issues. There’s no customer service number you can call, so getting a hold of a real person is kind of tough, and they’re known for not being all that helpful. [6] X Research source Visit Cupshe’s contact page and tap on the issue you’re having to see what kind of options are available for you. Cupshe does technically have a phone service, but you have to schedule a call via their contact page. They have to call you, so you sort of just have to be lucky and hope you’re by the phone whenever they call."

      "title": "Cupshe is based in China, but they ship from several international locations.",
      "content": "Cupshe is based in China, but they ship from several international locations. Part of what makes Cupshe’s suits so cheap is that they’re made in a country where the cost of goods and labor are much lower than in the US. Cupshe’s swimsuits are 100% inspired by California beach fashion, but many are shipped from China. The company does have several international fulfillment locations around the world, though, and orders are shipped from whichever warehouse is closest to the buyer's location. [7] X Research source How long does Cupshe take to ship? Users report a huge range here. On the earlier side, you can expect to have your swimsuit within 7-14 days of placing your order. Other buyers report waiting up to a month for their swimwear."

      "title": "Yes, and that’s actually where we recommend buying their swimwear.",
      "content": "Yes, and that’s actually where we recommend buying their swimwear. You will pay slightly more to buy a Cupshe swimsuit on Amazon , but you’re going to prevent a lot of headaches if the swimsuit doesn’t fit you and you want to return it. Cupshe does have a return policy, but getting through to someone on their site to get the info you need to actually file a return is kind of a mess. By buying on Amazon, you get to take advantage of their solid customer support and simple return process. How much more are Cupshe swimsuits on Amazon? It’s usually a $1-2 premium. For example, the Boho Shell Stitch bikini is $34.99 on Cupshe’s site and $35.99 on Amazon , so we’re not talking about a huge gap here."

      "title": "Cupshe’s reviews and reputation have increased recently.",
      "content": "Cupshe’s reviews and reputation have increased recently. If you pull up any older reviews from more than 2+ years ago, there tends to be a lot of negativity surrounding the brand. That hasn’t remained the case. Cupshe seems to have taken the feedback to heart and improved their overall business to keep customers happy."

      "title": "Cupshe typically delivers in under 9 days.",
      "content": "Cupshe typically delivers in under 9 days. Compared to a lot of other brands that are located in China, Cupshe is relatively fast. While shipping times will absolutely vary based on your location, it looks like Cuphshe’s products typically arrive in 6-9 days. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Cupshe has the same payment security as other online retailers.",
      "content": "Cupshe has the same payment security as other online retailers. Cupshe uses something called SSL (security socket layer) encryption for all of their transactions. This is the same security protocol used by Amazon, Apple, Walmart, and basically every other online retailer, so it’s as safe as safe can get. If you’re worried about the safety and security of your credit or debit card, you can use PayPal to check out!"

      "title": "Is Cupshe ethical?",
      "content": "Is Cupshe ethical? Not really, but it’s a lot better than the other fast-fashion brands when it comes to sustainability. If you’re buying anything online for pennies on the dollar, the odds are high that some kind of corner is getting cut. For Cupshe, that’s 100% the case—they’re paying Chinese workers low wages and generating a lot of textile waste in the process. That said, they’re better than basically every competitor. [9] X Research source Unlike a Shein or Temu, Cupshe does have biodegradable packaging and they do use recycled fabric. They also have sustainability initiatives, which is unique for a fast-fashion brand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Is Cupshe better than Shein?",
      "content": "Is Cupshe better than Shein? Yes, Cupshe’s quality is generally much better than what people report getting from Shein. Shein’s entire business model is designed around churning out as many cheap items as possible, so quality control isn’t particularly important to their strategy. Cupshe, on the other hand, has proven that they care deeply about the quality of their goods."

    {
      "title": "Is it safe to buy from Cupshe?",
      "content": "Is it safe to buy from Cupshe? Yes. Cupshe isn’t considered a uniquely dangerous or risky place to order from. That said, their customer service isn’t known for being particularly quick or responsive, so it may be “unsafe” in the sense that you might have a headache if your order goes missing, but that kind of thing is true of a lot of brands.
