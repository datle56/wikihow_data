Conversely, some foods — foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, \"junk food\" and soda — dull brain processes and make you foggy and sluggish.

Omega-3 fatty acids improve blood circulation, and boost the function of neurotransmitters, which help your brain process and think. Foods high in magnesium are important (such as chickpeas or garbanzo beans) because they help with message transmission in your brain. Scientists have linked a diet higher in blueberries with quicker learning, better thinking and better memory retention. Choline, which occurs in vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, has the potential to help with the growth of new brain cells, as well as boosting intelligence longer in older adults. Complex carbohydrates give your brain and body energy over a longer period of time. Try eating food like whole-wheat bread, brown rice, oatmeal, high-fiber cereal, lentils, and whole"

That means cell phones, computer, iPod, etc. Otherwise your brain will be over-stimulated as you're trying to sleep and you'll have greater difficulty in falling asleep and getting to the necessary stages of sleep.

As you get better at meditating, notice what is going on around you, feel the sun on your face, notice the sound of the birds and the cars outside, smell your roommate's pasta lunch. You can also do mindfulness activities — when you're having a shower, focus on the feel of the water, the smell of your shampoo, etc. This will help keep your mind attentive and help reinforce your mindfulness to the moment."
