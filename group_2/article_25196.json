If you want a shorter glove, cast on fewer stitches. If you want a longer glove, cast on more stitches. [1] X Research source Leave a long tail on your yarn. You'll be using it to stitch the glove together in the end. Use medium worsted weight yarn (size 4) and size 8 knitting needles. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Knit every row until the glove is wide enough to wrap around your palm or forearm. This will create a bumpy, purl pattern on both sides of you work. How many rows you knit depends on how wide your palm/forearm is. For most people, however, this will be about 48 rows. [3] X Research source Do not alternate between knitting and purling. You want to knit on every row. This will allow the glove to stretch both ways"
