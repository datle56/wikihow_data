If you don't have the app, you can download it for free from the Google Play Store. When you open it for the first time after using a different text messenger, you'll be prompted to set it as your default messenger. Everyone in the chat must have an Android with RCS enabled ."

      "content": "Phone ecosystems, like between Apple and Android, prevent smooth data transfer. When data is sent between an iPhone and Android, information is lost, like Apple's Tapbacks. These send as individual texts instead that encompasses what the original user sent. For example, if an iPhone user responds to a text with balloons, the Android will get a text message that says, \"Sent with Balloons.\" The Google Messages app got an update that shows these responses as emojis, so an iPhone user responding to a text with a balloon will be sent as a text message of a balloon emoji.
