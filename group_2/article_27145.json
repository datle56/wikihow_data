      "content": "Squeeze the glue into your jar. The size of your final eraser will be roughly determined by how much glue you add. Keep in mind that your glue will shrink slightly before it's ready. Be sure to add enough glue to make an eraser big enough to be usable. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the glue dry.",
      "content": "Let the glue dry. Leave the glue to set. This should take about 24 hours. Once it has congealed, it should look similar to dried wax. To double-check, touch the glue first. If it's still sticky, wait a while longer. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape the glue out of the jar. Once it's no longer sticky, simply pick the now semi-solid glue up with your fingers. Roll and knead the glob around in your hands for a while. It should now be ready for use. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. You'll need a solid rubber eraser and a several sticky notes (Â½ dozen 3\"x3\" notes produced an amount twice the size of a pencil eraser). Keep in mind that your final kneaded eraser will be about the same color as the eraser you start with. A multicolored eraser won't produce a smooth, uniform putty eraser. [5] X Research source The color of your sticky notes won't have any impact on the final eraser. However, since the sticky notes won't be usable after you're finished, consider using up a color you dislike."

      "title": "Try to \"erase\" or rub the glue off of the sticky note.",
      "content": "Try to \"erase\" or rub the glue off of the sticky note. Rub your eraser along the sticky part of each note. Use enough force to remove the glue from the paper but not so much that you tear the paper. When one sticky note runs out of glue, move on to a new one. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect your eraser shavings. After you've finished each sticky note, sweep the eraser shavings into one large pile. Keep rubbing your eraser against the sticky notes until you have enough shavings to make a new eraser. A pile containing about a tablespoon's worth of shavings is a good size to shoot for.

      "title": "Knead the shavings together.",
      "content": "Knead the shavings together. The thin shape of the rubber makes it more malleable, while being coated with glue from the sticky notes will make the small pieces much easier to stick together. Carefully scoop the pile of eraser shavings into your hand. Squeeze the shavings into a smaller clump. Roll the clump around in your hand. Continue working it until the clump becomes nice and smooth. When that happens, your eraser putty is finished. [8] X Research source"

This rubber eraser will make up the bulk of your final kneaded eraser, so pick one with a color you like. Softer rubber will make a better eraser putty. You will also need a \"hi-polymer\" vinyl eraser. It must be big enough that you can comfortably rub the first eraser against it. Only a small portion of this eraser will be in your final kneaded eraser, so its color doesn't matter as much as the rubber eraser's. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Sweep the shavings into a pile. The friction between the two erasers will create eraser shavings. These will mostly be made up of the softer rubber eraser, which will wear down much faster. However, you will also notice a crater begin to form in the center of your vinyl eraser. Periodically sweep away the shavings from this crater and into one big pile nearby. If you want a larger piece of eraser putty, you can always repeat this with multiple rubber erasers and combine the shavings together at the end. [11] X Research source"
