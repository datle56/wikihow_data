      "content": "Find a reputable source. Pet stores often get their animals from what are known as puppy mills. Puppy mills (also called puppy farms) treat their animals poorly and take advantage of their dogs, and their puppies are often unhealthy. Don’t support them! A great place to start is to ask your vet or local humane society for recommendations. Look for a breeder that: Allows you to visit and observe where they keep the dogs. Their kennels should be spacious and clean. Breeds only a few types of dogs and is knowledgeable about those breeds. Provides you with a written contract and health guarantee for your puppy. If a breeder does exhibit puppy mill type behaviour, report it to the authorities."

[4] X Research source Some breeders and animal shelters offer gift certificates. Alternatively, you can make a handmade IUO. You can include a stuffed animal puppy with your gift certificate or IOU. Consider bringing in a foster dog instead. Your recipient will be able to learn the responsibilities of animal adoption. If they fall in love with the dog, awesome job! If they don't fall in love with the pup, that's okay! Fostering is just a temporary home."
