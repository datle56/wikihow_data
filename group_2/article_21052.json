      "content": "“Gordita” is affectionate Spanish slang for a chubby girl. The word comes from the feminine adjective “gorda” (or \"fat\") with the suffix “-ita” (used to make the subject smaller or cuter). The word may be used pejoratively (that is, as an insult) or, much more commonly, as a term of endearment. [1] X Research source While something like “Ahhh, gordita, como estas?” (“Ahhh, fatty, how are you?”) might come across as insulting to an English speaker, to many Spanish speakers, this question is affectionate and illustrates the speaker’s concern for the subject’s well-being and health.

      "content": "\"Little gordita\" means \"little chubby one\" and is a romantic term of endearment. Though it literally means \"little chubby one\" in Spanish, it's a lot like calling someone \"honey\" or \"sweetheart\" in English. It's an especially popular pet name men give their girlfriends in many Spanish-speaking cultures. So, if a guy calls you \"little gordita,\" rest assured it's a good thing! \"Welcome home, little gordita! How was your day?\" \"I love you, my little gordita.\""

      "content": "As a term of endearment for a girl or woman you care about “Gordita” is an affectionate way to describe how cute you find your girlfriend if she’s little and chubby, or a term of endearment to call your daughter to show you care about her. However, since “fat” is sometimes considered to be an insult, be sure the person you're calling \"gordita\" knows your intentions are to show your affection and appreciation and that she’s OK with it. “¡Venga, gordita! No te pongas triste.” (“Come on, darling! Don't be sad.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "As a nickname for a cute baby, little girl, or animal “Gordita” isn’t just reserved for romantic terms of endearment—it’s also a sweet way to refer to a chubby baby or little girl, a cute, fat pet, or any other tiny, chubby, and cute thing or person. For instance, call a particularly chubby baby “gordita” to indicate how cute her little cheeks are, or call your kitten “gordita” to show how sweet you find her round face. “Diga hola a mi pequeña amiga gordita y peluda, Penélope.” (“Say hello to my little fat furry friend, Penelope.”) [4] X Research source"

      "content": "As an insult (less commonly) While “fat” is not nearly as taboo in Spanish language cultures as it is for English-speakers, some people may use “gordita” as an insult akin to “fatso” or “fatty.” The perfect way to respond? “No soy una gordita. Simplemente estoy rellenita de amor.” (That is, “I'm not a fatty. I'm just all full of love.”) [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The meaning of “Gordita” is typically affectionate from a loved one. If your boyfriend calls you “gordita,” for instance, it’s a term of endearment, especially if used in the context of how much he loves you or how pretty you are. For instance, he may call you “gordita bonita” (“chubby darling”). [6] X Research source Tip: While the term is often used affectionately, if you don’t wish to be called “gordita,” be direct about how the word makes you feel: “I don’t like it when you comment on my weight, even when it’s well-intentioned. Please don’t comment on my weight or body anymore.”"

      "content": "\"Gordita\" may sometimes be an insult, but this is less common. While English speakers may assume \"fatty\" is a rude comment, it's typically affectionate, but that doesn't mean it's never intended as an insult. \"Gordita\" may occasionally be used as a condescending way to suggest someone is eating too much or has gained too much weight. To get a sense of whether the person speaking is trying to insult you, consider your relationship with them and their character: are they the type of person to hurl insults? Is your relationship tumultuous, or built on respect? Tip: If you suspect someone is using \"gordita\" as an insult, consider dealing with it in the moment with gentle humor, like, \"You would know!\" or trying to let the comment roll off your back with, \"And darn proud of it!\" [7] X Research source Later, if it bothers you still or if the person continues to do it, consider taking them aside to let them know how their words make you feel, and set boundaries about its usage: \"I don't like it when you call me that, and if you keep doing it, I'll just have to spend less time with you.\""
