      "content": "Start early. Children should have their first orthodontic screening at age 7, to check for potential problems. It is best to start with braces as soon as the permanent teeth are in place, which may be as early as 10 or 11 in girls and as late as 13 or 14 in boys. The less mature the teeth, jaws, and facial muscles, the more rapidly treatment can be accomplished, meaning less time in braces."

      "content": "Consider aligner therapy (ALT) instead of conventional edgewise braces (CEB). Metal, edgewise braces involve bonding stainless steel metal to your teeth to apply precise forces that move them into place. Aligners are a clear, strong plastic material fabricated to fit each person’s mouth. Like conventional metal braces, they work by exerting pressure over time. Unlike metal braces, you will go through a series of aligners, wearing each one for three weeks. [6] X Research source Aligners are less obtrusive and studies show they reduce time in braces. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aligner braces are more expensive. Depending on your particular situation, they may reduce time in braces by only a small amount, or not at all, so consult your orthodontist before deciding which braces you will choose. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Unlike metal braces, aligners can be taken out, which is great for photo ops, etc. However, they must be worn at least 20 hours a day to be effective. If you are worried about your child wearing them enough, you may want to opt for metal braces. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider accelerated orthodontic treatment if you are an adult. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because adults have more developed teeth and jaws, teeth take longer to move. Low laser therapy and corticotomy, [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source as well as micro-osteoperforation [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source have all been shown to reduce treatment times in adults. Low laser therapy involves directing short bursts of low-frequency light at the jaw in order to increase the production of osteoclasts, cells that demineralize bony block in the jaw, thereby speeding tooth movement. It also reduces pain. [14] X Research source Corticotomy involves making small cuts to the bone around the tooth in order to greatly speed movement. It is often combined with alveolar grafting (grafting demineralized bone over the cuts) in a technique called Accelerated Osteogenic Orthodontics. It has been shown to reduce the time of treatment by up to one third. [15] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Micro osteoperforation is similar to corticotomy, accept that a tool is used to make much smaller perforations in the bone. This increases the production of osteoclasts, helping to demineralize hard bone and promote movement. [16] X Research source"
