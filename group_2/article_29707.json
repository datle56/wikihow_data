Choose a letter to represent the alleles. Write the dominant allele with any capital letter, and the recessive allele with the same letter in lowercase. It doesn't matter which letter you choose. [2] X Research source For example, consider the color of a bear’s fur. Call the dominant gene for black fur \"F\", and the recessive gene for yellow fur \"f\". If you don't know which gene is dominant, use different letters for the two alleles. If you’re working on a problem for an exam or assignment, use the letters used in the prompt."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source Sometimes, you'll already know exactly what this genotype is. Other times, you'll have to work it out from other information. \"Heterozygous\" means the genotype has two different alleles (Ff). \"Homozygous dominant\" means the genotype has two copies of the dominant allele (FF). \"Homozygous recessive\" means the genotype has two copies of the recessive allele (ff). Any parent that shows the recessive trait (has yellow fur) belongs to this category."

For example, imagine the female bear is heterozygous for fur color (Ff). Write an F to the left of the first row, and an f to the left of the second row."

Look at the allele letter to its left, and the allele letter above it. Write both these letters in the empty box. Repeat for the remaining three boxes. If you end up with both type of allele, it's customary to write the dominant allele first (for example, write Ff, not fF). [6] X Research source In our example, the top left box inherits F from the mother and f from the father, to make Ff. The top right box inherits an F from the mother and f from the father, to make Ff. The bottom left box inherits an f from both parents, to make ff. The bottom right box inherits an f from both parents, to make ff."

There are four different ways the parents' alleles can combine, and all four are equally likely. This means that the combination in each box has a 25% chance to occur. If more than one box has the same result, add up these 25% chances together to get the total chance. [7] X Research source In our example, we have two boxes with Ff (heterozygous). 25% + 25% = 50%, so each offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the Ff allele combination. The other two boxes are each ff (homozygous recessive). Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting ff genes."

      "content": "Describe the phenotype. Often, you're more interested in the offspring's actual traits, not just what their genes are. Their phenotype describes the actual observable trait that the genotype codes for (like having black fur or yellow fur). [8] X Research source Add up the chance of each square with one or more dominant alleles to get the chance that the offspring expresses the dominant trait. Add up the chance of each square with two recessive alleles to get the possibility that the offspring expresses the recessive trait. [9] X Research source In this example, there are two squares with at least one F, so each offspring has a 50% chance to have black fur. There are two squares with ff, so each offspring has a 50% chance to have yellow fur. Read the problem carefully for more information about the phenotype. Many genes are more complex than this example. For example, a flower species might be red when it has the RR alleles, white when it has rr, or pink when it has Rr. In cases like this, the dominant allele is then referred to as an incomplete dominant allele.

A capital R indicates the dominant allele (round) and a lowercase r represents the recessive allele (wrinkled). We’ll label the genotype for the color yellow with the letter Y. A capital Y indicates the dominant allele (yellow) and a lowercase y represents the recessive allele (green).

You know that the genotype for the white flower must be pp since the white color is recessive. However, the purple parent could have a genotype of PP or Pp and still appear purple (we can label it as P? in a Punnett square): [18] X Research source If we cross pp and P?, we end up with the following possible combinations: Pp, Pp, ?p, and ?p. This tells us that at least 50% of the offspring will be purple, but does not tell us the chance of white colored offspring. Without observing the offspring, a Punnett square alone is not enough to fill in unknown parent genotypes. Now, pretend that you’ve observed a white flower offspring. The offspring must have pp as its genotype, meaning it receives a p allele from both parents. The purple parent’s genotype must be Pp."

Someone with a serious genetic disorder, or a carrier of an allele for a genetic disorder, may want to know the possibility that they'll pass it on to their children."
