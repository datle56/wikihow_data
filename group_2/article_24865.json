      "content": "Create a center braid to contain hairs going along your part. This is a cute way to pull back your hair while creating a unique style. Gather the section of hair beginning at your forehead, right on top of your part. Begin braiding your hair going along your part and towards the back of your head, stopping at your crown. Pull hair into the braid as you move backwards and hold the braid together using a hair elastic. [1] X Research source Instead of just tying your hair back in an elastic, consider finishing the look by pulling the rest of your hair section into a bun towards the back of your head."

      "title": "Braid",
      "content": "Braid shorter hairs around your face into a headband look. Gather a section of hair closest to your face starting at your part. Braid your hair along your hairline and towards your ear so that the braid frames your face, gathering additional pieces of hair into the braid as you go. Keep braiding until you reach the end of the strand and secure it with a hair elastic or bobby pin. [2] X Research source Once you finish your braid, it’ll look like a headband holding your hair back. If you have a middle part, create thin braids on either side of your part going down the front of your face."

      "title": "Do a waterfall braid",
      "content": "Do a waterfall braid for an elegant style. A waterfall braid is very similar to a regular braid, but instead of braiding all three strands of hair consistently, you drop one strand as you go along. Start the waterfall braid by gathering a section of hair at your part closest to your face. The waterfall braid will wrap around your head—you can either create a short one that stops behind your ear or continue the braid all the way around to the other ear before securing it. [3] X Research source Tie the waterfall braid off with a hair elastic to keep it in place. As you braid your hair going along the side of your head, keep gathering new sections of hair and adding them to the braid."

Create a French braid on both sides of the part, pulling your hair tightly as you braid. Secure each braid with a hair elastic to finish off your French braid pigtails. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull your hair up into two space buns for a cute look. Separate the top half of your hair into two mini pigtails, positioning them on top of your head where you'd like them before securing them with hair elastics. Tease each pigtail with a comb to give it some volume and twist them around in circles on top of the hair elastic, creating mini buns. Hold the mini bun in place on your head as you secure it in place with additional hair elastics and bobby pins. [5] X Research source If one of your buns is sticking up more than the other, pin the hair down using a bobby pin to fix your look."

      "content": "Gather the top half of your hair to create a half bun. Brush out your hair and pull the top half back in your hands. Pull the entire strand of hair through the hair elastic once, and then twist the elastic. Pull your hair through the elastic again, but this time only pull it through halfway to create the bun. Leave the bottom half of your hair loose. [6] X Research source This is a great style for when you're on-the-go and need a quick fix."

      "content": "Create a pompadour on top of your head for a little pouf. Gather a section of hair starting at your hairline right on top of your head, creating a clump that's about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) wide. Twist this section once and use bobby pins to secure it on top of your head right at the twist, giving the pouf volume so it’s not flat against your scalp. [7] X Research source Twisting the section of hair on top of your head will help create the pouf. Smooth out the clump with your hands or a brush before twisting it so it doesn't have any bumps."

If you’re in a rush and want your hair out of your face, pull it back behind your ear or against your head and use a bobby pin to secure it in place. Slide the bobby pin into your hair starting at your hairline and positioning it horizontally across the section of hair to keep your look in place. [8] X Research source Add a barrette for a more decorative look if you’d like. Use as many bobby pins as you need to make sure the hair won’t come out and get in your eyes."

      "content": "Twist your hair before pinning it to hide any short hairs. This is a quick, elegant way to keep shorter hair out of your face. Take a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) section of your hair near the front of your face starting at your part and begin twisting it along your hairline. Keep twisting until you come to the end of the strand and use a bobby pin to secure it. Slide the bobby pin into your hair horizontally so it keeps the strand in place. [9] X Research source If you have a center part, twist both sections of hair on either side of the part instead of just one."

      "content": "Use a clip to hold your hair back from your face. Pick out a clip thick enough to hold back your hair type, like a bulkier clip for thicker hair or small clips for thin hair. Use the clip to hold larger sections of hair out of your face. For example, you might pull 2 inches (5.1 cm) strands of hair on either side of your part at the front of your face to the back of your head to hold them in place. [10] X Research source Pull a section of hair to the side of your face wherever you'd like it positioned on your head and use the clip to secure it. Make sure you have the teeth secured as close to the scalp as possible to prevent drooping and slipping. If needed, spray your hair and the clip with some dry shampoo spray to add a bit of “grip” and prevent the clip from slipping."

Pick out a headband that goes with your outfit to complete your look. [11] X Research source Plastic or metal headbands are good for keeping the short hairs out of your face, while a cloth or elastic headband is great for covering up sections of your hair."
