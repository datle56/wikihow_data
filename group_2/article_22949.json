      "title": "Identify the burrowing animals in your region.",
      "content": "Identify the burrowing animals in your region. Start your search broadly and narrow it down by first considering which burrowing animals are present in your area. You can eliminate any animals only found in regions outside your own. Search the internet for “Burrowing animals in [your region]” or call your local agricultural commissioner or animal control center to research this. [1] X Research source Though many common burrowing animals are present all over (and as such, might be hard to narrow down by location alone), a little research can still go a long way when deciding between two potential culprits."

      "title": "Measure the diameter of the hole.",
      "content": "Measure the diameter of the hole. Different animals make different sized holes, and the size of the hole will give you a good idea about what size animal you’re dealing with. [2] X Research source Use a tape measure to measure from one edge of the hole to the opposite edge, and wear sturdy garden gloves in case the animal is still present. For example, if you find the hole is very small, say about the width of your finger, you can rule out larger mammals like groundhogs or raccoons, which wouldn’t fit inside. In general, smaller animals (like squirrels) burrow in holes 3 in (7.6 cm) and smaller, whereas medium animals will be around 3–12 in (7.6–30.5 cm)."

      "title": "Examine the mound or soil deposits.",
      "content": "Examine the mound or soil deposits. Another great indicator is the dirt around the hole, or more specifically the structure, pattern, or placement of the dirt. Different animals tend to have different methods when it comes to disposing of excess soil. [3] X Research source Search for piled dirt in unusual places, like on flat areas, or trails of flattened foliage that might lead to a hole. Mounds come in many shapes. Some resemble small volcanoes with holes in the center, others are u-shaped, and still others are shaped like small chimneys or towers."

      "title": "Consider the location and surroundings of the hole.",
      "content": "Consider the location and surroundings of the hole. Just like humans, animals all have their own preferences about where to build their homes. Some like to build near water, while others like to cozy up to man-made structures for extra protection against the elements. Consider where the hole was dug to further narrow down your suspects. [4] X Research source For example, if a hole is on the side of a riverbank, you’re likely dealing with a semi-aquatic animal like a crayfish."

      "content": "Contact animal control or your local extension office for an expert opinion. There are a great many professional resources available, and if you're stuck or unsure, seeking professional help is often the best course of action. Plus, they can give you expert advice on wild animal removal if that's your ultimate goal. Ring your local animal control, or look up the extension office of your local university to ask for help.

      "content": "Groundhogs, gophers, and prairie dogs. While these 3 are, in fact, distinct animals , their burrows are largely the same. All of them build extensive networks which can host thousands of animals, so look for devastated local plant life and large swathes of dirt. [6] X Research source Geography: All of the United States and Canada. Hole size: 8–12 in (20–30 cm). Gopher holes are often bean-shaped. Soil: Mounds of dirt and rocks around the hole. Location: Meadows and prairies. Groundhogs also dig near gardens or barns."

Look for fresh sod that's stripped or rolled away, as that means you might have a skunk or raccoon on your hands.

If you think you might be dealing with a vole, look for burrows with multiple entrances and “runways,” or partially dug paths that they take to get from their burrow to their favorite food sources. Vole burrows are often accompanied by telltale gnaw marks on nearby trees or other foliage. Geography: North America, Mexico, British Isles, Asia Hole size: 1 in (2.5 cm) Soil: No mound, but there may be narrow, recessed pathways leading to the hole. Location: Beneath shrubs or in gardens"
