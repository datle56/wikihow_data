      "content": "A girl won’t waste time ghosting you when she wants to get serious. Pay attention to how long it takes her to get back to your messages. While you shouldn’t expect her to text or call you right away, she’ll at least respond as soon as she can. Someone who’s serious about you won’t want to keep you guessing because they’ll be excited to keep talking with you. [1] X Research source If she doesn’t respond for days at a time or doesn't seem invested in the conversation, then she might want to keep it casual."

      "title": "Even if you mention something small in passing, she’ll pay attention.",
      "content": "Even if you mention something small in passing, she’ll pay attention. See if she’s giving you her full attention without any distractions as you’re talking to her . If she’s listening closely, she’ll remember the things that are important to you and keep them in mind for the future. Notice when she brings up the topic again or surprises you with something you talked about in passing since it means she’s attentive and cares about the things that matter to you. [2] X Research source For example, if you mention that you love ice cream but you’re lactose intolerant, she may surprise you with a dairy-free version of your favorite flavor. As another example, if you tell her that your mom is having surgery, she’ll ask about how she’s recovering. Some people don’t have as good of memory, so don’t get discouraged if they don’t remember every little thing you’ve brought up."

      "content": "She’ll want to learn more about you and your beliefs if she’s interested . Rather than bringing up casual topics like the news or work, listen to see if she asks about your past or family. She might also try to find out more about your goals and what you want out of the future. If you hear her mention things about marriage or kids, it could even be a sign she’s looking to settle down. [3] X Research source If she’s really invested in you, she’ll initiate conversations frequently. Make sure you also talk about deep topics too so it doesn’t feel one-sided. You should feel comfortable expressing your personal views and beliefs around her. She doesn’t have to agree with everything the same way you do, but she should be open to your perspective.

      "content": "Cuddling and hand-holding helps build your bond even stronger. Notice when she scoots closer to you, cuddles with you, reaches for your hand, or hugs you. Even if it’s not sexual, a girl who’s interested in you wants you to show that they care, so they’ll feel more comfortable with public displays of affection. [9] X Research source Some people have different boundaries than others, so they might not feel as comfortable being touchy-feely in public.

      "title": "“We” shows that she’s invested in your future together.",
      "content": "“We” shows that she’s invested in your future together. During casual conversation, see if she refers to herself individually or to you as a couple. [10] X Research source When she uses terms like “we” or “us,” it shows that she thinks about the two of you together and doesn’t feel as anxious or avoidant of the relationship. However, if she refers to herself as “I” or “me,” it might mean she’s not ready to commit. [11] X Research source For example, when she’s talking to her friends about your relationship, she may say, “We had such a fun time this weekend,” rather than, “I had a lot of fun this weekend with him.”"

      "content": "If she’s actively finding ways to get together, it’s a sign she’s serious. Rather than coming up with things last minute, she’ll ask what you want to do together in advance. She may try finding out when you’re free so she’s able to work around your schedule and come with a few things to do. While you don’t have to spend every night together, it’s a good indicator if she’s searching for ways to see you more often. [12] X Research source For example, if you say you have to go grocery shopping, she might ask if she can come with you so you can buy ingredients and cook a meal together. She may also turn down going out with friends to spend more time with you if she’s invested in your relationship."

      "content": "She’ll ask for your opinions and input even for small choices. It may be something as small as what outfit she should wear or as big as a career change, but check if she asks about your thoughts. That means she values your opinion and how the decision affects you as a couple. While she can still make decisions on her own, she cares and wants you to feel heard in the relationship.

      "content": "If she knows she’ll be visiting you a lot, she may keep some things there. Listen to see if she asks about keeping some clothes, a toothbrush, or shower products at your place. Since she’s leaving things with you, she expects to visit frequently enough to use them and is invested in the relationship. [15] X Research source If you want to test the waters, try getting her a toothbrush or something small to keep at your place. Even something small can be a huge gesture and let her know you’re serious about the relationship too."

It might be tougher to meet her friends and family if they live out of town, but she may offer to call or video-chat with them.
