      "content": "Buy ceramic tiles at a hardware or floor store. Pay attention to things like color and texture. You could also go dumpster diving to find old tiles. You may want to purchase a tile cutter if you are looking for a dramatic, organized mosaic with square pieces. You should also buy some tile adhesive and cement. If your mosaic will be used where it may be subjected to freezing temperatures, the tiles should be porcelain that is frost resistant."

      "content": "Throw or drop the tiles. With your safety glasses and protective gloves on, throw your tiles at any hard object, or simply drop them.

      "content": "Lay the pieces on the surface you’re decorating. Arrange them in the design you want, then slide them into the wooden frame. They might scatter a little, but if you are careful, it shouldn’t be too bad. Slide the attempted escapees back into place, then individually glue each piece down with the tile adhesive."

      "title": "Pour the cement all over the tiles.",
      "content": "Pour the cement all over the tiles. Once the tiles have set, mix up the cement with water until it is of the consistency described on the cement bag (liquid but not runny). Spread the mixture over the tiles, then use a soft cloth to rub off the excess that covers the pieces. You now have a beautiful mosaic! [3] X Research source"
