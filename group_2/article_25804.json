      "content": "Purchase some comfortable workout clothes that don’t restrict your movements. Next, find some tap dancing shoes. These shoes can be bought online or at specialty dance supply stores. Choose a comfortable, well-fitting pair of shoes that have metal plates attached to the heel and ball of the foot. If you’re not ready to buy tap dancing shoes, you can wear flat-soled dress shoes instead. Choose shoes that don’t have a ridge on the bottom. [1] X Research source The metal plates on the bottom of tap shoes are called “taps.” More expensive tap shoes have taps that can create different tones."

      "title": "Find a tap dance class.",
      "content": "Find a tap dance class. Do an online search to find a tap dance studio in your area that meets your needs. For example, if you’re interested in performing or competing, find a studio that holds regular recitals or enters competitions. If you can’t find the information online, call the studio to ask questions about the tap dancing classes. For example: Ask if the teacher has a bachelors degree in dance or dance education. This may be important if you want to become a competitive tap dancer. Ask if the teacher performs or enters competitions. This will indicate whether or not the teacher is still an active dancer. Don't worry if the dance teacher teaches other styles as well as tap. They usually are qualified to teach more styles as it makes it easier to get jobs when you can teach multiple types of dance, as it limits the amount of staff members dance studios have to hire/find."

      "content": "Take an online class. If there are no tap dance studios in your area, you can take an online class instead. However, you won’t improve as quickly without one-on-instruction. Additionally, if you live in an apartment complex, make sure you practice during the day so that you don’t keep your neighbors up with tapping noises. Find free tap dancing lessons on Youtube. Pay a small fee for a series of taped lessons from a variety of websites. Pay an instructor to teach you one-on-one using webcams."

      "content": "Tap in rhythm with the music. First, bend your knees slightly. Extend one foot in front of you or to the side, keeping your leg straight. Lift your leg and tap the ball of your foot against the ground do to a “Toe Tap.” [2] X Research source Continue tapping in time with the music. This will help you learn to tap rhythmically and listen to the music you’re dancing to. Repeat this exercise with either foot until you feel comfortable tapping in time with the music. You can tap dance to whatever song you’d like. However, if you use your favorite song, you won’t get tired of hearing it when you repeat the exercise."

      "content": "Perform a “Ball Heel”. This is one of the most basic steps in tap dancing. First, stand with your feet together and your hands on your hips. Lift your right foot slightly. Keeping your heel raised, stomp down with the ball of your foot to create a clicking sound. Next, lower your heel sharply, keeping the ball of your foot pressed against the ground. [3] X Research source Repeat the movement with your left foot. Practice this movement until you can perform a Ball Heel with both feet."

      "content": "Complete a “Ball Change”. Stand with your feet together and your knees slightly bent. Next, raise yourself up so that you’re standing on the balls of your feet. Lift one foot, balancing all of your weight on the other. Step down sharply and shift your weight. Repeat this movement, rocking your weight back and forth between your feet. Only the plates on the balls of your feet should touch the ground. Keep your heels in the air. If you step forward or backwards while performing this move, you will do a “Step Ball Change.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a “Shuffle”. Stand on your left foot and bend your right leg behind you. Swing your right foot forward. As it passes your left leg, tap the ball of your foot against the ground. Swing it back, repeating the tapping motion. Finish the movement by stomping your foot back on the ground next to your resting foot. Repeat the motion with your other leg. [5] X Research source Don’t let your heel touch the floor while you swing your feet. Keep your knees slightly bent while shuffling. This will help you move your feet more quickly."

You can either move in place or slowly walk forward."

      "title": "Combine basic steps to create advanced moves.",
      "content": "Combine basic steps to create advanced moves. You can either learn an advanced move from your instructor or invent your own at home. Most complicated tap dancing moves are made up of a combination of shorter, simpler moves. [7] X Research source When learning the advanced move, break it down into a series of smaller, basic steps. Once you learn these steps, you will know the advanced dance move. Write down the sequence of basic steps on a notepad or piece of scrap paper. This will help you remember how to do the dance move. Practice transitioning between the smaller steps. If you transition smoothly enough, the basic steps will come together and look like one long complicated dance move."

      "title": "Dance slowly.",
      "content": "Dance slowly. While learning a difficult move, dance very slowly. Focus on mastering each step and learning the full routine. As you become more comfortable with the dance move, gradually speed up. If you have a solid understanding of the dance move, you will be able to perform it more quickly. This method is also important for learning basic dance moves. A good understanding of the basics will give you a solid foundation for the more difficult dance moves."

      "content": "Watch famous tap dancers. If you want to improve, watch talented tap dancers perform. This will give you an opportunity to learn their moves and adopt their styles. For example, watch famous tap dance groups perform if they come to your area. Alternatively, watch famous movies with great tap dancers or watch their routines on Youtube. Examples of famous tap dancers include: Bill “Bojangles” Robinson in “The Little Colonel” (1935) The Nicholas Brothers in “Stormy Weather” (1943) Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell in “Broadway Melody of 1940” (1940) [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice often.",
      "content": "Practice often. If you want to get good at something, you must practice. If you’re taking classes at a studio, see if they offer practice times. During these times, the studio will be open to any students who want to practice independently. If your studio doesn’t offer practice times, you may have to practice at home. If you live in an apartment complex, make sure to practice during the day. Otherwise, your tap dancing may keep your neighbors awake at night. To train your body to become a better dancer, you should do yoga or stretching exercises and make your body flexible. Make sure your body is strong. It is essential to keep the body fit and flexible to be a good dancer."
