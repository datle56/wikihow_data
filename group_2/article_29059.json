      "content": "Drill a 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) hole into the center of your bottle's cap. Start by removing all of the labels from your 17 ounce (502 mL) plastic bottle. Now, with the cap attached to the bottle, use an electric drill and 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) bit to drill a hole into the center. [1] X Research source Be sure the cap is tightly attached to the bottle prior to drilling the hole."

Position the powerhead against the glass and clamp the output tubing to the edge of the aquarium with a tube clip. Now, reopen the ball valve, plug in the power, and start cleaning your tank. [15] X Research source Focus your efforts on the bottom of the tank as opposed to the top surface of the water. Move the vacuum head in a grid-like pattern every 3 to 4 seconds. Unplug the power head and drain the remaining tubing when you're finished."

Afterward, use a wrench to grip each one and tighten them as much as possible. [16] X Research source Grip each connector perpendicular to the valve as you tighten them. It's important to note that the smaller the diameter of the hose, the gentler the flow. If you need a gentler siphon, use a smaller hose."

You can also use your mouth to pull back on the tube after filling it and hold the water in place. However, this isn't recommended for sanitary reasons."
