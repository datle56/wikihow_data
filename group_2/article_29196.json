When you're regenerating health, you will slowly regain health over time. Some potions combine these effects with the \"restore health\" effect, which can lead to the creation of very powerful health potions. Try different combinations, specifically with ingredients that can restore, fortify, and regenerate health, such as Ambrosia, Blue Mountain Flower, Heart of Order, Void Essence, and Wheat. [5] X Research source Many other ingredients have the effect of fortifying health and regenerating health. The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages has a wealth of knowledge on what ingredients fortify health and which regenerate health ."
