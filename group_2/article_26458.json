      "content": "Find your basal metabolic rate . Before you can cut calories to lose 3 lb (1.4 kg) per week, you’ll need to know how many calories you typically burn in a day. This is called your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and you can use this as your baseline for deciding how many calories to eat each day and how many calories you will need to burn from exercise. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can do the math to calculate your BMR, but it is quite complicated. You may find it easier to use an online calculator. There are many websites that have free calculators available. There are a few different formulas for calculating your basal metabolic rate and they’re all different. However, you’ll need to convert your height and weight into centimeters and kilograms. For example, to use the revised Harris-Benedict BMR equation as a man, you’d need to add 88.4 to 13.4 multiplied by your weight in kilograms, and then add this amount to 4.8 times your height in centimeters. Then, subtract 5.68 times your age from the total of these 2 sums. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

Once you know how many calories you burn in a day, subtract 1,500 from it to get your daily calorie goal. However, don’t go below 1,200 calories per day if you’re a woman or 1,500 per day if you’re a man. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if your basal metabolic rate is 2,756, then you could eat up to 1,256 calories per day and you’d be creating a 1,500 per day deficit. This should result in a weight loss of 3 lb (1.4 kg) per week. If your basal metabolic rate is 2,300, then your calorie limit would only be 800 per day. However, this is too low, and you’d be at risk of developing health problems by eating such a low calorie diet, such as heart problems and gallstones.
