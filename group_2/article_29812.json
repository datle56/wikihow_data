      "content": "Pack what you'll likely need. There's a lot of stuff you could put into your school survival kit, but it probably doesn't all need to be there. Only pick stuff that you're likely to need to use, and take out stuff that you end up never using. If you've never used a highlighter in your whole life, don't put one in your kit. Only you know yourself and what's best for you. Revisit your survival kit after a few weeks of school. If there's a stapler always available in the office for students to use, you probably don't need to have your own in your survival kit."

If you're a creative type, decorate your kit with stickers and markers to personalize it. Check out Pinterest for a lot of creative ideas about how to organize and decorate your kit. Alternatively, it might be fun to make your survival kit look like something else. Put it in an old First-Aid kit to make it look like one, or a Fishing tackle box. Nobody will know the difference."

      "content": "Change out some of the items regularly. If you keep food or other perishable items in your survival kit, make sure you go back into your kit and change them out to keep everything fresh. Check your kit before you leave for vacation, especially. You don't want to come back from Spring break to find a bunch of dried up or rotten stuff in your survival kit. Facial wipes and other types of pads can dry out, making them useless. Check on them regularly to make sure they're still fresh for when you need them. Make sure you keep your caps and lids all shut, to avoid spilling or drying out any of the hand sanitizer and lotion you have in your kit."

      "content": "Keep the kit in your locker or bag. After you get your survival kit decorated and organized, put it somewhere you'll be able to access it regularly and easily if you need it. Most school kits are best kept in your locker at school, but you can also keep smaller ones in your backpack or in your purse. If you'd rather, you could even keep a kit in your car, if you drive to school, or in your cubby box at school if you don't have a locker."
