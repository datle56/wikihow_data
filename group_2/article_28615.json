      "content": "Find a box. Get a nice big cardboard box. You may be able to ask for one at your local supermarket. It must be in good condition, and must be big enough to hold your cat. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the flaps from the box.",
      "content": "Remove the flaps from the box. Using a pair of scissors or a box-cutter, carefully remove the top “flaps” from the box. You may want to save these for future art projects. Leave the bottom “flaps” intact. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut an opening in the front.",
      "content": "Cut an opening in the front. You are going to create a U-shaped opening in the front of your box to act as a doorway for your cat. First, take a pencil and mark the location you plan to cut. Then, using your scissors or box-cutter, carefully cut this opening in your box. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Decorate the outside of the box.",
      "content": "Decorate the outside of the box. Using construction paper or fabric, and some craft glue, decorate the outside of your box. This will transform your cardboard box into an attractive cat bed. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Line the inside of the box.",
      "content": "Line the inside of the box. The final step is to create a soft area inside the box for your cat to rest upon. This may be a folded up towel, some quilt backing, stuffing, or a pillow the right size. Place your soft materials in the bottom of your box, and your cat bed is ready for use! [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Gather materials.",
      "content": "Gather materials. You are going to need an old suitcase with hard sides (look at a thrift store), four wooden legs (which can be found at a hardware store), strong glue, some art supplies, and a small pillow (that can fit inside the suitcase). [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Attach the legs.",
      "content": "Attach the legs. Turn your suitcase over so that the bottom is facing up. Then, apply some glue to bottom of each wooden leg, and affix each of them to the bottom of the suitcase (one near each corner.) Place some books or other heavy items on top of the legs, and allow the glue to dry (usually this takes about an hour). [7] X Research source Another option is to drill through the bottom of your suitcase and into the wooden legs. This is a good choice if your wooden legs came with screw holes, and if you are proficient with power tools."

      "title": "Place the pillow inside.",
      "content": "Place the pillow inside. Hopefully you have located a pillow that is roughly the same size as the inside of your suitcase. (You can look at thrift stores, home goods stores, or if you are feeling very adventurous, you can make your own .) Then simply place your pillow inside the suitcase. [8] X Research source Avoid pillows with tassels, sequins, or long strings that your cat may choke on."

Except for the sweater (which you can find at a thrift store), you can find all of these materials at a craft store. A good choice of material for the sweater is 100% wool, for warmth and comfort, but any material will do. If you have a sewing machine, you may want to use it, but it is not required.

You are going to sew both sides of your sweater together, across this line, using either your heavy-duty needle and yarn (or a sewing machine).

Line up the “body” with the plush loop you have created, with the body fabric on the bottom. Any fabric that extends out farther than your plush loop is excess. Remove this excess fabric with scissors. Then, using your heavy-duty needle and yarn, attach the bottom to the loop. [15] X Research source"
