      "content": "Download a hiragana chart to organize your study. There are many hiragana charts online that you can download for free. While the design details are different, all charts follow the same basic format, because everybody learns hiragana basically the same way. [1] X Research source There's a hiragana character for every sound made in Japanese, which means anything you can say in Japanese, you can write in hiragana! Some charts also include the stroke order to use when writing hiragana. If handwriting hiragana is something you want to learn, you might find one of these charts more beneficial."

      "content": "Pronounce the 5 hiragana vowels. The 5 characters that represent the hiragana vowels are either the top row or the first column of your hiragana chart, depending on how it's oriented. All the other blocks are characters that represent a consonant combined with each of those vowels, which makes the vowels a great place to start. Here are the sounds these hiragana represent: [2] X Research source „ÅÇ (a) is a mix between the A sound in ‚Äúfather‚Äù and ‚Äúcat‚Äù. „ÅÑ (i) is pronounced like the ee in the English word \"eel.\" „ÅÜ (u) is an \"oo\" sound, somewhat like the ou in the English word \"you.\" „Åà (e) is pronounced like the e in the English words \"exotic\" or \"egg.\" „Åä (o) is an \"oh\" sound, somewhat like the o in the English word \"or.\""

      "title": "Build on the vowels with consonant sounds.",
      "content": "Build on the vowels with consonant sounds. The other rows (or columns, depending on your chart's orientation) of the hiragana chart add a consonant sound to the vowel sounds you just learned, although there are a few exceptions to this basic pattern, as you'll see. You can do this however you want‚Äîsome people prefer to learn all the hiragana for one vowel sound first, then move on to the next, while others go consonant-by-consonant. Here's a rough breakdown of the rest of the chart and the sounds represented: [3] X Research source „Åã (ka), „Åç (ki), „Åè (ku), „Åë (ke), „Åì (ko) „Åï (sa), „Åó (shi), „Åô (su), „Åõ (se), „Åù (so) „Åü (ta), „Å° (chi), „Å§ (tsu), „Å¶ (te), „Å® (to) „Å™ (na), „Å´ (ni), „Å¨ (nu), „Å≠ (ne), „ÅÆ (no) „ÅØ (ha), „Å≤ (hi), „Åµ (fu), „Å∏ (he), „Åª (ho) „Åæ (ma), „Åø (mi), „ÇÄ (mu), „ÇÅ (me), „ÇÇ (mo) „ÇÑ (ya), „ÇÜ (yu), „Çà (yo) „Çâ (ra), „Çä (ri), „Çã (ru), „Çå (re), „Çç (ro) „Çè (wa), „Çí (o), „Çì (simply the \"n\" consonant sound without a vowel)"

      "title": "Practice your Japanese \"R\" sound.",
      "content": "Practice your Japanese \"R\" sound. If you're a native English speaker, the Japanese \"R\" is likely to give you the most difficulty. It's basically a combination of the English \"R,\" and \"L,\" sounds.. To get it right, try this exercise: [4] X Research source Say \"lah\" about a dozen times and pay attention to the position of your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Say \"dah\" about a dozen times, again paying attention to the position of your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Alternate between \"lah\" and \"dah\" and notice how the tip of your tongue moves back and forth between the same two positions. To pronounce the Japanese \"R,\" have the tip of your tongue hit the roof of your mouth directly in between the \"lah\" position and the \"dah\" position. Now all you have to do is practice until you've acquired the muscle memory of it."

      "content": "Add dakuten or handakuten to change the sound of a hiragana character. You're probably thinking that surely the hiragana you've learned don't actually cover all the sounds in Japanese. What about the \"P\" in \"Pokemon\" (or in \"Japan\")? That's where dakuten („Çõ) and handakuten („Çú ) come in to fill in all the blanks. Here's how they work: [5] X Research source \"H\" becomes \"B\": „Å∞ (ba), „Å≥ (bi), „Å∂ (bu), „Åπ (be), „Åº (bo) \"K\" becomes \"G\" (hard \"G\" as in the English word \"goat\"): „Åå (ga), „Åé (gi), „Åê (gu), „Åí (ge), „Åî (go) \"S\" becomes \"Z\" (with 1 exception): „Åñ (za), „Åò (ji), „Åö (zu), „Åú (ze), „Åû (zo) \"T\" becomes \"D\" (with 2 exceptions): „Å† (da), „Å¢ (ji), „Å• (zu), „Åß (de), „Å© (do) \"H\" becomes \"P\": „Å± (pa), „Å¥ (pi), „Å∑ (pu), „Å∫ (pe), „ÅΩ (po)"

There are many websites that claim they'll teach you hiragana quickly using mnemonics‚Äîand they absolutely will, as long as the mnemonics they use make sense to you. [6] X Research source But it's better to come up with your own mnemonics. Since that's what your brain sees in the character automatically, they'll be easier to remember than someone else's. [7] X Research source Here's an easy example: „ÅÆ looks like a \"No\" sign ( üö´ ) to many people. Conveniently enough, it also represents the sound \"no.\" But what if that's not what you see? To you, it might look like a fortune cookie‚Äîand if you don't like fortune cookies, you can just think \"no fortune cookies\" and you've got it! Here's another example: You might decide that „Åè looks like a mouth to you. Since „Åè represents the \"ku\" sound, your mnemonic could be a dove's beak saying \"coo, coo.\""

      "content": "Drill yourself with flash cards and spaced repetition. Standard hiragana flash cards have the character on one side and the sound it represents on the other. To use flash cards effectively, put the ones you're good at in a separate stack and review them less often than the ones you have trouble with. There are also some apps for your Android or iOS device that have the spaced repetition programmed in so all you have to worry about is learning. Here are a couple of popular options: [8] X Research source Anki has customizable flash cards available for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Install the Japanese Support add-on to make sure it works for you to learn hiragana. Memrise has apps for iOS and Android. Disable \"tap\" questions so you have to type in your answer rather than using multiple choice."

But there are also some great free apps that can help you with your hiragana and Japanese language study: Duolingo has a free Japanese course that includes exercises that will teach you hiragana. In addition to the desktop version, the app is also available for Android and iOS devices. Dr. Moku offers a free app for Android and iOS devices (with a paid option). The company also makes physical flash cards if that's more your thing. Hiragana Quest is a game created in partnership with Japanese language school Go! Go! Nihon that will teach you all 46 characters of hiragana and all 46 characters of katakana. It's available for Android and iOS devices."

If you learned to write English with handwriting paper that had double lines, you'll recognize the similarity.

      "content": "Combine hiragana to form Japanese words you already know. You likely already know a few Japanese words, such as oyasumi (sleep well) and say≈çnara (goodbye). Sound out the word into syllables, then find the hiragana that matches that syllable. You're writing in Japanese! Here are some examples to get you started: [10] X Research source „Åô„Åó is sushi . Don't you think „Åó looks like a fishhook? „Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ is kawaii . „Åï„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™„Çâ is say≈çnara „Åä„ÇÑ„Åô„Åø is o + ya + su + mi . oyasumi .

Many of these stories are available online to download for free. Here are some great sources to get you started: [11] X Research source Fuku Musume has about 500 traditional Japanese fairy tales available. Since Japanese children are typically familiar with these stories, reading them also gives you insight into Japanese culture. EhonNavi has hundreds of Japanese children's picture books available to download for free (along with paid content). Fanta Jikan has videos of Japanese stories and dialogue with Japanese subtitles so you can read along. Manga for children"

Just choose Japanese under the language option, then turn on subtitles. You could also try Crunchyroll, which has an ad-supported free option with access to most of the shows you'd get on the paid tier. [12] X Research source Start with shows for kids since they're likely to use the simplest language. A word of caution: depending on the speed of dialogue in the show, the subtitles sometimes move too fast for beginners to follow. They might also include quite a bit of kanji, which you don't know yet."

Place a hiragana keyboard skin over your keyboard at first, until you develop muscle memory for the locations of the characters. [13] X Research source If you're using a tablet or smartphone, the characters on the onscreen keyboard will automatically change when you change the keyboard's language. Search for forums and social media groups that use hiragana. The posts from others will help you practice reading, and you can check your understanding by typing replies in hiragana. Typing hiragana on your computer or device is also a great way to familiarize yourself with how hiragana looks in different fonts."

If Japanese children's books have any kanji, they typically also include furigana over the kanji characters."
