      "title": "Turn off the TV.",
      "content": "Turn off the TV. This is the first step to finding hobbies that enrich your imagination. Watching television programs is a form of passive engagement.

      "title": "Read creative literature and watch creative films.",
      "content": "Read creative literature and watch creative films. It is important to get out of your comfort zone for the forms of art you interact with. If you normally read detective thrillers, try reading a fantasy novel – and vice versa. The same applies to films. Look for experimental or independent films that challenge typical modes of presentation. Try to branch out not only in the content you interact with, but the way the content is presented."

Let music without lyrics arouse your creativity, and use it as a blank slate for your imagination to write on. Jazz, classical, blues, and electronic are mostly instrumental genres. Jazz and blues are also improvisational. There are many additional more obscure genres that you can explore that don't have lyrics, like dub and garage."

Write in whatever form you like – poetry doesn’t have to rhyme or have meters."

      "content": "Decorate your home. It is normal to decorate your home in a piecemeal fashion, accumulating random articles as needed. However, if you find your surroundings feeling stale or stagnant, you can take this opportunity to use your imagination. Buy simple or plain furniture, and see how it can fit together. Arrange your room in an intentional way that has functionality. This process naturally exercises your imagination and gets your brain working. [6] X Research source Don’t feel like everything has to be the typical definition of ‘tasteful.’ You can substitute everyday objects for furniture if you please. For example, instead of putting your jewelry in a shoe box or jewelry case, buy a cigar box. Or, build an outdoor table out of pallets. Get your house messy and clean it up. The act of reorganizing is a great way to use your imagination and get chores done at the same time. Like redecorating, it requires you to reconsider the functionality and feng shui of your home."

      "content": "Have stimulating conversations. Invite your friends over, but instead of watching TV, discuss something hypothetical.Exercises like this require you to use your imagination, and you can feed off that of your friends' ideas. Brainstorming ideas and answers to hypothetical questions can concern topics as serious as you like. If your friends are into discussing politics, ask how they think Americans would react to a declaration of war from Congress tomorrow.

Tasks like this force us to use our own creativity and imagination to add spice to life."
