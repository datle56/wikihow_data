Keep the corners matched up so your hat is nice and even. Run your finger along the fold to make a good crease in your paper. [1] X Research source A solid sheet of newspaper makes for a large pirate hat. If you'd like a smaller hat, try cutting off about 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 inch (0.6 cm) from one of the edges. [2] X Research source If you're working with kids, try telling them to fold \"hamburger\" style to make sure they get the fold right."

[3] X Research source You should have two triangles now, with the vertical edges lined up in the middle of the paper. For a good hat, try to keep the edges straight. Make good creases when you have everything lined up the way you want it. [4] X Research source Add some tape to the triangles if they start to unfold. [5] X Research source"

[21] X Research source Make a mark halfway down the side of each triangle. Draw a line to the opposite corner of each mark to make two smaller triangles. [22] X Research source Using the bowl as a guide, trace a circle in the center of the triangle. You should now have a circle with six small triangles in the center of the large triangle.

You should have three rounded triangles on your brim. [29] X Research source Wrap the rounded corners around a pencil and roll them up to the base of the hat. When you remove the pencil you should have a corner that stays slightly rolled. [30] X Research source You can even roll the tips of each corner if you like, to add even more character to your hat. To do this, use your pencil and roll the tips in the opposite direction. [31] X Research source At this point, you should start to see the pirate hat coming together."
