When we share space with another person, it can be difficult to accurately judge what they are likely to do because we are so overcome with the feelings about them that have accumulated over time. Take stock of previous violent incidences that have occurred between you and your roommate. What did the worst fights you ever had look like? Was physical harm ever involved? Has your roommate ever stolen from you before in retaliation? It can help to write down dangerous or violent incidences in detail. This way, you can accurately determine what of the following you may need to do: Get outside support, like police assistance and legal action, to oversee the eviction and move out. This will be useful if there is a real likelihood that your roommate will respond violently. Take legal action to ensure that you have as little direct confrontation with your roommate as possible. These options will be best if avoidance seems like the best way to avoid a dangerous situation. Attempt to talk to your roommate with civility about the need for them to leave. If the danger is that your roommate will act out of anger from not being spoken to directly, or they have not demonstrated much actual violence against you, try simply handling the situation on your own."

[1] X Research source If your roommate is subletting a room or part of the apartment from you or if you are a designated master tenant on your lease, you have the legal right to evict your roommate.

      "content": "Consult your lease about co-tenancy liability. If the lease is in both your name and your roommate's name (as co-tenants), you cannot evict your roommate. You will have to resort to other methods, like contacting your landlord to enlist their help in evicting your roommate, as you have no legal right to do so. If you're the primary lessee, and rent is your sole legal responsibility each month, your roommate has no legal right to live with you. This is unusual, but is sometimes the case between close friends or in last-minute living arrangements. If your roommate is not on the lease at all, kick them out according to your judgment of the danger you're in. In most cases, renters have a joint lease where all tenants are responsible for paying the rent. The key term you're looking for is joint and/or several liability. If you're jointly liable , that means you're responsible for paying the full rent regardless of whether or not your roommate pays. If you're severally liable , you're only responsible for your portion of your rent. If you're jointly and severally liable , this is better than being jointly liable because while you're still responsible for any unpaid rent, you do have legal cause to sue your roommate for unpaid amounts.

If they are on the lease, it is up to your landlord to move the eviction forward. If your roommate has no formal responsibilities for the property, you can handle the situation without talking to your landlord about it. Your landlord may need to file a criminal complaint for trespassing, although it may be easier for the landlord to just evict everyone in the rental unit, including you. Your landlord may or may not be willing to correct the eviction so that you can then move back in without the eviction showing on your record. [3] X Research source It can help to have a new tenant all lined up to move in so that your landlord knows that you will still be able to pay rent. If your landlord is unsympathetic, it may be best to simply break the lease and move out yourself. There are usually significant fees for breaking a lease, but if your roommate is dangerous and you want to avoid getting authorities involved, it could be a good option."

In lieu of a professional mediator (usually someone with a legal background), try asking a capable friend or family member to hold court. Do remember, though, that mediation is not an opportunity to prove guilt or blame. Instead, mediate to make sure that each person understands what the other is saying and can be held responsible for that knowledge. Try to decide in advance whether or not you will be open to any attempts that your roommate makes to convince you to let her stay at the place. Be firm about this decision. Highly manipulative people often feign agreeableness or make promises to change that they do not intend to keep."

Explain your reasoning, focusing as much as possible on yourself and your needs and provide specific examples of when and why living in your current situation proved unmanageable.

It will feel even longer if you are dealing with hostility and abusive behavior from your roommate in the interim.

Go to source : Show understanding of all of the (reasonable) things that your roommate requests in order to move out. For example, if they request to keep the toaster that the two of you purchased together, don't say no out of principle. Validate the request and then decide whether or not you can fulfill it. Choose your battles wisely and remember that the less you dispute, the less conflict you'll face. Negotiate possible ground rules, knowing that you must be willing to compromise if your roommate makes requests that are ultimately geared toward them leaving in a timely manner. Say what you are willing to do instead of what you aren't. So, if you want as little contact as possible going forward, tell your roommate that you're willing to talk only if it is absolutely necessary for logistical purposes. Don't simply demand that they not talk to you at all."

Even if you are not romantically involved with your roommate, legal counsel or help from a women's shelter can help you determine if your relationship falls under the category of domestic violence. In order to benefit from extended protection to victims of domestic violence, check with local law enforcement or a women's shelter regarding state laws applicable to your situation. Some laws that may apply include the following: [6] X Research source Anti-discrimination status and eviction protection. In many states, it is illegal to discriminate against someone who is a victim of domestic violence. So, a landlord cannot refuse to rent (or terminate) solely because the person is a victim of domestic violence. Early termination rights. Usually, a victim of domestic violence can end a lease with notice (often 30 days). States typically require that the tenant provide proof (such as a protective order) of her status as a domestic violence victim. Limits on rental clauses. In some states, landlords cannot include clauses that provide for termination, should a tenant call the police in the face of domestic violence, nor can landlords make tenants pay for the cost of such calls. Section 8 tenants. Domestic violence victims may circumvent regular relocation requirements if they have otherwise complied with other Section 8 requirements, have moved in order to protect someone who is or has been a domestic violence victim, and “reasonably believed” that they were imminently threatened by harm from further violence."

Use language that is professional and direct so that they do not sense that there is room for negotiation. It can be helpful to display your knowledge of your legal rights so that your roommate sees that you are not afraid to take legal action immediately, should cause arise to do so.

The safest option would be for you to stop staying at your shared place from the time that you deliver a letter of notice until your roommate moves out. Even if this much precaution is not possible, try to line up at least two different places where you can stay if you feel uncomfortable at home. Try asking trusted friends, family members, or co-workers. In the event that staying with others proves difficult, call local domestic abuse shelters and explain your situation."
