      "content": "Gather a slice of bread, a spray bottle, and a sealable plastic bag. As with any science experiment, it’s important to have all your materials handy first. Round up the following: a slice of bread (any kind), 1-3 sealable plastic bags, a spray bottle, and water. [1] X Research source Any type of bread works, but white bread will show mold the best. Fill the spray bottle with water. A spray bottle isn’t required, but it’s an easy way to evenly coat the bread in a fine mist of water. If you don’t have a plastic bag, use some other sealable clear container instead. Make sure it’s clear so you can watch the mold growth, and sealable to contain the mold. Note that store-bought bread often has preservatives that may make it take longer to grow mold."

      "content": "Give the bread 2-3 spritzes of water. Using the spray bottle, lightly mist the bread. You don’t want the bread to be soaked, you just want there to be some moisture to help with the growth of the mold. Just a couple of sprays are sufficient. Or: [2] X Research source Place a wet paper towel in the plastic bag with the bread. Sprinkle some water over the top of the piece of bread. Spraying the inside of the bag instead of directly on the bread."

      "title": "Seal the bread in the plastic bag.",
      "content": "Seal the bread in the plastic bag. Place your moistened piece of bread into the plastic bag and seal it closed. For the rest of the experiment, you’ll keep this bag sealed to avoid exposing yourself to the mold spores that will grow on the bread. [3] X Research source If you have allergies, you might not want to do this experiment as it may cause you difficulty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a control sample, if you like.",
      "content": "Make a control sample, if you like. A “control” sample is a basic sample that you haven’t sprayed with water, so you can compare what kind of different moisture makes when it comes to growing mold. Use a clean pair of tongs (so that you don’t introduce germs to the bread with your hands) into a new sandwich bag and seal it. [4] X Research source Then, label it with a sticky note that says, “Control,” so you know which bag is which. This isn’t required, but it’s a good idea if you’re growing mold as an experiment for class. If you like, also prepare other samples using our ideas below ."

      "title": "Store the bread in a warm area.",
      "content": "Store the bread in a warm area. Mold thrives in warm environments with moisture in the air. Find a warm place in your home and store the sealed bread here. You’ve already supplied sufficient moisture to the bread for growth. [5] X Research source Keep them out of the sun, though, since it could affect the mold growth. Mold is a heterotroph, so it does not need sunlight to create food. It gets food from the bread itself in the form of starch, which is broken down into smaller sugars. This is why mold often grows in dark, damp areas such as basements. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Check your mold growth each day, and take notes.",
      "content": "Check your mold growth each day, and take notes. Each day, take a look at your bread. It should take around 7-10 days before you will be able to see significant mold growth, but you might see growth as soon as 5 days depending on the type of bread you used. [7] X Research source Remember, fresh bread will mold faster than store-bought bread containing preservatives. [8] X Research source Track the progress by writing notes or taking pictures. When do you start to see mold? What size is the moldy spot? What color? Don’t remove the bread from the bag to examine it. Mold can cause allergic reactions or other side effects, so keep it sealed!"

      "content": "Throw the bagged bread in the garbage when you’re done. When you’re finished observing the growth of the mold, throw it out. Do not open the bag. [9] X Research source Opening the bag can release mold spores into your environment that are not good for your health. It’s also not safe to eat moldy bread under any circumstances. Wash your hands every time after you have handled the bag."

      "content": "Spray multiple slices with different amounts of water. Keep all other conditions the same (temperature and amount of light), but add different levels of moisture. [10] X Research source Have 1 slice with no moisture, 1 slice that is just damp, and 1 slice that is soaked in water. Check the samples daily to see if the growth of mold is different between the 3 pieces."

To test mold growth at different temperatures, store 1 sample in a warm place (like above the oven), and 1 at room temperature. [11] X Research source Then, place 1 in the refrigerator and 1 in the freezer. Remember, to minimize variability, you will want to use the same amount of water for each piece of bread and store the room temperature sample in the dark, as the samples in the fridge and the freezer will mostly be in the dark. Check each sample daily and see which piece of bread grows the most mold the fastest."

If you want to test whether or not light has an effect on the growth of mold, store samples in different light environments. Place 1 bag in total darkness and 1 bag in a brightly-lit area. [12] X Research source To minimize variability, make sure the temperatures of both environments are the same. Use the same amount of water for each piece of bread as well. If the amount of water and temperature is also different, you won’t know whether the difference in growth rate is due to the light, water, or the temperature. Observe your samples daily to check for differences in growth rate and amount."

      "content": "Use spit or other substances to grow mold. Mold often grows faster if there are more germs, or food, to eat up! Mix up your experiment by using your own spit instead of water. Or, simply wipe your hands on the bread before bagging it and see what happens. Just remember to use a control sample that you haven’t done anything to to compare it to! [13] X Research source Or, sprinkle the bread with lemon juice, sugar, or wipe a dirty object on it, like a TV remote."

      "title": "What is mold?",
      "content": "What is mold? Mold is a kind of fungus that grows from spores. You’ve probably seen it on old food in your fridge. Mold reproduces by releasing spores that, if the conditions are right, grow into mold cells. Molds are heterotrophs, meaning they eat other organisms for energy. When you see mold on your food, it’s eating that food before you get a chance to! [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Is mold a bad thing?",
      "content": "Is mold a bad thing? Mold is gross, but it’s also super helpful! Mold eats and breaks down organic materials like food or dead plants to create nutrients that other living things need to survive. We need mold to break down those dead things and to feed things like plants. That said, lots of mold is harmful to humans if we touch or eat it. [15] X Research source Some molds aren’t very dangerous, though. Many kinds of cheese are made by growing mold in the cheese on purpose, changing its flavor and other qualities.

      "title": "Why don’t some foods mold very easily?",
      "content": "Why don’t some foods mold very easily? Some foods have preservatives added to them to make them last longer. These preservatives often make it harder for mold to grow, so the food stays ready to eat for longer. Food that doesn’t have preservatives, like food you make at home, will often mold more easily. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Why does mold sometimes look different?",
      "content": "Why does mold sometimes look different? That’s usually because they’re different kinds of mold! You often see green-blue mold grow on bread or citrus fruits, while white mold grows on strawberries, and black mold grows in the shower. There are thousands of different kinds of mold, and different molds prefer different food sources and conditions. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Can you just cut off the moldy parts of the bread?",
      "content": "Can you just cut off the moldy parts of the bread? The answer is no. It may look like the mold is only on one part of the bread, but bread is soft and airy, making it easy for mold to spread inside. Even if you can’t see mold in other parts of the bread, there’s probably invisible mold spores you can’t see that are still harmful. It’s best to throw it out. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "How do you store bread so it doesn’t mold? For best results, store your bread in a paper bag, with the cut side facing the closed end of the bag. Then, store the bread in a bread box, which stabilizes things like light, heat, and humidity. If you don’t have a paper bag or bread box, store the bread in a sealed plastic bag on the counter, away from sunlight. [21] X Research source Keep your bread in a sealed plastic bag and place it in the freezer to keep it fresh for later. When you want to eat it, pop it in the often at 325 °F (163 °C) for 20 minutes to make it warm and soft again."

      "content": "Mold can grow on bread in 5-10 days. That said, there are a lot of variables! Some breads, like fresh-baked breads, mold more easily than others, since they lack preservatives. Other breads, like challah, are more moist, so they grow mold faster. It all depends on the kind of bread and the conditions in which you store it. [22] X Research source b To make bread last longer, store it in a cool, dry place, like a pantry, where mold has a harder time growing."
