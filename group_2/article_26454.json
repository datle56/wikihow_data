They can check to make sure you don't have systemic problems, like diabetes or arthritis, that may affect your weight loss goals.

This is especially important to help you create realistic goals and get the kind of professional support you need to make healthy, effective changes in your life."

      "content": "Keep a fitness journal. Consider including three sections in your journal: one for recording how you feel, one for what you eat each day, and one for daily activity. Start your journal by detailing the reasons that you want to lose weight. You can return to this page to refresh your motivation during the weight loss process. [2] X Research source For food entries, try to include each item that you consume, the quantity of each item, and any health stats that you are aware of (calories, grams of fat, carbohydrates, or others). For activity entries, include the type of activity, the duration, and the intensity. For example, if you walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes, write that down along with how fast you were going – either the intensity number on the machine, or a more descriptive term like “medium intensity” if you broke a sweat."

That can help you come up with a plan of action for how to move forward more intentionally. [4] X Expert Source Tara Coleman Clinical Nutritionist Expert Interview. 22 October 2020."

This goal can be met through dieting and exercise.

For the other half, include one serving of broccoli and one serving of carrots. Try to avoid things that have refined carbohydrates and sugars. Instead, replace them with produce and whole grains. If possible, remove most processed foods from your diet. These are usually filled with hidden sugar, fat, and calories. Studies show cooking fresh meals can help with weight loss. While eating healthier overall is a great goal, avoid overly restrictive diet plans. Those aren't great for your body in the long-term, and they're really hard to sustain.

Timing your meals so that your blood sugar doesn't drop significantly – such as morning meals, a morning snack, and a post-workout meal or snack – can help you stick to your calorie restriction. Try eating smaller portions at more frequent intervals throughout the day. [10] X Research source In between meals, try snacking on an apple with a handful of almonds, a half cup of cottage cheese with sliced fruit or vegetables, celery sticks with peanut butter, or carrot sticks with hummus.

You should always discuss exercise changes with your doctor, but this is especially important if you haven't been very active in the past. Increasing your exercise levels too fast can lead to injury or medical complications. Not only is this dangerous, but it will also delay the results you want. Tell your doctor that you plan to workout 5 to 6 days a week, including both cardio and resistance training."

[13] X Expert Source Kristi Major ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 28 October 2019. For increased weight loss, do 45 minutes to 1 hour of cardio 5 times per week. Good cardio exercises include walking, running , swimming, cycling, rowing , and jumping rope . [14] X Research source Start with something low-impact (like walking or swimming), then work your way up to more high-intensity cardio activities (like running or rowing). Allow your body time to adapt to a cardio fitness plan. Workout every other day for the first 1 to 2 weeks, if you were previously inactive. Add extra time and days to your plan until you reach a 6 day fitness goal. Use interval training methods. Work out at a moderate intensity and do bursts of high-intensity or resistance movement. You will burn more fat in the same period of time if you do intervals. Remember that calorie burns through exercise should be coupled with calorie deficits in your diet to see the results you want."

      "content": "Do strength training for 30 minutes 2 days a week. Use free weights , weight machines, resistance bands or a combination to kick start your metabolism and lose extra weight. Strengthening your muscles will help you lose fat from a wider variety of muscles. Remember that muscle weighs more than fat. So, strength training will help you get leaner and lose fat even if the scale doesn’t show much weight loss. Continue doing strength training for 2 days a week for the first 2 to 4 weeks. Once your body gets used to the workout, you can increase to 3 days per week. This usually takes about a month."

Failure to drink water, stretch, and give your body a rest can result in injury and it will be more difficult to lose weight with good nutrition alone. Take 5-10 minutes before each workout session to warm up your body. For your warm up, try dynamic stretches (those that involve performing controlled movements that gradually increase your range-of-motion). Dynamic stretches are best for warming up because they get the blood flowing throughout your body.

      "content": "Switch up your workouts. Once you get to the second month, try some new workouts. Using different muscles for strength training and cardio exercise will increase your metabolism and help you lose weight. As you grow accustomed to certain cardio exercises, consider alternating machines/activities. For example, spend one day on the elliptical machine, then go for a swim the next day. During strength training, make sure that each muscle group has time to recover before your next session. Muscle confusion, or targeting different muscle groups once your body grows accustomed to a specific workout routine, can help increase your weight loss."

Every couple of weeks, you should weigh yourself, measure your hips and waist, and take note of the increases in repetitions and weights you’re making. Analyzing these milestones will help you maintain the right direction for your weight loss goals and make sure that you aren’t pushing yourself too hard. Set clear goals for yourself – like losing 2.5 lb (1.1 kg) per week. Check in with yourself each week to see if you are meeting your goals.

Sit on the ground with your legs spread apart out in front of you and lean your arms toward one foot to stretch out your arms and back. Hold the stretch for a few moments, then lean back out toward the other foot."
