      "content": "Start with transliterations before learning script. Especially if your focus is conversation rather than reading and writing, you'll learn a lot more quickly if you use transliterated text rather than trying to learn Bengali script and speak at the same time. [3] X Research source With transliteration, you'll be able to learn new words and communicate in the language more quickly. Then, as you transition to Bengali script, you can start writing words immediately."

You may not know the definition, but you'll know how to pronounce it. [4] X Research source There is also a transliteration schema available on the Virtual Bangladesh website with comparisons of the sounds to English words.

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with Bengali script.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with Bengali script. Bengali is traditionally written in a cursive script. The alphabet has 12 vowels and 52 consonants. Bengali is a syllabic language, so every letter has a full sound associated with it. While there are separate vowels, each consonant has its own inherent vowel. [5] X Research source Vowels can be written either as separate letters, or by using various marks around the consonant to indicate how it should sound. Because the Bengali alphabet is closely related to the Devanagari alphabet, you may find it easier to learn if you are already familiar with the Devanagari script, which is used in Hindi, Sanskrit, and many other Indo-Aryan languages."

      "content": "Recognize similarities between Bengali and English grammar. As in English (but unlike some European languages, such as French or Spanish), the verb doesn't change form depending on the gender of the subject. [7] X Research source Bengali nouns are not assigned a gender, as they would be in some languages such as Spanish or French, so you don't have to worry about using the correct articles or changing adjectives for agreement."

      "title": "Use subject-object-verb word order in Bengali sentences.",
      "content": "Use subject-object-verb word order in Bengali sentences. Linguistically, Bengali is referred to as a head-final language. This means that the verb comes after any objects of the verb. This differs significantly from English and other European languages, which use the subject-verb-object word order. [8] X Research source Possessors, numerals, and adjectives come before nouns. However, articles (words similar to a , and , and the in English) come after the noun they relate to. This word order can be difficult for native English speakers. If you speak other head-final languages, such as Japanese, it might be easier. German also has some head-final verb phrases."

      "content": "Distinguish Bengali postpositions from English prepositions. English and other European languages make use of prepositions and prepositional phrases. In contrast, these connecting words appear after the object in Bengali. For this reason, they are referred to as postpostitions . [9] X Research source Bengali also has fewer of these words than exist in English and other European languages. For example, there is only one word in Bengali that is used to mean under, underneath, beneath, below, and down . Despite having fewer words, there are some situations in which a preposition would not be used in English at all, but a postposition is required under the Bengali grammar rules."
