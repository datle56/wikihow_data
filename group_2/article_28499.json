      "content": "Subscribe to a VPN service. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a service you can use to obscure your IP address, prevent your location from being tracked, and prevent your internet service provider from viewing your internet activity. To use a VPN , you will need to sign up for a service. Most good services will require a subscription fee. Once you subscribe to a service, you can download the app. Then you can usually turn the VPN on with the tap of a button. Worth Noting: While a VPN may prevent your location from being tracked via your IP address, it does not prevent your location from being tracked via your location services, or cellular data. You will still need to take other precautions to prevent your phone from being tracked. Additionally, while a VPN may prevent your internet service provider from tracking your internet activity, the VPN service provider may still be able to track your internet activity. No-logs VPN Services: When shopping for a VPN service, it's important that the service does not keep usage logs, which could be used to track your online activity. Most VPN services claim that they do not keep logs, but you should be skeptical of this claim. At the bare minimum, VPNs need to keep connection logs for maintenance and optimization purposes. These logs could be used to track when you connect to the service and for how long. Furthermore, many VPNs claim they do not keep logs, yet were able to provide logs to law enforcement when subpoenaed. The best way to find out if a VPN keeps logs is to research what happens when they are subpoenaed by law enforcement. Were they able to provide logs when subpoenaed, or did law enforcement come up empty-handed? [5] X Research source Some VPN services you can check out include; Proton VPN , NordVPN , ExpressVPN , and Surfshark ."

It's normal for your phone to get a little hot when you are doing activities that use a lot of your phone's resources (such as gaming or video editing). However, if you find your phone is getting excessively hot while doing mundane activities or while not in use, that could be a sign that there is spyware or malware running in the background. Your battery is running out quickly . Again, it's not unusual for your battery to drain quickly when you are doing resource-heavy activities, or if your phone battery is getting old. However, if your phone is fairly new, or you find the battery is draining quickly all of the sudden, that could be a sign that you have spyware or malware on your phone. Your data usage is higher than normal . Spyware collects data and sends it to a hacker or another third-party. If you receive a bill for excessive data usage, or you check your mobile account and notice your phone is using much more data than it use to, that could be a sign that your data is being tracked. Your phone lights up or restarts unexpectedly . Spyware and malware may cause your phone to glitch, light up, or restart unexpectedly. If your phone restarts automatically or lights up when you don't get a notification, that could be a sign that there is spyware running in the background. Your phone is running slow . If your phone is lagging and running slower than usual—even during normal usage—that could be a sign that your phone has spyware or malware running in the background."
