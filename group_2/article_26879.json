      "title": "Use real flowers if you want sweet-smelling bouquets.",
      "content": "Use real flowers if you want sweet-smelling bouquets. Opt for flowers that are especially fragrant, like roses, gardenia, or lilacs. Stick with one strong scent or mix and match different smells to create your own fragrance. For example, combine blossoms of jasmine and lavender for a soothing scent. Ask the bridesmaids ahead of time if they have any allergies or are sensitive to strong smells before you pick your flowers."

      "title": "Choose fake flowers for a more budget-friendly option.",
      "content": "Choose fake flowers for a more budget-friendly option. Cut down the cost of flowers by opting for fake ones, which you can buy at a craft store or an online retailer. Select from almost any type of flower imaginable, from hyacinths to peonies to tulips, for instance. If you do go with faux flowers, pick ones that are high-quality and look as realistic as possible, like silk ones."

    {
      "title": "Pick the color of the flowers based on the wedding’s color scheme.",
      "content": "Pick the color of the flowers based on the wedding’s color scheme. To narrow down your flower options, think about the colors of the wedding. Pick blooms that either match the exact colors or complement them. For example, if the wedding’s scheme is mint and peach, you could use peach roses to match or white lilies to complement. [1] X Research source If you want your flowers to match exactly, take fabric swatches or paint chips to your vendor so they know the precise shade. Consider the bridesmaid dresses, too. For instance, if the dresses are a wine color, you might want flowers in a contrasting hue to stand out."

    {
      "title": "Select a vendor based on price and variety if you’re using real flowers.",
      "content": "Select a vendor based on price and variety if you’re using real flowers. Research different vendors online to compare their prices and inventory options before you choose one. Take into consideration your budget when making a decision and how important it is to you to have the most expensive, exotic flowers or if you want something more affordable. [2] X Research source Ask friends who have gotten married what vendors or florists they recommend. Read reviews online to get a feel for the experiences other customers have had with a specific vendor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy flowers that are in season if you want to save money.",
      "content": "Buy flowers that are in season if you want to save money. Ask your florist or vendor for a list of flowers currently in season, or research them online. If you include flowers that are not blooming around the time of your wedding, be prepared to pay a higher price. [3] X Research source For example, buying daffodils in the fall, which is their off-season, will be more expensive than buying them in the spring."

    {
      "title": "Use the same flowers that are in the bride’s bouquet for a cohesive look.",
      "content": "Use the same flowers that are in the bride’s bouquet for a cohesive look. To tie all of the bridal party’s arrangements together, use some of the same flowers in both the bride’s bouquet and the bridesmaid bouquets. For example, if the bride’s bunch has roses, lilies, and baby’s breath, make the bridesmaid bouquets out of simply roses and baby’s breath. [4] X Research source Match the colors of the bride’s and the bridesmaid arrangements, as well."

    {
      "title": "Opt for cascading bouquets for an extra elegant effect.",
      "content": "Opt for cascading bouquets for an extra elegant effect. Arrange the flowers so that they fall down in a sort of waterfall effect by using a slanted bouquet holder. Drape long strands of greenery like ferns and eucalyptus to give it more depth, too. The longer and more voluminous you make the bouquet, the more dramatic it will be. [5] X Research source Choose flowers with longer stems for a cascading bouquet. Some of the most commonly used are roses and calla lilies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bunch together assorted wildflowers if you want a touch of rustic charm.",
      "content": "Bunch together assorted wildflowers if you want a touch of rustic charm. Loosely tie together wildflowers like bright poppies, blue cornflowers, and even sprigs of wheat to create a carefree, bohemian vibe. You can also keep the stems long and different lengths to enhance the undone feel. [6] X Research source For a country-chic wedding, swap the ribbon around the bouquet for a strand of lace or burlap instead."

    {
      "title": "Build the bouquet around one large flower if you want to make a statement.",
      "content": "Build the bouquet around one large flower if you want to make a statement. Start with an eye-catching blossom, like an oversized orchid or king protea. Surround it with smaller flowers to let the center really pop. [7] X Research source Choose your statement flower in a color that contrasts with the bridesmaid dresses for a bold accent. Keep the rest of the flowers in the bouquet understated and neutral in color so they don’t compete."

      "title": "Add non-floral extras for a unique and playful twist.",
      "content": "Add non-floral extras for a unique and playful twist. If you want a whimsical bouquet that’s completely one-of-a-kind, weave in pieces that aren’t flowers. For example, long feathers lend a boho feel, while glittering gems along the stems create a more glamorous touch. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove leaves and trim the stems to the same length if you’re using real flowers.",
      "content": "Remove leaves and trim the stems to the same length if you’re using real flowers. Pluck off any foliage on the stems, then use garden shears or sturdy scissors to cut the stems so they’re all an equal length. Keep the stems long enough so that the bridesmaids can easily hold them. [9] X Research source If your bouquet has roses, remove all of the thorns. You can also pull off any damaged or wilted petals from the flowers."

    {
      "title": "Form the base by wrapping the stems of 2 to 4 flowers together.",
      "content": "Form the base by wrapping the stems of 2 to 4 flowers together. Choose the flowers that you want to be the base, or the center, of your bouquet. Then, use floral tape to secure the stems together, leaving about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of stem below the tape. [10] X Research source Try to wrap the flowers so that they’re all at an even height."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add flowers around the bouquet, taping the stems as you go.",
      "content": "Add flowers around the bouquet, taping the stems as you go. As you bunch the remaining flowers around the base, wrap more floral tape around the stems to hold them in place. Continue adding flowers until the bouquet is your desired size and shape. [11] X Research source Use as many or as few flowers in each bunch as you'd like. For reference, a medium-sized bouquet usually has 18-20 flowers."

    {
      "title": "Wrap a final layer of floral tape around all of the stems to secure the bouquet.",
      "content": "Wrap a final layer of floral tape around all of the stems to secure the bouquet. Once you’ve added all of the flowers that you want, keep all of the flowers together by tightly wrapping them with one more layer of floral tape. Start taping about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) from the base of the flowers. [12] X Research source You can leave as much of the stems exposed at the bottom as you want. Typically, people don’t leave more than 4 inches (10 cm) of stems showing."

    {
      "title": "Wind a ribbon around the stems if you want to cover up the tape.",
      "content": "Wind a ribbon around the stems if you want to cover up the tape. To hide the tape, first pin the ribbon so it’s parallel with the top row of tape on the bouquet. Then, wrap it around the length of the stems until none of the tape is visible anymore. [13] X Research source Choose a ribbon that matches or complements the color scheme of the wedding or some of the flowers in the bouquet. Opt for thicker, sturdier ribbons, like satin or grosgrain, which cover up the tape better and will hold up on the bouquets."

    {
      "title": "Stand the bouquets in water in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.",
      "content": "Stand the bouquets in water in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. If you aren't using the bouquets right away, set them in a container, like a glass or vase, with just enough water so that the ends of the stems are submerged. Then place the bouquets in a refrigerator to keep them cool until you're ready to use them. You can add plant food to the water if you want to keep the flowers looking fresh and vibrant for longer. Remove any fruits or vegetables from the fridge where you're keeping your flowers. Produce can cause flowers to wilt faster."
