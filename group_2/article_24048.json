      "content": "Choose round dock pilings made of pressure-treated wood . Pressure-treated wood has been preserved with special chemicals that help it last longer when it’s exposed to harsh outdoor conditions, like constantly being waterlogged or subjected to tiny wood-eating organisms. Round pilings aren’t cut to expose the interior of the wood, making them hardier than square-cut ones. Pressure-treated wood is also the most cost-effective option. [2] X Research source Other options for pilings include plastic-coated wood and heavy-duty aluminum. Buy pilings 6–8 in (15–20 cm) in diameter if your dock will weigh less than 10,000 lb (4,500 kg). If it’ll weigh more, choose 10–12 in (25–30 cm) pilings. [3] X Research source Get enough pilings to place one about every 10 ft (3.0 m) along the dock on both sides to support its weight.

      "content": "Rent a 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) water jetter from a home improvement store. Often, your local home improvement store will allow you to rent high-powered tools like a water jetter (also called a hydro jet) for a short amount of time. This prevents you from paying full price for a tool you won’t use very often— water jetters can be pricy! [5] X Research source These high-powered water pumps typically run on gasoline and come with either a 2 in (5.1 cm) or 3 in (7.6 cm) diameter hose. Either size will work, but since the hose gets heavy when it’s full of water, the 2 in (5.1 cm) hose may be easier to use. The cost of renting a water jet will vary depending on your location and the length of time you need it. A 1,500 PSI jet might be $100 to $200 per day. If you don’t have access to a water jetter, use a power washer or high-pressure garden hose instead. The process will probably take longer this way, though."

      "title": "Spray paint",
      "content": "Spray paint your pilings at 12 in (30 cm) intervals to monitor their depth. As you start to sink the pilings, it can be hard to keep track of how far they’ve gone into the ground. By marking them with spray paint, it’s easier to make sure your pilings are all installed at the same depth."

    {
      "title": "Cut the pilings",
      "content": "Cut the pilings tall enough to hold the dock 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) above water. Ideally, your dock will hover above the highest level the water will reach (taking tides, flooding, or heavy rainfall into account). [6] X Research source Use a long measuring tape or a marker float to find the depth of the water from the lakebed to the surface. Then, add 4 in (10 cm) plus the length of piling that will go underground (4–6 ft (1.2–1.8 m)) to find the total height. For example, if the water is 6 ft (1.8 m) deep, you’d need pilings that are between about 124 in (3.1 m) and 148 in (3.8 m) tall. Cut the beams a little longer than you think you’ll need them to be. You can always trim them later if needed. Even in a body of water that isn’t affected by tides, the water level may still fluctuate. If you’re not sure what the maximum water line is, ask other pier or dock owners in your area."

      "content": "Stand the first piling in the water and push it into the lakebed. If possible, recruit 1-2 strong people to help you hold the piling in place (try bribing a few friends with lemonade and the promise of spending sunny days on the water!). Once the post is in the right location, gently push or hammer it a few inches or so into the lakebed for some stability before you jet the sand and silt away. [7] X Research source If you don’t have anyone who can help you, use sturdy pieces of wood and a pulley system to create a tripod that can lift and hold the pilings in place. If the lakebed is hard or compact, use the water jetter to “pre-jet” a starter hole to help the piling settle."

      "title": "Aim the water jetter at the bottom of the piling and turn on the pump.",
      "content": "Aim the water jetter at the bottom of the piling and turn on the pump. The water will blow out of the hose with enough force to push the sand and silt out from under the piling. As this is happening, guide the piling further down into the earth until you reach the desired depth. If you need to, move the tip of the hose from side to side so the piling can go in evenly. [8] X Research source If the force of the water isn’t enough to remove the sand, attach a PVC pipe with a 1 in (2.5 cm) diameter to the end of the hose to increase the pressure. Some people attach a metal brace to the piling 4–6 ft (1.2–1.8 m) above the bottom so it doesn’t sink further into the lakebed. This is optional. Use the water jetter to push some of the dirt back into place around the piling after it’s set. This helps stabilize the piling even more. Repeat this process for the remaining pilings."

      "content": "Measure the total length of PVC pipe you’ll need for every piling. Measure from the bed beneath the water to the highest level the water reaches in your area. Depending on how soft the earth is below the water, add another 1–2 ft (0.30–0.61 m) to that length (closer to 2 ft (0.61 m) for soft, silty beds). Multiply this length by the number of beams you will need to get the total length of PVC. [9] X Research source When you’re choosing the pilings that go inside of the concrete, add another 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) to account for the height of the pier or dock above the water."

For standard 8 ft (2.4 m) docks, a PVC pipe with a diameter of 12 in (30 cm) and an interior post with a diameter of 4 in (10 cm) is sufficient. [10] X Research source If your dock is longer than 8 ft (2.4 m), start with a PVC pipe of 18 in (46 cm) and posts that are about 6 in (15 cm)."

Bail out the water that’s inside of the PVC pipe with a bucket, then use a post-hole digger to remove sand, silt, or mud from the bottom of the pipe. The pipe should be clear down to the bottom. [12] X Research source While you can use a pump to clear out the pipe, doing it by hand is safer, since you don’t have to have electrical equipment near the water. If the ground is very hard, you may need to rent a mini-excavator ."

It’s easy to mix quick-set concrete, like Quikrete , by hand—just pour the concrete mix into a bucket and dig a small hole in the mix, then add in water according to the instructions. [13] X Research source The amount of concrete you’ll need depends on the size of your project. For a PVC pipe with a diameter of 12 in (30 cm) and a post of 4 in (10 cm), estimate about 2 bags of Quikrete per 1 ft (0.30 m) of height. If your pipe is 18 in (46 cm) in diameter and your post is 6 inches (15 cm), you’ll need about 5 bags per 1 ft (0.30 m). It may be a good idea to rent a concrete mixer for this project."
