      "content": "Select a rod that matches the rest of your bathroom fixtures. You’ll be more pleased with your curved shower rod if its color and material match those of your sink and/or cabinet handles. This will give the bathroom a great sense of unity and style. [1] X Research source Read the directions that come with your shower rod. Different shower rods have different sets of hardware and different installation strategies. To determine how to use your curved shower rod, consult the directions that come with it."

      "title": "Position the shower rod high enough that you won't bump your head.",
      "content": "Position the shower rod high enough that you won't bump your head. If you position the rod too low, you’ll be ducking every time you get in and out of the shower. If you live with other people, install the curved shower rod at a height that allows the tallest person living in the house to get in and out of the shower without bumping their head. [2] X Research source At the opposite end, ensure your rod is not so high that the bottom of the shower curtain is above the edge of the tub. Measure the height of your shower curtain. This is a great way to make sure your shower curtain rod is placed at the right height."

      "title": "Place the shower rod at least 74 inches (188 cm) above the shower floor.",
      "content": "Place the shower rod at least 74 inches (188 cm) above the shower floor. The standard shower curtain is 72 inches (183 cm) long, and when it is linked to shower hooks, it usually gains another two inches (five cm). To prevent the curtain from dragging on the floor of the tub, hang the curved shower rod at a height of 74 inches or more. [3] X Research source If your bathroom ceiling is so low that you will be unable to install the curved shower rod at the appropriate height, modify your shower curtains so that they are short enough that they won’t bunch up on the bottom of the tub."

      "title": "Cut your rod if necessary.",
      "content": "Cut your rod if necessary. If your curved shower rod is not collapsible and does not fit perfectly across the length of your shower enclosure, you’ll need to cut it using a hacksaw. Measure the width of your shower enclosure, then subtract it from the length of your shower rod. Divide the difference in half and cut that length from your shower rod. [4] X Research source For instance, if your curved shower rod is 50 inches long, and your shower enclosure is 48 inches wide, cut one inch off each end of the shower rod. When measuring the length of the shower rod, measure from end to end, not along the curved length."

      "title": "Center the rod over your tub’s edge.",
      "content": "Center the rod over your tub’s edge. If you’re installing a rod over a tub with a straight edge, position it in such a way that the curve extends equally into and out of the shower or tub space. For instance, if the arc of your shower rod extends six inches out from where it otherwise would be (if it was straight), place the ends three inches inside the tub. That way, the shower rod and curtain will perfectly straddle the line marking the edge of the tub. [5] X Research source If you’re installing a curved shower rod over a curved tub edge, position it in such a way that the curve of the rod aligns with the curve of the tub."

      "title": "Mark the spots where you want to install the flanges.",
      "content": "Mark the spots where you want to install the flanges. The flanges are the mounts that hold the curtain rod. Once you’ve centered the shower rod over the edge of your tub and you know the height at which you want to install it, measure down from the ceiling on both sides, and then make a small mark with a pencil or marker on the spot where you’ll need to install the flanges. [6] X Research source It is also a good idea to check the rod with a level . Place the level on top of the shower rod to ensure that the flanges will be even. Some curved shower rods don’t need flanges installed, and instead feature extendable “feet” that can be pressed directly against the walls of your shower or bathroom. This is called a tension rod and it is held in place by a spring that pushes the ends of the rod outwards. However, these rods do not stay up as well as shower rods that you mount on the wall. You can use felt pads between the end of the rod and the wall to help them stay put. Consult manufacturer directions for more information."

      "title": "Drill the mounting holes",
      "content": "Drill the mounting holes with a mini hole saw meant for tile. Although it is best to avoid installing your shower rod onto tile at all, a mini hole saw with a 3/16” (4.7 mm) that is designed for tile will allow you to drill through bathroom tile if needed. Line the flange up to the position where you want it, then drill through the holes around its perimeter. [7] X Research source Drill slowly at first to avoid having your drill slip on the tile. Once your drill is through the tile, you will need to place an anchor through the tile to prevent it from cracking. If your shower enclosure has acrylic siding, don’t drill through it. Instead, drill the mounting holes into the finished wall either above or just outside the shower enclosure."

      "title": "Tap the plastic anchors into the holes.",
      "content": "Tap the plastic anchors into the holes. Move the flange away from the wall before tapping the anchors in place. If the plastic anchors don’t go all the way in, shave off the part that sticks out using a utility knife so they’re flush with the wall. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Screw the flanges into the wall.",
      "content": "Screw the flanges into the wall. Line the holes of the flanges up with the plastic anchors you drove into the wall, then screw the flange in. You could use a power drill or a regular screwdriver to affix the flanges to the wall. [9] X Research source Try to find studs to screw your flanges into. You can use a stud finder to do this. It will make it possible for the shower rod to hold more weight and you will not need to use anchors."

      "title": "Fasten the rod to the flanges.",
      "content": "Fasten the rod to the flanges. Slide the flange covers over the ends of the shower rod. The way in which you fasten the rod to the flanges will vary depending on the manufacturer of the curved shower rod you’ve selected. In some cases, the ends will just snap into the flanges, while in other cases you’ll need to screw the ends of the rod to a bevel attached to the flange. [10] X Research source Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to fasten the curved rod to the flanges."
