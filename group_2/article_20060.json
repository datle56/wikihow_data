      "title": "Spritz over the wrinkled edges of tint with water.",
      "content": "Spritz over the wrinkled edges of tint with water. Fill a spray bottle with a mixture of distilled, lukewarm water and a pea-sized amount of liquid soap. Search along the edges of your car window for any obvious wrinkles, or other areas where the tinting looks bumpy and uneven. Spray the soapy water along these edges so the tint can loosen. [2] X Research source Some tints will last longer than others. If you used a cheap tint to cover your windows, you may start seeing wrinkles within a year or 2."

      "title": "Lift the wrinkled tint away from the window.",
      "content": "Lift the wrinkled tint away from the window. Pinch and pull the damp, wrinkled section of tint edges up and away from the window with your fingers. Don’t lift the entire tint section—only peel away the area that’s really wrinkled or bubbly. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray soapy water on both the window and the inside of the peeled tint.",
      "content": "Spray soapy water on both the window and the inside of the peeled tint. Cover the entire wrinkly section of tint with soapy water, along with the matching portion of window. You may need to hold the tint in 1 hand while you spray over the inner section. [4] X Research source This process will make it easier to reapply the wrinkled tint."

    {
      "title": "Arrange the tint so it fits evenly over the window.",
      "content": "Arrange the tint so it fits evenly over the window. Pinch the edges of the wet tint and hold it up to the edges of your car window. Make sure that all the edges line up, so you can reapply your tint as smoothly as possible. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Press the tint onto the damp window with a squeegee.",
      "content": "Press the tint onto the damp window with a squeegee. Hold your squeegee along the bottom of the peeled tint, then drag it upwards. Repeat this process several times until the tint is firmly attached to the rest of the window. [6] X Research source Always apply an even amount of pressure to squeegee as you stick the tint to the window. This helps the film to look as smooth as possible."

    {
      "title": "Wait 1 hour for the tint to dry.",
      "content": "Wait 1 hour for the tint to dry. Set a timer for about an hour and go about the rest of your day. Don’t drive your car anywhere—instead, give the film plenty of time to air-dry. If this doesn’t work, try spritzing and squeegeeing the tint once more and letting it dry. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn on your heat gun to the highest setting.",
      "content": "Turn on your heat gun to the highest setting. Plug your heat gun into an outlet near your car and adjust the temperature dial. Check that it’s turned up the highest possible setting, or somewhere around 1,100 °F (593 °C). You need a heat gun for the repair to work properly. While blow dryers can get pretty hot, heat guns are a much better tool for the job. If you don’t have a heat gun, you can purchase one online or in a hardware store. Always use a lot of caution when working with a heat gun. If the heat touches your skin, you could get seriously burned."

      "title": "Hold your heat gun around 3 in (7.6 cm) to the left the window’s edge.",
      "content": "Hold your heat gun around 3 in (7.6 cm) to the left the window’s edge. Your heat gun is really strong, so you don’t want it to melt or warp the rubber seal along the side of your car window. Instead, move your heat gun to the left of the wrinkle, which makes the creases and bubbles easier to remove. [8] X Research source Whenever you work with a heat gun, hold it at least 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the window tint. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold your fingers against the window to see if it’s hot.",
      "content": "Hold your fingers against the window to see if it’s hot. Lightly tap the fingers of your opposite hand along the glass while applying heat to the tint. Remove your fingers once the window is uncomfortably hot, then turn your heat gun off. [10] X Research source To protect your fingers, consider wearing a pair of sturdy, flame retardant work gloves."

      "content": "Press upwards along the edge of the tint with a credit card. Find the exact spot where the crease or wrinkle is on your tint and place your chiseler directly below it. Push the card in short, smooth, outward motions, working your way to the side of the car window. With the window tint still warm, you can get rid of the wrinkles and bubbles with the credit card. [11] X Research source Always work along the edge of the window."
