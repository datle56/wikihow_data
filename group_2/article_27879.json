      "content": "Choose pine cones, pine needles, and peonies for a winter potpourri. The winter holidays almost have their own specific smell.

      "content": "Dry your ingredients on a baking tray for 2 weeks. Set all of your ingredients on a baking tray or in a cardboard box. Make sure they are all in 1 layer and not overlapping each other. Allow them to dry out completely for about 2 weeks. Dry ingredients will be crumbly and might flake when you touch them. [4] X Research source To dry your ingredients faster, place them in direct sunlight."

      "title": "Put your dry ingredients into an airtight container.",
      "content": "Put your dry ingredients into an airtight container. Carefully pour your dried ingredients into a container that can be sealed. Try not to crumble or crush them too much as you transition them. Your container does not have to look attractive since it will not be what you are displaying your potpourri in. [5] X Research source Use a mason jar and a lid for small ingredients. Seal a large bowl with plastic wrap or a lid."

    {
      "title": "Add 2 drops of essential oils to your dry ingredients.",
      "content": "Add 2 drops of essential oils to your dry ingredients. Essential oils add fragrance and moisture back into your dry ingredients. Use an eyedropper to pour 2 drops of essential oils into your ingredients. Put 1 drop on each side of your container to evenly disperse them. [6] X Research source Rose oil, cinnamon oil, lemon oil, orange oil, honeysuckle oil, and bayberry oil are all great choices for potpourri."

      "content": "Seal the container and allow it to sit for up to 6 weeks. Let your dry ingredients soak up the essential oils so that they smell good for longer. Leave your container in a cool, dry place where it won’t be disturbed. Avoid opening the container before you want to display your potpourri. [7] X Research source Try putting your mix in a closet or a dark bedroom to let it sit."

Use small jars for individual gifts or put your potpourri into 1 large bowl to keep for yourself. Your potpourri should emit a strong smell for about 2 months. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry your flowers fully by baking or hanging them. To hang your flowers, tie them together by the stem and hang them upside down for 3 weeks until they are fully dry. To bake your flowers, arrange them on a baking tray and preheat your oven to 200 °F (93 °C). Bake them for 2 hours or until they are fully dry. Dry flowers will be flaky and crumbly to the touch."

      "content": "Place your dried flower petals or heads in a container. If your flowers have any stems on them, cut them off with sharp scissors. Place individual petals or full flower heads into a container that can be sealed. The petals may crumble a bit in the container, but that’s okay. This container is not the one that you’ll display your finished potpourri in, so it doesn’t have to look aesthetically pleasing."

      "content": "Seal your container and let it sit for 2 weeks. Put a lid on your airtight container and don’t open it up for at least 2 weeks. This allows the oils to soak into the flower petals and make them smell good for much longer. Avoid opening your container until you are ready to use your potpourri. You can leave your container sealed for up to 8 weeks for a stronger smell."

      "content": "Mix in 1 tbsp (15 g) of orris root powder. Orris root powder is a “fixative,” meaning that it will keep your essential oils from evaporating and keep your mix smelling good for longer. Pour some orris root powder into your flowers and essential oil mix and shake it up so it covers all of your potpourri. You can find orris root powder at most grocery and health food stores."

[10] X Research source You may even notice more of a smell as you start to move your potpourri around."

      "content": "Add 2 to 3 drops of essential oil to your potpourri. Use the same essential oil that you started with to refresh your potpourri. If you can’t remember what you used or you don’t have it anymore, use an essential oil fragrance that complements what it used to smell like. There will probably be a little bit of essential oil left in your mix, so the scents will combine slightly. [11] X Research source Lemon oil and orange oil are great for citrus potpourri. Rose or lavender oil are both good for floral potpourri."
