Ringtones can be a maximum of 30 seconds in length, so choose a part of the song you think would work best as a ringtone in that period of time. You’ll need to write down or remember the starting and stopping time of your new ringtone. To do this: As your song plays, look at the moving slider at the top right side of the screen. The left side of the moving slider shows how many seconds have elapsed as the song plays. Remember (or write down) the time when your ringtone should start. You can move the slider around with your mouse to test different periods of time within an audio file. From the starting point, keep listening and write down the time listed when the tone should end. Keep the 30-second maximum ringtone time in mind—if you want the tone to start at 1:30 (1 minute and 30 seconds) into the song, the end time can be no later than 2:00."
