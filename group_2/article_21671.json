      "content": "Work around your friend's tendency to flake on you. There's nothing worse than having to cancel or change your plans because of an unreliable friend—so try to avoid putting yourself in that situation. You don't have to necessarily cut the person out of your life entirely, but do try to make sure your day won't be ruined if they don't keep up their end of things. For instance: [1] X Research source Don't interrupt what you're doing to wait for your friend if they're always late. Keep watching your movie or folding the laundry, and have them call or text you once they arrive. If your friend promises they'll bake a cake for your daughter's birthday, plan to have cupcakes as well. If your friend does bring a cake, you'll have extra sweets on hand—no big deal! If they don't, though, the party can still go on as planned."

If your friend says they'll meet you for lunch at 1:00, then they casually stroll into the restaurant around 1:30, you've had a whole half-hour to sit alone with your feelings. You don't have to put on a brave face and pretend everything's okay when they finally get there. If you're upset, don't be afraid to say so. [2] X Research source For instance, you might say something like, \"I have other things to do today, and it feels like you don't respect that when you make me wait. I'm glad to see you, though—we just don't have as much time to hang out as I hoped we would.\" If your friend cancels your plans altogether, you might say, “Hey, Carla. You always seem to bow out at the last minute without any explanation. That makes me feel like I’m not a priority as your friend. What’s up with that?”"

      "content": "Give them positive feedback when they follow through. If you notice your friend trying really hard to be more reliable, let them know. That might mean keeping plans, being on time, or even just letting you know ahead of time if their plans have changed. When you give them positive encouragement, they may be more likely to work harder at being there for you in the future. [3] X Research source For instance, if they call ahead of time to tell you they're running late, you could say, \"Thank you so much for giving me a heads up—I know sometimes things come up, and it means a lot that you thought to let me know.\""

If you feel like your friend just really isn't taking your feelings into consideration, it may help to have a more in-depth conversation with them about what's going on.

It makes me feel like our friendship isn't important to you, and I can't help but take it personally.\" [6] X Research source Take some time to get to the bottom of how you're really feeling before you talk—maybe you feel unappreciated, disrespected, or ignored, for instance. By being open and honest with your friend, you might be able to find out more about what's happening with them, as well. [7] X Research source"

If your friend is often unreliable, it's absolutely okay for you to ask them to commit to concrete plans—and to let them know what will happen if they don't follow through. If you're really specific about what you need, it may help your friend stick to the plan, and they'll already know what to expect if they flake on you. [8] X Research source [9] X Expert Source Tracey Rogers, MA Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 January 2020. Try saying something like, \"I'd love to go to dinner with you tomorrow, but sometimes you back out at the last minute. I need you to call me by 5:00 tomorrow to let me know we're for sure going. If I don't hear from you, I'm going to make other plans, okay?\""

If that's an ongoing problem, ask if it would help if you texted them to remind them before you're supposed to meet. [10] X Research source If you're supposed to meet for dinner, give them a call around 4:00 and say something like, \"Hey are we still on for tonight?\" If you don't hear back from them by 5:30 or so, you might consider making other plans."

If you're planning to spend time together one-on-one and your friend doesn't show up, you might end up having to cancel your plans altogether. When it's possible, try inviting at least one other person to join you so that doesn't happen. [11] X Research source This works best when you’re inviting your friend to do things—it might seem rude if they invite you to hang out and you ask if you can bring someone else along."

An issue like that might cause them to feel overwhelmed when it's time to meet up, so they might procrastinate or cancel altogether.

Sometimes, you just have to come to terms with the fact that someone is going to consistently cancel at the last minute, or that they're going to be late any time you make plans. If you tell yourself this ahead of time, you might not feel as frustrated when it happens. [14] X Research source This is a good approach when you're dealing with someone who's otherwise a great friend, but maybe they're super busy and have a hard time keeping commitments. [15] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source It's still okay to set certain boundaries with your friend—like telling them you won't wait more than 20 minutes if you're supposed to meet for dinner. If you have a hard time doing this, try making a list of everything you love about your friend, and read it when you start getting frustrated with them. [16] X Research source"

If you feel like the situation is causing you more upset than it's worth, it's fine to put a little space between the two of you. You don't even necessarily have to let them know what you're doing—just don't be the one to reach out or try to make plans.

If you've tried talking to them and the other person still isn't showing signs of respecting your time, you might be better off cutting ties with them altogether. This can be really hard sometimes, but in the long run, you might find that it leaves you more room for healthy friendships that leave you feeling refreshed instead of exhausted. [18] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Sometimes people use flakiness as a passive-aggressive way of telling you they don't want to be your friend. If they continually overstep your boundaries, ask yourself if they're really that good of a friend after all. [19] X Research source It might be time to end the relationship if your friend regularly cancels plans without calling, doesn't follow through on important promises, or makes you feel like you're overreacting when you talk about how you feel."
