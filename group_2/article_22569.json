This should be the hole just above the hole the left lace went into. You will then thread the right lace down through the hole immediately across from it, the same as you did with the left end.

Continue to thread the laces according to this pattern: bring the left lace up through the hole just above the previous hole you worked with, and down into the hole straight across. Then bring the right lace up out of the hole just above the hole the left lace went into, and bring the right lace down into the hole straight across.

      "content": "Tie a bow on the inside of the shoe. Make a bow as you normally would, but hide it under the tongue of the shoe. Cross the left lace over the right lace, and bring it down to twist the laces. Now make a loop with the right lace, and wrap the left lace around the back of the loop, bring it forward, and push it through the hole under the loop. Grab the original loop and the loop you have just made, and pull them until the bow is tight. [6] X Research source Some people find having the bow under the tongue makes their shoes painful to wear. If this is uncomfortable for you, you can try pushing the bow under the sole of the shoe or to one side of your foot instead."

This should create a bar across the bottom two holes on the inside of the shoe. Pull the ends of the lace up to tighten it. Make sure the lace is centered and that both ends are the same length. Criss-cross lacing is the most common type of shoe lacing. Most shoes will already be laced this way when they are purchased. Save yourself some time by checking to see whether they are already laced in a criss-cross pattern before you remove them. [7] X Research source"

Keeping the laces loose, cross the right lace over the left lace at the toe of the shoe, then bring the end of it under the place where the two laces cross to make a twist in the laces. Do not pull too tight, because you want this twist to stay at the toe of the shoe. Next, cross the left lace over the right lace and bring it under the place where the laces cross, above the first twist you created. [9] X Research source Remember to keep the laces loose as you do this. The knot should land just inside the point of your shoe. It should fit in the space in front of your toes."
