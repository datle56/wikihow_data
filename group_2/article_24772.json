      "title": "Reduce stress.",
      "content": "Reduce stress. When you are stressed, your body starts shutting down processes that aren’t necessary for survival. This shutdown can occur with physical stressors, like surgery or an illness, and emotional stress, which often manifests as physical symptoms. Loss may occur up to three months after the stressful event and may take another three to grow again. Start a daily meditation practice. Make time in the morning, after work or school, or before bed to calm your mind and sit quietly. Pick a time that works best with your schedule and spend at least 20 minutes focusing on your breathing. Yoga is a great way to get more exercise and reduce stress at the same time. It is also easier for many people to do than traditional cardio exercises and only requires a mat for practice."
