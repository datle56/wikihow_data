      "content": "Wait to lay down new turf until fall or spring if possible. Fall and spring are the best seasons for turf to root into the ground because of all the rain. Winter can be too cold and summer can be too dry for turf to root. [1] X Research source If you wish to put down turf in the summer, or your area does not get enough rainfall in fall and spring, install a watering system or use a hose and sprinkler to make sure your turf gets enough water. If you are installing turf in the fall, lay it down early enough so that it is well established and rooted at least 6 weeks before the first hard freeze of winter. Artificial turf is more expensive than real sod up front, but it doesn't need real maintenance afterwards, and often has a warranty of about 16 years.

      "content": "Test your soil pH, and adjust if necessary. Buy a soil testing kit from your garden center or nursery and test a few samples from different parts of your yard. Test your soil a few months in advance of when you plan to lay down the turf, because it may take some time for any necessary amendments to take effect. Most turfgrass species prefer a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.2. [5] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If your soil is too acidic (low pH), add some ground limestone to the soil. Garden lime can be bought in most garden supply stores. If your soil is too alkaline (high pH), add garden sulfur or some type of acidic mulch, such as pine needles. [6] X Research source Some soil testing kits also allow you to check your soil’s nutrient levels."

Rake across the surface of the soil again. [9] X Research source To pack soil down more efficiently, rent or buy a water-weighted lawn roller from a garden center or home improvement store. Many models can be either pushed by hand or towed behind a tractor. Adding turf will raise the level of your lawn by about 2 inches (5 cm), so pack your existing soil or turf down by at least that much."
