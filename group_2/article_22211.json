      "title": "Ask someone out.",
      "content": "Ask someone out. People appreciate it when you're clear and concise about asking them out. You can send a text that says something like, \"Could I take you to a movie sometime?\" You can also call and say something like, \"I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie with me.\" Make a clear plan as well. Suggest a specific day of the week, time, and place to meet up. For example, you could agree to meet around six o'clock at a specific theater downtown on Friday. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a good outfit.",
      "content": "Pick a good outfit. A movie date is more on the casual side, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't dress well. Opt for something dressy while still being casual. For example, a button-down shirt with jeans works well instead of pairing jeans with a t-shirt. [2] X Research source Don't place too much focus on dressing to please your date. If you feel comfortable in your clothes, you're more likely to exude confidence on a first date."

    {
      "title": "Get some cash.",
      "content": "Get some cash. The matter of who pays for what on a date can get complicated. Sometimes, people may prefer to split checks on a first date. Therefore, it's a good idea to bring some cash in case a place can't split a check with cards. [3] X Research source Get a variety of bills. If you show up only with twenties, splitting checks can get a little tricky. Make sure to have some fives, ones, and tens as well."

    {
      "title": "Decide on the movie together.",
      "content": "Decide on the movie together. While you may be inclined to cater to your date's taste, your date may get uncomfortable if they feel they're dragging you to a movie you don't want to see. Figure out a movie you both want to see together. Ask your date about the kind of films they like and pick something that appeals to your taste as well. For example, maybe you both share a similar sense of humor. Consider going to see a comedy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do something together before the movie.",
      "content": "Do something together before the movie. Going straight into a movie on a first date can be awkward. You want some time to talk and get comfortable with one another before sitting in a theater in silence. Plan to grab a quick cup of coffee or a drink before the film. Look for a place near the theater so you don't risk being late for a movie. Reader Poll: We asked 549 wikiHow readers who've planned successful first dates, and 64% of them agreed that the best way to break the ice is by going to a coffee shop. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Arrive to the theater on time.",
      "content": "Arrive to the theater on time. Some people really dislike being late for movies. To avoid irking your date with tardiness, keep track of time. Make sure you and your date head to the theater so you'll have plenty of time to grab tickets, snacks, and get a good seat. [4] X Research source Aim to be at the theater around 15-20 minutes before the film starts. You can also try buying tickets online to avoid lines at the theater. Some people enjoy getting seated as early as possible so they don't miss trailers."

    {
      "title": "Offer to pay for the ticket.",
      "content": "Offer to pay for the ticket. If you initiated the date, offering to pay is a nice gesture. However, some people are uncomfortable having their date pay for them. While you can offer to pay for the tickets, don't push it if your date would prefer to pay for their own seat. [5] X Research source For example, say something like, \"I can get your ticket if you want.\""

      "title": "Buy snacks.",
      "content": "Buy snacks. Popcorn is a good option, as you can share the bowl and initiate contact by your fingers brushing together. You also want to avoid food that gives you bad breath. Minty flavored chocolates are generally a good choice for a movie night. [6] X Research source Kernels can sometimes get stuck in your teeth, making kissing awkward. Bring some floss with you and run to the bathroom to use it if you get kernels stuck in your teeth."

      "title": "Try hand holding.",
      "content": "Try hand holding. Pay attention to your date's body language. If they seem to be leaning towards you and placing their hand on the shared arm rest, this could be an indicator they would be open to holding hands during the film. If they move their hand away, don't chase it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide whether to talk during the film. Some people enjoy casually whispering during a film while others prefer to stay silent. To gauge your date's preferences, let them take the lead when it comes to talking. If they start whispering, feel free to participate. [8] X Research source Make sure to keep your voice down. You don't want to make things awkward by annoying other movie guests. Avoid texting, however, as this is generally considered rude."

      "content": "Hang out after the movie. It's a good idea to plan to hang out a little after the movie to have a chance to chat. You can go get a cup of coffee or a drink at a nearby establishment. The great thing about a movie date is that you'll already have something to talk about after the date. [9] X Research source Pay attention to your date, however. If your date seems to be drawing away from you physically, and mentions needing to get home, do not pressure them to go out afterwards."

      "content": "Decide whether or not to kiss goodnight. Watch your date's body language. If your date seems to be leaning towards you at the end of the night, or if they offer a warm hug goodbye, you can ask to kiss them on the lips or cheek before they leave.

Think about whether you enjoyed the conversations you had before and after the film and whether you're attracted to the person. If you are, give them an enthusiastic goodbye and let them know you'd like to see them again. Say something like, \"I had a great time, Jamie. It's a lot of fun hanging out with you.\" If your date responds with enthusiasm, let them know you'd be open to seeing them again. Say something like, \"I'd really like to see you again soon.
