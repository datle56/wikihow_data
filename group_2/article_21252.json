      "title": "Sow the seeds once the ground begins to thaw.",
      "content": "Sow the seeds once the ground begins to thaw. Coreopsis flowers can be sown directly in the plant bed during early to mid spring, after the frost has cleared but before the weather gets hot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a sunny spot in your garden.",
      "content": "Pick a sunny spot in your garden. Coreopsis flowers are native to areas with prairies and dry plains, and as a result, the plant thrives in warm, sunny locations. A south-facing spot that receives full sun often works best, but an east- or west-facing spot that receives at least partial sun will work, as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the soil.",
      "content": "Turn the soil. Use a garden fork or tiller to dig up and loosen the soil in your plant bed. The soil in the plant bed should be turned about 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 cm) deep."
    },
    {
      "title": "Amend the soil with compost.",
      "content": "Amend the soil with compost. [1] X Research source Mix 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of compost into the garden soil using a trowel or shovel. The compost enriches the quality of the soil, making it nutritional enough for new flowers to grow in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Improve the soil's ability to drain.",
      "content": "Improve the soil's ability to drain. These plants do not do well if the roots are water-logged, and good draining soil is essential. If your soil is dense and heavy, you may want to mix in 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of garden sand or peat moss, or vermiculite along with the compost."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle the seeds over the soil.",
      "content": "Sprinkle the seeds over the soil. Do so sparingly, preventing the flowers from growing too closely together to avoid crowding them out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the seeds with a light coating of soil.",
      "content": "Cover the seeds with a light coating of soil. The soil you use to cover the seeds should be sandy, or otherwise loose. The seeds should not be planted too deep, but a covering of soil is necessary to protect them against the elements and against birds and other predators."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the soil moist.",
      "content": "Keep the soil moist. Water the area with a watering can or garden hose every day, except for rainy days, until the seeds germinate and seedlings start to form. This should only take one or two weeks. Do not allow the soil to dry out during this time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Space the plants about 12 inches (31 cm) apart.",
      "content": "Space the plants about 12 inches (31 cm) apart. By early summer, the plants should have several sets of leaves. At this point, it is best to space them apart by at least 12 inches (31 cm) to prevent the roots from tangling and competing for resources. You can thin the plants out by either snipping the stem off at soil level or by gently yanking weaker plants out of the ground. To yank out a weaker seedling, insert a garden trowel about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) into the ground, at a distance of about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) away from the visible stem. Gradually ease the trowel toward the plant until the tip is about even with the center of the stem. Then, slowly and carefully lift the plant out roots out. This method works best when you can guarantee that you will not harm the roots of nearby plants or if you plan to transplant the removed flowers to another location."

      "title": "Only water established plants during seasons of drought.",
      "content": "Only water established plants during seasons of drought. If the average rainfall during the summer is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week, you will need to give the soil a good, thorough drenching once a week. Do so early in the morning or in the evening since watering plants in the middle of a hot afternoon can actually cause them to burn when sunlight reflects off the water."

    {
      "title": "Apply compost every spring.",
      "content": "Apply compost every spring. Use a thin layer, just enough to give the soil a little added boost of nutrition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fertilize the flowers once or twice a season.",
      "content": "Fertilize the flowers once or twice a season. [2] X Research source Use an all-purpose, granular, slow-release fertilizer to make the feeding last longer. The first feeding should be in the early spring, around the same time that you apply compost. The second should be about two months later. Alternatively, you can skip the first feeding if you use compost and simply apply one coating several months later, after the initial benefits of the compost have worn off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay mulch over the flower bed each spring.",
      "content": "Lay mulch over the flower bed each spring. After applying compost and/or an early spring dose of fertilizer, lay 2 inches (5 cm) of wood chips or another mulch over the flower bed and around the stems of the flower. This mulch helps the soil to retain moisture and also prevents weeds from popping up."

    {
      "title": "Stake the flowers only as necessary.",
      "content": "Stake the flowers only as necessary. Coreopsis flowers have thick, sturdy stems, and flowers of a moderate height will not need to be staked. If you have larger varieties and the heads begin to droop mid-season, insert a metal or wood pole into the ground about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from the flower and 4 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) deep. Carefully tie the step to the pole using twine or thick yarn."

      "title": "Deadhead the blooms to encourage further blooming.",
      "content": "Deadhead the blooms to encourage further blooming. When the petals of the flower start to wither and drop, use clean shears to snip off the head of the flower. Doing so redirects the plant's energy and encourages it to sprout additional blooms before the end of the season."

    {
      "title": "Cut back the stems in late fall to early winter.",
      "content": "Cut back the stems in late fall to early winter. After the first major frost comes, you should trim the stem of the plant back, only leaving about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of stem above the soil line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide the plants every two to three years.",
      "content": "Divide the plants every two to three years. Do so in the early spring, when growth is just beginning to develop, or in the mid to late fall, right before the frost comes. Carefully dig the plant up by lifting it out with a shovel. Divide the plant into clumps. Large clumps can be replanted immediately, but smaller clumps may need to be potted and kept indoors until the weaker roots develop more. Weaker clumps that are removed can usually be replanted during the late spring or early summer. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch out for pests and disease. Aphids are the most common insect to appear, and leaf spot, rust, and wilt are the most common diseases. If these problems occur, you can treat the plant with an insecticide or fungicide. Only use pesticides as necessary, though. Do not apply preventative pesticides."
