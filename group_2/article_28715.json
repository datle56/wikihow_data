      "content": "Bind 13 sheets of sturdy A4-sized paper or cardstock. With the sheets stacked neatly in a pile, punch 3 or 4 holes along one long edge. Run a piece of string or twine through the holes, allowing the pages to remain loose enough that they can be turned. Punch an additional hole, located directly opposite the central hole, through every page so that you can hang the calendar up later. White paper or cardstock is probably the best option, since it will allow for the most visibility, but you could also use yellow, light blue, or another color that enables good visibility. Alternately, you could use more than one color, so that each month the calendar pages is a different color."

      "content": "Line every other pages with a grid of 42 boxes. Position the calendar with the binding along the top edge, then open the cover page. The page below the binding should contain a grid with 7 squares going across and 6 squares arranged into rows. Each square should be about 1.2 square inches (7.7 cm 2 ). Draw the grids in such a way that the margin along the top and bottom and the one on the left and right is equal. [1] X Research source Use a ruler when drawing the lines so that they're straight."

      "title": "Fill in the days, months, and dates on your grids.",
      "content": "Fill in the days, months, and dates on your grids. Open the calendar to the first page and write “January” at the top, then turn to the second calendar page and write “February” at the top. Continue in this way until you've written all 12 months in order. At the top of each of the 7 columns, write the appropriate day, staring with Sunday and working your way through the week. Finally, copy the numbers from another calendar of the same year as the one you're making to fill in the dates. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Decorate each page above the binding of the calendar. Use crayons, markers, or colored pencils to draw images in your calendar. If you want to get really decorative, you could use glue to add sequins, feathers, and glitter to your calendar. You could decorate the calendar with seasonal images (such as pumpkins in October, or a holiday scene in December), or you could draw something totally unrelated. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Mark important dates like birthdays, holidays, the first day of school, and so on. A cool way to do this is to cut out pictures relating to every special day and glue them onto the correct date. For example, if it's your sister's birthday on May 6th, cut out a photograph of her face and stick it to that date. Use a picture of a Christmas tree to mark December 25th, a cartoon of a witch or ghost for Halloween, and a picture of a fluffy bunny to represent Easter. You could also add famous or popular people's birthdays."

You could choose a standard 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) size, or a smaller desktop size. Many sites also offer even larger sizes. Choose one that will best fill the wall or space you have designated for the calendar. Not every website that offers custom calendars offers the size you want. If the calendar size you want is not available from one site, check another. Remember, the larger the calendar, the more expensive it will be."

Having the calendar shipped to you is probably your best bet, since it reduces the potential frustrations of having to get paper that is correctly sized, running out of ink, or having the printout smudging."

If you're using a program that everyone else in your business or department has, the calendar is often shared automatically. In other cases, you can simply enter the email address of anyone you want to see and use the calendar. Remind the people you're sharing the calendar with that they can probably access the calendar on their smartphone as well.
