      "content": "Always keep moving. By moving frequently in any fight, it makes you more difficult to hit. Try to take on Herobrine in an area that allows you to move easily without too make obstructions."

      "title": "Use potions.",
      "content": "Use potions. Some potions can be really helpful in taking on Herobrine, regardless of which mod you have. A couple of useful potions include: Strong strength potions, made using Nether wart, blaze powder, and glowstone dust Negative effect potions in splashable form (to use on Herobrine), such as weakness potions, poisons, or slowness potions."

      "title": "Use traps.",
      "content": "Use traps. Mob traps come in many different varieties. You'll have to choose one that you can afford, is suitable to the area you're in, and which can affect the version of Herobrine you have. Different mods will have different weaknesses for Herobrine, so you'll have to figure out what traps will affect him."

      "title": "Get good with bows and arrows.",
      "content": "Get good with bows and arrows. Killing with Bugbites is a great technique for fighting Herobrine. Get up a tree or in another safe location and then chip away at his health. You can also use the bows and arrows while fighting on foot: just keep moving!"

      "title": "Make a beacon",
      "content": "Make a beacon . Beacons will give you a benefit if you take on Herobrine in that area. When built to maximum strength, you can choose status effects that can help you defeat Herobrine with ease. The best choices would be either strength or resistance."

      "title": "Get and keep home-field advantage.",
      "content": "Get and keep home-field advantage. Never take on Herobrine in an area that you don't know well. You need to be able to run around and attack him without worrying about what's around you. You should also always have a plan. Know how you're going to use your environment. Basically, take the fight seriously and you'll already have an advantage."

      "title": "Rest easy.",
      "content": "Rest easy. Herobrine is not real, has never been real, and will never be real. Herobrine is a myth or urban legend among Minecraft players, used to scare new or young players. If you believe that Herobrine is real, someone tricked you. If you think you've seen Herobrine, you were mistaken or an admin on your server was playing a trick on you. You cannot get Herobrine in your game without modding the game. This of course also means that all the urban legends about what Herobrine can do to you in real life aren't true either. He won't come out of the computer and haunt you if you leave it on at night, etc, etc."

      "title": "Stop listening to trolls.",
      "content": "Stop listening to trolls. Many of the \"signs\" of Herobrine are easily faked. Don't take someone at their word that their game is unmodded. Don't get spooked if you see them in your own game either. Admins can change their skins, how their name displays, and do things like teleport to players and destroy vast areas in order to spook you. This is a sort of hazing or bullying and if someone tells you Herobrine is real, they aren't being very nice to you."

    {
      "title": "Look at the code.",
      "content": "Look at the code. The code of a game is like the game's DNA. Kind of like how you can't have wings because it's not in your DNA, a game can't have content that's not in the code. There's always a trail with code. Nothing can hide from people that know what they're doing. Do you think that if the character was really there, that someone wouldn't have proven it in the code by now? Herobrine can only appear through the use of mods, which introduce new code to the game."

      "title": "Listen to Notch.",
      "content": "Listen to Notch. Notch, the creator of the game, has stated on multiple occasions that Herobrine is not real and will not be real. [4] X Research source Since he makes a lot of his money from kids playing and loving the game, do you really think he'd add in something that would scare them away?"
