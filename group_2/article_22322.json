      "title": "Rest and immobilize the injured part.",
      "content": "Rest and immobilize the injured part. Muscle activity and movement can irritate and increase the pressure on the soft tissues, which can trigger an inflammatory response and make your hematoma worse. Maintain relative rest for the first 48 hours after injury, if at all possible. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Immobilization that keeps you in a normal anatomical position (lying on your back with the palms and feet pointing forward) is helpful in the healing process and may prevent further damage. This is especially true for the extremities and joint areas."

      "title": "Apply a cold compress immediately after the injury.",
      "content": "Apply a cold compress immediately after the injury. This should be done immediately and repeated every few hours for 48 hours after injury. Apply an ice pack to the affected area right after you notice a hematoma starting to develop. Low temperature reduces blood flow, decreasing bleeding. Remember not to hold the ice pack on the skin for more than 15-20 minutes to prevent tissue damage. Wrap the ice pack in a cloth to prevent ice burn. [2] X Research source The cold temperature causes constriction of the blood vessels and limits post-injury swelling and accumulation of blood underneath the skin. This can also prevent potential tissue damage due to decreased oxygen flow in the injured area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Elevate the site of the injury.",
      "content": "Elevate the site of the injury. This is especially helpful for extremities. Keeping the area in which the hematoma has occurred on an elevated surface will reduce blood flow to that specific area, minimizing swelling and keeping the hematoma from growing. [3] X Research source Use pillows or blankets to keep the area elevated. Keep the injured area above the level of the heart, if possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the affected area with a compression bandage to control swelling.",
      "content": "Wrap the affected area with a compression bandage to control swelling. Gently wrap an ACE or compression bandage around the injured area. Don't wrap it too tight! You want the bandage to rest firmly against your skin without cutting off circulation, causing tingling, or cutting into the skin. Too much compression can increase swelling around the hematoma and even make the bruising worse. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply a warm compress after 48 hours.",
      "content": "Apply a warm compress after 48 hours. Use a heat pack or a washcloth soaked in warm water. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In contrast with the cold compress, warm compresses are more beneficial in the recovery stage, because they dilate the blood vessels and improve circulation and delivery of nutrients necessary for repair. Much like a warm compress, a relaxing warm bath will also soothe pain and improve circulation in the area. The increased circulation caused by the warmth can help flush waste products from the injury, promoting faster healing. You may also find the warm sensation comforting if your injury is causing a lot of pain."

      "content": "Eat more protein. This may provide needed benefits for tissue repair. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source High levels of protein usually come from animal sources rather than plant sources. Here are some examples of healthy proteins that may promote healing: Whey protein Tuna Wild salmon Halibut Poached egg Turkey or chicken breast Cottage cheese"

      "content": "Get enough vitamin B12. A vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause easy bruising. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is especially true for vegetarians—plant food sources have no vitamin B12 unless they are fortified. If you're vegan or vegetarian, ask your doctor or nutritionist if you should take a vitamin B12 supplement. B12 is found naturally in a wide variety of animal foods including organ meats (beef liver), shellfish (clams), meat, poultry, eggs, milk and other dairy foods, some breakfast cereals, and nutritional yeasts."

Great sources of vitamin C include cantaloupe, citrus fruits, berries, watermelon, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, spinach, squash, tomatoes, and potatoes. [9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source As a rule, you can get enough vitamin C by eating a well-balanced diet.

      "title": "Make sure you get sufficient vitamin K.",
      "content": "Make sure you get sufficient vitamin K. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in adults. However, if you have it, it can result in impaired blood clotting and other bleeding problems, which can make hematomas worse. Vitamin K deficiency can be caused by medical conditions such as diabetes, celiac disease, and cystic fibrosis. Talk to your doctor if you suspect you may have a vitamin K deficiency. [10] X Research source Sources of dietary vitamin K include leafy greens (such as Swiss chard, kale, parsley, and spinach), broccoli, Brussels sprouts, green beans, avocados, and kiwi. Fermented dairy, including yogurt, cheeses, and fermented soy, including miso and natto, are also good sources of vitamin K."

      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated can improve circulation and help your body heal after an injury. [11] X Research source The amount of water that’s best for you will vary depending on your physical activity level, size, and overall health. In general, men should get about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) a day, and women should drink 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) daily. [12] X Research source Water is better than any other liquid you can drink. Unsweetened fruit juices and decaffeinated teas are okay and can be consumed safely in moderation, but the focus should be water. It is possible to drink too much water, so don’t force yourself to drink once your thirst has been quenched. Drinking too much can cause a dangerous electrolyte imbalance."

Here are the symptoms that often accompany your average hematoma: [18] X Research source Pain is one of the most common symptoms of a hematoma. It occurs because the tissue where the hematoma occurs is inflamed. If the tissue becomes flooded with blood, it will become inflamed, and will eventually swell. Redness of the area where a hematoma is formed is caused by the blood building up underneath the surface of the skin (subdermal hematoma), and because of inflammation. Severe internal hematomas may cause more serious symptoms, such as headache and confusion, unconsciousness, or weakness in the extremities. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. [19] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"
