Gently roll the origami paper into a cylinder shape, leaving a space in the middle if possible. It should look something like a small cardboard paper towel roll. This is your mold, and you'll use it to help roll the rest of the paper tubes needed to make a paper pistol. [2] X Research source It should be about the diameter of a pencil. If in trouble, you can even use a pen or pencil to help you get the shape right."

To create the second tube, roll a second piece of origami paper around the first tube you created. When the second paper is completely rolled up, gently slide the first tube out of your new tube. You will now have another tube, slightly bigger than your first. Like the first tube, this tube should something like a cardboard paper towel roll. [3] X Research source"

Place one piece of tape on either end of the tube to keep it together. Then, trim down the sides of the tube using your scissors. You want the sides to be smooth and even, with no awkward bits of paper slipping out on the sides. [4] X Research source"

Then, use scissors, a ruler, and a marker to cut your tubes into the following lengths. For the barrel: You need to have two 15cm tubes.

Stack all of the tubes on top of each other, then slightly offset them by moving the bottom ones to the right, diagonally (this mimics the shape of a normal pistol handle). Hot glue them, one on top of the other, together to make a long, thin handle for your gun. You can also glue them on straight, then cut one end of the handle diagonally, forming a slight angle. Trim down the angle with your scissors to smooth out the sides. [5] X Research source"

Roll up some paper (it is nice if you can use a different color) into round tubes just a bit thinner than your first set. These new ones need to be able to slide in and out of the older tubes. To get them thinner, roll them without the guide. You should also cut off the last 4-5\" triangular inches of paper as you're rolling the tubes to decrease the thickening paper in the center of the tube."

This will be your trigger -- when you pull the trigger back, this little extra bit should pop out the back of the trigger chamber. Make sure that the tube can slide freely back and forth.

You then hot glue it to the back of the handle, curving it around the front and under your trigger guard, if you have one. The goal is to close off all of the unnecessary openings in the tubes on the handle of the gun, but the essential one to close is the one right behind the trigger. DO NOT close up the trigger chamber. This needs to be open to load and fire the gun. In the end, you'll create an \"outline\" of sorts of the bottom of the gun. This is why using another color looks so good."

You will fold each smaller sheet using the following process: Fold the rectangle in half from top to bottom, creating a smaller, narrower rectangle. Then, unfold the paper. [9] X Research source Use the crease in the center of the paper as a guide. The paper is now in two halves. Fold one-half inward, so the end of the paper lines up with create. Then, fold the other half inward, so the end of the paper lines up with crease. The two ends of the paper should meet at the crease of the paper.

The bent down portion should have two small openings. Feed either end of the second strip through these openings.

If you do, try and stagger them a bit to make a \"hammer\" on your gun, or the small lever you see people pull back before shooting in movies.
