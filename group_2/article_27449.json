    {
      "title": "Start with a mug of milk or water.",
      "content": "Start with a mug of milk or water. Iced chocolate made with milk has a much richer flavor. You may use water instead, but it's not recommended unless you do not drink milk. You can experiment with various milk substitutes as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix in cocoa powder and sugar to taste.",
      "content": "Mix in cocoa powder and sugar to taste. Start with one teaspoon (5mL) of each ingredient and adjust from there. You may use baking cocoa or unsweetened cocoa powder. Dutch processed cocoa powder is less bitter, which most people prefer for drinking. You may replace both ingredients with a pre-made hot chocolate mix, but these mixes tend to have tons of sugar and almost no chocolate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Microwave for 30–45 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave for 30–45 seconds. Yes, this recipe is for iced chocolate. But in a cold liquid, cocoa powder and sugar tend to clump. Warm the liquid just enough to dissolve the powder with a quick stir."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chill for 30–60 minutes.",
      "content": "Chill for 30–60 minutes. Let it cool for a few minutes at room temperature, then move it to the fridge. Your chocolate should chill in about half an hour to an hour, depending on how cold your fridge is. You can put the drink in the freezer for 5–10 minutes instead, but remember to take it out before it freezes. It's best to move it a plastic container first, since mugs and glasses can crack with rapid chilling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add ice.",
      "content": "Add ice. Add a few ice cubes to keep it cold, then drink. If you want a slushy drink instead, blend it with the ice in a food processor or strong blender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover in toppings (optional).",
      "content": "Cover in toppings (optional). Try adding marshmallows, whipped cream, or cinnamon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make chocolate sauce (optional)",
      "content": "Make chocolate sauce (optional) . This part is a bit tricky, so there's no shame in starting with store-bought sauce instead. If you're up for making it yourself, browse your options here or try this simple recipe: Make a double boiler and pour a little water into the lower section. Combine 7 oz (200g) finely chopped chocolate (any type) and ½ cup (120mL) heavy cream in the top of the double boiler. This is enough to make plenty of leftovers. Bring to a simmer and stir constantly, until ingredients are mixed. If the chocolate loses its shine, reduce heat. If the sauce turns grainy, it's been overheated and is no longer usable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend together all ingredients.",
      "content": "Blend together all ingredients. Blend 1 tbsp (15mL) chocolate sauce, 1½ cups (360mL) milk, ¾ cup (180mL) vanilla or chocolate ice cream, and a generous scoop of crushed ice. To make an ice cream float instead of a thick, sludgy drink, add the ice cream after blending instead. If you don't have a blender, whisk the chocolate sauce into the milk and top with ice cream and crushed ice. Adjust the amounts however you like. Depending on the type and brand of chocolate, you may need to add more chocolate sauce."
    },
    {
      "title": "Serve with toppings.",
      "content": "Serve with toppings. Serve in a long glass with a straw and spoon. Optionally, add a drizzle of chocolate sauce on top, chopped nuts, or other ice cream toppings."
