      "title": "Take note if your cat develops a potbelly.",
      "content": "Take note if your cat develops a potbelly. A cat with a heavy worm burden (which means that they have a lot of worms ), tends to have a potbelly but little fat cover over the spine or pelvis. A typical potbelly looks like a swollen tummy, round and full, and often the swelling is carried down low on the cat's body (the cat may even look pregnant). [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source The difference between a potbelly and a fat cat is the rest of the cat’s body is also in poor condition. Roundworms are the most common cause of a potbelly, though other worms can also cause this symptom."

      "title": "Check your cat’s body for fat pads.",
      "content": "Check your cat’s body for fat pads. When you run your fingers over a healthy cat’s backbone, you will most likely be able to feel bumps along the spine, but should not be able to feel sharp, angular bones. This is because there is a fat padding over the cat’s bones. Cats that have a lot of worms will not have these fat pads. When you stroke the cat’s back and pelvis, you may find that you can feel each sharp, angular bone. Body \"condition\" is a matter of assessing the fat cover over the cat’s bones. Landmarks such as the spine, hips, and pelvis are especially useful for this."

      "title": "Look at the condition of your cat’s coat.",
      "content": "Look at the condition of your cat’s coat. Intestinal parasites steal much of the nutrition out of the cat's diet. This means that your cat does not get the vitamins, minerals, and proteins that they need to maintain a healthy coat. Check your cat for: [2] X Research source A dull coat. A coat that lacks any sort of gloss. A matted coat."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention if your cat experiences vomiting or diarrhea.",
      "content": "Pay attention if your cat experiences vomiting or diarrhea . Worms can physically irritate the stomach and intestinal lining, causing diarrhea and vomiting. A very high worm burden can physically obstruct the bowel and cause profound vomiting that is potentially life threatening. Cats can even vomit up a bundle of worms which look like squirming spaghetti. [3] X Research source If your cat begins vomiting uncontrollably, bring him or her to the veterinary clinic immediately."

      "title": "Look at your cat’s gum color.",
      "content": "Look at your cat’s gum color. Some worms, especially hookworms, can make your cat’s gut bleed, which can result in slow but steady blood loss. This blood loss can lead to anemia , making your cat sluggish and weak if it is severe enough. In kittens it can be deadly. [4] X Research source You can recognize anemia by lifting you cat’s lip and looking at her gums. If your cat’s gums are healthy, they should be pink in color. If the cat is anemic, the gums will be white, grey, or a washed-out pink."

      "title": "Pay attention to signs of worms in kittens.",
      "content": "Pay attention to signs of worms in kittens. Kittens with worm infections tend to be lethargic and fail to thrive. This means that they do not grow as well as their other litter mates. They are smaller, less vigorous, have dull coats, potbellies, and less fat over their ribs and backbone. If you do not have other kittens for comparison, this can be difficult to assess but a fit, healthy kitten should be bright, playful, plump, and should have a soft, glossy coat. Heavy worm burdens in a kitten can have life-long ramifications causing ill health throughout its life."

      "title": "Check your cat for fleas.",
      "content": "Check your cat for fleas . This is relevant because fleas carry tapeworm eggs. When a cat grooms itself, it may eat fleas infesting its coat, which allows the tapeworm eggs to enter into the cat's system. [5] X Research source It may be easier to look for flea dirt, rather than the fleas themselves. Flea dirt is dried blood excreted by the flea and is often present in the coat of infested animals. To look for flea dirt brush a section of the coat in the wrong direction and look for small dark dots near the base of your cat's hairs. To check that the specks you find are flea dirt rather than just dust or dander, take a damp piece of white tissue and place the dirt on it. Because flea dirt is dried blood, when it comes into contact with the moisture the dirt will leave a red or orange stain. If you find fleas or flea dirt you need to treat the cat for the fleas and the environment (ie the house and bedding material) to rid the cat and home of fleas."

      "title": "Look for migrating tapeworm egg packs.",
      "content": "Look for migrating tapeworm egg packs. Look under your cat's tail. Tapeworm egg packets migrate out of the cat's anus and get stuck around the fur near the rectum. The egg packets are a creamy-white color and are variously described as looking like rice grains, cucumber pips, or sesame seeds. [7] X Research source Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Canine and Feline Infectious Diseases and Parasitology. 2nd edition. Wiley-Blackwell The egg packets may also get stuck to the cat's bedding, so have a quick look at your cat’s bedding as well. If you find these, take your cat to its veterinarian to get treated for tapeworm."

      "title": "Check your cat's feces for tapeworms.",
      "content": "Check your cat's feces for tapeworms. This is much easier to do if your cat uses a litter tray. Examine the feces for the presence of worms. Sometimes these are visible on the surface of the stool, but more likely you will need to put on plastic gloves and use a disposable tool to break the pellet open and look for worms inside. Tapeworms are a creamy white color, flat, and segmented. They average around 4 to 28 inches in length. Dipylidium caninum : The cat can get this type of tapeworm by eating fleas infected with tapeworm eggs. [8] X Research source Taenia taeniaeformis : Cats can get this type of tapeworm when they hunt, catch and eat rodents infected with this kind of tapeworm. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Recognize roundworms.",
      "content": "Recognize roundworms. Roundworms are very common and look like spaghetti or noodles. On average they are two to four inches long, but can grow up to five inches in length. There are two different kinds of roundworms, both of which can be picked up in different ways: [10] X Research source Toxocara cati : These worms can be picked up via the mother's milk, and most kittens are infected at birth. These are commonly responsible for pot-bellied kittens, and cause vomiting and diarrhea. Toxascaris leonine : These roundworms are acquired from contact with infected cat or rodent feces. The worm is sometimes vomited up whole, or passed out in the stool."

      "title": "Identify hookworms.",
      "content": "Identify hookworms. Hookworms are small (0.5 to 1 centimeter), curly worms that have a hook-like mouth. They are very hard to see with the naked eye. Ancylostoma duodenalis can be found in a mother cat’s milk, though kittens can also be infected by this kind of worm by walking on soiled, infected bedding. [11] X Research source The tooth-like mouth parts attach to the lining of the small intestine and release an anticoagulant that causes blood seepage into the gut. Infected kittens tend to be anemic, lacking in energy, and grow poorly."

      "title": "Ask your vet to check your cat for heartworms.",
      "content": "Ask your vet to check your cat for heartworms. Heartworms are much more common in dogs than in cats. That said, it is still possible for cats to become infected. This sort of worm is found in blood vessels rather than in the intestine, which means that you will have to get a vet to check your cat for these types of worms. [12] X Research source Dirofilaria immitis : Infected mosquitoes can transfer dirofilaria eggs into your cat’s bloodstream. The signs are nonspecific such as lack of energy, weight loss, and a cough. Sadly, some cats show no symptoms and die suddenly, because of a blockage in a main blood vessel to the heart."

      "content": "Have your vet take a fecal sample for analysis. The best way to check for worms (excluding heartworms) before they become a huge health liability is to take a fresh fecal (stool) sample to your veterinarian’s office. Adult worm will lay eggs while living in the cat’s intestinal tract. These eggs will frequently (but not always) be passed in the stool and can be seen after special preparation and examination under a microscope. [13] X Research source Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Canine and Feline Infectious Diseases and Parasitology. 2nd edition. Wiley-Blackwell The eggs of different worms have a different physical appearance which aids in their identification. If the examination of your cat and its feces proves fruitless, this does not mean that your cat does not have worms. It merely means that no worms were passed out of its body. Some cats can harbor large amounts of worms and not pass any out. The only way to be certain is to collect a fecal sample to take to your vet for analysis.
