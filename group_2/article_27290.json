      "content": "Find small, good quality images without any text or writing on them. The images should be sharp and clear, not blurry or pixelated. The image should be no larger than the palm of your hand. It can be its own, contained image, or part of a larger picture. This method will also work on other types of paper as well, such as printed images, photographs, scrapbook paper, or even wrapping paper."

      "content": "Paste the cut out image onto a sheet of cardstock. Place the image a sheet of scrap paper, image-side down. Cover the entire back of the image with glue. Then, flip the picture over and press it against a sheet of cardstock. Smooth the image out to get rid of any bubbles or wrinkles. The best type of glue for this would be a glue stick. You can also use rubber cement or spray adhesive. If you are using liquid glue, apply a thin layer of white or clear-drying glue using a paint brush."

      "content": "Cut out the pasted image. If your image has an irregular shape, such as a rolling pin, you can follow the original shape. You can also cut a new shape around it, such as a square or circle. The original color of the cardstock will be part of your gift tag design. If your image is square-shaped, consider cutting it out using a pair of zigzag scissors."

You can decorate it however you want, but consider matching it to the gift bag, the holiday or event, or to the recipient's personal tastes. For example, if you know the gift recipient really likes cats, consider drawing a cat on the tag. Here are some more decorating ideas to get you started: Draw designs with metallic pens or glitter glue. Glue on small rhinestones or sequins. Stick on some washi tape around the edges of a square or rectangular card to give it a fancy border. Attach stickers that match the holiday, season, or event. For example, if the tag is for a birthday gift, you can use candle- or balloon-shaped stickers."

Attach it to the tag using a small piece of foam mounting tape; this will help give it that 3D or layered effect. You can match the smaller shape to the larger one, or use a contrasting shape. For example, if your tag is square-shaped, you can make the smaller shape a heart."
