      "content": "Mix vinegar and baking soda for regular cleaning. These two common household items are not only useful in the kitchen but also make excellent natural cleaners. By thoroughly sprinkling baking soda into your toilet bowl, then pouring a small amount of vinegar over it, you can make a cleaning paste that eliminates grime. [1] X Research source Since vinegar is acidic and baking soda is basic, when used together, they react to form carbon dioxide bubbles that can lift away grime. This is a simple reaction that won’t leave behind any harmful chemicals. [2] X Research source Avoid vinegar types that are not clear in color since they can cause stains. [3] X Research source Baking soda is especially useful for eliminating odors in the bathroom since it absorbs smells from both water and the air. You can also use it in other places in your home when you need a natural deodorizer. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use vinegar and borax for even deeper cleaning. Although baking soda is good enough to offer a thorough cleaning on its own, borax shares baking soda’s basic pH level, but can break down grime even more easily. You can use it in the same way as baking soda—just sprinkle the borax throughout your toilet bowl, then drizzle vinegar over it. [5] X Research source When exposed to water, borax turns into hydrogen peroxide, which will naturally whiten surfaces. Even though it isn’t a harsh chemical, borax can be dangerous when ingested, so be careful to keep it out of the reach of children and pets. [6] X Research source"

For added convenience, you can then transfer this mixture into a spray bottle before using it on all your toilet and bathroom surfaces. [7] X Research source While you should clean your toilet regularly, disinfecting it can be done less often. Cleaning removes dirt, grime, and other substances, while disinfection is used to eliminate all germs. [8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Instead of rubbing alcohol, you can also use more concentrated isopropyl alcohol. If you do so, wear gloves for safety. Prolonged contact with skin can cause irritation. If you end up spilling isopropyl alcohol on your bare skin, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. [9] X Research source Baking soda, borax, and vinegar do have disinfectant properties, but you’ll have to turn to rubbing or isopropyl alcohol in order to eliminate as many germs as possible while still using natural and safe products.

You might need to use a lot of vinegar! Let the mixture sit for about 12 hours while it dissolves mildew, rust, and mineral deposits. Then, flush the toilet a couple of times to drain the vinegar and water.

To drain the tank, you’ll first have to turn off the water supply valve, located on the wall behind your toilet. Flush in order to empty the tank, then use a toilet bowl scrubber or steel wool to scrub the tank. Any grime should come off easily after having been loosened by the vinegar. [20] X Research source"
