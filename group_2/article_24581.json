      "content": "The game of jinx may have been inspired by a 1940s children’s game. Although the precise origins of “jinx” are uncertain, it’s believed that the Jinx game replaced the pre-existing playground favorite known as “Needles and Pins” in the 1940s. It originally consisted of a wishing ritual in which two children unintentionally said the same word at the same time, locked pinkies, and repeated the following chant: “Needles and pins, needles and pins, when a man marries, his trouble begins.” [1] X Research source In the early-mid 20th century, folklorists Peter and Iona Opie witnessed two children accidentally say the same thing at the same time, immediately stop what they were doing, and enter into a kind of silent ritual. [2] X Research source While the ritual varied regionally, one rule remained consistent: the word or phrase said in unison must be unplanned, adding to the element of superstition. Variations of the game following the silent ritual include pinching, punching, and demanding that the “jinxed” person or “jinxee” give them a treat. The shift in dynamics from a wholesome wishing ritual to a competitive struggle for dominance may reflect the rising global tensions of the 1940s."

      "content": "The origin of the word “jinx” dates back to the 17th century. The term “jinx” has origins in the 1690s, in reference to the jynx wryneck bird that was used in witchcraft rituals. It appeared in its modern form in a 1910 short story about a cursed baseball team by Allen Sangree, titled, “The Jinx.” In a 1911 edition of “Technical World Magazine,” the jinx came up again in reference to baseball: “Most mysterious of all in the psychics of baseball is the ‘jinx,’ that peculiar ‘hoodoo’ which affects, at times, a man, at other times a whole team.” [3] X Research source These are some of the earliest references to a jinx being a curse or hex on a person or group, which later transformed into the childhood game that temporarily “cursed” the jinxee. Other sources suggest that “jinx” made its way into the culture via popular figures of the 19th century, including the American vaudeville song, “Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines” and an 1887 musical comedy titled, Little Puck . [4] X Research source In Little Puck , a character named Jinks Hoodoo is introduced, described as “a curse to everybody, including himself.” Over time, “jinx” became synonymous with “bad luck.”"

      "title": "“Jinx, you owe me a soda!”",
      "content": "“Jinx, you owe me a soda!” This is the most modern and perhaps the most well-known iteration of the jinx game. It begins when two people accidentally utter the same word or phrase at the same time. Then, one of them says, “Jinx” while the other remains silent, if they choose to follow the rules. The jinxer then exclaims, “You owe me a soda!” [5] X Research source Whether the jinxee agrees to treat the jinxer to a soda is up to them. Generally, however, the fun is in acquiring the jinxing power—not the prize."

      "title": "“Jinx! Pinch, poke, you owe me a Coke.”",
      "content": "“Jinx! Pinch, poke, you owe me a Coke.” This is a more playfully aggressive and specific version of, “Jinx, you owe me a soda!” This rendition of the jinx game begins as expected, when two people say the same word in unison without meaning to. Then, the jinxer may pinch and/or poke the jinxee while they stay silent. Finally, they finish the phrase and demand a Coke in exchange for the jinxee’s “freedom.” Another variation is, “Jinx! You owe me a Coke!” The Coca-Cola company registered “Coke” as a trademark in 1945, at around the same time that jinx began making its rounds in schoolyards and playgrounds. [6] X Research source The “Coke” may have been added in not only due to its growing popularity but because it rhymed perfectly with “poke.”"

      "title": "“Jinx! You can’t speak until I say your name.”",
      "content": "“Jinx! You can’t speak until I say your name.” In this version of the game, the same word is simultaneously spoken by two people. The jinxer shouts “jinx” and then informs the jinxee that they are not allowed to speak until their name is said a certain number of times. The kindest jinxers will stop at one, while more mischievous jinxers may only “free” the jinxee when their name is repeated 10+ times."

      "content": "“Jinx! The soda machine is out of order, please insert another quarter.” Rhyming is often a major element in children’s games and this rendition of jinx proves it. A more elaborate, sing-song version of “Jinx, you owe me a soda,” this request for a fizzy drink is veiled in fun language. The effect does not change the outcome, however: the jinxee owns the jinxer a soda. Another version of this turn of phrase is, “Jinx! The jinx machine is out of order. Please insert another quarter.” In this case of jinx, the request is for money, not a soda."

      "title": "“Jinx!”",
      "content": "“Jinx!” On the playground, the game of jinx may be used for kids to embarrass one another. So, if two kids say the same word at the same time, the jinxer will say, “Jinx!” Afterward, when the jinxee is silent, the jinxer may command the jinxee to say any variety of colorful gibberish in order to be “freed.” One seemingly popular response is, “Jinkle pink pickle jinx, I love you.” [7] X Research source Many kids of a certain age might find saying “I love you” to be humiliating, surrendering to the power of the jinxer."

      "content": "“Jinx! Let’s lock pinkies and make a wish.” This dates back to the behaviors that Peter and Iona Opie observed among children. After two kids say the same phrase at the same time, one or both shout, “Jinx!” Then, they interlock their pinkies and make a wish. It echoes the innocent wishing rituals of the 1940s, before the Jinx game as we know it took over. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "After two people say the same thing in unison, the first to shout “jinx” wins. In case there’s a tie, the participants must go on to say \"double jinx,\" \"triple jinx,\" and so on until there is a clear winner. After a winner is determined, they then become the jinxer and they decide what comes next. They may ask for anything from a Coke to a quarter, and the jinxee has to remain silent until they’ve satisfied the jinxer and “broken” their jinx. [9] X Research source The word or words said in unison must be actual words; burps and other bodily sounds don’t count. Remember: the word or phrase spoken at the same time has to be accidental. The rules to playing Jinx are generally the same up until the jinxer makes their demands. Here is the point in the game where different versions come into play."
