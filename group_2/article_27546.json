      "content": "Switch up your style or appearance. New hair, new you! Get a trim, and ask the barber what sort of cut they recommend for your face. Or, hit the mall or the thrift store and grab a new outfit (or 3). Often, changing your appearance is a shortcut to feeling reinvigorated and refreshed. Dye your hair , or use temporary dyes to switch up your hair color as often as you want. Get a tattoo or a piercing. They’re more permanent than a haircut, but a tattoo can be a fun way to document your values, friendships, or milestones. Be sure you consider carefully what you want and shop around for the best artist."

Life often feels drab when we stay firmly in our comfort zones, which often isn’t actually very comfortable. Think of something that other people enjoy, but which doesn’t quite appeal to you, and try it anyway to bust out of that comfort zone ! Try a new sport, a new cuisine, a new class, caring for a new (and easy) pet, a new hobby (photography, painting, sculpting, collecting). The options are limitless! Recovery coach Kamila Tan adds, “I always encourage clients to open their minds and hearts, skip any judgment about a new experience before it happens, and then decide which of those new experiences they want to incorporate into their lives.”"

If you and your partner don't have a date night at all, set aside time each week to be together doing things you love; it can help strengthen your relationship. [2] X Research source If you do have a regular date night, but it’s become a predictable routine (dinner and a movie, anyone?), go somewhere unfamiliar or try something new together to shake things up. Do something outside your normal routine; consider taking dancing lessons, going rock climbing, taking a couples' painting class, or even just trying a new recipe together. If you’re single, consider mingling at local singles’ nights, hopping on the dating apps, or just talking to someone you like. A relationship—even a casual one—can add that special something back to your daily life."

      "content": "Make new friends, and be more spontaneous with old ones. Sometimes we get too into the “roles” of our friendships that they become stale, or we forget that there are always new and exciting people waiting to enter our lives, if we just look for them. But studies show that lively and intimate platonic relationships help combat depression and ward off stress and disappointment. [3] X Research source If your conversations or time spent with your current friends is stale, invite them somewhere exciting to make new memories to talk about. Catch a great concert, set fitness goals together (for instance, to train for a marathon), or learn a new hobby or skill together to give you more great topics for conversation. Also, try to coordinate small activities on short notice to make things more exciting. Call up your friend right now and ask if they want to grab lunch! Make new friends by hanging out in places relevant to your interests, like a local gym if you're into fitness, or art galleries if you’re a creative."

      "content": "Shake up your work routine, or even your career. Work comprises the majority of our waking hours during the week, and tweaking how you spend those hours can dramatically shift your routine. Try a new route or mode of transportation for your commute, ask if you can work at a different desk or at home, or even ask for a new assignment or learn a new field within your company. [4] X Research source If your job is the main culprit in your feelings of repetitiveness, consider looking for new employment that might be more fulfilling. Take an online career aptitude test to see what you're well-suited for, then start looking in your area for a new position. Think about what types of careers might be more interesting and offer more opportunities for different experiences each day. Of course, be sure you don't quit your current job until you have something else lined up in writing, or else you might end up out of work."

There are a million different ways to live a single day, even if your schedule is mostly the same from one day to the next. For example: Get up an hour earlier than you normally do and go for a run or a walk outside. This helps your mood, can alleviate your anxiety, boost your immune system, and let you enjoy the best part of the day as you move.

Sticking to the same haunts every weekend is dull and prevents you from meeting new people and trying new things. Pick up a new hobby or art form.

Move your furniture into new configurations. A new view from the couch can shift your perspective and lend a sense of freshness to a room. Paint your walls to alter the general mood of your home. Cool blues and greens are often refreshing and soothing, while warm reds or yellows are comforting and cozy. Declutter your space to help you also declutter your mind.

Having a list of all the things you’d like to do, big or small, gives you something to look to for inspiration any time you’re stuck in a rut. Jot down anything and everything you’ve always wanted to try, from picking up that niche hobby to traveling the world, then place it somewhere you can see it every day. [7] X Research source Make sure your list includes some easy things as well as more difficult ones, and some free or cheap things as well as things that cost money. This gives you fun things to do now, plus things to work toward. Include things like places to visit, things to see, experiences to have, achievements you like to make, people you'd like to meet, things you'd like to experience with a friend or loved one, and skills you'd like to learn. Do 1 thing on your list every month. If you're feeling ambitious, up it to every week. By adding in a totally new experience every month, you automatically keep life from being too overly repetitive."

Even the smallest things come with questions to explore. Look around you and start asking “Why?” and “How?” then turn to the internet or a local library to find answers. There’s always something to explore! For example: What sort of birds frequent your area? What do they eat? What’s their life cycle? What’s the history of the land on which you live? Who lived there 10, 100, or even 1,000 years ago? How do stoplights know when to change? Why are streets designed the way they are? Who decides where new roads go? etc."

For example, maybe there’s a new coffee shop on the corner; a friend moved to a new apartment that you visit; you’ve spent time with a new book, album, or game; you’ve been thinking about new ideas, etc. Consider the seasons, as well, which are closely tied with our lifestyles and emotions.
