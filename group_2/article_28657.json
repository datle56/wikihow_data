      "title": "Choose a time when they’re likely to be free.",
      "content": "Choose a time when they’re likely to be free. It’s best to make your move in the evening, around 7-11 p.m. on weekends, or an hour or so earlier on weeknights. They probably won’t be able to drop everything for a hookup in the middle of the workday, and the morning usually isn’t the sexiest time. But also, if you make the call too late, they might sleep right through it. Or, if they work odd hours, make sure you’re aware of their schedule."

      "content": "Ease into the big question with some flirty conversation. Just dropping a “Come over” might work sometimes, but mostly it’s a little low-effort and not super appealing. Instead, dating coach John Keegan suggests sending a casual, flirty text to establish the mood and signal your intentions. That way, if they’re not in the mood, things are a little less awkward if it doesn’t work out. Just remember you’re not here to chat, so keep it brief. For example, you might open with: “Hey, you just crossed my mind and now I’m wondering what you’re up to?” or, “Got any plans tonight? Want any?” If you want to keep it coy, talk about your night and say that you're now relaxing at home. See how they answer and then take the conversation the way you intended to."

      "title": "Invite them over, or to somewhere private.",
      "content": "Invite them over, or to somewhere private. Booty call courtesy says that the caller usually hosts, but your circumstances might be different and you might ask to go to their place. [1] X Research source Whatever the case, make the question casual and low-stakes, but make it clear what you’re looking for, and that you’re looking for it sooner rather than later. Also, even though it’s a booty “call,” we recommend asking over text, which is more casual and takes some pressure off both of you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect their answer if they decline.",
      "content": "Respect their answer if they decline. At this point, the other person may accept or reject the booty call. If they accept, great! If they decline, respect that choice—no means no. It’s also possible for the other person to misunderstand you. While statements such as “Let’s hang out at my place,” or “I want to have some fun,” may imply casual sex, if the other person is not on the same page, respect that. Also, don’t take it too hard, or too personally. Sex is just sex, but it’s still more than grabbing coffee, and a lot to ask of someone. Brush it off with something like, “No problem, I totally understand. Enjoy your night!” or, “Couldn’t hurt to try, but I get it. Stay safe out there!”"

      "title": "Set the mood with some music or a movie.",
      "content": "Set the mood with some music or a movie. Once they’ve arrived, turn on some seductive, or at least low-key, music to make things more comfortable. Or, you might have a movie or TV show playing to add a little ambience and background noise, making things even more casual. Turn the lights down low and consider lighting some candles, if you want to go the extra mile. Remember though: stay laid-back and easygoing! This is fun, not romance. [2] X Research source Also, if you’re hosting, make sure your place is tidied up, and don’t forget to hop into the shower, yourself! Even if you’re not totally grimy, it doesn’t hurt to be as fresh as possible."

    {
      "title": "Make sure you both know your intentions and boundaries.",
      "content": "Make sure you both know your intentions and boundaries. Once you’ve settled in, and before you make your move, make sure you have consent. Even if you were obvious about the purpose of the call, it might’ve gone over their head. Also, make sure they know that this is a casual thing, and not a committed relationship. For example, say, “I’m so glad you could make it. The bathroom’s down the hall, if you need to get ready. I’ll be waiting here in the bedroom,” which gets the message across pretty clearly."

      "title": "Arrange a ride home for them, or get home yourself afterward.",
      "content": "Arrange a ride home for them, or get home yourself afterward. Spending the night is a slippery slope—waking up in each other’s arms is a recipe for unwanted feelings. Once things are through, call them a ride home, offer to drive them home yourself, or get on your own way. [3] X Research source If that’s not possible, offer them the bed, and sleep on the couch or in a different room to give them some privacy. Don’t rush them! Bask in the afterglow, maybe watch an episode of a TV show, or have a light conversation before you bring up parting ways. You might say, “You’re so much fun to spend time with, and I’d love to see you again. For now, let’s make sure you get home safe…”"

      "title": "Send a flirty, open-ended, and no-pressure message.",
      "content": "Send a flirty, open-ended, and no-pressure message. Keegan recommends keeping your booty call message open-ended, but suggestive enough that the other person gets the idea. Tell them you’re free at the moment, hint at what you want, and ask what they’re doing, like, “Hey, just lying in bed right now, trying to cool off. What are you up to?” Here are some other ideas: Keegan suggests making a joke, like: “Definitely not booty calling you right now. I would never. But if you wanted this to be a booty call, it could be. But it’s not. Yet.” “It’s been a weird night, but having you here with me would make it better.” “I was thinking I might hit this party tonight, but wanted to see if you had any better ideas.” “My roommate’s gone tonight, and I’m hoping to take advantage of that. Want to help?” “I did almost everything on my to-do list today. Want to come help with the last thing?” “I ordered a bit too much take-out. You could come help me finish it, then see where things go from there?” “I’ve been wanting to watch this movie, but it wouldn’t feel right without someone to hold.” “I’ve been thinking about you all day, and there’s only one way to get you out of my head.”"

      "content": "Don’t booty call someone you spend a lot of time with. This means coworkers, regular platonic friends, or even just the barista at your regular coffee shop. Regular booty calls are a relationship dynamic of their own, and have a tendency to muddy the waters of other relationships, so it’s best to have a dedicated friends-with-benefits situation for your booty calls. [4] X Research source This is where dating and hookup apps come in handy. They’re great ways to meet like-minded people and form relationships around sex as something fun and low stakes."

Take it from us: A booty call is not the place to find a fulfilling relationship, or even a significant emotional connection. Those things might blossom, but 9 times out of 10, you’ll be disappointed if that’s what you’re looking for. Before you reach for the phone, ask yourself: Am I doing this for fun, or am I hoping something deeper might happen? [5] X Research source If your answer is the latter, spend the evening with friends or go out somewhere, like to a movie, then see how you feel afterward."

The other person most likely isn’t looking to get serious, so don’t booty call someone who you want to be serious with. That’s a situation where you want to ask for a date , not a hookup. And definitely don’t get clingy or jealous—it’s just sex! [7] X Research source Also, don’t booty call the ex, which is just asking for trouble. Some of us can have casual sex with old flames, but mostly it just leads to choppy emotional waters. There are plenty of other fish in the sea!"

[8] X Research source If the other person insists on not using protection, that’s a red flag, and we suggest ending the hookup then and there."

      "content": "Communicate your needs and boundaries. You don’t have to sign a contract or anything, but it is a good idea to make things clear before you get down to business. Let the other person know that you’re not looking for a serious relationship, aren’t trying to catch feelings, and that this is only for fun. That way, you both know what you’re in for, and can dip on the arrangement at any time without guilt. [9] X Research source For example, say, “I’m glad we could keep things casual like this.

Smile, stay casual and not too serious, and ask them questions about themself to get to know them. [13] X Research source Giving a slick compliment is always a great way to both signal your intentions and get conversation going. You might compliment their outfit, their hair, their voice, or anything else that strikes you. Be sure to also compliment their personality, once you’ve chatted a little bit."
