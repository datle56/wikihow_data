      "content": "Sign your dog up for basic obedience training. Before your dog can be considered for a commercial, it is crucial that it attends obedience classes. These introductory courses teach dogs basic compliance to commands telling them to sit, stand, down, stay in position, and come when called. Make sure to choose a trainer approved by the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT), listed on the council's website at http://www.ccpdt.org ."

      "content": "Teach your dog hand signals. Hand signals can be useful for a dog to follow on-set, when verbal cues may not be possible. To teach your dog basic hand signals, use cues (with the influence of treats) that will then become the hand signals. For instance, teach a dog the \"down\" hand command by holding a treat in front of its nose and drawing it down towards the ground, having the dog follow it. After repetition of this exercise (varying between dogs), the motion itself will serve as the command and it will be clearly understood by your pet. Other hand signals to try include: [1] X Research source \"Sit\" \"Stand\" \"Heel\" \"Spin\" \"Go to your crate\""

      "content": "Book an \"animal acting\" class. To really solidify your dog's training, consider signing it up for an acting class to learn entertainment industry tricks like finding a mark on the set floor, cocking its head, and waving its paw. Classes are offered by some dog training venues and pet agencies, and can be a costly investment in your dog's acting career. Look online for courses available in your area. [3] X Research source For instance, the Hollywood Paws agency in Los Angeles, California offers introductory, intermediate, and advanced courses in animal acting. Each level costs $995.00 and is comprised on 6 courses (totalling 7.5 hours)."

If your dog is not familiar or comfortable with the experience, bring it to the groomer's for a quick visit where it does not receive any actual treatments to get it used to the sounds, tools, and overall environment of the establishment. When you return, be sure to bring treats to reward it for good behaviour. [4] X Research source"

These distractions could include big bright lights, noise, and harried people milling around. Get your dog used to this type of atmosphere by bringing it to equally distracting places when permitted, such as: [5] X Research source Dog-friendly cafes or restaurants Pet stores (like Petsmart or Petco) Hardware stores (like Home Depot or Lowes) [6] X Research source Evening softball or soccer games at a local park"

      "content": "Introduce your dog to new people. In preparation for the potential experience of filming a commercial, have your dog meet and interact with new people as much as possible. Socialization may ease its trepidation around strangers, and this comfort will make your dog more composed and comfortable on a commercial shoot. Be sure to assess the comfort level of individuals with your dog before prompting it to be friendly to them. It is your job as your dog's owner to protect it in social situations. If someone gets too close or behaves inappropriately to your dog (e.g. aggressive teasing), correct the human and ask them to back away from your pet. This will show your dog that it's being protected, and doesn't need to protect itself or you by getting aggressive."

While having an agent is not necessary to get your dog into a commercial, it can help to facilitate connections between dog owners and producers, as well as other entertainment industry professionals. Look online for pet agencies near you, or for an agency that you'd be willing to travel to.

For a direct approach, look for online ads for TV commercial casting calls near you and respond by email, adding a few pictures of your dog if possible. For instance, visit http://www.auditionsfree.com/tag/dog-auditions/ for auditions being held in your area that might apply to your dog. Sites like Craiglist might also offer opportunities for your dog to act in a commercial, albeit a smaller, lower budget one (e.g. an ad for a small, local business)."
