When you are having a conversation with a friend, you are likely using your chest voice to speak to them. Head voice: The higher register of your voice when you are speaking or singing. Some people speak in their head voice when they are nervous or speaking to strangers. There's also a kind of voice in-between those two types, called mixed voice. It is a softer version of the chest and a fuller version of the head, and it can be used as a transition between the two types."

When singing in your head voice, you shouldn't have strain at all. Your head voice should be light and lifted."
