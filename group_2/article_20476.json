      "content": "Apply for your license at any age. Since you will not be driving while you possess a NY non-driver’s ID, you can apply at any age. You’re legally allowed to obtain a non-driver’s ID if your driver’s license has been revoked or suspended, although you’ll need to hand over your suspended ID with your application. [2] X Research source Children under the age of 16 will need the permission of a parent or guardian to apply for a NY ID card. If you’re 16 or younger, your parents need to accompany you to the DMV office. If you’re under 16 and mailing in your learner’s permit to exchange it for a non-driver’s ID, your parent or legal guardian will need to fill out the “Parent/Guardian Consent” section on the MV-44 form."

If your driver’s license has expired (or been suspended or revoked) and you’re exchanging it for a non-driver’s ID, you can mail in your application. You’ll need to include the MV-44 application form and a check made out to the “Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.” You do not need to include your expired or revoked driver’s license. [3] X Research source Mailing in your application materials is more convenient (no long DMV lines). However, paperwork can always be lost or delayed in the mail. Add 3 or 4 days processing time for the envelope to make its way to the DMV. The application will be processed at the normal speed once it’s in-hand at the DMV, but you’ll also need to wait for the non-driver’s ID to be mailed back to you. You can also mail in the application if you’re exchanging your NY learner’s permit for a non-driver’s ID."

Only US citizens and documented US residents can apply for a non-driver’s ID. If you were not born in the United States, you should bring another type of document that shows your legal resident status. If you have misplaced your birth certificate or SSN card, you can apply for replacement documents for a small fee.
