      "content": "Stand in front of a mirror to practice. It is important that you can see how the trick appears to your audience, so you can get a feel the angle at which you need to hold your thumbs so they are partially hidden."

      "title": "Hold your left hand out with the palm facing you.",
      "content": "Hold your left hand out with the palm facing you. This means your left thumb is resting against the side of your hand that is pointed to the sky, and the back of your hand is facing your audience. Imagine where your audience will be standing (preferably directly in front of you), and be careful not to angle your hand so they can see behind your palm."

      "title": "Bend your left thumb back toward your body.",
      "content": "Bend your left thumb back toward your body. Your thumb should be bent at a 90° angle, with only the bottom half (the half below your knuckle) visible to someone standing directly in front of you."

      "content": "Bend your right thumb at a 90° angle and lay it on the side of your left hand so that the knuckles of your thumbs are touching. It should appear as though you have one very long thumb--the left thumb providing the part below the knuckle, and your right hand making up the part above the knuckle, or the part with the nail.

      "title": "Slide your right thumb to the right, along the length of your left hand.",
      "content": "Slide your right thumb to the right, along the length of your left hand. Your index and middle fingers will naturally move with your thumb. It will look like the tip of your left thumb has detached and you are pulling it apart. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Practice this movement until it feels comfortable and fluid.",
      "content": "Practice this movement until it feels comfortable and fluid. You may find you have to adjust the angle of at which you bend your thumbs for it to look convincing. If you are left handed, the trick is exactly the same, just reverse it so your right thumb is the bottom of the thumb and your left thumb makes the tip."

      "title": "Learn a little finesse to hide the process from the audience.",
      "content": "Learn a little finesse to hide the process from the audience. Once you've got the basic movement mastered, you need to learn how to move in and out of the trick with some smooth movements, instead of just clearly setting up the trick before your audience's eyes.
