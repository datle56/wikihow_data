      "content": "Lure a villager child and an Iron Golem into a lava-filled hole. Iron Golems like giving children flowers, so spawn an Iron Golem and a villager child, but before you do, make a deep 1x3 hole with lava in the bottom and put a pumpkin behind it. The child will be attracted to the pumpkin and run for it, making it fall into the hole. The Iron Golem will chase it, and it too will fall."

      "content": "Zombies go after villagers at night. When zombies see a villager, they automatically try to kill it. Sometimes, they even form zombie groups that attack villages. These zombie attacks are called “zombie sieges”. Remember, you can't spawn zombies in the daytime, for they’ll burn to ashes, so wait until night. It will transform them."
