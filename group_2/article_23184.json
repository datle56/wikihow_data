Press the side button to turn off the screen and activate StandBy. StandBy Mode works best with a charging stand that allows you to set your iPhone on its side with the screen facing you. If you don't have a stand, you can still use StandBy by propping your phone against something sturdy. If you have an iPhone with an Always-On display (iPhone 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max), StandBy will stay on the screen all the time by default.
