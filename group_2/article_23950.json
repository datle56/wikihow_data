      "content": "Install the rod on the wall outside the casing to block more light. Installing in the casing will always leave at least part of the window obscured, while installing outside the casing allows you to pull the curtains back completely. Which you choose will partially be determined by the material of the wall or casing. If you have plastic window casing, the curtain rod will need to be installed on the wall; if you have plaster, cob, or stone walls, then the casing may be easier. [1] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 June 2021. Bear in mind that the curtain will only draw back as far as the brackets holding the curtain rod, and the style of the curtain will determine how much they can be compressed. If you want to install your curtain rod in the wall, make sure to install it in a stud. If you cannot locate a stud or must install the rod in drywall, you will have to use drywall anchors."

      "content": "Measure your window to make sure your curtains and rods fit. Measure from about 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) above your window to the floor to determine the length your curtains should be . To figure out the length of your rod, measure the width of the window, and then add about 8 inches (20 cm) to 12 inches (30 cm). [2] X Research source Bear in mind that some styles of curtains have ruffles or pleats that extend above the top of the rod; subtract this section from the measurement. If you want your room to appear taller, hang your curtains closer to the ceiling to give the illusion of height."

      "content": "Use your pencil and a level to mark where you’ll put your hardware. This is where your bracket and screws will go. Plan to screw your hardware into the wall at the height you determined in the last step, and about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from either side of the window. To get an accurate measurement, hold the bracket in position against the wall with your fingers, and then use your pencil to mark where the screw will go. [3] X Research source Be careful not to get too close to the edge if installing in the casing, as this will make the material too fragile and cause the wood to crack. Adding 3 inches (7.6 cm) on each side of the window will give you as much light as possible when the curtains are drawn. Measure for a mid brace if needed. Though most curtain rods are adjustable, you don't want the distance between the brackets to be so wide that the rod sags in the middle. In general, you shouldn't increase the length of the expanded rod by more than 50%."

      "content": "Drill pilot holes to help start the screws, and then screw the brackets in. Drilling pilot holes before screwing in your hardware can keep the screws from cracking the casing or wall material. If you’re installing the brackets into drywall, make sure your pilot holes are big enough to place screw anchors into; if you're installing into the studs, you won't need anchors. [4] X Research source Use a stud finder to find the studs in your wall . Screw anchors will expand inside the drywall panel to the weight of the rod and curtains and will prevent the screws from pulling out of the wall."

      "content": "If you can't screw directly into the wall, or if you want to hang café curtains, use a tension rod instead. Place the tension rod inside the window frame, twist it to unlock it, and let it expand until it is tightly suspended between both interior edges of the window frame.

      "title": "Hang your curtains.",
      "content": "Hang your curtains. Thread your curtains on the rod, then place the rod on the brackets. How exactly your hang your curtains (for instance, by threading the rod through a pocket in the curtain or by hanging the curtain on pins) will depend on what sort of curtain you're using. [6] X Research source If you're hanging eyelet curtains, thread the rod through the holes in the top of the curtains. Panel curtains usually have one long pocket sewn into the top that you must push the rod through. To hang drapes, place drapery pins in the pleat, and then hang the pins on the rod. If hanging tab top curtains, a thin rod is best. A thick rod will draw the curtain up, making it hang too high."

      "content": "Opt for curtains that match your aesthetic and needs. If you haven’t already chosen your curtains and rods, think about what style of curtain is right for you and your living space: do you want heavy curtains that will block out daylight when they are closed? Or perhaps you prefer curtains that only cover a portion of your window. There are a number of unique styles of curtains to choose from. [7] X Research source Drapes are typically made from heavy, pleated material and are hung by attaching drapery pins to the pleat and then hanging them on the rod. Panel curtains , eyelet curtains , and tab top curtains are meant to hang from a plain round rod. They may have a pocket along the top to push the rod through, or the rod may be threaded through eyelets or tabs. Café curtains cover only the bottom half of a window, to let light into the room while affording some privacy. They are typically hung on tension rods."

      "title": "Measure your window and pick curtains of corresponding length and width.",
      "content": "Measure your window and pick curtains of corresponding length and width. To make sure you get the right sized curtains, measure the length and width of your window, and then decide where you want the bottom of your curtain to fall. Some folks prefer curtains that hit the bottom of the window sill, while others prefer curtains that extend below the sill. [8] X Research source A general rule of thumb says that you should choose curtains that are 2 times the width of your window. The wider your curtains are, the more they will fold and bunch, while narrower curtains will hang flat. Keep in mind that thinner materials will bunch less, while thicker materials will be fuller. [9] X Research source If you opt for tab top curtains, make sure the curtain length doesn't include the length of the tabs. Floor length curtains should end 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the floor, unless you live in a humid environment, in which case they should end 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the floor, because they will stretch more on humid days. If your ceiling is low, curtains can give the illusion that your ceiling is higher than it is: opt for long curtains (like drapes or panel curtains), and install the curtain rod closer to the ceiling. Alternatively, don't let your curtains end a few inches above the floor, as this can make your ceiling seem lower. Your curtains may extend beyond the floor—a style known as puddling. If you plan to puddle your curtains, measuring is pretty simple: you only need to ensure you have plenty of material left over for the puddle. Curtains that hang below the sill should extend 4 inches (10 cm) below the sill, long enough to cover the edge of the casing below the window. Sill-length curtains should skim the sill."

      "content": "Buy a long rod if you want to pull back the curtains completely. A shorter rod is fine if you don't want your window to be completely exposed when your curtains are open. If you'd like to pull them completely away from the window, buy a longer rod or a rod that has a return (a 90-degree turn on each end that allows you to push the curtain around the turn or rest against the wall). [10] X Research source To determine the length the return should be, measure the width of the curtain. Curtains that open completely will give you as much sunlight as possible, but keep in mind that concealing the edge of the windows will give the illusion that your window is bigger than it is."
