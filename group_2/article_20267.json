Your child may be sucking their fingers in response to stress or anxiety, or it could be a natural reflex that’s become a habit. Pay attention to your child’s behaviors before and after sucking their fingers to help identify specific triggers for sucking.

[3] X Trustworthy Source American Dental Association World's largest dental professional organization and advocate for proper oral health Go to source Track specific situations that cause your child to suck their fingers. Does the child do it when they have done something bad or are scared? Does your child suck their fingers only at night as a way to fall asleep? This can help you find the most effective strategies for eliminating triggers and breaking the sucking habit. Ask your child why they sucks their thumb. In some cases, open communication is a good step towards dealing with the problem. Your child may also help you realize that you can provide comfort or activity in alternative ways.

Likewise, if your child gets scared when you go away, make a small video to remind them that you will be home soon."

[5] X Trustworthy Source American Dental Association World's largest dental professional organization and advocate for proper oral health Go to source Providing your child ample activities and diversions can help distract the child from sucking on their fingers. Make sure your distractions are appropriate to day- or nighttime sucking habits. Give your child plenty of toys with which to play during the day.

[6] X Trustworthy Source American Dental Association World's largest dental professional organization and advocate for proper oral health Go to source Tell your child to try squeezing their thumb if they feel the need to suck their fingers. Show your child how to play “hide the finger” game. For example, if your child wants to suck their thumb, tell them to “wrap your finger with another finger to hide it.” Try sleep-inducing props to substitute finger sucking at night. For example, play lullabies or white noise for your child throughout the night. A teddy bear can also help reinforce other props. Older children can try special anti-stress finger toys, like stress balls or fidget spinners as a distraction."

      "content": "Try covering your child’s hands with bandages or a sock. The texture or even size of the covered hand can help get the child out of the habit of sucking on fingers in any situation. Remember that you don’t want to embarrass your child. Consider bandaging the child’s hands only if they are not in school and not out in public. This may work best at home or when the child is sleeping.

Stay positive and offer gentle reminders to stop sucking their fingers may provide enough reinforcement to curtail the problem. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask your child, “Did you know that sometimes you suck your thumb?” If your child says “no,” then it’s a good sign that the habit is a natural reflex that can easily be forgotten with gentle reminders. However, you may find that your child sucks their fingers as a way to get your attention. In this case, ignoring your child is sometimes the best way to break the habit. Spare your child any embarrassment about their habit. If your child starts sucking their fingers in public out of habit, then have a special hand signal or private cue to alert them to stop. You could also use a code word such as “bubbles” to tell your child to stop."

      "content": "Breaking a habit is hard for a child to do. So, it’s essential to encourage your child every step of the way. Remind your child how good it will feel to be a \"big kid.\" Make sure to offer reassurance often, especially if the child makes a mistake. You can say, “I know this is hard [insert name here], but you’re doing a great job at not sucking your fingers.” Play a game of show and tell with your child to help encourage them. For example, stand with your child in front of a mirror and have her look at you and their teeth. If your child has a small gap, you can say, “If you keep sucking your fingers, you’ll end up looking like that wascally wabbit Bugs Bunny. Do you want to have big teeth like Bugs?”"
