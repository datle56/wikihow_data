      "content": "Use these common phrases to sound like a local. Some of the words have their basis in Gaelic, so they don’t resemble English words at all. Banjaxed means “broken” or “not working.” Use it to describe a piece of furniture, a car, or any item that's broken. The car won’t start and is totally banjaxed. [1] X Research source Barrer is the Irish word for a “wheelbarrow.” A lot of Irish slang terms are simply shorter versions of their English original. Grab the barrer and load it up with bricks. Beour refers to an “attractive woman” or someone’s “girlfriend.” It’s less possessive than “mot,” also meaning “girlfriend.” She’s a real beour. He’s a lucky man. [2] X Research source Bleedin’ means “very.” It’s similar to the way the English say “bloody” as an adjective when they’re angry or excited about what they’re describing. It’s bleedin’ cold outside. Bog roll refers to “toilet paper.” It’s a funny term, because Irish people call the rural, muddy countryside the “bog.” We’re out of bog roll in the bathroom. Boyo is a word used for any “juvenile male.” It’s a term of affection a teacher or priest might use when talking to a student. A father could also use “boyo” when addressing his son. Come here, boyo, and get to school. [3] X Research source Cailín is Irish slang for a “girl.” Though used similarly to “boyo,” Cailín isn’t as common as its male equivalent. She’s a Cailín you’re going to love. Cat doesn’t refer a feline, but instead indicates something “bad.” It can specifically refer to an unpleasant situation you need to get out of fast. The exam was totally cat. [4] X Research source Chipper is a nickname for a “fish and chips shop” where you can order takeout (called “takeaway”). Fish and chips are definitely Ireland’s late-night food of choice. We’re going to the chipper for a late-night meal. Clatter can be used to describe any “large amount.” In contrast, American English uses “clatter” to describe a loud bang or noise instead of a lot of something. You’ve got a clatter of exams you need to study for. Clem means to “steal something.” Don’t clem that shirt; it doesn’t belong to you! Cop on is a term used to describe “getting something.” It’s used when you have your heart set on something in particular. Cop on to that parking spot right there. [5] X Research source Culchie can refer to someone “from the country” or anyplace “rural.” “Culchie” is slightly derogatory without being a complete insult. She’s a culchie who grew up on a farm. [6] X Research source Deadly means “brilliant,” “fantastic,” or “great.” Irish people have loads of words to describe what they love most. The concert last night was deadly! I’ll never forget how amazing it was. Fair play can mean “good job” or “good on you.” It’s also similar to the term “that’s fair” that you might hear in American English. Fair play to you for playing such a great football match. [7] X Research source Feck is a lesser version of an “f” expletive. “Feck” is considered a tame version of the f-word that kids and teens say when they’re trying to be good. Oh feck, what’s going on? Feek refers to an attractive person. It’s one of many Irish slang words used to describe a good-looking person. They’re a real feek; I’d love to go out with them. Fella is an Irish word for your “partner/boyfriend/man.” You can also call any guy a “fella,” whether he’s your friend or acquaintance. He’s been my fella for over 2 years now. [8] X Research source Fine is a way to cut off a conversation you don’t want to have. People in America used to say “fine” interchangeably with “okay,” but this version is less amenable. What’s the matter? Fine. Flah means to “show off” or “boast.” “Flah” resembles the English word “flaunt,” which is just what it means. Don’t flah about how good you did on the test. Fry is a word describing an Irish breakfast. A traditional “fry” or “fry up” consists of black and white pudding made with blood sausage. Let’s enjoy a delicious fry tomorrow morning. Gaff is a term for a “house.” You can refer to your own house or someone else’s as a “gaff” equally. For example, you might say, We’re moving into a brand new gaff next month! [9] X Research source Gammy means anything “crooked” or “odd-looking.” You can have a “gammy” leg, a “gammy” car, or a “gammy” tooth. That gammy road had a lot of twists and turns. [10] X Research source Gas refers to a funny or amusing person. Beyond that, anything can be referred to as a “gas.” The comedian last night was such a gas. Give it a lash is a phrase used to describe “quick movement” or a person you find “attractive.” Irish slang terms like “lash” have multiple meanings and situations. Give it a lash and hurry up. Giving out means “to scold” or “complain.” When you “give out,” it’s somewhere between complaining, being annoyed, or venting about what’s bothering you. She was giving out about how disappointed she was. Grá is a Gaelic term for “love.” It’s not as common in Irish these days, but it represents an element of slang that derives from the native Irish language. It’s pure grá; I love you more than anything. G’wan is a short Irish variation of “go on.” “G’wan” is also so natural that it’s said without meaning as part of a conversation. G’wan, they’re waiting for you at the store. G’way means “you’re joking or kidding.” Like “G’wan,” “G’way” is the verbal equivalent of gently shoving someone while saying, “you’ve got to be kidding me.” G’way, that can’t be what happened. Holy show refers to a “disgraceful scene.” A “holy show” is something you walk away from because it’s shameful in some way. They made a holy show of themselves last night. [11] X Research source Jammers means “extremely full.” American English uses the term “jam-packed,” which is very similar to the Irish “jammers.” The pub was totally jammers this weekend. Jaysus is an Irish phonetic spelling of “Jesus” used for emphasis or surprise. It’s literally spelled the way that Irish people speak the word “Jesus.” Jaysus, can you believe that? [12] X Research source Keen means “eager” or “enthusiastic.” Though less used in American English, “keen” appears in older vernacular when it comes to being “eager” for something. She’s keen on going to England for her holidays. Knackered means “tired” or “exhausted.” To say you’re “knackered” means you feel like you've been knocked in the head. I’m totally knackered after working out. [13] X Research source Legends refers to anyone who is “highly respected.” People are referred to as “legends” in English, but it’s more prolific in Ireland. Those legends are the best professors they’ve got. Lethal means “excellent” or “amazing.” It’s completely normal to say the song you just listened to is “lethal” when using it as the Irish do. The performance was lethal; I loved it. Like is a filler word Irish people say at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence, any time they can’t think of what their next word is. It’s a brilliant film, like. Lock-in can refer to the act of “drinking in a pub” after hours. Because pubs close at 12:30 am in Ireland, groups of people who stay can enjoy the wee hours of the night. We had a lock-in until 6 in the morning. [14] X Research source Mog is an affectionate term for a “child” or “pet.” Your cat or dog might be called a mog, as can your baby or little child. The little kitty’s such a mog. Mucker can refer to a “friend” or “companion.” The word “mucker” is also sometimes used in England and is a term of affection for those you care about. He’s been a mucker to me for ages. Nixer refers to a “job done for cash” to avoid paying tax. It’s the equivalent of a freelance worker or day laborer in America. Hire a nixer to get the job done quickly. [15] X Research source Oul dear is an “old woman,” and sometimes specifically a “mom.” It’s interchangeable with “aul,” which the Irish sometimes use instead of “old.” The oul dear is doing well these days . [16] X Research source Oul fella means an “old man.” Like “oul dear,” “oul fella” is a sweet term for your granddad, dad, or any older man you care about. Look at the oul fella trying to get down the street. Poxy means something is “not great” or “not working.” When Irish people are unhappy, they can call on many slang words of choice to describe why. The class is poxy; it doesn’t make any sense. Press is a “cupboard” or “closet.” Like “messages,” which used to mean “groceries,” a “press” sounds like a printing press. This is because groceries were once sold at the post office in Ireland. I’m putting your groceries in the press. Pure is a word that emphasizes whatever comes after it. Like the word “very,” “pure” is less about piety than it is a way to focus on what it’s describing. The stew was pure delicious. [17] X Research source Puss means to be “sulking” or “sad-faced.” “Puss” appears in American English with the term “sad puss,” but it’s considered old-fashioned today. His puss didn’t get better all night. [18] X Research source Quare is another word for “very.” Like “pure,” “quare” is another word to emphasize how much something is what it is. Good or bad, if it’s “quare,” it’s extremely so. The show was quare good. [19] X Research source Ride refers to a “good-looking person.” In American English, a “ride” can refer to a trip in a car, on a bike, or at an amusement park. Your friend is such a gorgeous ride. [20] X Research source Rotten means “bad” or “unpleasant.” Whereas you might refer to “rotten” food, Irish people call anything that doesn’t please them “rotten.” The odor was rotten in that refrigerator. Scundered can mean “embarrassed” or “ashamed,” particularly in Northern Ireland. The Irish vernacular has many words that describe an embarrassed person. She was absolutely scundered when she walked into her surprise party. [21] X Research source Sham is a term of endearment for a “friend” or “acquaintance.” A “sham” is used in American English for anything “fake,” which is quite different from how it’s used in Ireland. She’s been a sham since we met at school. Slagging is the act of “teasing” or “mocking” someone. The art of “slagging” is something that Irish people love to do with friends and people they know. The bully at school was slagging me off all day. [22] X Research source Sound references when “all is good,” which is also used in Britain. Anything from a person to a school or a business plan can be “sound.” How is she? She’s sound. [23] X Research source State refers to a “mess” or “chaotic” situation. Using the word “state” in Ireland is usually connected to something negative. You wouldn’t say, “You’re in a state” and then offer a compliment. Look at the state of you. Take the piss is a more colorful way to describe the act of “mocking” someone. Irish people are known for their sarcastic sense of humor, which is reflected in Irish slang. They were all telling jokes about him and taking the piss in general. [24] X Research source The jacks refers to “the toilet.” While the British use “loo,” the Irish prefer “toilet” or “jacks” when it comes to direct bathroom slang. I’m off to the jacks; be right back. [25] X Research source Wee can be used to describe anything “small” or “tiny.” It’s also a favorite of Scottish people who refer to anything little as “wee.” He was just a wee lad. [26] X Research source Yoke was originally referred to as the “collar of a farm animal,” but can be used with anything. “Yoke” is a stand-in word for anything you can’t remember the name of. Go for the yoke and win that prize. [27] X Research source"

      "title": "Use these Irish phrases to greet someone.",
      "content": "Use these Irish phrases to greet someone. Instead of “hello,” you might say, “Howya,” which combines the words “How” and “are you?” The Irish also sometimes begin conversations with English words which take on a new meaning, like “Well—” instead of the American “So—.” Craic means “fun.” It’s used as a common greeting and tends to be overused by tourists who visit the Emerald Isle. Just about anything can be “craic” for an Irish person. The pub last night was really good craic. Grand means “good” or “great.” In addition to things being “grand,” people can be too, as in “you’re grand,” meaning “you’re doing fine” or “you’re ok.” My holiday in Italy was grand. [28] X Research source How ya getting on/How’s the form?! are another Irish way of saying “How are you?” Using these phrases proves that the Irish are a very friendly people who use many different greetings. How ya getting on? I’m doing grand. Hows-a-going? is a different way to say “How are you doing?” The American English equivalent to “hows-a-going” is likely “How’s it going?” Hows-a-going? Really well, thanks. Howya is a Dublin greeting that represents a way to say “hello” in Irish while speaking in English. It’s an abbreviation of “How are you?” to save time. Howya, Niall? Pretty fair. [29] X Research source How’s she cutting? is a way to say “How are things?” or “What’s new?” in Ireland. It's used among many Irish phrases to greet people they know and others they don’t. How’s she cutting? Just fine.

Story horse? Oh, I’m feeling pretty good. Well is regularly the first word used in a greeting. The equivalent in American English is “so,” as in, “So, tell me what happened?” Well, how are you then? What’s the craic or story? is another way to say “how are you doing?” This one includes the famous Irish word “craic” when you’re trying to find out more. What’s the story today, Shane?

      "title": "Interpret some friendly teasing with these terms.",
      "content": "Interpret some friendly teasing with these terms. Irish people are known for their wit, which includes poking fun at friends and loved ones in their life. Most often, Irish words like “chancer,” “dosser,” and “pox” are ways of keeping others humble enough to laugh at themselves. Amadán means a “fool” or “idiot.” Amadán Mór is also called the “Great Fool” and is a hero in some Irish folktales, so being a fool isn’t all bad. [32] X Research source He was an amadán and had no idea what he was doing. Bollocks is an English term meaning “rubbish” or “nonsense.” When the Irish don’t like someone or something, they’ll often use “bollocks” to express their disdain clearly. The rules at the pub are bollocks. Eejit refers to an “idiot.” If you take the actual word “idiot” and shorten it, it easily turns into “eejit.” Irish people often create their own variations of an English word. Look at the eejit embarrassing himself over there. [33] X Research source Chancer refers to a “person who takes a risk.” This word uses the phrase “taking a chance” and turns it into a descriptive noun meant for a person who gets what they want. He’s a real chancer who’s bound for trouble! [34] X Research source Cute hoor is a name given to a person who “quietly engineers” things so they can take advantage. They are a “clever” or “sneaky” person who may also be a trickster. [35] X Research source What a cute hoor to get what they want. Dope describes a “foolish” or “gullible” person. Both American English and Irish English use “dope” for a “fool,” but American slang also uses it to describe something great. The customer is a real dope. Dosser refers to someone who “doesn’t work.” “Dosser” is a very specific way to call someone “lazy” as it pertains to not having a job. He’s just a dosser and hasn’t got a job. [36] X Research source Dryshite is a name given to a person who is “boring” or “not any fun.” The Irish slang “shite” is a slightly softer version of another expletive. The teacher is a dryshite; she is such a bore. Geebag refers to an “irritating” or “obnoxious person.” The Irish use plenty of colorful phrases for those people they don’t like, and “geebag” is no exception. What a loudmouth and geebag he is. Gobdaw is taken from the Irish “gabhdán,” referring to a gullible person.” Another word for a naive person, “gobdaw” sounds even more unique than just calling someone a “dope.” Don’t be such a gobdaw; they’re trying to take advantage of you. Gobshite means a “braggy” or “mean” person.” “Gob” means “mouth” in British and Irish English, while “shite” is another way to say “feces.” What a gobshite he is. He talks about nothing but how big his house is. Gombeen refers to a “mean,” “underhanded,” or “corrupt” person. It comes from the Irish “gaimbin,” meaning “interest on a loan.” [37] X Research source Don’t trust that gombeen as they’ll fool you to get what they want.

[38] X Research source In bits refers to anything that “isn’t as it should be.” If you’ve worked too hard, been too upset, or drank too much, you may easily be “in bits.” I overworked myself the whole week and am in bits today. Jackeen is a term a rural Irish person gives to a “Dubliner.” Dubliners might call those from the country “colchies,” but they have an insult to give back to those from the big city. He’s such a jackeen and thinks it’s all about Dublin. [39] X Research source Kip means “the unpleasant state in which you leave someplace.” If someone calls your home a “kip,” it means you live in a total wreck or mess of a place. He left the house a total kip. [40] X Research source Langers is a Cork expression used any time you get “drunk.” Calling someone “langers” combines the idea of being drunk with being sloppy. He was langers after the bar crawl last night. Manky refers to something “disgusting” or “gross.” Anything or anyone can be “manky,” from a kitchen sink to a disheveled person. The garbage bin was so manky today. Melter refers to someone who is a “nuisance” or “annoyance.” “Melter” presumes you are so much of a nuisance that you cause everyone around you to want to melt to get away from you. She was talking all night and was a real melter. [41] X Research source Minus craic means that something was so much of an un-fun time that it was “minus fun.” Take the popular Irish idea of “craic” being a great time, and make it negative. That class was minus craic for an hour straight. Muppet is any “foolish” or “gullible” person. It doesn’t mean you’re cute enough to be on the classic TV show. It means you’re easily fooled and have low intelligence. She was a muppet for believing your fake story. Plonker is another way of calling someone an “idiot” or “fool.” Add “plonker” to the list of Irish insults that refer to a “fool.” Don’t be such a plonker about your life.

Scut is an Irish insult for anyone “bad,” “stupid,” or “unpleasant.” To be called a “scut” means you’re either unintelligent or just not nice to be around. Get away from me, you scut! Shitehawk is a specific term for any “scavenger bird,” such as a hawk. Scavenger birds are bottom-feeders, which makes the term “shitehawk” a creative way to insult someone. The shitehawk is picking their bones clean. Thick means “dull” or “stupid.” It’s not the nicest thing to say to a person, and it means they’re definitely not the sharpest mind around. Don’t be so thick. You don’t know anything, do you? Tool is a way to call someone “dumb” or a “clown.” If you’ve done something stupid, you may be called a “tool” by any Irish people who saw you do it. This tool just fell down in the road. Tosspot refers to either a “contemptible” person or a “drunkard.” Add “tosspot” to the list of Irish insults, because Irish often specifies exactly what makes you bad in their eyes. The tosspot didn’t know which way he was going. Wago is a name given to a woman who “isn’t nice.” It’s used for a woman who isn’t liked or is seen as being mean in some way. She’s such a wagon—nobody likes her."

      "content": "Talk about having a few pints using these Irish words. There are many words to describe getting drunk using slang.

Fluthered means “very drunk.” This word is similar to the phrase “in a flutter,” which means you’re all over the place. In this case, it’s due to being very drunk.

I woke up in a heap this morning and felt super sick. In rag order/in ribbons is another way to describe being sick or hungover. Another visually-inspired Irish phrase about being “hungover” when you can’t hold yourself together. I’m in rag order today after partying last night.

Sally was paralytic after she left the pub last night. Scoops refers to any “alcoholic drink.” Specifically, using “scoops” indicates one serving each. If you’ve had more than a few “scoops” of alcohol, it may be time to call it a night. We had two or three scoops with vodka last week.

      "content": "Discuss the moody and expressive Irish weather with these local slang words. Ireland is known to have a lot of rain and damp weather, often experiencing all four seasons in a day. Irish slang words about the weather are also typically expressions that reflect whether the sun is shining or not. Saying that the rain is “lashing” or “spitting” is a specific example of the different ways it can rain in Ireland. It’s a day for the fire is used to describe a cold winter’s day when you’d want to have a fire to warm up. Irish weather is often quite damp, which is a good reason to burn a fire. It’s a day for the fire. It’s going to snow. It’s a good day for drying is used to describe a dry day when Irish people like to let their clothes dry out in the open. It’s a good day for drying. Get your clothes out! It’s fierce mild is a unique way to describe a warm, pleasant day. In this example, “fierce” is used as a positive way to say “very” mild. I’m going to the beach; it’s fierce mild. It’s lashing/pissing means “raining hard,” equivalent to “raining cats and dogs.” Since the Irish use “lash” for multiple reasons, it’s a favorite term for the heaviest of rains. It’s lashing out there; there’s no telling when the rain will stop. [51] X Research source It’s spitting is a descriptive way to talk about a “light rain.” Though “spitting” seems like a negative term, it simply describes rain that isn’t a downpour or a torrential rainstorm. It’s spitting, but not too bad out there. It’s wetter than an otter's pocket refers to the wettest kind of “rainy day.” Otters swim in the water, so the idea is that their “pockets” must be the wettest place on earth to be. It’s wetter than an otter’s pocket out there; bring a raincoat. The sun is splitting the stones can mean that the sun is so bright that it could break rocks. “The sun is splitting the stones” focuses on how strong the sunshine can be. The sun is splitting the stones; what a beautiful day. Soft day describes a typical Irish day when the rain is so light that it looks invisible. It describes the kind of light rain that feels light until you find yourself soaking wet. It’s a soft day today, but you still may need an umbrella. [52] X Research source"

      "title": "If you head to Dublin, use these phrases with roots in city life.",
      "content": "If you head to Dublin, use these phrases with roots in city life. Even within Ireland, certain slang words are specific to a region, city, or town. Since Dublin is the capital city, it’s bound to have plenty of Irish slang to call its own. From something good being “mot” to something bad being “brutal,” these words are Dublin City approved. Brutal means “awful” or “dreadful.” Whereas “brutal” may be more of a violent term in English, it’s used in Irish and American English for anything bad you’ve been through. The traffic was brutal at rush hour. [53] X Research source Chiseler refers to a “young child” in Irish English. “Chiseler” is also a vintage American slang term for a “swindler” or someone who may use an actual chisel. He was only a chiseler at 6 years old. Delira means “delighted.” When you use “delira,” it can mean you’re so happy that you’re practically “delirious” and can’t think straight. I was delira that they were coming to visit. [54] X Research source Get outta that garden refers to an area of conversation to avoid. Also interchangeable with “get up outta that.” Get outta that garden. She doesn’t want to talk about it. Janey Mack is used as an interjection in a conversation, especially in Dublin. You’d use “Janey Mack” when frustrated mid-conversation. Now listen—Janey Mack—I’m trying to explain! Mot comes from the Gaelic “maith,” meaning “good.” “Mot” isn’t as commonly used as other phrases meaning “good,” but tends to be found in Dublin more so. She’s such a mot; I love her. [55] X Research source Scarlet is a description of an “embarrassed” person having a red face. It’s an example of a literal description made into Irish slang that is very straightforward in its meaning. He was so scarlet after he tripped in front of the whole class. [56] X Research source Whopper means “excellent,” “fun,” and “great.” A “whopper” can be “big” in English, but here it’s more about how wonderful the thing itself is. The concert was a real whopper.

      "content": "If you head to Northern Irleland, you'll seem like a local if you use these phases. Irish terms from the North have a personality all their own. These examples of Irish slang are most commonly found in Belfast and other areas of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland slang can take on more British-sounding words and phrases, or just use Irish words in a unique way. They’ll call a face a “bake” and say “Bout ye?” to express the question, “How are you?” Bake is a way to describe a “face.” A “bake” is a very unique way to talk about someone’s facial expression or mouth, in particular. Her bake was so angry that she yelled at you. Beamer describes someone whose face is “red with embarrassment.” Your face can beam as it blushes with redness from being embarrassed about something. He’s a beamer now that you brought out his baby picture. Bogging means “dirty” or “disgusting.” The “bog” is a muddy place in Ireland, which means something “boggy” is the best way to describe it. The basement was boggin’ since no one had cleaned up in years. [57] X Research source Bout Ye? means “How are you?” in Belfast. Similar to the Irish “Howya,” the Northern Irish “bout ye” shortens “how about you” into a concise piece of slang. Bout ye? I’m pretty good myself. [58] X Research source Dander refers to something “completely different.” A “dander” is anything you choose to do that’s different from what you’re doing right now. Go for a dander and take the car for a spin. Houl yer whisht is an eloquent way to say “shut up.” It’s one of the more colorful Northern Irish phrases you can use to tell someone to “be quiet” fast. Houl yer whisht; I need to say something. Ogeous handling refers to a “tricky situation.” Anything you encounter in life can be “ogeous handling” if it’s difficult to maneuver through or figure out. That accident is some ogeous handling for sure. Peeler describes a “police officer.” Using this word for a member of law enforcement is based on Sir Robert Peel, the 19th-century founder of the Irish constabulary. [59] X Research source The peelers are out looking for criminals. Up to high doh means to be in a “nervous” or “excited” way. If you’re excited about something, you’re very likely to be “up to high doh” about it. I’m up to high doh since the accident."

      "title": "Some Irish phrases are so out there that they can’t be categorized.",
      "content": "Some Irish phrases are so out there that they can’t be categorized. These expressions don’t fit into groups and can be used anytime you want to sound like the Irish might. To “bagsy” something instead of claiming it is a particularly Irish word, while “G-way” is another example of Irish slang that combines words (in this case, “Go away”). A bad dose refers to a “severe illness.” Instead of a “bad dose” of flu or a cold, you can have a “bad dose” of just about anything you can think of. She had a bad dose of stress all last week. [60] X Research source Acting the maggot refers to “fooling around” or not being serious. No one wants to be called a “maggot,” so if you’re acting like one, it means you’re messing around. Stop acting the maggot and do your work. [61] X Research source Ah, here! expresses “frustration” or “annoyance.” This essentially means you’re trying to get someone’s attention because they’re not listening to you very well to begin with. Ah, here, how do you drive this thing? Arseways can mean “mixed up,” “backward,” or “wrong.” Instead of right-side-up, being “arseways” expresses how upside-down you are about a particular thing. Your arithmetic in this problem is arseways. [62] X Research source Bagsy is a verb that “claims something for yourself.” “Bagsy” is used as a verb and is thought of as a childish way to lay claim to anything you want for yourself first. I bagsy the front seat. Codding means to “tease” or “joke” with someone. “Codding” is one example of “joking around,” so don't’ be offended if you’re the butt of a joke. We were only codding ya. Don’t take it so seriously. C’mere to me is a way of saying “Listen up; I’m about to tell you something important.” This phrase isn’t negative; it only means someone Irish is trying to get your attention. C’mere to me; I’ve something to say. [63] X Research source Deadly buzz describes any “exciting” or “thrilling” experience. Like “deadly,” using “deadly buzz” is linked to something great or terrific. The hike up the mountain was a deadly buzz. Donkey’s years can mean “a very long time.” Donkeys live a long life that can last up to 40 years, so it’s easy to see why Irish people use them as inspiration for this slang term. We haven’t seen each other for donkey’s years. [64] X Research source Eat the head off is similar to the American term of “bite someone’s head off,” or “lash out.” It indicates someone is so angry they’re going to take your head off. Don’t eat the head off me; I was just asking about your day. [65] X Research source Effin’ and blindin’ is a phrase that is the same as “swearing” and “cursing.” The Irish often use their own variations on swear words, including “feck” and “shite.” They were effin’ and blindin’ me after I accidentally backed into their car. [66] X Research source Gimme a shot is said anytime you want someone to “give you a go.” Similarly, this phrase works like “give me a chance.” Come on, give me a shot with the new toy. G’way! is an abbreviated form of saying “you’re joking” or “you’re kidding.” “G-way” is an abbreviation of “get out of here.” G-way! You can’t be serious. He/she is your only man/woman! is used when an Irish person recommends someone for a job or assignment. It’s a way to show confidence in someone else’s abilities. He is your only man to fix your sink. Jammy is a name given to anyone who is “lucky” or “flukey.” Using “jammy” stands on its own since it doesn’t directly remind you of luck. Kathy won the lotto; she’s so jammy! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph is a Catholic phrase used to express surprise. By naming Jesus Christ and his earthly parents, you’re expressing disbelief, frustration, or amazement. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, where have you been? [67] X Research source Lash means anything from “heavy rain” to “give something a try” or “go out drinking.” “Lash” is used to express anything you give your all to. Make sure to give it a lash before you give up. Leg it is an expressive term meaning “run.” It literally means you should take your legs and move them fast to go the distance or get away fast. Leg it before they catch us! Lob the gob is a way to describe “kissing someone.” Considered a slightly crude term, “lob the gob” uses the Irish word “gob,” which means “mouth.” He will lob the gob if she’ll let him. Minerals is an Irish term for “soda” or “pop.” It can relate to beverages like “mineral water,” but is used for any kind of bubbly non-alcoholic beverage kids enjoy, like soda or seltzer. We gave the children minerals with their lunch. [68] X Research source Now we’re suckin’ diesel is another way to say “Now, we’re really going strong.” You can use this Irish phrase for anything you’re doing once you feel confident in your actions. We’re doing better and now we’re suckin’ diesel. [69] X Research source Shaping/shaper can mean “walking with a strut” or in a “cocky” way. You’re creating shapes as you saunter while moving your legs, hips, head, shoulders, or arms. She’s shaping her way down the street. Shifting can refer to a “meeting,” but can also mean “kissing.” You can shift a new person at work without kissing them, so make sure you know which one is being said. They were shifting at the party, so I think they got along well. Sorry? is a word used similarly to “excuse me?” In addition to saying “sorry” when bumping into each other on the street, Irish people use it as a lead-in to a conversation. Sorry, do you have the time? Stall the ball is a term meaning “to wait a moment,” “slow down,” or “stop.” It can refer to speaking too fast or explaining a complex set of instructions. Stall the ball until I understand what you’re talking about. [70] X Research source Stooked is another way of being “tired” or “exhausted.” Similar to “knackered,” “stooked” is a more obscure Irish way to tell you someone needs a nap. I’m stooked after yesterday’s run. Stunner is a way to describe a “beautiful” woman. It’s similar to calling a woman “stunning,” but changes the descriptive adjective into a noun. She’s a real stunner; I can’t take my eyes off of her. Suds means “soap” or “shampoo.” In this case, “suds” describes the bubbles that soap or shampoo create when lathered in the shower. Buy some suds so I can wash my hair. Sure look is an Irish filler phrase used when something isn’t in your control. It’s a way to throw your hands up or when you feel lost in a conversation. Sure, look, what can we do? Swift one is a way of having a “quick drink.” You may meet up with a nightcap or an after-dinner drink without making a night of it when you enjoy a “swift one.” Come out for a swift one; you’ll be home soon. Tae is a unique pronunciation of “tea.” This is an example of Irish words like “jaysus” that are just reproductions of other words spelled in the same way an Irish person speaks them. Do you want some tae and biscuits? The craic was 90 means that the “good times were at their peak.” Unlike “minus craic,” when the craic is at 90, it indicates an especially wonderful time. The craic was 90. I didn’t ever want to leave. [71] X Research source The messages is an Irish slang term for “groceries.” At one time, groceries were once sold at the post office in Ireland. Did you get the messages on the way home? I’m hungry. Up to 90 refers to being “stressed out,” “agitated,” or “busy.” While craic can be at 90, you’re not feeling great when you’re “up to 90.” I was up to 90 and needed a break. [72] X Research source Will I, yea/I will, yea?! is a good example of Irish sarcasm that means you definitely will not. A similar phrase in American English is, “Oh, you think so, do you?” Will I, yea? You think I’ll drive you to the airport? Yer man/yer wan is an Irish way of referring to any man; “wan” means “woman.” Instead of “your,” Irish people tend to say “yer,” which reflects their specific accents. Your man who came in yesterday was really excited to see me. [73] X Research source Yonks means “a very long time.” “Yonks” is considered a way to blend the idea of “years, months, and weeks” so the other person knows exactly how long a time it’s been. It’s been yonks since we’ve seen each other."
