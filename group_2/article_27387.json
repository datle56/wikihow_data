Fill a large pot with water and then pour 25 g (1/3 cup) of soap nuts, 25 g (1/3 cup) of dried gooseberry, and 25 g (1/3 cup) of dried shikakai into the water. Let the ingredients soak overnight, or for about 12 hours, so they get soft. [1] X Research source Soap nuts provide a small lather to your shampoo so it’s easier to wash your hair with. Gooseberry helps to promote blood flow to the scalp and new hair growth. shikakai has antibacterial and antifungal properties to help prevent dandruff. Your ingredients will be much easier to use after they’ve soaked since they won’t be hard and dry anymore. You can also substitute the shikakai for 2 tbsp (28 g) of Fenugreek seeds.
