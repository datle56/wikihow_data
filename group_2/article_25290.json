Vedic astrology uses fixed zodiacs based on the actual constellations, so it's important to know the exact details of your birth to ensure accuracy. If you have a birth certificate , check it before entering your information into the online calculator. [2] X Research source The exact time, date, and place allows Vedic astrological predictions to be much more detailed and personalized, while Western predictions are general and made to address anyone who was born in that month. Your birth-influenced rashi is considered to govern major parts of your life, such as marriage, journey, and important work."

Enter the characters and specify how they’re pronounced in order to find the most accurate sign. [3] X Research source It’s best to only use this method if you don't know information about your birth. If you calculate rashis for both your birth information and your name, you may end up with 2 conflicting zodiacs. Generally, a name-calculated rashi will be more connected to predictions for your career, home, and daily routine work."
