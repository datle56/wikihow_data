      "title": "Apply glue to the earring flatback.",
      "content": "Apply glue to the earring flatback. Use the toothpick to apply a dot of glue to the stud earring flatback. You don’t need a large amount of glue, just enough to cover the surface of the earring flatback. [2] X Research source Superglue also works if you are in a hurry. If using superglue, then you can apply the earring glue directly onto the earring flatback with the tube. Only use a small amount and be careful not to get any on your skin or other surfaces. Be sure to work over a paper towel to avoid getting glue onto your table and other surfaces."

      "title": "Press earring décor onto the earring flatback.",
      "content": "Press earring décor onto the earring flatback. Take the piece you want to mount on the earring back and press it onto the glue on the earring flatback. Hold the pieces firmly together for a minute to give them a chance to bond. Then, place the earring on your paper towel to dry the rest of the way. [3] X Research source If the earring piece you have added has a flat surface, such as a button or flat pennant, then place the earring face down rather than on its side."

      "title": "Allow glue to dry.",
      "content": "Allow glue to dry. Leave the earrings alone to dry for a few hours or overnight. It is important to let them dry completely before you wear them. [4] X Research source If you used superglue, then your earrings will be ready after just a few minutes. However, you may still want to leave them be for up to an hour to let the glue dry and bond completely."

      "title": "Look for beads and buttons in craft stores.",
      "content": "Look for beads and buttons in craft stores. Craft stores are the best place to find all kinds of different beads, buttons, and other cool things to make into stud earrings. Look for items that have a flat surface on one side. This will make it much easier to attach the items to the earring flatbacks. If using buttons for your earrings, you may want to paint over the button with some clear nail polish before gluing it onto the stud flatback. This will make the button shiny if it is a matte button. [5] X Research source Let the nail polish dry completely before gluing it onto the stud."

      "content": "Use clay to make your own designs. If you want to create your own beads to glue onto the earrings, then clay beads are a great option. Try getting some air drying clay in your local craft store and then shape the clay into bead to glue onto your earring flatbacks. You can use multiple colors of clay to create interesting designs in the clay."

For example, you could glue a four leaf clover charm onto an earring flatback for St. Patrick’s Day, or glue a jack-o-lantern piece onto an earring flatback for Halloween. You can make yourself a pair of holiday themed stud earrings for every holiday of the year!"

      "content": "Try using old jewelry. If you don’t want to buy any new beads or other notions to turn into earrings, then you can also convert your old, unwanted jewelry into stud earrings. Try taking apart old necklaces and bracelets and using the beads and charms to create stud earrings. Be sure that you no longer want the item and that it is something you can break apart before you try to harvest the beads and charms from a piece of jewelry. Use scissors to cut the string holding the beads and charms together. Break apart the old jewelry over a bowl or other container to ensure that the beads do not go everywhere."
