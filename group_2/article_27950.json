      "content": "Put the petals through a mincer or through a blender until there is a mince of roses that appears ideal for forming into beads. You can test this after each mince or blend by rolling in your hands. If the mixture stays together in a bead shape, the mixture is ready to work with."

      "content": "Using your hands, roll small bead shapes with a bit of the mixture. Do this firmly so that the little bead balls stick together well. Remember that the plant material will shrink as it dries to half the original size, so make account for this in your bead size. Continue until you have made as many beads as required."

      "title": "Pierce a hole through the centre of each bead.",
      "content": "Pierce a hole through the centre of each bead. Use a long hat-pin, a thin skewer or a piece of wire to create a hole through each bead. Leave the beads to dry on this to ensure that the hole remains stable and of a good size as the beads dry."
