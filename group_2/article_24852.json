      "content": "Keep fresh roses cool until you're ready to work with them. Place your cut roses in cool water in a clean container, like a vase, until you're ready to use them. Store the vase somewhere cool and out of direct sunlight, like a cellar or garage, so they stay looking their best. [1] X Research source Replace the vase water every 2-3 days if you plan to store them that long. [2] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021."

      "content": "Prepare the petals no earlier than 3 days before you need them. 3 days is probably the maximum amount of time you want to store fresh rose petals if you plan to use them as decorations. If you try to store fresh rose petals for longer than 3 days, they won't be in peak condition when you go to use them. [3] X Research source For example, if you're using the petals to decorate a wedding, don't remove the petals from the roses until 3 days before the event at the earliest."

      "title": "Grasp the rose bloom firmly and pull it off the stem.",
      "content": "Grasp the rose bloom firmly and pull it off the stem. Grab the thick part of the stem right under the bloom with one hand. Then, pinch the entire head of the rose bloom with your other hand. Gently pry the bloom away from the stem until the entire bloom, petals and all, separates from the stem. [4] X Research source Avoid yanking or being rough with the petals since this can bruise them."

      "title": "Separate the petals from each other gently with your fingers.",
      "content": "Separate the petals from each other gently with your fingers. Insert your fingers into the center of the bloom and gently pull and separate the individual petals. Let the petals fall gently to a clean, flat work surface as you continue with the rest of your blooms. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove enough fresh rose petals to cover your intended project.",
      "content": "Remove enough fresh rose petals to cover your intended project. The number of roses you need really depends on what you're using them for and how heavily you plan to layer them. After you separate the first bloom and see the petal yield, you'll have a better idea of how many additional roses you need for your project. [6] X Research source For example, if you're scattering them down the aisle at a wedding, consider the length of the aisle and how thickly you want to layer the petals. It's better to have extra petals on hand rather than not enough, especially if you plan to use them as decorations."

      "title": "Transfer the fresh petals to an airtight bag or container.",
      "content": "Transfer the fresh petals to an airtight bag or container. Petals are very lightweight, so don't worry about them crushing each other. Fill zip-lock baggies or airtight containers with petals, just don't compact them or put additional pressure on them. [7] X Research source The petals should have room to shift around in the container. Don't pack them any tighter than that. [8] X Research source It's crucial that the container(s) be airtight so the petals stay crisp and fresh-looking.

Tuck the dry paper towel into the bag with the petals or place it on top or underneath them before sealing the container. [10] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. Double-check the lid or baggie to confirm it's completely sealed.

[12] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. Avoid putting the container near any fresh fruits or vegetables, since their proximity can cause the petals to wilt. [13] X Research source If you're ordering bags of roses petals for a wedding, do it about 2 weeks before the event. Request them to be delivered 1-2 days before the event. Keep them in the bag and place them in your fridge until you're ready to use them."

Give the petals a gentle shake or turn the container(s) over. Then, put them back in the fridge immediately. [14] X Research source"
