      "title": "Choose between butter or shortening to grease your pan with.",
      "content": "Choose between butter or shortening to grease your pan with. Butter and shortening are the 2 most common fats used to grease baking pans. Butter will impart a slight richness to the batter and will help the exterior bake to a golden brown. Shortening is flavorless and the batter is less likely to brown. [1] X Research source Oil-based sprays and vegetable oil should not be used to grease the pan. Oil turns into a hard glaze when it is heated that can be tough to remove from the pan."

      "title": "Scoop up shortening with a pastry brush for a flavorless option.",
      "content": "Scoop up shortening with a pastry brush for a flavorless option. Gently dip your brush or paper towel into your shortening and pick up a glob about the size of a dollar coin. If your shortening is too hard, let it sit out at room temperature until it softens up enough to be pliable. [2] X Research source Leave your shortening within reach in case you need more for another pan. You can buy pastry brushes at most home goods stores."

      "title": "Open up a stick of unsalted butter for a smoother and richer pan lining.",
      "content": "Open up a stick of unsalted butter for a smoother and richer pan lining. Grab a new stick of unsalted butter from the package. Open up 1 side of the paper until about half of the butter stick is out. Leave the paper on the bottom half of the butter so you can hold it without getting your hands greasy. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub butter or shortening over the bottom and sides of your pan.",
      "content": "Rub butter or shortening over the bottom and sides of your pan. Spread a thin layer of your greasing agent onto the entire bottom of your pan. Make sure there are no holes in your layer. Go over every part of the pan at least once. Turn your pan on its side and apply your greasing agent to the sides of the pan as well.

    {
      "title": "Spray a thin layer of cooking spray on your pan if you are not baking.",
      "content": "Spray a thin layer of cooking spray on your pan if you are not baking. For normal stovetop pans and dishes, oil and cooking sprays are fine to use. Hold the spray can at least 5 inches (13 cm) away from your pan. Spray a thin layer of spray over the whole pan, making sure to coat the entire thing. [5] X Research source A recipe will not usually ask you to flour your pan for stovetop cooking."

    {
      "title": "Set aside some flour that is already used in your recipe.",
      "content": "Set aside some flour that is already used in your recipe. Various flour types can be used to flour the pan, but the rule of thumb is to use the flour that the recipe called for. This way you won't be altering the taste or composition of the batter. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose cocoa powder instead of flour for chocolate baked goods.",
      "content": "Choose cocoa powder instead of flour for chocolate baked goods. Flour is tasteless, but it can leave a white residue on baked goods, especially if they are chocolate ones. For chocolate cakes, muffins, or any baked good that has cocoa powder in it, set aside some cocoa powder in place of flour. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle flour or cocoa powder onto the pan.",
      "content": "Sprinkle flour or cocoa powder onto the pan. Add 1 or 2 tbsp. (15 to 30 ml) of flour or cocoa powder to the greased pan by pinching it in between your fingers and sprinkling it all over. Pick the pan up and tilt it about, allowing the flour to distribute and cover the entire interior of the pan. Invert the pan over the garbage or a sink and tap it gently with your hand to remove any excess flour. The flour or cocoa powder will stick to the greasing agent that youâ€™ve already put down. Flour and cocoa powder both act as a second barrier between your baked good and the pan. If your recipe calls for parchment paper in addition to greasing and flouring, put the parchment paper down on top of the grease and the flour or cocoa powder. It will act as another barrier between your baked good and the pan."

    {
      "title": "Pour your batter into the pan.",
      "content": "Pour your batter into the pan. Hold your bowl of batter directly over the pan. Gently pour it in, using a spoon if you need to scrape the bowl. The flour and grease will provide a non-stick layer so that your baked good does not stick to your pan. Bake your batter according to the recipe. Greasing and flouring your pan works better than using a non-stick oil spray."
