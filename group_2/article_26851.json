Before you make your own blueprints, it will be helpful for you to learn how to read other blueprints so you can make sure that yours has all of the necessary information and structure. You need to know how to read the standard scale, grid, lines, as well as the notes and legend. [1] X Research source Read the title blocks to know the blueprint’s name, location, site, and vendor so you can include the information when you make your own."

      "content": "Visualize the design of your structure. As you’re looking at other blueprints for inspiration, imagine what you’d like to design. How are you going to use the space? Picture the layout of the rooms, materials for flooring, placement of appliances and electrical outlets, as well as where you’d like to place windows and doors. [2] X Expert Source Steve Linton Custom Home Builder Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. [3] X Research source Think about how thick you want the exterior and interior walls to be. Don’t forget about hallways and entrance ways when you’re coming up with your design."

      "content": "Decide on a scale for your design. All blueprints are scaled representations of the design of a structure or layout. The key to having accurate blueprints is to use a consistent and precise scale for your design. The scale dictates the sizing measurements for the entire blueprint. [4] X Research source For example, you could choose 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) to represent 1 foot (0.30 m). Stick to the scale that you set for the whole design."

      "content": "Lay a 24 by 36 in (61 by 91 cm) sheet of tracing paper on a poster board. The poster board will act as a base for you to draw your blueprints on the tracing paper. Place the poster board down on a flat working surface like a table or desk and then lay the tracing paper on top of it with the long edge running horizontally. You can find large format tracing paper at craft supply stores or online."

      "title": "Create the exterior wall of your design.",
      "content": "Create the exterior wall of your design. First, you need to decide where you want the outer wall or border of your design to be and draw it to scale. Use your architect’s scale, a straight edge, and a pencil to draw the outer wall. Roughly center your design in the space on the tracing paper."

      "content": "Use a second line to show the width of the outer walls. After you complete the outer wall of your design, draw another line parallel to the first line to show how thick the outer walls will be. Use your architect's scale to make sure you follow a consistent scale. Most houses have an outer wall that is at least 6 inches (15 cm) thick."

Draw the lines to scale so the rooms and hallways are accurate. Draw 2 lines like you did for the exterior walls so you can indicate how thick the inner walls will be. For a home design blueprint, most interior walls are at least 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) thick. Think about the spaces that you’re making. You can use the walls to create bedrooms, hallways, a kitchen, or any other rooms that you want to include in your design.

      "content": "Finish the blueprint by adding dimension lines. The last thing you need to do is draw lines to indicate the lengths of the design elements. Start with the walls by adding lines about .5 inches (1.3 cm) from the edges of the walls in each room to show their length. Then add another line about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the exterior walls to show the total length. Add dimension lines for every room, window, closet, cabinets, and any appliances that you’ve added to your blueprint."
