Wear a red with bluish undertones if you have a cool skin tone or a red with orange undertones if you have a warm skin tone. [2] X Research source Don’t worry about wearing red lipstick if you hate makeup. You shouldn’t put up a false self: you want him to be attracted to who you are. If you're still in school, make sure you're allowed to wear makeup before you do it."

[8] X Research source You might ask, “What are your plans for the summer?” “What did you do last weekend?” or “What kind of music does your favorite band play?” If you're still in school, ask questions about your assignments, like \"Which topic did you choose for the research project?\" or \"Are you going to the school play auditions this year?\""

This will ensure that he sees your posts. Plus, it makes it easier for him to contact you by commenting on your post or sending you a direct message. [16] X Research source Don’t follow all of his accounts at once. Start with the platform you use most, then space out the others over a few days.

      "content": "Limit how often you post negative things on social media. It’s okay to sometimes post about negative events in your life when you need support or advice.

[19] X Research source For instance, it’s okay to post something like, “I had a hard day today, but I’m grateful for my friends,” or “Really needing support right now because I lost my dog today.” However, avoid rants about people you hate or polarizing issues, as well as comments like, “Everything always goes wrong,” or “People really suck.” Reader Poll: We asked 426 wikiHow readers if they thought putting away their phone enhances a date, and 89% of them said Yes.
