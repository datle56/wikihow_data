      "content": "This works best when you're going to be out in the sun. Mix equal parts lemon juice and water and spritz the mixture on your brows. You can also dip a cotton swab in the mixture and apply it that way. The sun activates the lightening properties of the lemon. [2] X Research source You'll get the best results if your brows are already a warm brown and you just want to lighten them a shade or two. The longer you're out in the sun, the lighter your brows will get, so be careful! It's a good idea to check them every 30 minutes or so, especially if you're planning on being outside for several hours. Use a wet washcloth to clean all the lemon juice off your brows when you're satisfied with the result. It's not common, but lemon juice can sometimes cause a rash when put directly on your skin and exposed to sunlight, a condition known as phytophotodermatitis.

      "content": "Dab honey onto your eyebrows and sit out in the sun. Honey has trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide in it, so it'll lighten your brows very gently when activated by the sun. For best results, use a spoolie to paint the honey evenly onto your brows. Leave it for 15-20 minutes, then wipe it off with a wet washcloth. If you want to go even lighter, you can always reapply the honey. The longer you stay out in the sun, the lighter your brows will get."

      "content": "Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water. Dip a cotton swab into your mixture, then rub it on your brows. Allow the solution to soak the hair, then leave it on for 15-20 minutes. [4] X Research source Vinegar's lightening properties are often more pronounced if you're out in the sun, but it'll still work even if you stay inside. Vinegar is highly acidic and can burn your skin. Don't leave it on your skin for more than 20 minutes and make sure you wash it off thoroughly afterward.

      "content": "Cut open about 10 chamomile tea bags. Pour boiling water directly onto the tea leaves and mix it until it forms a paste. Wet your brows first (it'll stick better), then spread the mixture over your brows so that all hairs are covered. Leave the mixture on your brows for several hours. Just wipe the mixture off with a wet washcloth when you're done. If you want them even lighter, feel free to do it again! [6] X Research source Covering your brows with cellophane adds heat so they'll lighten more quickly. Adding cinnamon enhances the lightening effects and honey will give you a thicker, more paste-like consistency."

      "title": "Use 3% hydrogen peroxide to permanently lighten your brows.",
      "content": "Use 3% hydrogen peroxide to permanently lighten your brows. Dip a cotton swab in the hydrogen peroxide and gently dab it onto your eyebrows until the hair is saturated. Watch out for drips! You might want to smear a little petroleum jelly under your brows to keep it out of your eyes. Leave it on your eyebrows for anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, then wipe off with a wet washcloth. [7] X Research source Since hydrogen peroxide is clear, you can watch your brows lightening so you'll know when to wipe it off. Fine, lighter brows will take far less time than thick, dark brows."

      "content": "Use a spoolie to brush concealer into your eyebrows. Brush the concealer into your eyebrows with your spoolie (that's just a clean mascara wand), taking care to make sure every strand is coated. Then, brush them with another wand or eyebrow comb to get out any clumps that make them look unnatural. [8] X Research source After you've got the look you want, dust your eyebrows with translucent powder to set the concealer. You'll usually need several layers of concealer to achieve the effect you're going for. Use different shades for best results, with the first layer being a shade or two lighter than your skin and the subsequent layers gradually darkening. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush in an eyebrow gel close to the color you want your brows to be.",
      "content": "Brush in an eyebrow gel close to the color you want your brows to be. It can take some experimenting to find the best eyebrow gel that gets your brows to the shade you want. To apply it, simply brush it onto your brows with the applicator that comes with the product. [10] X Research source Start with a thin layer. You can always apply more if you want them lighter, but if you get too much product on your brows by accident you'll have to take everything off and start over. If you have black or dark-brown brows, start with a shade that's one or two shades darker than the one you want, then layer a lighter shade over top of that. Use a brow pencil or a micro pencil to lighten your eyebrows as it's very small, and it's easier to work with compared to a thicker pencil or eyebrow gel."

      "content": "Mix permanent hair color with hydrogen peroxide to control color. Brush or comb your eyebrows up so that you can get to the roots. Then, add 2 or 3 drops of hydrogen peroxide to the hair color of your choice. [11] X Research source Dab the solution lightly on your brows with a cotton swab. [12] X Research source Let the color process for about 15 minutes, then roll a cotton swab over your brows and wipe it off on a paper towel to remove the hair color. After you've gotten the bulk of the hair color off of your brows, wipe them with a wet paper towel to remove the rest. [13] X Research source Use vegetable-based dyes so they don't damage your brow hair. [14] X Research source Do an allergy test before you put the color on your brows, even if you've used the same color on your hair. The hair in your eyebrows can be very different from the hair on your head, and the skin on your face may react differently than your scalp would. [15] X Research source"
