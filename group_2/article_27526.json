This lava does not last very long, but it is fun and exciting to watch as it foams out of your volcano. Here is what you will need: A homemade volcano, plastic bottle, bowl, cup, or jar ½ cup (64 grams) baking soda ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of vinegar Food coloring, glow-in-the-dark paint, or fluorescent paint Dish soap Water"

      "title": "Build your volcano.",
      "content": "Build your volcano. Find a plastic bottle and take the cap off. Set the bottle down on a flat surface and wrap clay around it until you get a cone shape. You can do this by putting more clay on the base of the bottle and less clay at the top. Do not cover the top of the bottle; leave it open so that you can pour the ingredients inside. You can then decorate your volcano with fake plants, rocks, paint, and plastic animals. Let the clay dry before making the lava. You can use any type of clay you want. You can also use plasticine or paper mache. You can also make a simple \"volcano\" by using a tall glass or an empty bottle."

      "content": "Mix your liquid ingredients. You will need at least ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of vinegar, a few drops of liquid dish soap, and a few drops of water. The more vinegar you use, the more dish soap you will need. The dish soap will not only make the lava fuller, but also make it last longer. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider making colored or glowing lava.",
      "content": "Consider making colored or glowing lava. You can make your lava look like real lava by adding a few drops of food coloring to the vinegar. You can also make glowing lava by adding 1 teaspoon of glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint to the vinegar. Be sure to stir the vinegar well to make sure that the food coloring or paint is completely mixed. [2] X Research source If you are using glow-in-the-dark paint, you will need to \"charge\" it by setting it in the sun or under a bright lamp for a few minutes. Once the paint is charged, you will need to turn off the lights in order to make it glow. If you are using fluorescent paint, you will need a black light. Once you have the paint and vinegar all mixed, you will need to turn off the regular lights and turn on the black light. You can purchase a black light online or in an arts and crafts store, and switch out one of the light bulbs at home with the black light. If you are a child, please ask an adult to help you with this step. You can make your lava any color you want, but red, orange, and yellow will give you the most realistic-looking lava. You can make the lava even more exciting by adding in some sparkly glitter!"
