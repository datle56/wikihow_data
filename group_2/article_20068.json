If you have bald spots or areas where the beard doesn’t reach your sideburns, try giving it some more time to grow.

Expect to grow your beard for 3-6 months before it looks full. If you’ve only been growing for a month, then the beard definitely won’t look connected yet unless your hair grows very fast."

      "title": "Keep your beard short so patchy sections aren’t as noticeable.",
      "content": "Keep your beard short so patchy sections aren’t as noticeable. In addition to growing the beard longer to hide patches, you can also use the opposite approach and shorten it. In some cases, a longer beard makes bare patches more noticeable. Trimming the beard and leaving it short doesn’t make those patches stand out as much. Your beard might look connected even if it’s not.

You could also have your barber do it so the result is as even as possible. This works best if you have lighter hair, or a skin tone that’s close to your hair color."

      "content": "Brush your sideburns and mustache toward your beard to connect them. If you have curly or wavy hair, there might be noticeable gaps where the beard doesn’t connect with your sideburns or mustache. Try styling it to cover those gaps. Brush your sideburns and mustache down, towards the beard. This could cover up spots where the beard doesn’t connect. [5] X Research source Use a special beard brush to avoid damaging the hair. If your beard won’t stay in place after brushing, try using some beard balm while you brush to stop it from moving."

      "content": "Shave your beard to a point that it does connect at so it's even. Sometimes, your beard might reach your sideburns in one thin spot but not the others. This makes the beard look uneven and disconnected. You can style the beard around this. Use a razor or your trimmer and shave the beard back to the point where it reaches your sideburns. Do the same with your sideburns so the beard and sideburns meet at an even point. You’ll then have a nice, even spot that the beard connects to. [6] X Research source Remember to maintain this trim if you do it. Otherwise, the beard will look unkempt when the hair starts growing back in. If you don't think you can shave the beard this closely, let your barber do it."

      "content": "Get a skin fade at the barber shop to hide the disconnected area. A skin fade is a hairstyle that makes your hair and beard progressively shorter as they approach each other. It’s a good hairstyle to cover up if your beard and sideburns don’t connect. Next time you get a haircut, ask the barber to give you this cut and see if it covers the patches better. [7] X Research source The hairstyle can accommodate lots of different beard and hair lengths. Whether you have a bushy beard or just stubble, it will look good if the barber fades it correctly."

If none of these solutions satisfy you or cover the gaps well enough, then you can try out a different beard style. A goatee, for instance, only requires chin hair, so patchiness isn’t a problem. Explore other beard styles to see if another one works for you. [9] X Research source Some other unconnected beard types include: a Van Dyke, with pointed chin hair and a mustache that don't connect; an anchor, which rounds out the chin hair with a mustache; and balbo, which extends the chin hair slightly up onto the cheeks. Experiment to see which suits you best."

      "content": "Condition your beard after you wash it to keep it soft. Keeping your beard conditioned prevents it from getting straggly and tangled.

[11] X Research source Keeping your beard conditioned makes brushing it easier as well. This way, you can cover up and patches or disconnected spots. If you just have stubble or a short beard, you probably don't need conditioning."

[12] X Research source If your beard is short, you can oil it every 2 days. If it’s longer or you live in a dry climate, oil it every day."
