      "content": "Choose a soap that's easy to rinse away. Most bar soaps are fine to use. Body washes are also acceptable as long as they don't leave a residue. You may add soap to one of the basins to create a bowl of warm, soapy water for washing, or keep the soap separate and apply it directly to the patient's skin. [2] X Research source Avoid using soap that has exfoliating beads or other substances that could end up staying on the patient's skin and causing irritation. No-rinse soaps are available at drug stores. This is a convenient solution for a quick cleanse, but they leave a residue so you'll still need to rinse the patient's body from time to time."
