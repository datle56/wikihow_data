      "content": "Purchase 4 oz (110 g) each of sushi grade salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. The fish you use to make sashimi needs to be incredibly fresh. Go to a fish market and purchase sushi grade salmon, tuna, or yellowtail. Do not buy fish that is not considered safe to eat raw! [1] X Research source If there is no fish market in your area, try visiting an Asian market that has a seafood counter or ask the employees at your grocery store’s fish counter if they have any sushi grade fish available. Keep in mind that this usually just means the fish was previously frozen to kill any parasites. [2] X Research source Tell the fish monger or fish counter employee that you are making sashimi and ask them to cut it into a sashimi block so that you only have to purchase what you need to make sashimi."

      "content": "Cook 8 oz (230 g) of sushi rice to top with individual slices of sashimi. Rice is optional for sashimi, but it is a nice complement. Cook the rice according to the package’s instructions. Then, let the rice cool completely before using it. Mold the rice into 1 in (2.5 cm) sized balls. [3] X Research source You may season the rice with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of rice vinegar, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and ¾ of a tablespoon (12 g) of sugar if desired, or leave it plain."

      "title": "Get a very sharp knife.",
      "content": "Get a very sharp knife. Your knife needs to be razor sharp to cut sashimi properly. Choose the sharpest knife you have or sharpen a knife before you cut the sashimi if needed. [4] X Research source Avoid using a serrated knife since this will rip and tear at the fish. The goal is to cut the fish in a single motion and to keep the edges as smooth as possible."

      "title": "Coat the block of tuna with sesame oil and cilantro and sear it.",
      "content": "Coat the block of tuna with sesame oil and cilantro and sear it. This is optional, but it is a nice way to add flavor to the fish. Coat the outside of the block of tuna with sesame oil and then press it into fresh chopped cilantro leaves. Heat a non-stick frying pan over high heat and place the tuna onto the pan. Let the block cook on the first side for 15 seconds, and then rotate the block 45 degrees to turn it onto the next side. [5] X Research source Continue to rotate the block and cook for 15 seconds on each side until all 4 sides of the block have been cooked. Then, remove the block of fish from the pan and place it back onto your cutting board. If desired, you may do this for the salmon and yellowtail as well, or you may only sear the tuna."

      "content": "Cut the fish into 0.25 to 0.5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) slices. Place each of your raw or seared blocks of fish onto a clean cutting board. Then, begin cutting a block into slices. Cut straight across the fish with 1 motion. Repeat to the end of the fish block. [6] X Research source When you cut the salmon, hold the knife at a 45 degree angle to the cutting board. Then, cut the fish down towards the board at the angle to create slices that are slightly angled. Make sure to cut with the grain so that each slice will have several lines running across it. Do not saw back and forth across the fish! This will rip the fish and it may ruin the shape of your slices. If the knife is not sharp enough to cut the first slice with 1 motion, sharpen it or get a new knife."

The slices should appear to be overlapping each other like a hand of poker cards or dominoes that have fallen over. [7] X Research source Do this for each type of fish."

Place the shredded veggies into a bowl or plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator until you are ready for them. Put 1 pile of each kind of shredded veggie you are using on the plate. [8] X Research source If you are only using 1 type of veggie, then place it in the center of the plate. If you are using 2 or more kinds of shredded veggies, arrange them in a row in the center of the plate."

For example, place the lemon next to the daikon, the avocado next to the shredded cucumber, and the sliced cucumber next to the shredded carrots."

Once you have finished arranging the veggies and other additions in a pleasing manner, add the sashimi slices to the plate. Place the sashimi slices so that they are halfway between the beds of shredded veggies and the sliced sashimi complements. [10] X Research source Consider the color of the fish when choosing where to place it. For example, you might place the red tuna on top of the white daikon radish, the orange salmon on top of the shredded cucumber, and the white yellowtail on top of the shredded carrots. If you are serving your sashimi slices on rice balls, place individual slices of sashimi onto each of the rice balls or keep the rice separate and combine the rice and fish as you eat 1 piece at a time."
