      "content": "Click the checkbox option. In the Bulleted List drop-down menu, select the checkbox option. This will insert a checkbox where your cursor is in the text box. Note that the checkboxes will behave exactly like a bulleted list, meaning you can indent and format them the same way. This is great for creating a presentation that needs a checklist."
