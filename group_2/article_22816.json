If you close Snapchat, it will show the last location you were active at. [4] X Research source To enable and disable location-sharing, tap the wheel icon in the top right corner of your Snap Map. Toggle the “Ghost Mode” button to the right to stop sharing your location. It will look green when your location is not being shared."
