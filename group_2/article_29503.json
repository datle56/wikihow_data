      "content": "Measure the space you will be putting your clothes rack in. It is important that you measure your space so that you know how much PVC and other materials you will need. Also, measure the length of the clothes you envision hanging on this rack to plan accordingly for the height. Keep in mind that the longer the clothes rack, the less sturdy it will be."

      "title": "Buy your materials.",
      "content": "Buy your materials. PVC pipe can generally be found at any hardware store. You will need PVC pipe of any desired diameter (although 1\" diameter is recommended), two elbow pieces, four caps, and four tee pieces. If your hardware store does not cut PVC, you will also need a PVC cutter."

    {
      "title": "Cut your PVC pipe.",
      "content": "Cut your PVC pipe. You can usually have this step done at the hardware store. You will need your PVC pipe cut into a total of ten pieces. You will need two pieces cut to the desired length. For the height, you will need to split it into 1/3 and 2/3s. Four equal pieces of any length will be cut for the feet, but the longer they are the sturdier the rack will be."

      "title": "Paint your PVC pipe.",
      "content": "Paint your PVC pipe. PVC on its own is not appealing to look at, there are serial codes on the sides and usually, barcodes as well so paint is recommended. There are multiple ways to go about painting PVC pipes, but the easiest and cheapest way is to spray paint them. You can also reuse any wall paint or even use acrylic paint. Acrylic is not advised since it will be hard to get an even finish, you will need multiple coats, and it will add up in cost."
