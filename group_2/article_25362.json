      "content": "Ask yourself how well you know and trust your partner. Sex is an intimate act, so it is important to make sure that the person you have sex with is someone that you trust and know well. If you do not know and trust your partner, then you may not want to engage in sex with this person. Some questions you can ask yourself include: [1] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. Do you trust your partner? You should feel confident that your partner is a basically good person who wouldn't do anything to hurt or humiliate you. This can be hard to gauge, but here's a metric to try: If you wouldn't trust them with any of your private thoughts or secrets, then you probably shouldn't be sleeping together. Is your relationship mature enough to include sex? If the majority of your interactions with your partner focus on superficial things, then incorporating sex might be a bad idea. If, on the other hand, you feel like you and your partner help each other grow and improve as people, then you might consider moving on to having sex. Can you discuss sex with your partner? Think about whether or not you'll be able to talk about things such as contraception, STIs, basic anatomy and other sex-related topics with your partner. If you can't comfortably have this discussion with them before you have sex, then reconsider whether it’s the right choice. Would you be violating your partner's beliefs? In addition to considering your beliefs and values, think about what your partner believes as well. If they might be subject to shunning or punishment for having sex with you, it might be best to hold off. Will you be embarrassed later about sleeping with this person? This might sound silly, but try to think ahead a few years. If you were no longer dating this person, would you be embarrassed to describe them to your future partner? If the answer is \"yes\" or \"maybe,\" consider holding out for something better."
