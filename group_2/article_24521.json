      "content": "VR headsets do not seem to cause serious eye problems. VR headsets are pretty new technology, so there aren't many long-term studies on their effects on eyesight. [1] X Research source Researchers at the University of Auckland's School of Optometry and Vision Science have found that short-term use of VR headsets doesn't seem to cause myopia (nearsightedness) [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source , and a more recent study also suggests that short-term VR use did not negatively impact eyesight any more than using a smartphone for the same amount of time. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, prolonged VR use can lead to minor short-term eye issues, including: Eye strain. Dr. Hartl explains that focusing on any close screens for prolonged periods of time, including a VR headset, can lead to eye strain . \"When we focus at close distances, we do so by constricting a muscle in our eye that changes the shape of our intraocular lens and allows the change of focus from distance to near,\" she explains. \"If we focus all day on close devices, a muscle in our eyes must constrict all day long and eventually fatigues and aches. This is the dull pain that we associate with eye strain.\" Dry eyes. Fixating on any screen for an extended period of time can lead to dry eyes. The longer you wear your VR headset, the less often you blink, and blinking is what keeps your eyes moist. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source This is especially problematic for people who wear contacts while using VR. Blurred vision. Your vision may seem cloudy or blurred after using VR for a prolonged period of time. Fortunately, this effect is usually temporary. [5] X Research source Eye twitching. VR environments often contain a lot of fast-moving objects and rapid light changes, which can cause your eyes to move and adjust quickly. According to Meta, the developers of the Oculus VR headsets, about 1 out of every 4000 users may experience involuntary eye twitching as a result of prolonged VR usage.

      "content": "Prolonged exposure to any screen can lead to eye problems in children. While there aren't many studies on the long-term vision effects of VR in children, there is plenty of evidence that prolonged exposure to video games and electronic screens can negatively impact children's eyes. Studies show that prolonged use of video games (30 minutes or more per day) by children under ten may compromise the development of their visual pathways. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It's also possible that prolonged VR headset use can negatively impact a child's hand-eye coordination, at least in the short term. [8] X Research source Fortunately, VR-specific studies have not yet found that VR headsets specifically are found to induce myopia (nearsightedness). [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Proper fit is important . Improper VR headset fit can cause eye discomfort in smaller children due to their eyes being too small to properly align with some headsets. [10] X Research source An improper fit can lead to eye strain, blurry vision, headaches, and nausea. To ensure your child's safety when using VR, make sure they take frequent breaks (at least every 15-20 minutes) when using their VR headsets. Most VR devices recommend that children under the age of 13 not use their products. [11] X Research source"

Dr. Rajesh Khanna recommends taking a break at least every 20 minutes to look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds. If your eyes start to hurt, you feel nauseous and dizzy, or your vision starts to blur, take a break right away. [12] X Research source"

Many VR apps also have comfort settings that can reduce the amount of motion you experience (i.e., teleport movement, snap turning, vision vignettes) to make the experience more comfortable.

Together, these two images create a stereoscopic (or 3D) image. In addition to creating 3D images, VR also uses motion-sensing technology to allow you to look around and even move around in the 3D environment. [18] X Research source"
