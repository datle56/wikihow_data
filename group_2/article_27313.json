      "content": "Melt beef tallow, coconut oil, and castor oil in a slow cooker. Weigh out 440 g (16 oz) of rendered beef tallow , 200 g (7.1 oz) of castor oil, and 160 g (5.6 oz) of coconut oil into a bowl on a kitchen scale. Then transfer the oils to the slow cooker and turn the heat setting to Low. Stir the oils occasionally to ensure they melt evenly and don't burn. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix lye with distilled water and stir until dissolved. Weigh out 117 g (4.1 oz) of lye and 306 g (10.8 oz) of distilled water into two separate bowls. Put on disposable or kitchen gloves, a long-sleeved shirt or jacket, and safety goggles, then pour the lye slowly into the water. Mix the two substances with a spoon until the lye is dissolved. [2] X Research source DO NOT pour the water onto the lye, as this will cause a chemical reaction in which the lye will explode out of the bowl. [3] X Research source Lye is a caustic substance, so always wear protective gear when working with it. If you're using it inside your home, open windows and vents and turn on fans to provide more ventilation. If possible, handle the lye outside your home where the fumes can ventilate into the fresh air. If any lye comes into contact with your skin, immediately flush that area of your body with water for 15 minutes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the lye water into the oils and blend until it reaches trace. While still wearing your gloves and other safety gear, transfer the lye and water mixture into the oils and stir it in with a spoon. Then blend the oils and lye mixture with an immersion blender until you achieve soap trace, which is the point at which the oils and lye no longer separate. [5] X Research source If you notice oil streaks in the mixture, it hasn't reached trace yet. Soap trace has a cake batter consistency and a uniform cream color. It generally takes about 30-60 seconds to get to this point. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook the mixture on low for 3 hours. Cover the slow cooker pot with a lid and cook the trace oil and lye mixture on low for 3 hours. When it's done, the mixture will have a thick, gel-like consistency. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Add alcohol and glycerin to the soap and blend until combined.",
      "content": "Add alcohol and glycerin to the soap and blend until combined. Weigh out 300 g (11 oz) of alcohol and 133 g (4.7 oz) of glycerin separately and pour them into the slow cooker. Then use your immersion blender to blend the ingredients together and break up the thick soap until the mixture has a liquid consistency. Then cover and cook the mixture for 30 more minutes. [8] X Research source Ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol are the most common choices of alcohol in soapmaking. The only difference is ethyl alcohol is food-grade, whereas isopropyl alcohol is not. [9] X Research source You can either make your own glycerin or purchase glycerin online."

      "title": "Make a sugar syrup on the stove and add it to the soap mixture.",
      "content": "Make a sugar syrup on the stove and add it to the soap mixture. Weigh out approximately 56 g (2.0 oz) of sugar and 124 g (4.4 oz) of distilled water. Combine them in a saucepan on the stove, turn the burner on low, and stir the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved. At this point, weigh out 16 g (0.56 oz) of sugar syrup and then slowly stir it into the soap mixture in the crockpot. [10] X Research source However much sugar syrup you add, make sure it's at least 2% of the total amount of oils. For example, in this recipe, the total weight of the tallow and oils combined is 800 g (28 oz), so 2% of that amount is 16 g (0.56 oz). [11] X Research source Adding sugar syrup to your soap will increase the lather it creates when you wash with it in a process called saponification. It's also optional, so if you prefer less lather, feel free to leave the sugar out of this recipe."

      "content": "Add drops of essential oil to the soap mixture for fragrance (optional). You can add drops of essential oil equal to 3% of the total weight of oils you used to make your soap. For this recipe, 3% of 800 g (28 oz) (the total weight of oils and tallow combined) is 24 g (0.85 oz). [12] X Research source Avoid using non-skin-safe oils like citrus oils (lemon, orange, or grapefruit) and cumin oil. Some essential oils that are safe to use in soap on your skin are lavender , chamomile , eucalyptus , and sage . [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Check if the soap is transparent, then transfer it to the molds. Dip the bottom of a small, heat-safe jar into the soap and let it coat the bottom. Lift the jar out, and if the soap on the bottom of it is mostly clear, it's ready to transfer to your molds. Turn off the slow cooker and ladle the soap into your soap molds , filling them up to the top (or to your desired height for your soap bars). [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the soap cool and set, then remove it from the molds and cure it.",
      "content": "Let the soap cool and set, then remove it from the molds and cure it. Use a soap-cutting tool to slice the soap into bar-sized pieces, then separate them onto a baking sheet or a rack in a cool, dry place to cure for at least 4 weeks. The curing process will dry up any remaining moisture and help the soap hold its shape for use. [15] X Research source Williams recommends using a soap cutter with a wavy edge to cut your soap, but she says a regular knife or a wire cutter will work just as well."

      "title": "Melt the glycerin soap base in the microwave.",
      "content": "Melt the glycerin soap base in the microwave. Slice 1 block of glycerin soap base (equal to 1 lb (450 g)) into small pieces that will be easier to melt. Place the glycerin pieces in a microwave-safe bowl and heat it in 30-second increments in the microwave until all the glycerin is melted. [16] X Research source Stir the glycerin and check its temperature with a kitchen thermometer between each turn in the microwave. Melt-and-pour bases start to burn when they reach between 140–150 °F (60–66 °C). If the temperature of the glycerin is nearing 140 °F (60 °C), but there are still small unmelted chunks in it, stir the mixture with a whisk or spatula to break up those last few pieces. Williams recommends using a melt-and-pour heating pot that will melt the soap base for you."

      "content": "Stir essential oil into the soap base to add fragrance (optional). Add just a few drops of the oil; since it's so concentrated, a little goes a long way. Use a spoon to stir the drops directly into the melted soap base until you no longer see any oil streaks. [17] X Research source Add no more essential oil than 3% of the weight of your melt-and-pour base. For example, if you melted 1 block of glycerin soap base, that weighs approximately 454 g (16.0 oz). 3% of 454 g (16.0 oz) is roughly 13 g (0.46 oz), so that's how much essential oil is safe to add to your soap.

Once you pour the soap, if you notice any bubbles on the surface, spritz them lightly with rubbing alcohol and the bubbles will disappear.

Williams suggests wrapping the soap in wax paper to store it, saying, \"It [the wax paper] protects the texture of the soap and its integrity with the oils.\""

This is a great way to personalize soaps to make favors for baby showers or kids' birthday parties, or to match your bathroom décor. Consider the following options: [21] X Research source Make floral soaps by suspending dried flower petals in the liquid soap before you pour it into the molds. Make birthday party soaps by filling the molds halfway and then inserting a small toy, like a tiny plastic animal in the center of the soap. Pour more soap over the toy to cover it completely. Make baby shower soaps by pouring soap into the molds and inserting small plastic rattles or other baby items into it."

If you use an item that's usually used to make food, be sure to wash it thoroughly before you use it again. Ice cube trays make excellent soap molds. Use simple square trays or buy trays with interesting shapes, like fish, shells or skulls. To make larger soaps, use small plastic bowls or cups. You could also use a recycled plastic container, like a yogurt cup."

Next, dip a length of string into the liquid, remove it from the bowl, and let the liquid cool and harden. Dip it again to add a second coating, then remove it from the liquid and let the second layer cool and harden. Continue dipping the soap in this manner until the soap on a rope reaches your desired thickness. [22] X Research source Get creative with the material you use for your rope. Rather than dipping a straight length of rope into the glycerin, try tying it into a loop or a knot to create soap in different shapes. Hang the rope from your shower head so it's handy to use each time you take a shower. [23] X Research source"
