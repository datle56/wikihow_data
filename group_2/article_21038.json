      "content": "Passion, relevance, and evidence are all components of good topics. Your passion and expertise on the topic may be the most important—people are more likely to be persuaded by someone who knows what they’re talking about and cares about the outcome. (Plus, you’ll probably enjoy yourself more if you’re presenting on something that really matters to you.) Besides passion, a good persuasive speech topic is: [12] X Research source Timely and relevant: Is this something that is on people’s minds right now? Somewhat controversial: Is this something that’s emotionally charged or that people are opinionated about? (Note: “Controversial” does not mean “offensive.”) Complex: Does the topic have layers to it, or can the audience already predict where you’re going? Supported by evidence: Are there data and facts to support your claims? Appropriate for the audience: Does your topic resonate with their interests and concerns?"

In either case, research different opinions and data about your topic so you’re very familiar with both its supporting and opposing arguments. Gather as much information as you can before starting an outline or draft of your speech. [13] X Research source Once you’ve got all the facts, write your thesis statement . This is your main argument in one sentence. For example, “School uniforms should not be required because they don’t positively impact academic performance or behavior.” Your audience will be able to tell if you’re prepared and knowledgeable about the topic. If you appear unsure or your research is weak, you’ll have a harder time persuading them to agree with you."

[14] X Research source Muñoz recommends starting with a personal anecdote: “Say the opposite of what you're going to be persuading them on to make it really stand out in their mind, like ‘Wow, is he/she really saying this?’ Speak from your heart and make sure you really connect to people, that you really look them in the eyes, that you really talk to them, that you're speaking very specifically about your topic.

After your intro, walk the audience through the problems you’re describing, using evidence from your research to prove they’re a real issue. Explain what causes these problems and then propose solutions that relate back to your thesis statement. Include details on how your solution should ideally be executed, how long it may take, and any other relevant information. [15] X Research source For example, you could state that “School uniforms suppress self-expression” is a problem and use a student survey as evidence. Then, explain the cause: “Forcing everyone to wear the same thing limits creativity and personal expression at school.” End with a solution: “Eliminating uniforms allows students to dress more authentically.” You can also address any relevant counterarguments in a similar way: state what the counterargument or problem is, then use evidence to explain why it’s a weak or false argument and why your solution will work instead."

This could be a loose summary for casual presentations, or a restatement of your thesis for formal speeches. Try ending with a final statement that leaves your audience thinking about your ideas—this is the last thing they’ll hear, so aim to make it impactful!

Practice singing it, try going as fast or slow or loud as you can, and jump around while you do it. Do anything you can do to get out of [your head] and into your body.” He continues, “Make sure there are no physical tics that give you away…and you're using a warm, centered voice.” If you struggle with mumbling , Muñoz advises to “Slow down and over-enunciate.

[17] X Research source Muñoz adds, “Make sure you're standing up and you're very centered. Make sure you're breathing, make sure you're physically relaxed. All of those things can really help you give a great speech.”"
