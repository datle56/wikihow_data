      "content": "Fold your pants in half vertically. Lay your pants flat on a table so the front side is face-up. Fold the pants in half so the legs line up and the hand pockets are on the inside. Smooth out the fabric to get rid of any wrinkles or creases where the legs are bunched up. [1] X Research source If you’re not able to smooth out all the wrinkles by hand, iron your pants before putting them on the hanger. A simple hanger fold works best for jeans or slacks."

      "content": "Hook a hanger on your closet rod. If you have other clothes hanging in your closet, push them out of the way so you have space to hang your pants. Rather than using a standard triangular hanger, try an L-shaped hanger that's open on one side so it's easier to slide the pants off of it. [2] X Expert Source Joanne Gruber Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 30 July 2019. Avoid using wire hangers because they could distort from the weight of your pants and leave wrinkles in the fabric."

      "content": "Drape the pants over the hanger’s horizontal bar. Slip the waistband through the middle of the hanger, and drape your pants over the bar. Pull the waistband down so it lines up with the cuffs at the ends of your pants’ legs. Be sure to take everything out of your pants pockets before hanging them because your items could drop onto the floor. If you’re hanging jeans, hook 1 or 2 of the belt loops around the hanger’s hook to prevent the heavy denim from slipping. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust your pants until they don't slide off.",
      "content": "Adjust your pants until they don't slide off. If you notice that your pants are slipping off the hanger, then one side is heavier than the other. If the side with the waistband is causing the pants to slip, gently pull on the legs. If the pants are slipping on the side with the legs, then tug on the waistband. Keep adjusting the position of your pants until they balance on the bar without slipping. [4] X Research source If your pants are still sliding off, try clipping them to the horizontal bar with a clothespin or two."

      "title": "Add velvet or hot glue to the hanger’s bar if your pants keep slipping.",
      "content": "Add velvet or hot glue to the hanger’s bar if your pants keep slipping. If you don’t already have non-slip hangers , attach the velvet or put a line of hot glue along the bottom bar of a plastic or wooden hanger. The addition will help create more friction so your pants are less likely to slide or fall off. [5] X Research source To add velvet strips to your hanger, cut a piece of velvet with adhesive backing to the length of the bottom bar. Peel the backing off the velvet and stick it to the top of the hanger’s bar. If you use hot glue, simply draw a zigzag or squiggly line along the center of the bar."

      "content": "Hold the pants upside down by cuffs. Hold onto your pants so they’re upside-down and your fingers are on the outer leg seams. Position your thumbs on the inseams and ensure they face each other. [6] X Research source The Savile Row fold uses a standard hanger and prevents fabrics on like silk from slipping, so this works great for dress pants."

      "content": "Place the hanger between the pant legs. Place a standard plastic or wooden hanger on a rod or hook so it’s easier to work with. Hold up the two pant legs up to the hanger so the horizontal bar hangs between the ankle cuffs."

Tug the leg down until the ankle cuff lines up with the crotch and the pants hang evenly on the hanger.

      "title": "Fold your pants in half if they’re too wide or too long.",
      "content": "Fold your pants in half if they’re too wide or too long. If your pants are wider than your hanger with clips , fold them in half vertically so the legs line up. If you don’t have a lot of vertical space in your closet, fold your pants in half vertically and then again horizontally so the ankle cuffs and waistband line up. [9] X Research source Run your hands over your pants after folding them to smooth out any creases or wrinkles."

      "title": "Clip the pants to the hanger by their waistband.",
      "content": "Clip the pants to the hanger by their waistband. Move the clips on the hanger’s horizontal bar so they’re about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the outside edge of the waistband. Pinch the top of the clips to open them. Place the pants inside of the clips and release them to secure the waistband inside. If you folded your pants in half horizontally, then clip your pants on the leg fold instead. Hangers with clips work for any type of pants, including jeans, slacks, and dress pants. Because many hanger clips have grooves or teeth on them, they can leave marks and imprints in soft fabrics, such as leather and pleather. Place 2 index cards inside of each clip to protect your fabric."

      "content": "Place the cuffs between the bars. Hold your pants upside-down by the ankle cuffs and place them in between the open bars on your hanger. Avoid hanging your pants by the waistband with a clamp hanger because bulky pieces, like the buttons and zippers, get in the way and prevent the hanger from closing completely."
