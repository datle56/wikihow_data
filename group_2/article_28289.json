Cover the entire surface with newspaper so you don't accidentally damage the surface with glue.

      "content": "Stir 3 parts craft glue with 1 part water in an old plastic container. Use an ice block stick to mix the water and glue until they are fully combined. To make 2 large yarns balloons, mix ¾ cup (180 mL) of liquid craft glue with ¼ cup (60 mL) of water. [2] X Research source Increase or decrease the quantity of glue solution according to how many yarn balloons you wish to make."

      "content": "Use water balloons, if you want very small yarn balloons. These balloons will create cute egg-shaped decorations and are perfect for garlands. Purchase water balloons in the toy section of a general store. [3] X Research source Check the measurements of the water balloons on the packet, as sizes vary between brands. Water balloons are often sold at toy stores, but you may also find them in a seasonal aisle at a grocery store or dollar store when the weather is warm."

      "content": "Opt for party-sized balloons if you want larger yarn balls. Party-sized balloons are the type that you see most often at birthday parties and other celebrations. Use these to create classic balloon-shaped decorations. [4] X Research source You can find these balloons anywhere that party supplies are sold. If you want to make a medium-sized yarn ball, simply blow the balloons up partially."

      "title": "Blow up the balloons, but don't fill them all the way.",
      "content": "Blow up the balloons, but don't fill them all the way. Avoid blowing the balloons up to capacity as this can cause them to pop while the yarn is drying. Once you have blown up the balloons, keep them out of the sun to avoid them popping from the heat. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dunk approximately 60 centimetres (24 in) of yarn into the glue mixture.",
      "content": "Dunk approximately 60 centimetres (24 in) of yarn into the glue mixture. Find the end of the yarn and gather about 60 centimetres (24 in) of yarn. Make sure that the yarn is fully submerged in the glue to ensure that it will stick evenly to the balloon. [6] X Research source Don’t cut the yarn yet, as you will need to use more yarn later. Any type of yarn fibre can be used for this task. Experiment with different textures and colours to vary the look of your yarn balloons."

      "title": "Wrap the wet yarn around the balloon in different directions.",
      "content": "Wrap the wet yarn around the balloon in different directions. Place the end of the yarn next to the neck of the balloon and then wrap the yarn vertically around the balloon. Ensure that the yarn lays flat against the balloon so that it will dry in a perfect balloon shape. Vary the direction of your wraps to create a lattice effect. [7] X Research source Keep wrapping the balloon until you run out of wet yarn."

      "content": "Cut the yarn once you have covered 80% of the balloon. Use a pair of scissors to trim the end of the yarn. Rinse the scissors in water straight away to avoid the blades getting stuck together. [9] X Research source Make the cut at least 1 centimetre (0.39 in) away from the balloon to avoid accidentally puncturing it."

      "title": "Tuck the end of the yarn under another piece of yarn.",
      "content": "Tuck the end of the yarn under another piece of yarn. Lift up a piece of the yarn that you wrapped around the balloon, and slip the very end of the string beneath it. This helps to secure the yarn. If it is not staying in place, dab a drop of glue over the end to help it stay in place. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the wet yarn balloon on wax paper to dry for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Place the wet yarn balloon on wax paper to dry for 24 hours. Wax paper is a non-stick surface, meaning that the yarn balloon won’t stick to it when it dries. If the yarn still feels tacky after 24 hours, leave it to dry for another day. [11] X Research source Place the wet yarn balloon and wax paper in a non-windy area to ensure that they don’t blow away. Never leave the yarn balloons on newspaper, as the glue will cause the newspaper to stick to the yarn."

      "content": "Pop the balloon with a needle. Hold the balloon securely in one hand and use your other hand to poke the needle into the inflated balloon. Watch the balloon pull away from the yarn to reveal a beautiful egg-shaped ball. [12] X Research source If you don’t have a needle on hand, use a sharp craft knife to pop the balloon."
