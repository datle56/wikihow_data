For this battery, you will need one unopened can of soda (any type will do), one plastic cup (6 to 8 ounces), and one 3/4-inch-wide strip of copper that's slightly longer than the height of the cup. In addition, you'll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and two electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends. [1] X Research source If you don't already have these materials around your house, you can purchase them at a hardware store nearby. You can substitute the copper strip with several pieces of copper wire stuck together or bent in a zig-zag fashion to reach the desired width."

      "content": "Cut a strip of aluminum from the soda can. Cut a 3/4-inch-wide strip from the side of the soda can. Ensure that's it's slightly longer than the plastic cup's height; if this isn't possible, don't worry — you can just bend the top of the strip and let it hang over the edge of the cup and into the fluid. Instead of cutting the can, you may purchase aluminum strips from a hardware store. Aluminum foil is not an effective replacement for an aluminum strip; don't use it!"

      "content": "Sand the aluminum strip (optional). You can skip this step if you bought the aluminum from a hardware store. If you cut the strip from a soda can, you'll need to sand off the coatings (i.e. paint, plastic) on both sides of the strip."

      "title": "Place the strips into the solution.",
      "content": "Place the strips into the solution. Ensure that the strips do not touch each other. Place them across from each other — not side by side or overlapping — in the cup. Ideally you've cut the strips long enough that their tops sit above the soda, extending slightly past the rim of the cup. If the strips do not extend past the cup's rim, you can bend each strip lightly so that it hangs off the edge of the cup."

      "content": "Gather your materials. For this battery, you'll need one plastic cup (6 to 8 ounces), two 3/4-inch-wide strips of metal that are taller than the cup, and one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of salt. Each strip must be a different type of metal, but you can choose which type: zinc, aluminum, and copper are popular choices. In addition, you'll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and 2 electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends. A variation on this recipe is to add one teaspoon (4.93 ml) of salt, one teaspoon (4.93 ml) of vinegar, and a few drops of bleach to the water instead of one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of salt. If you choose this variation, be careful, as bleach is a hazardous chemical. Metal strips, electrical lead wires, and voltage meters are available at hardware stores. You should also be able to find lead wires at shops that sell electrical components."

[4] X Research source In addition, you'll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and two electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends. You'll wrap each screw in copper except for one, which you will use as a negative terminal (to which you will attach one of the lead wires once the battery is complete). How many screws you use will depend on how many ice cubes your tray is meant to hold. The tray in this example can hold 14 ice cubes. As long as they aren't copper, you can use any type of metal screw. Zinc-coated (galvanized) or aluminum work well. [5] X Research source As for size, aim for screws that are around one inch in length."

After wrapping the wire around a screw, use your finger to bend the wire into a hook. You'll use this hook to clip the screw to the edge of its ice cube tray compartment. You can either pre-cut the copper wire into pieces long enough to wrap around each screw (with a bit extra for the hooks), or you can work with it long, cutting it as you finish each screw."

If the meter doesn't show a reading, reverse your connections: attach the copper plate to the terminal that the aluminum plate was connected to, and vice versa. If you still struggle to get a reading, check the connection and wiring. If everything is working well, it could be that the plates are oxidized. To remove oxidization, clean the plates with a pencil eraser or steel wool."
