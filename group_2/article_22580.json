      "content": "Treat the coworker as you would any other coworker. The easiest way to hide your feelings is to simply treat them normally. In theory, this is simple, but in practice, it can be challenging. If it is difficult for you to keep things “as usual,” then limit your contact with that coworker as much as reasonably possible. For example, avoid going out for lunch with them unless a large group also goes. If you do go with a group, do your best to socialize with the other people in the group besides the one you’re interested in. Think about how you would act around any one of your coworkers and mimic that behavior with your crush."

      "content": "Don’t flirt with them. Putting a stop to flirting can be difficult, especially if your coworker tends to initiate the flirting. However, reciprocating this behavior (or initiating it) will be one of the most obvious signals that you are interested in them. If you do end up flirting with them, you won’t be able to hide your love for them for long. Would you flirt with a coworker you're not interested in? Probably not. [1] X Research source For example, don’t laugh at every funny comment they say. You don’t have to be rude, but a small smile at a joke and a change of subject will send the message that you’re not interested."

Obviously, you should avoid inappropriately touching your coworker, but you should also avoid all physical contact (with the exception of a professional handshake, when necessary). Don’t put your hand on their arm if they say something teasing; don’t come up behind them and put your hands on their shoulders, and don’t hug them. Besides being obvious signals of your interest, this level of touching is also considered unprofessional in many working environments. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t show favoritism or give special treatment. If you, your love interest, and other colleagues are debating an issue, don’t side with your love interest all the time. For important business decisions where the coworker you have feelings for truly does have the best idea, then, by all means, point out why their point of view makes the most sense. With smaller, more mundane decisions, however, avoid siding with them if you can. When considering different perspectives , try to separate the idea from the person offering the idea. Detaching your crush’s ideas from your feelings for them as a person may help you treat everyone more fairly. If you are in a position of power, don’t give all the best tasks to your love interest or set lower working standards for them. Your other employees will likely pick up on this eventually, and your secret won’t be safe—plus, this sort of working environment is inequitable and may even lead to resentment or resignations.

Hopefully, taking steps to act professionally will help you hide your feelings. However, if you feel that you cannot comfortably continue to work with this person, think about asking your boss to work on something different. [4] X Research source For example, maybe you can work on a different project or in another area of the office. Come up with a different reason to explain to your boss why you want to move. Give them a plausible excuse, such as wanting a bigger challenge or wanting to develop a different skill set. Getting space from the coworker you have feelings for may also help those feelings go away faster, if that’s your goal."

In many situations, the intense feelings of attraction felt for a coworker whom you spend a lot of time with can be traced back to infatuation. Ask yourself these questions to separate infatuated attraction from love: How much quality time have you actually spent with this person? Have you fallen in love with their true inner qualities, or are you infatuated with their work persona? Are you captivated by their seeming allure in the workplace? Power or leadership is alluring in a workplace context and can lead to infatuation."

There are many reasons for not getting involved with someone at work, including: [5] X Research source The time and energy it takes to hide a relationship from your boss and coworkers. Having focus pulled away from your work and derailing your career. Eventual boredom or resentment from spending all day at work and at home with the same person. The risk of darkening each other's opinions about others in the workplace, if you have similar annoyances or enjoy venting to each other.

Avoiding all face-to-face contact may not be possible in every type of job, but if you are able to do so without being suspicious, choose email or other methods of communicating that your company might offer. This will give you time to process your feelings until you can behave normally around your coworker. [7] X Research source If the coworker you have a crush on works in another department, minimize your contact. If you're lucky enough to love from afar, it shouldn’t interfere directly with your job. Minimize contact when in the break room or after work. Don’t go out of your way to avoid your coworker, but graciously maintain a safe distance. If you're obviously trying to avoid this coworker, you could end up calling more attention to yourself, and people may wonder why you're going out of your way to avoid the person."

If you have a crush on a coworker, chatting about your personal life or spending time with them outside of work may only lead you to develop more feelings for them and make it easier for you to fantasize about what your relationship would be like outside of work. Instead, try to keep them completely out of your personal life and only see them or speak to them for professional reasons. For example : Give neutral, impersonal responses to questions about your weekend or after-work activities. Avoid attending drinks or dinner with colleagues if your crush is also attending. If you must attend an event together, stay sober and distance yourself as much as possible. If they make advances or conversational innuendos, exit from the conversation or reduce contact."

If you are having trouble keeping it professional in the office, consider taking one or two days off work (either by calling in sick or using vacation days). Sometimes, a little space can really help clear the air and help you refocus on what’s important. [8] X Research source During this time away from work, try to remind yourself why you want to keep your love to yourself and eventually make your feelings go away. Maybe it is your dream job, and you don’t want to jeopardize it, or maybe you’re already in a committed relationship. Whatever the reason, try to convince yourself that this is not a person worth complicating your life for. Ideally, when you return to work, you will feel refocused on the job and not the coworker."

Even if your company doesn’t have a policy against office dating, if you have decided not to pursue your feelings for your coworker, it can be helpful to make it a rule for yourself that you’ll never romantically pursue or date a colleague. Not only will this zero-tolerance rule help you stay true to your desire to keep your feelings to yourself, but it will also help you in the future should you experience romantic feelings for a different coworker. If a coworker approaches you to let you know they have feelings for you, you can easily and gently let them down by explaining that you don’t date coworkers as a rule. After setting this rule for yourself, consider your coworker completely off-limits. Resign yourself to the fact that this relationship simply isn’t going to happen. The sooner you believe it, the easier it will be to conceal how you really feel, get over your crush , and avoid falling in love with colleagues in the future."

Consider online dating or attend social events. You can also meet new people through hobbies, sports, churches, and volunteer activities.

[11] X Research source For some people, this is binging on unhealthy foods such as chips or ice cream. For others, drinking alcohol, smoking, or doing drugs are ways to avoid dealing with these feelings. Whatever your unhealthy coping mechanism, try to identify it, and when you feel the urge to engage in that activity, turn to a different, more healthy way of dealing with your emotions. If you are experiencing strong emotions related to hiding your feelings, try talking to a trusted friend (preferably one who isn’t also a coworker) or family member about what you are feeling. If you’d prefer not to, you can also write what you are feeling in a journal. Either way, those feelings must have an outlet."

It’s no surprise that many people find themselves experiencing romantic feelings at work. [18] X Research source Aside from the comfort, familiarity, and trust that’s often built amongst colleagues in the workplace (which may evolve into chemistry or love), dating coworkers is also convenient. Many people feel like they don’t have time outside of the office to find others to date, so their colleagues are a logical choice. There’s also a phenomenon called the mere-exposure effect that makes someone more likely to date coworkers. In effect, the more someone sees or interacts with another person, the more likely they are to develop feelings for them. Since most people see their colleagues every day, they’re more likely to build attraction. [19] X Research source"
