Some websites will display Minecraft servers in \"address:port\" configuration (e.g., \"play.avengetech.me:19132\"). If so, exclude the colon from the address and use the number to the right of the colon as the port entry. If you're using a desktop server website to find a server, you probably won't see a port number listed. If so, try using the default port number that's listed in the \"Port\" text box when creating your server."
