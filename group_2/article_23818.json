      "title": "Hug her when you see her.",
      "content": "Hug her when you see her. This is very casual and common among friends. Hugging shows her that you are excited to see her and is a good start to initiating physical contact. [1] X Research source If she refrains from hugging you back, she may be uncomfortable or uninterested and you should hold back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush against her.",
      "content": "Brush against her. Sit next to her with your shoulders or thighs touching, or “accidentally” bump into her as you walk. If this happens a few times, she may take the hint. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that this might be a little too subtle and she may not even notice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Touch her back.",
      "content": "Touch her back. This works especially well if you are walking together, as you can easily put your hand gently on her back. Use your surroundings to give reason for contact. For example, if you see a dog or other animal at a distance, touch her back and say something along the lines of “Look over there!” [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place your hand on her knee.",
      "content": "Place your hand on her knee. If you are sitting next to her, lightly touch her knee as you stand up. [4] X Research source You can also do this if you are trying to get her attention. Simply tap her leg and say, “Hey, I just wanted to tell you…” or ask her a question."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put your arm around her shoulders.",
      "content": "Put your arm around her shoulders. If she snuggles closer or at least doesn't pull back, this is a good sign that she feels very comfortable with you. [5] X Research source If she has followed along up until this point and now stops you or seems hesitant, she may just like you as a friend."

    {
      "title": "Tickle her lightly.",
      "content": "Tickle her lightly. This is fun and playful; however, if she seems to not like it or tells you to stop, make sure to do so. If she is interested in you, she may laugh excessively, blush, or tickle you back. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that some people just don't like tickling, and this might not be an accurate reflection of her opinion of you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold her hand.",
      "content": "Hold her hand. If you feel like you are at this point, try holding her hand while you are walking or alone together. If she continues to hold it, there is a good chance that she is interested in a relationship with you. And if she gives you this signal, it might make sense for you to have a conversation about your romantic interest to see if she's feeling the same way!
