Now, pour this water into a measuring cup until you get 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) and add it to the bowl. Stir it in with your spatula until the mixture is a smooth consistency.

Now, repeat this process, making sure to mix the solution in thoroughly in between each addition. [4] X Research source Be sure to stir everything together thoroughly.

      "content": "Continue mixing your slime until it forms a ball. Once you notice your slime forming spiderweb-like strands, stop adding the solution and mix your slime together until it forms a ball. At this point, there should be no excess slime on the edges of the bowl. [5] X Research source Scrape any pieces of excess slime into the ball with your spatula."

      "title": "Mix food coloring into your jiggly slime mixture if you'd like.",
      "content": "Mix food coloring into your jiggly slime mixture if you'd like. Coloring can be food dye, water paint, acrylic paint, pigments, confetti, glitter, or any combination of these things. Start by adding 2 to 3 drops of your coloring substance and mix it into your mixture. Mix it in well with your spatula and then continue adding more of the same color to create a stronger color or mix in other colors. [6] X Research source Continue experimenting and adding colors until you get one you like. To create a sparkling look, add some glitter and confetti. Keep in mind that the colors will be lighter than normal when using white glue."

You'll notice your slime changes consistency as you knead it—continue until you're happy with the final result. [7] X Research source Take your slime out of the bowl and knead it on a flat surface for the best results."

Pour the water into the bowl with your slime and then poke holes in your slime to help it absorb it. Afterward, lift the slime up over the bowl for about 10 to 15 seconds and let the excess water drain out. [8] X Research source Check that your slime is jiggly. If you think it needs more hot water, add another 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) and mix it in again."

Be sure to store it in a Ziploc bag and close it tightly so as little air as possible enters. [9] X Research source Your slime will probably last 1 week or less in the refrigerator. If you notice mold or bacteria growth, throw the slime away. Keep your refrigerator temperature at 35 to 40 °F (2 to 4 °C)."
