Everything about your manner should say “I’m glad you’re here!” [2] X Expert Source Sheila A. Anderson Certified Image Consultant & International Branding Icon Expert Interview. 9 August 2021."

      "title": "Dress professionally.",
      "content": "Dress professionally. How you look is a key part of your greeting. You need to look like you care about your job. A conservative, professional outfit will convey that message. Unless you work in a store with a specific dress code that states otherwise, avoid provocative clothing that might offend customers or make them feel uncomfortable. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Acknowledge the customer quickly.",
      "content": "Acknowledge the customer quickly. 80% of customers say they want to be noticed and nearly all welcome a friendly greeting. [4] X Research source You don’t have to greet each customer right away, but you do need to acknowledge him or her with eye contact and a smile. [5] X Research source If stocking shelves or working in the back, stop to greet a new arrival. At the very least, tell her you will be with her shortly. Studies show that customers are much happier waiting if they have been greeted first. [6] X Research source If serving another customer, ask him if he minds if you quickly greet the new arrival before you do so. [7] X Research source Use a bell on the door to let you know when new customers have arrived, so that you can be sure to greet them promptly. Try to greet incoming customers within 30 seconds."

      "title": "Remember customers' preferences.",
      "content": "Remember customers' preferences. It pays to remember frequent customers’ likes and dislikes. Knowing what someone orders at a coffee shop or restaurant makes them feel like a regular. If you work at clothing store, remembering that a customer loves pink or is fond of a certain brand will make her feel like you care. Personal attention like this is a great way to create customer loyalty. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Show customers to products.",
      "content": "Show customers to products. Don’t just tell them where to look for what they want. They will appreciate it if you walk them to the product and show them precisely where it is. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask questions.",
      "content": "Ask questions. The more specific details you can get on what a customer is looking for, the better you can satisfy his needs. If at a nutrition store and looking for protein powder, you might ask if he is trying to lose weight, built muscle, or tone. Does he want something for after workouts or to stave off hunger? If a customer is looking for shorts at a clothing store, you might ask about how formal or the type of fabric. Questions show you care. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Give space after the greeting if necessary.",
      "content": "Give space after the greeting if necessary. Don’t try to read your customers before greeting them. You never want to assume someone wants to be left alone. Always greet an arriving customer warmly, but if she responds coldly or not at all, tell her you will be nearby if they need help and give them space."

      "title": "Get the exit right.",
      "content": "Get the exit right. The effect of a great greeting can easily be lost with a bad goodbye. Don’t just thank them for coming in. Walk customers to the door and open it for them. Ask anyone who looks like they could use a hand – older customers, pregnant people, parents wrangling their children – if he or she would like help carrying their packages to the car.

      "title": "Don’t say “Can I help you?”",
      "content": "Don’t say “Can I help you?” This is a standard greeting that simply does not work. Usually, the answer is “no, just looking.” You’ll usually get a similar response – “just looking” – If you ask customers if you can help them find something. And don’t start off with a canned speech, either. The key is to promote a natural conversation that makes the customer feel welcome and relaxed. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell customers your name more than once.",
      "content": "Tell customers your name more than once. You want customers to know your name if they need something. Giving them your name also transforms you from a faceless employee to a person they can feel comfortable with. Try to use your name more than once to be sure they remember it."

      "title": "Show you recognize your customers.",
      "content": "Show you recognize your customers. If it is a frequent customer, you should greet him by name. “Jack! Welcome back!” Hearing one’s own name stimulates specific regions of the brain that makes people listen more closely to whatever comes next. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you don’t remember his name, at least let him know you remember them: “Hi! Nice to see you again!” People enjoy recognition. It will make them want to return. [14] X Research source"

This greeting has been shown to increase sales by up to 16%. [15] X Research source If she has been there, ask what she bought and if she liked it. This gives the opportunity for positive reinforcement or to address concerns. If she has not been there before, offer to show her around the store."

Be sure to listen to your customer’s responses and reply appropriately. The key is to foster a natural conversation in order to put customers at ease, making them more likely to buy.
