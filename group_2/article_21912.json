      "content": "Keep your message short and sweet so it fits on the cake. In general, there’s not going to be much room on the birthday cake, so try to aim for 2 to 5 words. You can practice writing your words to ensure that it fits on the cake—just make a piping bag by putting frosting into a resealable plastic bag and snipping one of the corners. Then, apply gentle pressure to squeeze the frosting out and use small, even strokes to write each letter. Chill your cake in the freezer for at least 15 minutes before writing on it. This helps you remove mistakes easily without messing up the frosting. If you don’t have enough freezer space, chill the cake for at least 30 minutes in the fridge. [1] X Research source If you’re not comfortable writing a message on a cake, you can always spell out each letter with small candies, such as chocolate chips or M&M’s. Alternatively, you could use stencils , fondant , cake toppers , or edible images to create your message."
