Windows 10 comes with antivirus software called Microsoft Defender. Update your computer. Keep your programs up to date, and don't defer or disable Windows Update. Pay attention to security warnings. They are there for a reason. Don't ignore them. Don't click links or open unusual attachments in emails. Type the link directly into your browser, and ask the person who sent the email if they were the one who sent it to you. Only download software from the company’s website. For example, Adobe Reader should only be downloaded from Adobe.com. Scan USB drives before using them. Most antivirus software does this automatically, but it doesn't hurt to run a manual scan. Back up your data. Once a week, copy your data to an external drive, then disconnect the drive. This will protect your data from ransomware. You can also back up your data to the cloud.
