Your BMI is your weight in kilograms (not pounds) divided by your height (in meters) squared. [17] X Research source Here is an example. For someone that is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 165 pounds, the formula reveals the BMI to be 27.3. [18] X Research source Convert the pounds into kilograms. Do this by multiplying the weight in pounds by 0.45. So 165 x 0.45 = 74.25. Next, convert the height to meters. 5 feet 6 inches is 66 inches. Multiply the 66 by 0.025 to get 1.65 meters. Then square that number by multiplying it against itself, so 1.65 x 1.65 = 2.72. Divide the new weight number by the new height number; 74.25 ÷ 2.72 = 27.3. This person’s BMI is 27.3.
