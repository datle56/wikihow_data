You can get a teacher to like you simply by paying attention and being interested in their class. [1] X Expert Source Alicia Oglesby Professional School Counselor Expert Interview. 29 October 2020.

      "content": "Complete your assignments in a timely manner. One of the easiest ways for you to get a teacher to like you is to complete the homework and classroom assignments and to turn them in when they’re due. Turning in incomplete work or asking for a time extension shows them that you didn’t manage your time well or that you’re not interested in their class. [3] X Research source If you’re struggling with an assignment, ask for help. Your teacher wants you to learn, so asking them for help if you’re having trouble shows them that you’re interested in learning. Do your homework as soon as you can, rather than waiting until the last minute. Be honest with your teacher if you forget to do your homework. They may be upset, but they’ll appreciate that you told them the truth."

      "title": "Listen closely",
      "content": "Listen closely to your teacher’s directions. Whenever your teacher is assigning homework or going over the instructions for a test, pay attention so you don’t have to ask them again later. Whenever you get a test or a written assignment, read the directions carefully to show the teacher that you care, which will make them like you more. [4] X Research source Asking questions that you already have been given the answer to show a teacher that you’re lazy and that you weren’t listening to them when they gave you directions."

      "title": "Answer your teacher’s questions when they ask the class.",
      "content": "Answer your teacher’s questions when they ask the class. Teachers will often pose questions to the class that you can raise your hand to answer. If you know the answer, try to answer it. If you don’t know, but you have a good idea, try giving your best idea to the teacher. They’ll like that you’re trying to understand and learn the material. [5] X Research source If you have no idea what the answer is, maintain eye contact with your teacher so they can see that you’re listening but you don’t have the answer. Some questions are rhetorical and aren’t meant to be answered. Pay attention in class so you can tell when your teacher really wants an answer to their question. It’s okay to get an answer wrong! That’s part of learning, and your teacher will like that you made an effort."

      "title": "Ask meaningful questions",
      "content": "Ask meaningful questions related to the lesson. Questions that show that you’ve read the assigned book or completed the homework will show the teacher that you’re engaged in the class and will make them like you more. Be specific when you ask and don’t pose empty questions like, “I don’t get it, what does this mean?” [6] X Research source For example, ask a thoughtful question about the assigned reading like, “I understand that the main character had a traumatic childhood, is that why he’s unable to fully commit to the woman who loves him?” Ask questions that are related to the course to show the teacher that you’re paying attention."

      "title": "Study",
      "content": "Study additional materials to go above and beyond. A teacher loves it when they’ve inspired their students to learn more about a subject on their own time. If you really want to get your teacher to like you, spend time on your own learning more about the topic or subject so you can discuss it with them in class and show them that you’re interested in it. [7] X Research source For example, many literature textbooks include supplemental essays and readings at the back that expand on the ideas of the text. Read the supplemental materials for an even deeper understanding of the work. Go online and search for more information about the subject that you can use to ask questions in class. Ask your teacher for more information or materials about the subject. They’ll love that you’re interested enough to learn more about it."

A simple thank you can go a long way when it comes to getting someone to like you. Thank them in private by waiting after class or visiting their office hours so they know that it’s genuine. If you exchange email correspondence with your teacher, always send a thank you email whenever they respond or reply to a message that you send them."

[15] X Research source Ask them to leave the letter undated and addressed to “To Whom It May Concern” if you don’t know when you’ll need to use it. If you have a counselor or a potential employer that you need to provide a letter of recommendation, ask your teacher to date and address the letter to them."
