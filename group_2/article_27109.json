      "content": "Work on 1 dread lock at a time. If you need to, clip the rest of your dreads up or out of the way so you can focus each lock individually. Hold the first dread taut away from your scalp so you can see the new growth at the roots. [1] X Research source This technique works best about a month or so into your dread journey because you need new growth to work with."

      "content": "Tease the dread lock at the roots with a dread comb . Use quick strokes to tease the hair towards your scalp in the opposite direction of the hairâ€™s growth, starting at the roots. [2] X Research source A metal comb is ideal, but a plastic comb will also get the job done. In a pinch, you can use a crochet hook instead of a comb. Use the smallest crochet hook you have on hand.

      "content": "Keep backcombing all the way to the ends of your dread. Focus on getting as close as you can to the roots before working your way to the tip of the dread. You'll notice the dread looking puffy and more voluminous immediately. [4] X Research source If you're using a crochet hook, run the hook back and forth through your dread, starting at the roots and working your way to the tip."

      "title": "Twist the dread at the roots with your fingers.",
      "content": "Twist the dread at the roots with your fingers. Once you've backcombed your dreads from root to tip, use your fingers to carefully twist the backcombed hair together from the root to the tip. Twist the hair 1-2 rotations in a clockwise direction. [5] X Research source You can backcomb and twist the same dread a few times to help it lock."

      "content": "Backcomb and twist each dread at least once a day. Get in the habit of backcombing and twisting your dreads while you're watching television, listening to music, or talking to friends. The more you do it, the faster your hair will lock."

      "title": "Hold your dread at the root between your palms.",
      "content": "Hold your dread at the root between your palms. Place the dread across your right palm at the root and hold it in place with your thumb. Then, put your left palm on top of the dread. [6] X Research source Work on 1 dread at a time for the best results. If you need to, clip the rest of your hair out of the way so you can access the roots more easily. Palm rolling is a bit more gentle on your hair than backcombing, making it a better long-term maintenance solution. If you start out backcombing, you can switch to palm rolling after a few months (once your locs start to set)."

      "title": "Roll your dread back and forth in your hands.",
      "content": "Roll your dread back and forth in your hands. Start at the roots and roll the dreads with your palms moving upwards against the hair. Your dread should roll along your hand. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep rolling the dread moving from root to tip for 30 seconds. Roll your dread once against your palm and then move about an inch down the dread. Adjust your thumb so it holds the dread in place. Roll the dread and move an inch or so down again. Continue until you reach the tip of the dread. [8] X Research source If you notice any lumps or uneven parts on your dread, roll those spots more rapidly to smooth them out."

      "title": "Style your hair after twisting or rolling your dreads.",
      "content": "Style your hair after twisting or rolling your dreads. In the early stages, dreads tend to get loose if you wear your hair down a lot. After you do your daily backcombing, twisting, or rolling, pull your hair back out of your face and leave it that way. Any style will work! You can try do bantu knots , a pineapple, 2-strand twists , or any other look you like."

      "content": "Apply a small amount of wax once a month to help set your locs. While dread wax can help to smooth out and set your dreads, it can also make them greasy and loose. Only use wax once a month before you palm roll (or after you backcomb) to speed up the interlocking process. Apply a small amount on the bottom two-thirds of your locs (so don't get wax near your roots or scalp). [11] X Research source Look for hair wax that's formulated for dreadlocks for the best results."
