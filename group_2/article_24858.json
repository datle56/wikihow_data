      "content": "Use crusty bread or rolls to avoid sogginess. Crusty bread like baguettes are particularly dry as a result of the baking process, and thus do a better job of preventing sogginess in your sandwich. If you decide to use sliced sandwich bread instead, toasting the bread before making the sandwich will also help to keep moisture out and keep the sandwich fresh. [1] X Research source If you’re using standard sliced sandwich bread, buy a square loaf from a baker or supermarket that bakes their own bread in order to get the freshest bread possible. Certain types of bread also work best with particular fillings. If your sandwich will have heavy solid ingredients like meat and cheese, use a more robust crusty bread. If your sandwich will have a soft and more viscous filling like egg mayo, use a fluffier white bread that the ingredients will cling to."

      "title": "Use dry fillings.",
      "content": "Use dry fillings. While almost any ingredients can be used in making sandwiches, wet fillings are much more likely to leave a sandwich soggy. Lightly butter the inside of the bread before adding your ingredients to create a moisture barrier between the fillings and the bread. Wash and thoroughly dry lettuce before adding it to the sandwich, and place tomatoes at the center of the sandwich between the meat and cheese. [2] X Research source You might also consider packing wet ingredients like tomatoes separately in their own container, and adding them to the sandwich immediately before eating."

      "content": "Put condiments at the center of the sandwich and separate from the bread. If you’re using condiments, place the condiments in the middle of the sandwich between the main ingredients to prevent them from dampening the bread. You can also place an individual slice of meat or cheese on a slice of bread and spread your condiment on that. [3] X Research source For best results, never put the condiment directly on the bread."

      "content": "Make your sandwich at the last possible minute to cut down on storage time. The longer you have to wait to eat your sandwich, the less fresh it will be. Consider packing your bread and fillings separately and assembling the sandwich immediately before you eat it. [4] X Expert Source Randall Chambers Personal Chef Expert Interview. 1 March 2022.

      "content": "Wrap the sandwich in parchment paper. Although packing your sandwich in a Ziploc bag will prevent your sandwich from being exposed to the air, it will also lock in condensation. To store your sandwich without leaving it soggy, wrap it in parchment paper or waxed paper. You can also tightly wrap the sandwich in plastic wrap to keep loose ingredients together. [7] X Research source If you’re packing a hot sandwich, use tin foil instead of parchment paper to keep it warm or to heat it up in the oven later. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid putting anything heavy on top of the sandwich. When packing the sandwich among other items, make sure you don’t place any heavy items on top of the sandwich, especially if it isn’t stored in Tupperware. Heavier items will crush the sandwich and displace the ingredients, potentially making the sandwich soggy and unpalatable. [10] X Research source"

Keep your sandwich at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler if you have to take it out of the refrigerator while traveling.
