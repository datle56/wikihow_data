      "content": "Warm up with 5 minutes of cardio and stretching. Go for a light jog, jump rope, or do jumping jacks to help raise your heart rate so you’re ready to work the punching bag. After doing some cardio, do some arm circles to loosen up your shoulders and forward bends to stretch out your back. Stretch your triceps and biceps as well so you don’t hurt yourself while you’re punching. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Throw combinations of punches for at least 45 seconds before resting.",
      "content": "Throw combinations of punches for at least 45 seconds before resting. You won’t get an effective workout just randomly punching the bag. Instead, focus on throwing 1 or 2 types of punches during the round, such as jabs , hooks , and uppercuts . Keep your core engaged and keep your feet moving so you stay active and work your entire body. After 45 seconds, take a break for 15–20 seconds. Some popular combinations you can try include: [2] X Research source 1 jab with your left hand and 1 jab with your right. [3] X Research source 2 jabs with your left hand and then 1 jab with your right hand. [4] X Research source 1 jab followed by 1 uppercut. 1 jab followed by 1 hook. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Try out different combinations for 5 rounds.",
      "content": "Try out different combinations for 5 rounds. Change the types of punches you throw each round to add some variety to your workout. If you did only jabs in your first round, try adding in a hook or uppercut during the next one. After each round, take a short break before starting the next one. When you finish the 5th round, you’ve done a great workout. [6] X Research source As you get more comfortable, try doing combinations of 4 or 5 punches. For example, throw 1 left jab, 1 right uppercut, 1 left hook, and finish with 1 right jab. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Intersperse squats between boxing rounds to work legs and glutes. Rather than taking a short break when you finish your round of boxing, immediately transition into squats. Do as many squats as you can within 1 minute. After that, take a break for another minute before going into your next round. [8] X Research source Make the routine a little bit harder by throwing your combination followed by a squat. For example, you could jab twice, do 1 squat, and continue repeating that for the full 45–60-second round. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your heart rate up with jumping jacks and high knees. After you finish up your punching combinations, transition into these great cardio exercises. Try to do as many as you can within 1 minute before going back to work the bag. Only rest when you feel the need to so your routine stays high-intensity and burns more calories."

      "content": "Incorporate push-ups if you want to work your upper body more. Get into a plank position and perform 1 push-up. When you reach the top of the push-up, reach one arm out and punch the bag. Then, do another push-up but punch with your other arm. Continue alternating which arm you punch with for 1 minute or until you feel tired out. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Work up to 5 rounds that are around 3 minutes each.",
      "content": "Work up to 5 rounds that are around 3 minutes each. Working a bag can be tiring if you do it for too long, so try starting off with a 3-minute round throwing punches. If you can’t go the full 3 minutes, go for as long as you can before getting tired. After you finish your round, rest for 30 seconds or 1 minute before starting your next rounds. After 5 rounds, you’ll have completed an intense 15-minute workout. [11] X Research source As you get more comfortable using a punching bag, try doing 4- or 5-minute rounds instead."

    {
      "title": "Alternate which arms you’re throwing punches with.",
      "content": "Alternate which arms you’re throwing punches with. If you’re just starting off on a punching bag, just switch arms after each punch to improve your form and keep a consistent rhythm. Once you start feeling comfortable, try switching to combinations of 2–3 punches, such as left-right-left or right-left-left, to add some variation. Use a little more power on the last punch in combo to add some intensity to your workout. [12] X Research source When you throw a punch, keep your other hand up in front of or to the side of your face to maintain a defensive stance. Don’t let your arm drop down after you land your last punch. Always bring it back up in front of your face as if you were defending against another person."

    {
      "title": "Move around the bag in between your punches.",
      "content": "Move around the bag in between your punches. While you should keep your feet planted while you’re throwing punches, stay light on your feet after your last hit. Try moving in the same direction as the arm you last punched with, so you’d move left if you landed a punch with your left hand. Keep shuffling around the bag throughout your entire workout so can practice punching from new angles. [13] X Research source If the bag swings back toward you, practice taking steps back or to the side so you maintain the same distance from it."

      "title": "Take at least 1 day to rest in between bag workouts.",
      "content": "Take at least 1 day to rest in between bag workouts. Your muscles need time to rest and recover so you don’t damage them. After you do a workout on a punching bag, take a day to rest or do some lighter activities, such as jogging or running. You can even work a different muscle group, such as your chest or back, on your rest days so you don’t overwork your arms or legs."

      "title": "Use hand wraps and gloves to prevent injuries if you’re a beginner.",
      "content": "Use hand wraps and gloves to prevent injuries if you’re a beginner. Punching bags are a lot heavier and denser than you think, and you can seriously hurt your hands and wrists if you aren’t careful. Wind some hand wraps around your wrists and between your fingers to stabilize them. Then put on a pair of boxing gloves that fit you well for additional padding. [14] X Research source Punching a bag without gloves could bruise your knuckles and cause skin tears, and you may have to wait a few weeks before you can safely workout on a bag again."

      "title": "You can throw less powerful punches without gloves to improve form.",
      "content": "You can throw less powerful punches without gloves to improve form. If you have a little more experience on the bag, it’s a little easier to control how hard you hit it without gloves. [15] X Research source As you throw a punch, focus on your accuracy and pull your fist back as soon as you hit the bag so you don’t hurt yourself. Practicing without gloves can also help strengthen your knuckles, forearms, and wrists."

      "title": "Plant your feet shoulder-width apart so they’re at an angle.",
      "content": "Plant your feet shoulder-width apart so they’re at an angle. Turn your body at an angle so your front shoulder points toward the bag. Point your toes on the foot closest to the bag so they’re at a 45-degree angle to the punching bag. Position your foot furthest from the bag so they’re turned to the side. Line up the toes on your front foot with the heel of your back foot. Keep your knees bent and your weight on the balls of your feet. [16] X Research source Foot placement is important since it gives you more punching power and helps you stay balanced while you’re boxing."

      "title": "Twist at the hips and straighten your arm.",
      "content": "Twist at the hips and straighten your arm. Press your weight down into the balls of your feet and start turning your hips toward the bag. Start with your knuckles pointing up and start extending your arm straight out. As you’re reaching your arm out, turn your fist so your knuckles point toward the bag. [17] X Research source Try practicing the movement slow when you’re first starting off so you maintain proper form."

    {
      "title": "Keep your body still when you hit the bag.",
      "content": "Keep your body still when you hit the bag. If you move your head backwards each time you punch the bag, you aren’t getting as much power as you could. Stand far enough away from the bag so your arm is almost fully outstretched when you land a punch. Maintain your balance and try to push the bag away from you without moving backward. [18] X Research source If you’re consistently having trouble moving back as you punch, try switching to a lighter bag. It might be hard to notice if you’re moving backward if you’re working out on your own. Ask a partner or a trainer to watch your form to see if you’re hitting the bag correctly."

      "title": "Plant your non-dominant leg as a pivot point.",
      "content": "Plant your non-dominant leg as a pivot point. Your non-dominant foot is usually on the opposite side of your body as the hand you use to write. Stand just out of reach from the bag and turn your body so your non-dominant foot is in front. Keep your leg straight and turn your foot so it points away from the bag. [19] X Research source For example, if you’re right-handed, keep your left leg in front."

      "title": "Turn your entire body to add power to your kick.",
      "content": "Turn your entire body to add power to your kick. Most of your kicking power actually comes from the rest of your body instead of your legs. Push your weight off of your dominant foot so you’re supporting yourself with your non-dominant leg. Twist your upper body and hips toward the bag and raise your back leg up to start your kick. [20] X Research source Start practicing your kicks slowly so you can work on your form and balance."

    {
      "title": "Hit the bag with your shin instead of your foot.",
      "content": "Hit the bag with your shin instead of your foot. Punching bags can be a little heavier on the bottom, so you could break the bones in your foot. Instead, try to land your kick with the middle of your shinbone since it’s a lot stronger. Follow through with your kick so you hit with all of your power. [21] X Research source Throw in some kicks in between punches while you’re working the bag. Try kicking the bag at different heights to add some variation to your workout. It still might hurt a bit even when you hit the bag with your shin. If you’re in pain, start with some lighter kicks and work up your tolerance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on your speed and technique instead of power.",
      "content": "Focus on your speed and technique instead of power. Using all of your strength during a punch can make your form sloppy, slow you down, and tire you out faster. Rather than using 100% of your power, work on landing lighter jabs that are faster and maintaining the proper form. [22] X Research source Even though the bag should move a little bit after each punch, you shouldn’t try to make it swing wildly."

      "content": "Yes you can since training on a bag tones your body and builds muscle. Working a punching bag for an hour can burn 450 calories, so it’s a great cardio workout to help you burn fat. Try working with heavier bags since they have more resistance and use up more of your energy. Incorporate other cardio exercises and strength-training exercises into your workout routine to help you lose weight even faster."
