      "content": "Spray your basement floor with a hose if you want to wet grind the concrete. You can either dry grind or wet grind your floor. Wet grinding is preferable because the water on the floor soaks up the concrete dust and leaves less of a mess to clean up later on. You don’t have to wet grind your basement floor, just keep in mind that you’ll have a bigger mess to clean up if you don’t. [3] X Research source Read the manual that came with your concrete grinder to make sure it’s compatible with wet grinding. If you decide to wet grind, spray your basement floor with enough water that there's a visible puddle across the entire floor."

When you reach one side of the floor, move the grinder over next to the row you just made and then slowly push it back to the other side to make a new row. Continue doing this until you’ve gone over the entire surface of the floor. [4] X Research source When you encounter a raised spot on the floor, hold the grinder over it for a few seconds so it grinds it down. Make sure you’re pushing the grinder in a straight line."

Once you’ve gone over the floor once with the concrete grinder, it’s important that you go over it a second time in the opposite direction so that the floor is even.

Quick-drying leveling agents dry a lot faster than regular leveling agents, so they're a good option if you need to get the floor done quickly. However, they don't leave a lot of room for error because of how fast they dry. If you're new to using self-leveling agents, you may want to go with one that has a longer drying time.

      "content": "Get enough self-leveling agent to cover the entire floor. To determine how much self-leveling agent you need, start by calculating the floor's square footage . Then, check the label on the self-leveling agent you want to buy to see the number of square feet it covers. Finally, divide the floor's square footage by the number of square feet listed on the self-leveling agent to get the number of bags you'll need. For example, if the floor's square footage is 100, and the self-leveling agent covers 25 square feet, you would need 4 bags. Get more self-leveling agent than you think you need so you don't accidentally run out."

Then, cut strips of wood that will fit in these spots. The strips of wood should be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall so none of the leveling agent goes over them. Use duct tape to secure the strips of wood in place. [9] X Research source When you’re finished leveling the floor and it’s hardened, you'll be able to easily remove the strips of wood."

The amount of time it will take the leveling agent to dry depends on what kind you used. If you used regular self-leveling agent, it can take 1-3 days for the floor to fully dry. If you used a quick-drying leveling agent, your floor may be dry after several hours. [15] X Research source To test if the leveling agent is dry, try standing on it. If your feet leave any kind of depression in the floor, it’s not dry enough yet."
