      "content": "Connect your light bulb. Now that you have a wire attached to your battery, take that same wire and touch the other end to the side of the bulb along the metal threading. Take the second piece of wire and touch it to the bottom metal tip of the bulb. Tape these pieces down so they don’t move around."

      "title": "Attach the other end.",
      "content": "Attach the other end. Take your second piece of cable (with the exposed end) and attach it to the other side of your battery. This should be the positive side of the battery. When you touch the wire to the surface of your battery, it should light up. This is because the electrons flow out of the negative terminal of your battery, through the bulb, and back into the positive side. This creates a circuit that causes the bulb to light up.

      "title": "Tape batteries together.",
      "content": "Tape batteries together. Line up your 2 AA batteries so that the positive end of one is attached to the negative end of the other. Using your electrical tape, connect the batteries. Make sure that the connection is strong so that you don't have to push the batteries together with your hands to create the charge."

      "title": "Expose the wire.",
      "content": "Expose the wire. Using your scissors, cut the insulation away from the ends of your electric cable. This will expose the wire. Be careful not to cut through the wire. Do this to both pieces of cable."

      "title": "Test your light.",
      "content": "Test your light. Using the shorter cable, place the exposed wire onto the negative side of the battery. While holding the wire directly on the battery, place the exposed wire from the longer cable onto the positive side of the battery. If your LEO diode doesn't light up, switch the cables so that the shorter one is on the positive side and the longer one is on the negative side."

      "title": "Fray the wire.",
      "content": "Fray the wire. Once you've discovered which charge your shorter wire needs to attach to, fray the end of it and tape it to the proper side of the battery. Fraying the wire will ensure connection because it will cover more surface area of the battery."

Your longer wire shouldn't be taped down yet. Tape the paper over your batteries with the light at one end and the end of the longer wire and exposed side of the battery on the other.
