There are several ways to get a hazmat suit. The easiest way is to go to Becky Fallon in Fallon's Basement located in Diamond City. However, if you are short on caps, other ways would be to go to the Yangtze, Marowski's Chem Lab, or Cambridge Polymer Labs. Another method is to do the big dig quest in good neighbor."
