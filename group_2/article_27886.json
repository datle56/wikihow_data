      "title": "Buy a pig leg.",
      "content": "Buy a pig leg. This should be 10 to 12 lbs (4.5 to 5.4 kg), although larger is fine too. If you're making spanish serrano ham, leave the hoof on and hip bone in. If making Italian prosciutto, remove the hoof and partially remove the bone to expose the ball joint."

      "title": "Wet cure the pork with brine, for one way to cure and make prosciutto.",
      "content": "Wet cure the pork with brine, for one way to cure and make prosciutto. Create salt water brine with 2 to 4 cups (473 to 946 ml) of sea or kosher salt per 1 gallon (3.79 L) of water. Place the pork in the pot of brine. Make sure the meat is completely covered. Place the pork still in the brine in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 weeks. Stir occasionally. Rinse the meat with cold water. Use paper towels to pat it dry. Cold smoke the pork in a smokehouse or smoker by hanging on a hook for 7 to 10 days. Dry the prosciutto for 4 to 5 months in an area that is cold and well ventilated."

      "title": "Dry cure the leg of pork to make prosciutto a different way.",
      "content": "Dry cure the leg of pork to make prosciutto a different way. Dry the piece of meat thoroughly using paper towels. Season your leg of pork with dry or liquid ingredients. You can use garlic and pepper or liquids such as bourbon or brandy. Rub the seasonings into the pork or pour the liquid all over the meat. Use 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) of sea or kosher salt and cover the pork completely. Place the leg of pork onto a rack and place the rack into a pan. The salt will draw the moisture out of the meat and the pan will catch the drippings. The rack also allows for air circulation. Put the pork and pan into a sealed plastic bag and place in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 weeks. Rinse the meat with cold water. Wrap the prosciutto in cheesecloth and hang it in a dry, cold place for 6 months to 2 years."

      "title": "Measure out an amount of curing salt.",
      "content": "Measure out an amount of curing salt. The amount should be about .25 percent the weight of the meat. Rub it over the ham, focusing on the meat side. Curing salt is not necessary but helps the ham develop flavor and prevents botulism."

      "content": "Remove the ham from fridge and hang it. This should be during progressively warmer temperatures throughout the spring and summer. Bring the ham into warmer temperatures of 80-90 degrees during the summer. Keep a pan or towel underneath the ham, as it is normal to see the ham sweating off fat during this period. This is helping to give the ham more flavor. Let it hang for 5-6 months of summer drying."
