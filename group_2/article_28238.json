      "title": "Heat the oil.",
      "content": "Heat the oil. Pour 4 inches (10 cm) of cooking oil into the deep fryer. Switch on the heat and allow the oil to reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). If you don't have a deep fryer, you could pour the oil into a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Use a frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. It should remain at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for the duration of the cooking process. Adjust your temperature settings as needed to achieve this."

      "title": "Clean the potatoes.",
      "content": "Clean the potatoes. Rinse the potatoes under cool, running water while scrubbing off the dirt with a vegetable brush. Thorough cleaning is important if you intend to keep the skins on for your fries. On the other hand, if you prefer fries without skin, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. Since the dirty skins are gone, you won't need to scrub the potatoes with a brush."

      "title": "Slice the potato using a ridged waffle blade.",
      "content": "Slice the potato using a ridged waffle blade. Insert the waffle blade attachment into the mandolin. Pass the end of the potato over the blade, making one ridged slice. The waffle blade should have ridges on it. If your mandolin allows you to choose the thickness of the slices, choose a thickness of at least 1/4 inch (6 mm). If you don't have a mandolin, you could also use a ridged cheese knife. Make a straight cut down over the end of the potato and create slices roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, if not a little thicker."

    {
      "title": "Rotate and continue slicing.",
      "content": "Rotate and continue slicing. Rotate the potato 90 degrees, so that the vertical grooves now run horizontally. Make a second slice from this angle. The resulting crisscross should produce the waffle fry shape. If you do not rotate the potato, your slices will look like ridges instead of waffles. Continue slicing in this manner, rotating the potato 90 degrees in between each slice. Repeat until you slice through both potatoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fry the potatoes in batches.",
      "content": "Fry the potatoes in batches. Place several cut slices into the hot oil. Fry for several minutes, turning as needed, until the fries turn golden brown. Watch the fries closely to prevent them from burning. You need to fry the potatoes in batches instead of frying them all at once. Adding too many to the hot oil can crowd out the pan and cause the temperature to drop. As a result, the fries won't cook correctly."

      "content": "Drain the excess oil. Use a slotted spoon to remove the finished fries from the hot oil. Transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels. While waiting for the oil to drain, you can start on your next batch of fries."

[1] X Research source Meanwhile, prepare a 15-inch by 10-inch (38-cm by 25-cm) baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil. Alternatively, you could lightly coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray instead of using oil."

If you wish to keep the skins, you need to scrub off the dirt in this manner. If you don't wish to keep the skins, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. You should not need to scrub them since the dirty skins are already gone."

Using firm, even pressure, pass the end of the potato over the blade, creating the first slice. The waffle blade should have ridges on it. To prevent the fries from becoming too thin, use a thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm). If you don't have a mandolin, consider using a ridged cheese knife. Chop straight down over the end of the potato using this knife, making slices that are 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick."

Bake the fries in your preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they turn golden brown. The exact amount of time may vary depending on how thick you cut the fries. You may need to check the progress every 5 minutes after the first 15 minutes to prevent the fries from burning. If you'd prefer evenly browned fries, consider turning the fries with a spatula after the first 15 minutes. Allow the other sides to brown for the duration of the cooking time."

You should be able to use nearly any standard-sized waffle iron for this procedure. Usage instructions will vary based on the manufacturer and model, however, so you need to be familiar with the machine you're using before embarking on this recipe. After the waffle iron preheats, consider spraying the grate with a light coating of nonstick cooking spray. This may not be necessary if the waffle iron has a nonstick cooking surface, however."

Do not rinse the shredded potatoes since doing so will rinse away too much of the potatoes' natural starch. That starch is necessary since it will help bind the shreds together."

It's generally a good idea to check on the fries after 5 or 6 minutes, though. If the bottom of the fries are cooking faster than the tops, consider flipping them over before you finish cooking them."
