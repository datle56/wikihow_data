A toxic person will have no trouble telling you all about the terrible things you’ve done or all the good things you should be doing that you aren’t. They’ll pick at your minor flaws, exaggerate your “bad” behaviors, or even make up things that aren’t true. In fact, a lot of toxic people aren’t afraid to lie—if it means they can judge you even more, they’ll do it. [6] X Research source Keep an ear out for phrases like, “You always…” and “You never…” Sweeping statements like these are often overgeneralizations, and it probably means that the person you’re dating is exaggerating to make your actions seem worse."

If the person you’re dating can’t admit when they’ve done something wrong and never apologizes, even when you call them out directly, this is a bad sign. A toxic person loves to play the victim, and they’ll constantly find ways to shift the blame to someone else. This goes for issues in your relationship, and things in their personal life, as well. A classic example of this is someone calling all of their exes “crazy,\" saying all their friends are terrible and everyone in their life lets them down. They’ll also try to spin things around and blame you in fights, explains Polk. [9] X Expert Source Jason Polk, LCSW, LAC Relationship Counselor Expert Interview. 11 February 2022.

If this sounds like your partner, you may be in a relationship with a toxic person. Say, for example, that you tell your significant other that you’re a little upset because they showed up 30 minutes late to your date last weekend. When you bring it up, they respond with statements like, “It’s so ridiculous for you even to be upset about that. It wasn’t a big deal at all,” or “That’s completely untrue, I was barely late. It couldn’t have been more than 5 minutes.” These statements invalidate your feelings and make you question your version of events, which would be an example of gaslighting."
