      "content": "Get active. If you must sit at school and/or work, then move your legs and body about, but not constantly like a pendulum. Get up and go to the pencil sharpener, if possible. Step outside during your lunch break or walk to get a drink of water. If you want to get in shape but you’re too busy to hit the gym, you need to at least get yourself up and active. Walk. Park on the far side of the parking area. There are lots of ways to do such things, and they don’t need to be very time consuming or costly at all. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Make a point of taking the stairs rather than an elevator when going home or to work (split between stairs and elevator if you need to go up very high). Get a standing or treadmill desk, or use an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Go ahead, listen to your favorite TV shows -- but don’t just sit there watching. Cook, fold laundry, empty the dishwasher or ride a stationary bike. Do a step routine/step up/step down (repeatedly) for a good while. Do squats while waiting for your food to cook. Walk around on your tiptoes, in a duck posture or in a semi-squatting position."

      "content": "Eat balanced meals . You will need to eat a proper balance of protein, carbohydrates (found grains), fruits and vegetables, and dairy. Whole grains might comprise about 30% of the food you eat (if grains are not inflammatory for you), fruits and vegetables another 30% (weighted more towards vegetables), dairy 15%, very lean protein 15% or up to 40%, if you lower the calories from carbohydrates. Lower unhealthy fats, processed carbs and sugar to no more than 4% of you diet. There are different types of fats. Some are good for you, while others are not. You should avoid trans fats (found in many commercially baked and snack foods) and limit saturated fats (ground meats, sausages, wieners, fried foods and butter). However, monounsaturated fats (olive oil, avocados) and polyunsaturated fats (fish, walnuts) are good for you. Good whole grains include whole wheat, whole oats, quinoa and brown rice. Good fruits and vegetables include chickpeas/garbanzo beans (can be used to make hummus), beans, kale, broccoli, spinach, blueberries, strawberries, lemons and pears."

When exercising, make sure you are getting your heart rate up for at least ten minutes at a time. Here are some example exercises (try to do all three every day): Do 2 minutes of planks, 4 minutes of jumping jacks, and 4 minutes of squats with thighs parallel to the floor (not deep squats), as soon as you get up. Do a few sets of as many push-ups you can do while keeping good form. If you have time before getting ready for work, go for a half hour fast walk or jog. Use a stationary or mobile bike for half an hour when you get home from work or school. Reader Poll: We asked 331 wikiHow readers for their favorite ab workout to target and strengthen core muscles, and only 11% of them said bird dogs. [Take Poll] However, bird dogs are a great way to work your core if you have back pain. So, if other ab exercises hurt your back, switch it up with some bird dogs."
