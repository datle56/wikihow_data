      "content": "Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl to form a soft, firm dough. Start by mixing 2 cups (10 oz) of all-purpose flour, 2 eggs, 4 additional egg yolks, and 1 tsp (5 mL) of iodized or kosher salt. It’ll be easiest to do this using a food processor or stand mixer, but you can also mix the ingredients by hand. Add 2 tsp (10 mL) of olive oil if you want: if you're rolling your pasta by hand, it'll make the dough easier to handle. In a food processor : Pulse a few times to combine the ingredients, then process the mixture for about 45 seconds. In a stand mixer : Combine all the ingredients with a flat beater for 30–60 seconds. Switch to a dough hook attachment and mix at medium speed for another 2 minutes. [1] X Research source By hand: Add the flour and salt to a bowl and form a 4-inch (10 cm) \"well\" in the center. Whisk the eggs and egg yolks together in a separate bowl, then pour the mixture into the well. Slowly push the flour into the egg with a fork, until you've formed a soft dough. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Make adjustments as needed to give your dough the right consistency. The brand of flour, size of eggs, and humidity in the air can all affect the dough, meaning that you may need to adjust the recipe slightly if your dough isn’t soft enough. [3] X Expert Source Thuong Tan Noodle Expert Expert Interview. 28 January 2021. Add more flour if your dough is too wet, and add a bit of water if your dough is too dry. If your dough feels wet and tacky, add a spoonful of flour at a time until it feels firm. If your dough is so dry it won't combine or breaks apart when held, mist it with water or spatter a few drops with your fingertips. Don’t do this for minor cracks."

      "title": "Knead the dough by hand and then wrap it in plastic.",
      "content": "Knead the dough by hand and then wrap it in plastic. Place the dough on a floured surface and fold in any remaining flour by hand or with a bench knife. Knead the dough by pressing it down and forward with the flat of your hand. Rotate the dough as you knead, until it’s smooth and firm, like a ball of Play-Doh. [4] X Research source This will take about 10 minutes if you combined the ingredients by hand, and only 1–2 minutes if you used a food processor or mixer. Then wrap the kneaded dough in plastic wrap. Test the dough’s firmness by slicing into it with a knife. If there are air bubbles in the dough, this is a sign it hasn’t been kneaded enough."

      "title": "Let the dough rest for one hour for a softer pasta (optional).",
      "content": "Let the dough rest for one hour for a softer pasta (optional). Over time, moisture will distribute more evenly in the dough. This makes the dough easier to handle, and makes softer, less rubbery pasta. If you have some experience handling dough, you can skip this step without major problems, but if you’re new to the pasta game, consider letting the dough rest. [5] X Research source This pasta is best cooked immediately after making, but if you’re not ready to cook your pasta just yet, store it in the refrigerator for up to a day, or seal the wrapped dough in a plastic bag and freeze it for up to 3 weeks.

      "title": "Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.",
      "content": "Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll the dough by hand into a cylinder. Cut the cylinder in half, then cut each half into thirds to make 6 even pieces. Sprinkle flour over any dough you aren't currently using, and cover it with a towel or plastic wrap. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll each piece of dough using a pasta machine or by hand.",
      "content": "Roll each piece of dough using a pasta machine or by hand. It’s faster and easier to use a pasta maker , but if you don’t have one (or want a little exercise), roll out your dough yourself using nothing but a rolling pin and a little elbow grease. The heavier your rolling pin, the faster you’ll go by hand. [8] X Research source By hand: Flour your countertop and roll out each piece of dough into a rectangle roughly 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 20 inches (50 cm) long. When finished, it’ll be transparent enough to see your fingers through it. Lift the dough up frequently and dust with more flour as needed. Using a pasta machine: Set the machine to its widest setting. Press the dough to a flat rectangle and send it through. Fold one end over the center, then the other, making a stack of 3 layers of dough. Flour lightly and roll it through again. Repeat at least 3 times to add a chewy texture. [9] X Research source Set the machine to a slightly narrower setting. Dust with flour and send the dough through, without folding. Repeat with increasingly narrower settings, until you’ve reached the desired thickness (typically the third-to-last setting or further). A hand-cranked pasta machine is the cheapest option, but you can use an attachment for kitchen mixers instead."

      "content": "Cut the noodles to the size you want. You can use a pizza cutter, a sharp knife, or a pasta cutting machine. This same dough can be used to form noodles of any size. Fold the dough strips into tubes to make macaroni. Pinch dough rectangles in the center to form farfalle. Place pasta sheets between wax paper or a kitchen towel while you aren't actively cutting them. This prevents them from drying out."

      "content": "Cook the pasta immediately, or dry it out to store it. This pasta is best cooked right after you’ve made it, and it only takes 60–120 seconds in boiling water. If you want to store it long-term, hang the noodles up to dry over clean, plastic coat hangers or pasta drying racks . [10] X Research source Dry the noodles until they’re brittle, then store them in an airtight container for up to several weeks."
