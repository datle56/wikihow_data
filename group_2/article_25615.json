      "content": "Truth or Dare This is a fun and nostalgic choice since most people grew up playing Truth or Dare at sleepovers. You can opt for the traditional version, or if you’re throwing a 21+ girls’ night, you can spice things up with a more grown-up variation like Truth or Drink. Truth or Drink involves asking someone a juicy question. That person can either answer or take a swig of their alcoholic beverage. If you tend to have trouble coming up with questions or dares on the spot, check out this helpful list for some inspiration!"

      "title": "Never Have I Ever",
      "content": "Never Have I Ever This game is a fun way to learn all about your friends’ escapades. To play, everyone holds up ten fingers, and then players take turns saying something they’ve never done, starting with the phrase “never have I ever.” If any of the other players have done this thing, they have to put down one finger. Another variation of the game involves taking a drink instead of putting down a finger, which is a good option if you’re serving cocktails or wine at your girls’ night. If you don’t want to worry about coming up with good “never have I ever” statements , you may want to purchase the Never Have I Ever: Girls Edition card game to make things easier. Just beware that this card game contains some mature content, so it’s meant for players who are 18+!"

Worried about coming up with good “Most Likely To” questions? We’ve got you covered! Check out this list for inspiration."

Alexa will play a short audio clip from a movie, and you’ll need to guess the title!"

It comes with 500 cards split up into different categories, like “Truth or Dare” “Most Likely To,” and “Never Have I Ever.” Each player rolls the dice to determine which type of card to pull. If they pull “Truth or Dare,” for example, they’ll need to answer a question or do a dare to keep the card. If they pull “Never Have I Ever…” they get to keep the card if they have done the thing written on it. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins! [5] X Research source This game is a great option if you want to eliminate the brainstorming aspect from games like Truth or Dare or Never Have I Ever.

The best card wins the round! Just like romance novels themselves, Romance vs. The World has some mature content, so it’s meant for adult players only. Of course, if you prefer to stick with the classics, regular Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity make great girls’ night games, too!"

You can even film each person's reveal and post your own TikTok, if you'd like!

Next, your guests print and cut out pictures of the craziest and most out-there characters they have secret crushes on and tape them to the ends of the wooden skewers. From there, you each take turns sticking the skewers into the cake and revealing your picks! [8] X Research source The point of the game isn’t to pick people or characters that everyone’s attracted to—it’s to make some wacky choices that will get your friends to laugh. For example, some choices that have shown up in popular TikToks include the dad from Inside Out , Nick Wilde from Zootopia , the fairy godmother from Shrek , Patchy the Pirate from Spongebob , and even the number 8. This video from TikTok user @taylornaustin is a great example of how to do the trend if you’re looking for some inspo!"
