Talk about things like philosophy, art, film, and politics, and don't be afraid to share your point of view even if the two of you disagree. A Leo appreciates a battle of the minds and will be up for a friendly debate. [1] X Research source After you see a movie together, go out for some pie and coffee to talk about the film. Say something like, \"I thought it was interesting that the main character was also the villain in the story. What did you think about that?\" If you're at a museum and discussing a certain painting, say, \"I think the painting is a metaphor for the artist's experience with grief. What do you think?\" Try to come up with some follow-up questions if they start talking about themselves—don't just change the subject afterward.

Leos are one of the most self-assured signs of the zodiac, and they're looking for a partner that shares that belief in themselves. [3] X Research source If you see him at a party, smile at him and walk over to say hi. You may be nervous on the inside, but you'll look relaxed and confident to him. Don't be shy about all of the cool things that you do. If he asks about your interest in piano, for example, proudly tell him that you've been playing for 10 years and won a state competition. Confidence takes work to build over time. If you're not always feeling super confident, try faking it. Keeping good posture and repeating mantras in your head like, \"I am awesome!\" or \"I can do this\" can really help.
