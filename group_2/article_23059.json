Sending a few texts back and forth and maybe talking on the phone at some point during the day is pretty normal for people in committed relationships. However, people in more casual relationships might only talk every other day or a few days a week. [1] X Research source Some people like to be in constant contact, while others may only want to text a few times a week. Talk to your partner to find out what sort of texting schedule works best for both of you. If you’re in a long-distance relationship, try to set up virtual dates to make your relationship more intimate and less text-based.

      "content": "Check in with serious partners at least once a day. Many people expect their serious partners to message them daily, so choose a time during the day when you know they’re available to ask them how they’re doing, update them about something that happened to you, or let them know you’re thinking about them.

You’ve been on my mind a ton today 😘 How’s your day going?” As another example, you could say, “Hey 😄 my day has been SO crazy so far. I hope your day is doing better than mine!” If you’re in a brand new relationship with someone, texting every day might seem a little overbearing. It’s okay to leave a few lulls in the conversation. However, a daily text is expected in a lot of exclusive relationships."

At the start of a relationship, you might both eagerly text back and forth without a break, but as it progresses it’s normal for texting to slow down. As long as it’s not time-sensitive, it’s okay to reply later. [10] X Research source Try to write your texts so they’re about the same length as your partner’s. That way, you can keep the conversation going rather than using one-word replies. [11] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. Your texting speed might vary depending on how far you are in the relationship. If you’re in something pretty casual, you may have a few days between messages.

I hope you have an amazing day!” This can leave a really good impression on your partner if you’re in a new relationship. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t wake up to a text from your partner.
