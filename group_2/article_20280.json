Unlike criminal court, losing a civil lawsuit does not result in any jail time. If you want a court to award you money from someone else because you think that they have wronged you in some way, you will need a civil court order. To get a civil order, you must first file a civil lawsuit. [1] X Research source There are many types of civil lawsuits, including: personal injury lawsuits, defamation lawsuits, breach of contract lawsuits, medical malpractice lawsuits, and slip and fall lawsuits."

      "content": "Consider hiring an attorney. If you want to file a civil lawsuit, an experienced attorney can help you win your libel case. Although you can represent yourself in court, many civil lawsuits are difficult to win, so if possible, you should have an attorney who can advocate for you. Additionally, an attorney will be able to help you navigate the unfamiliar and sometimes complex court system. If you do want to hire an attorney, choose someone who has at least 3-5 years of experience handling whatever type of case you have. To find an attorney near you, consider talking to friends and family members who have used an attorney before. Find out who they hired, for what type of service, if they were happy with the services, and why or why not. Ask if they would recommend the attorney. You can also find an attorney by checking online reviews. Many websites offer free reviews of businesses. Some places to look for lawyer reviews include: FindLaw , Avvo , and Yahoo Local ."

      "content": "Decide which type of court to sue in. The law establishes limits on which courts have “jurisdiction” (power) to hear and decide a case. Therefore, it is important that you file your case in a court that has the power to hear your case. In the United States, you will file your civil case in either state or federal court. [2] X Research source Generally, you should file a case that deals with a state law in state court. The majority of civil cases, including personal injury cases, landlord-tenant cases, and breach of contract are based on state law. Usually, you should file your state court case in the state where the actions occurred. There are a few types of cases that should be filed in “federal court” instead of state court. If your case is based on a federal law, you can sue in federal court. A few examples of cases under federal law include: suing a police officer under the federal civil rights statute (called a 1983 case),suing someone for patent infringement, or suing an employer under Title 7 for discrimination.

Once you figure out which state to sue in, you also need to figure out which court in that state is the correct one to sue in: for example, many states have different “levels” of courts that plaintiffs can file in depending on how much money they are asking for. Typically, states will have the following courts (which may have different names) to choose from: Small claims court: small claims courts will usually hear claims that involve a certain amount of money - usually up to $2,500 - $5,000. Courts for medium-sized claims: usually, the middle level of court will hear cases that involve claims of up to $25,000, Courts for any cases with larger claims: there is usually a court that will hear claims that are about $25,000, and also certain specialized statutory claims that specify in the law which court will hear them."

After you determine which court you should file your lawsuit in, you should begin to prepare your “complaint.” To sue someone, you must prepare a document called a complaint that you will file with the court. The complaint includes the grounds or cause of action for your lawsuit. [4] X Research source If you have an attorney, he or she will write and file your complaint.

      "content": "Try to resolve your case before trial. Even if you file a lawsuit, you won’t necessarily get a court order after a trial. Most cases actually “settle” before trial. Settling with the opposing party is a good idea for many reasons including: Timing: trials are often long and drawn out, therefore, settling now means that you will probably receive money sooner rather than later. Easier than trial: as someone representing yourself, going all the way through the trial can be stressful due to the complex and unfamiliar nature of the legal system, settling will save you from having to navigate all the way through a trial on your own. You will know and agree to the result: if you end up going to trial, you really have no idea how the judge will decide your case, and the order may end up being against you! Settling allows you to agree to the amount of money you will receive, and saves you and your opponent from the uncertainty of trial."

If you need a court to grant you a divorce, award custody, visitation, or child support, or establish paternity, you will need to get an order from the family court in the state where you live. Every state has different rules and requirements for filing an action in family court, so if possible, you should consult an attorney before taking any action. [5] X Research source Family court orders are almost always from the family court in the state where the parties reside. If a child is involved, the action is usually filed in the state where the child lives. [6] X Research source Matters that deal with “family issues,” are almost never filed in federal court. Therefore, if you file for divorce, custody, visitation or paternity, you will file your action in state court."

Additionally, paternity must be established in order to handle issues such as child support, and even custody and visitation. In many cases, paternity can be established without a court order if both the mother of the child and the alleged father agree on paternity. However, if the alleged father does not admit to paternity, you may need a court order. [7] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source The procedure will differ depending on your state, but usually, the person who wants to establish paternity will file a “Complaint to Establish Paternity.” In most cases, the only people who can file in court to establish paternity are the child, the child’s mother, and the alleged father. Usually, the court will order a DNA test to determine whether the “father” in the complaint (whether he filed the complaint was named by someone else) is actually the child’s biological father. Because paternity cases can be extremely complicated, you should call your local family court to see if there is any help available to help you through the process."

All states allow a “no-fault” divorce, which is a divorce where the spouse asking for a divorce does not have to prove that the other spouse did something wrong. To get a no fault divorce, one spouse must simply state a reason for the divorce that is recognized by the state. In most states, it's enough to declare that the couple cannot get along. [8] X Research source While it is possible to file for divorce yourself, it is often useful to acquire help during the process. Depending on the state you and your spouse live in, you may be able to get help from a “domestic relations clinic” at your courthouse, a low cost attorney, or a legal clinic at a local law school.

Custody and support are responsibilities of both parents, regardless of the couple's relationship status. If you and your spouse/partner cannot come to an agreement on the amount of child support or the custody of your children, the court will enter an order telling both of you what to do. [9] X Research source If you are in the middle of your divorce, then you likely have a case number or court file already. Therefore, you will not need to file anything extra to get an order regarding custody and support. If you are married and have not yet filed for divorce, you will need to file for divorce in order to get a hearing for child custody and support. If you have filed for divorce, or are not currently married to your child’s other parent, call the local court clerk (either in the county where you live, or where you filed for divorce) and ask to schedule a hearing for child custody and support."

Ordering abusers or stalkers not to come within a certain distance of you and/or your children. Most commonly, this distance is 100 yards (91.4 m), but it can be extended well beyond that. If you live with the abuser, the judge can order he or she to move out.

While it's not mandatory to have a lawyer with you when you file a restraining order, it would be smart to get an attorney if possible, to answer any extra questions you have about your situation or help you fill out your forms. If you have questions but prefer not to hire a lawyer, ask for help from court staff or an advocate, who may be able to answer your question. Additionally, you can call a domestic violence hotline to ask about your options, and in some cases, the organization associated with the hotline can provide a lawyer for you.
