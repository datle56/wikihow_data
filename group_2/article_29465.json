      "content": "Apple cider vinegar doesn’t kill fleas, but it may repel them. Fleas don’t like the smell or taste of apple cider vinegar, so applying a diluted ACV and water solution may prevent fleas from making a home in your pet’s fur. [1] X Research source It’s important to note, however, that many veterinarians recommend using traditional flea repellant methods instead. “Medications are the most effective method to remove fleas and prevent them from returning,” explains veterinarian Ray Spragley, DVM. Safety may also be an issue. Although apple cider vinegar isn’t toxic to dogs or cats, it can sometimes cause skin irritation. Additionally, if your pet licks their skin and accidentally ingests the ACV solution, it may cause stomach issues like diarrhea or vomiting, especially for pets with sensitive stomachs. [2] X Research source The bottom line? ACV could work as a natural flea repellant, and it is non-toxic. There are some risks, however, so it’s a good idea to consult your vet first. Below, we’ll go over some ways to use ACV against fleas if you and your vet decide it’s the right method for you."

      "content": "Mix apple cider vinegar, castile soap, and water to make a flea spray. Putting straight vinegar directly onto your pet can irritate their skin, so you’ll need to make a diluted solution. Mix up 1 cup of ACV, 1 quart warm water, and 1 ounce of castile soap. This diluted solution is powerful enough to deal with fleas, but not so strong that you will be able to smell it. If you’re treating a dog, you can add 2-3 drops of lavender or cedar oil to the mixture for added flea-fighting power. The scent of the oil will help keep the fleas and ticks off and also give the solution a pleasant smell.

      "content": "Apply the solution directly on your pet’s fur. Apply the ACV wash solution onto your pet, using your fingers to work it into their fur like you would regular pet shampoo. The Castile soap should lather a bit at this point, so rub the suds into their skin as well. Let the solution sit for ten minutes. Make sure you don't get the solution into their eyes or ears, as the ACV can cause irritation in these sensitive areas. Be careful not to get the solution in their mouth as well, since the ACV can cause an upset stomach if they ingest it. Don’t apply the solution if your pet has any broken skin from scratching."

Each time you comb through a section of fur, dip your comb in a bowl of soapy water to get rid of the fleas on the comb, then continue on. The fleas should come off your pet's fur easily, since they are repelled by the taste of the ACV. [5] X Research source Once you finish combing your pet, rinse the wash out with warm water. If your pet has particularly thick fur, you may have to go over their body twice with the comb. After the first combing, rinse your pet and apply a second round of ACV treatment. Wait ten minutes, then start again. Make sure you use a comb designed for flea removal. Fleas are very small, so a very tight special comb is needed to remove the fleas and their eggs, explains dog trainer David Schmucker."

      "content": "Repeat the ACV treatment in a few days. Fleas have a life cycle that lasts a few weeks, so if you missed any fleas the first time around, they may lay more eggs in your home and cause a reinfestation. You'll have to keep giving your pet the ACV treatment every few days until you no longer see any signs of fleas. This will likely take 2 or more treatments over a 5-10 day period."

Unfortunately, fleas can live for days or even weeks on fabrics, so you’ll need to clean everything your pet has come into contact with. “Use a washing machine to wash all bedding, rugs, and pet bedding, which are common areas fleas breed,” says pest management expert Luke Lewis. You should do this a few times as you’re fighting the infestation to really make sure you get all the fleas and stop the spread in its tracks. This prevents your pet from getting re-infected with fleas from their environment as you’re working on getting the infestation under control. You should also wash any throw pillows or throw blankets your pet has come into contact with, as well as any soft toys they play with.

This is especially important if you have carpet in your home, since flea eggs can infest carpet in the same way they can infest bedding and other fabrics. A good thorough vacuuming session can help you get rid of these eggs and any live fleas that may be hiding. Additionally, make sure you vacuum upholstered couches and chairs, crevices in your furniture, corners of the room, and any place that your pet has been. [7] X Research source"

Fill a large spray bottle with this solution, then spray carpets, wood floors, crevices and corners, windowsills, and furniture in a thick coating of the spray. You may need to repeat this method for 2-7 days depending on how bad your flea infestation is. If you are just trying to prevent infestation, you can do this once a month.
