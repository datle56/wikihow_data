Tutorials, life hacks, witty Q&As, quick tips, and rare facts all make great short-form videos. Hop on a trend: When you scroll through your own Reels, you're bound to notice trends like certain dances, filters, memes, music, and filming locations. Take an idea that's already viral and use it to present your topic with your own unique twist. Behind the scenes: If you have a business, try a peek into your workspace, your daily routine, and a show-and-tell of your tools to show the human side of your brand. If your account is personal, try to film a day in your life in short clips—the things you see, your habits and rituals, and your progress on projects. Before and after: Makeovers, restoring antiques, big cleaning projects, and home remodeling videos will all both shock and satisfy viewers. Relatable stories: Find a way to connect your topic to something anyone can relate to, then narrate your connection to the topic over a thoughtful video. Listicles: Everyone loves a funny, informative, or thought-provoking list. For example, \"10 products to try if you love xxx,\" \"Top 5 best self-esteem boosting songs,\" \"7 unique nail color ideas for fall,\" etc."
