      "title": "Travel to the plains, forest, or flower forest biome.",
      "content": "Travel to the plains, forest, or flower forest biome. Keep an eye out for a bee nest hanging on the bottom of a tree or bees flying around. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put some flowers nearby for the bees to pollinate.",
      "content": "Put some flowers nearby for the bees to pollinate. They will fly around the flowers for around 30 seconds and eventually gain an animation of pollen dripping from their abdomen. [2] X Research source Then, the bees fly back to their nest and deposit the honey. The flowers must not be more than three blocks away from the bees nest, or the bees won't be attracted. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put a campfire below the nest.",
      "content": "Put a campfire below the nest. This will stop the bees from attacking you when you try to obtain honey or honeycomb. Campfires can be crafted with 3 sticks, one piece of charcoal, and 3 logs. [4] X Research source The bee could accidentally fly into the fire and burn to death. If this happens, dig a hole below the hive and place the campfire there."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use shears on the nest once it is full.",
      "content": "Use shears on the nest once it is full. This will be indicated by the design of the block. Using shears on the nest will get you 3 honeycomb, which you should use to craft a beehive. [5] X Research source The beehive crafting recipe is 3 honeycomb in the middle row and wooden planks in every other slot. They function almost exactly like a bee nest. You can skip this step if you have a silk touch tool. Then, you can wait until the bees go back into the nest at nighttime and break the nest, trapping the bees inside. Transport the nest to your bee enclosure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the bees on a lead.",
      "content": "Put the bees on a lead. Leads can be crafted with one slimeball and one piece of string, although an easier way to get them is by killing llamas from the Wandering Trader. Right-click the bee while holding the lead, and it will follow you. [6] X Research source Donâ€™t move too fast or the lead will break. Get at least two bees so that you can breed them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lure the bees with a flower if you don't have a lead.",
      "content": "Lure the bees with a flower if you don't have a lead. Bees will follow you if you are holding any flower. This method is tedious but cheap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Build an enclosure.",
      "content": "Build an enclosure. You should put a door for your own exit, but make sure there are no gaps for the bees to escape. Block up any water sources since they are dangerous to your bees. Put flowers inside the enclosure. Crops grow faster when bees with pollen fly over them. You can use this to your advantage by putting the crops in between the flowers and the nest/hive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place down the beehive.",
      "content": "Place down the beehive. You can keep campfires permanently lit beneath them so that they never get angry with you. Place some carpet over the campfires."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lure the bees inside.",
      "content": "Lure the bees inside. Use either the lead or a flower as you did before. If you picked up the bee's nest using silk touch, simply place it down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Breed the bees by feeding flowers to two adults.",
      "content": "Breed the bees by feeding flowers to two adults. This will give you a baby bee, which will grow to become an adult in 20 minutes. Keep in mind that the hive can only house 3 bees each, so you'll need to make more if you keep breeding them. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait until the hive is full of honey.",
      "content": "Wait until the hive is full of honey. Using a glass bottle will get you a honey bottle that can cure poison or be crafted into the honey block. Honey blocks are useful for redstone and parkour. To craft them, arrange four honey bottles in a square formation."
