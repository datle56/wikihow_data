      "title": "Add three to four drops of saline solution to dried-out mascara.",
      "content": "Add three to four drops of saline solution to dried-out mascara. Use saline-based contact solution or eye wash. Be sure the eye drops aren’t specially formulated to reduce redness, as this could actually irritate your eyes. [1] X Research source Pour a few drops in the tube, shake it, and then test the mascara on your wrist. Add another drop or two if it’s still dry. Don’t add more than about ten drops. If you put too much liquid in the mascara, it won’t work properly."

      "title": "Use aloe vera to avoid clumps in your mascara.",
      "content": "Use aloe vera to avoid clumps in your mascara. Aloe vera can thin out your mascara and give you a smoother application. Put one to two pea-sized drops of aloe vera gel into the tube. Twist your wand in the tube to mix the gel in. Swipe the wand over your wrist to see if you get less clumps. Add another drop if you feel you need to. As with saline solution, it’s best not to add too much aloe vera to the tube. If you’ve still got thick, clumpy mascara after you’ve added about five drops of gel, it’s probably best to get a new tube."

      "title": "Add coconut oil to mascara to condition your lashes.",
      "content": "Add coconut oil to mascara to condition your lashes. Coconut oil will also thin out your mascara, and it may even lengthen your lashes! Heat up a spoonful of the oil in the microwave for about 15-30 seconds, or until it melts. Use the spoon to put three to four drops of the (now liquid) coconut oil in your mascara tube. You can either shake the tube or twist your wand in there to mix the oil in. You may notice that your lashes are longer after using this solution for about two months."

      "title": "Boil a pot of water on your stovetop.",
      "content": "Boil a pot of water on your stovetop. Use a medium-sized saucepan and fill it up about halfway. Turn your stovetop up to high heat. It shouldn’t take more than five minutes for the water to start boiling. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the boiling water into a heat-safe glass bowl.",
      "content": "Pour the boiling water into a heat-safe glass bowl. Pour carefully and slowly. You don’t want any to splash on you! Don’t worry if all the water doesn’t fit. You just need a few inches (several centimeters) of water in there. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check that your mascara tube is tightly closed.",
      "content": "Check that your mascara tube is tightly closed. Pick up your tube and give the cap a good twist. You’re going to put it into the water, so you don’t want any to leak in. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak the mascara in the glass bowl for five to ten minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the mascara in the glass bowl for five to ten minutes. Drop the mascara into the bowl of hot water. Leave the tube in the water for a minimum of five and up to about ten minutes. [5] X Research source Use the timer on your phone or stovetop to track your mascara’s progress."

    {
      "title": "Dry off the tube and test your mascara.",
      "content": "Dry off the tube and test your mascara. Use tongs or a large spoon to scoop your mascara out of the bowl. Place the tube on your counter top and then dry it off with a dishcloth. Avoid touching the mascara with your skin for a few minutes. Once the tube feels cool to the touch, swipe your wand across your wrist to see if the mascara has gotten thinner. [6] X Research source If this doesn’t work the first time, you probably need to add liquid to your mascara to thin it out."

      "title": "Screw the cap on tightly after each use.",
      "content": "Screw the cap on tightly after each use. Ensure that your mascara is closed by giving the cap an extra twist after you’re done using it. Even a small amount of air can cause your mascara to completely dry out. [7] X Research source If you struggle to open the mascara back up again, put rubber gloves on and then try again! This will give you a better grip."

    {
      "title": "Store it standing up.",
      "content": "Store it standing up. Use a small, glass jar to store your mascara upright with your makeup brushes. This will help the liquid in the tube stay fresh longer. [8] X Research source You can even decorate the jar to make it part of a pretty display in your bathroom or bedroom!"

      "title": "Avoid pumping your mascara wand.",
      "content": "Avoid pumping your mascara wand. Many people pump their wands because they think this gets more mascara on the brush and then onto their lashes. Don’t do it! This actually adds air to the tube, leaving your mascara dried-out and clumpy. Instead, twist your wand in a circular motion as you lift it out of the tube. [9] X Research source The circular, twisting motion will allow you to scrape the sides of the tube with your wand. You’ll get plenty of mascara on your brush without causing air to get into the tube."

      "title": "Dispose of thinned mascara after 1 week.",
      "content": "Dispose of thinned mascara after 1 week. Mascara contains carefully balanced ingredients that are formulated to prevent the growth of bacteria. When you thin mascara with water or any other substance, you throw off that balance and increase the chance that bacteria can grow. In order to prevent a potentially serious eye infection, never use thinned mascara for more than 1 week."

      "content": "Keep your wand when you’re ready to throw out your mascara. Who doesn’t love recycling expensive beauty products? Soak the wand in makeup remover for a few hours to get off all the gunk. Then, clean it with warm water and body soap. Rinse it off, dry it out, and you’ve got a new makeup tool. [10] X Research source Use it as a spare mascara wand or eyebrow brush. [11] X Research source"
