      "content": "KEKW is a Twitch emote used to convey laughter. KEKW was originally published by Keesual on FrankerFaceZ, a Twitch extension that allows people to create and submit custom emotes. [1] X Research source Since then, KEKW has become a popular emote that represents laughter when something hilarious happens—kind of like the gamer equivalent of the laughing face emoji. You might also see someone type out “KEKW” or the lowercase version “kekw” to represent laughter. [2] X Research source Many people debate about how KEKW is pronounced. While some people pronounce it “Keh-kwuh,” others might say “Keh-kuh-wah.” There’s no right or wrong way to say it. You might see other variations of the KEKW emote on Twitch, like KEKWhat or KEKWow."

      "content": "KEKW comes from World of Warcraft slang. In the video game World of Warcraft, if an Alliance player writes “LOL” to a Horde player, it gets transcribed as “KEK.” The “W” at the end of “KEKW” is used to convey exaggerated facial expressions. [7] X Research source For example, “LULW” is the exaggerated form of “LUL” (the Twitch equivalent of LOL). If a Horde player writes “LOL,” it gets transcribed as “BUR.” “KEK” is also the Korean equivalent of “LOL,” which is where some players think that the Alliance-to-Horde translation comes from."
