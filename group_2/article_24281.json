      "content": "Find an indoor receptacle to connect to on the wall where you want the exterior outlet. Look around the outside of your home for an area where you want to place the outlet, such as on a porch or patio. Once you find the spot where you want to place the outlet, go inside your home and find the nearest outlet on the other side of the exterior wall. Be sure to choose an outlet that isn't switch-operated or else the exterior outlet won't work when you plug into it. [1] X Research source If you don't have an inside outlet on the wall where you want the exterior outlet, then hire an electrician to run wires from your circuit box to the spot. Rather than connecting to an existing receptacle, you can also run the outlet back to your circuit breaker.

      "title": "Turn off the power at the circuit box for the outlet that you're connecting to.",
      "content": "Turn off the power at the circuit box for the outlet that you're connecting to. Locate the breaker inside your circuit box that controls the interior outlet and flip the switch to the off position. Put an outlet tester in the plug to see if it still has a current running through it. If none of the lights turn on when you plug the tester in, then it's disconnected from power and you can continue working. [3] X Research source Try the outlet tester in a plug that you know works to make sure the tester functions properly. Never work on an outlet when it's still connected to power since you could electrocute yourself. If some of the lights still turn on when you plug the tester in, then the outlet is still live and you turned off the wrong breaker. Continue testing the breakers until the tester says the outlet has no power."

      "content": "Remove the outlet from the wall to access the box behind it. Use a screwdriver to remove the cover plate on the outlet and set it aside. Unscrew the screws on the top and bottom of the outlet to loosen it from the wall. Once you remove the screws from the outlet, carefully pull it out from the wall so the wires stay attached to it. [4] X Research source Keep the screws for your outlet in a small container so you don't misplace them while you're working."

      "title": "Drill straight through the back of the outlet box and siding.",
      "content": "Drill straight through the back of the outlet box and siding. Position the end of a 12 in (30 cm) drill bit through the hole at the back of the outlet box, making sure it doesn't touch any wires. Turn the drill on and slowly push through the wall behind the outlet box. Continue pushing the drill bit through the wall until you feel it pop out through the exterior wall and through your siding. [5] X Research source If you can't drill through the back of the outlet box, then drill the hole next to the top corner of the box so you can still easily access the wires. If the inside outlet is less than 1 foot (30 cm) from the ground, angle your drill bit up so it comes out higher on the exterior wall. Never place an exterior outlet less than 1 foot (30 cm) from the ground since it could easily be exposed to moisture. If you're drilling through concrete or brick, use a drill bit meant for masonry."

      "content": "Feed a 12/2 cable through the hole in your outlet box. A 12/2 cable contains a live, neutral, and ground wire inside so you can easily attach an outlet to it. Push the 12/2 cable through the hole you just drilled so there's 5 inches (13 cm) of excess on the inside and outside of your home. Cut the cable to size with a pair of wire cutters. You can buy 12/2 cables from your local hardware store."

      "content": "Strip 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) off the interior end of the 12/2 cable. Clamp the jaws of a 12/2 cable stripper 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) from the end of the cable and squeeze the handles together. Pull the stripper toward the end of the cable to cut through the insulation and expose the 3 wires inside. Pull any leftover insulation off the 12/2 cable if it doesn't come off with the stripper.

      "content": "Expose 1 in (2.5 cm) on the end of each wire inside the 12/2 cable. The 12/2 cable contains a black wire, a white wire, and an exposed copper wire. Grip the black wire 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end with a pair of wire strippers and pull them toward you to remove the insulation. Repeat the process on the white wire so you can attach them to the outlet. [7] X Research source Sometimes, the ground wire may have green insulation around it. If there's a green wire in the cable, strip it as well."

      "content": "Loop the black wire clockwise around the live screw on the outlet. Use a pair of needlenose pliers to bend the end of the black wire into a loop. Locate the black screw on the side of the outlet and position the loop you made underneath the screw head. Make sure the loop goes clockwise around the screw so it has a full connection. Tighten the black screw to secure the live wire in place. [8] X Research source Check the back of your interior outlet to see if it has ports where you can plug additional wires in. That way, you don't need to loop the wire around the screw but it will still get power."

Loop the wire around the silver screw on the opposite side of the outlet so it goes clockwise. Tighten the screw with a screwdriver to secure the wire in place. [9] X Research source Put the wire in the back of the outlet behind the silver screw if there's a port so you don't have to wrap it around the screw."

Guide the end of the 12/2 cable through the hole in the middle of the exterior box and push the box against your siding. Locate the screw holes in the back of the box and drive screws into your siding to secure it tightly in place. [12] X Research source You can buy exterior outlet boxes from your local hardware or home improvement store. If you have brick exterior walls, position the screws so they go through the middle of the bricks rather than through the mortar."

      "content": "Screw the outlet into the exterior box to hold it in place. Hold the outlet inside of the exterior box so the screwholes line up with one another and so the wires are tucked in the back of the box. Use either wood screws or masonry anchors depending on whether you have wood or concrete exterior walls. Tighten the screws on the outlet to the sides of the box so it's secured in place. Some exterior boxes allow you to screw the outlets directly into them so you don't need to put more screws in your siding."
