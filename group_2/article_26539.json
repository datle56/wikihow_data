Then, tap the socket onto the locking nut with a mallet or hammer so it has a tight fit. Attach your ratchet to the socket, and turn it counterclockwise to loosen the lock until it comes off. [1] X Research source If the socket doesn’t grip the lock nut, carefully cut flat edges on the top and bottom of the wheel lock with a rotary tool . Then, fit the socket over the lock.
