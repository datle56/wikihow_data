      "content": "Check your state's requirements. For legal purposes like registration or changing title on a vehicle, the state needs to verify that the VIN on the car is correct. You generally cannot do this by yourself, but you may still have some options. Some states require you to take your car only to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Nevada is one state that uses this system. [1] X Research source Some states will allow you to get a verification from a local police station or the DMV. Examples of this are Montana, Massachusetts, or Vermont. Some states have private, licensed VIN verifiers who are more conveniently located, but will charge a small service fee. California and Florida [2] X Research source both use this system."

The two leading official sources for the information you need are the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) and the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). [4] X Research source The NMVTIS has an official, secure web site, http://www.vehiclehistory.gov/ , that will search the VIN and let you know if that car has ever been reported as stolen. The NMVTIS search has a fee that ranges from $3 to $15 and gives you a five-point report of the car's title, prior damage, odometer records, and salvage history. The NICB also has an official, secure site, https://www.nicb.org/vincheck , to check the car's history. The NICB search is free, but provides a limited report that only tells you if the car has ever been reported stolen or a “total loss.” [5] X Research source"
