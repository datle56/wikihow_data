      "title": "Let the person vent.",
      "content": "Let the person vent. Sometimes, when someone we care about feels crappy, the best thing we can offer is a listening ear. Give your loved one the opportunity to air his or her grievances about academic problems. Being able to express oneself in this way can be incredibly soothing. Plus, allowing your loved one to vent shows that you care. Demonstrate active listening by turning to face the person and making regular eye contact. Nod your head or make appropriate sounds to show you’re listening, such as “uh-huh.” When the person is done talking, try to reflect back what he or she has said using emotion. For example, you might say “It sounds like you’re really angry about your performance on the test.” At this point, simply let the person talk. Refrain from trying to “fix” the problem just yet."

      "content": "Share a story of how you overcame adversity. [1] X Research source One humbling way to support your friend during this tough circumstance is to share a situation in which you struggled. It might pertain to academics or it might merely be an anecdote about a different obstacle you have to overcome. Just make sure that the message is clear, and that you don't make yourself seem better than your friend. It may be scary at first to open up and tell someone about a difficulty you faced. However, it’s important to note that sharing your story may help your friend see that everyone encounters hardships and that it’s entirely possible to succeed despite setbacks."

      "title": "Offer to help however you can.",
      "content": "Offer to help however you can. Although you can’t fix the situation, there may be something you can do to help the person through it. Are you good in the subject that he or she is struggling in? Perhaps you could casually offer some tips on how to improve. Do you have pretty good study skills? Maybe you can share some of those nuggets of wisdom with your friend. Keep in mind that your friend may not want your help. Instead of thinking in advance of how you will help, simply ask “Is there anything I can do?” and see what the person’s response is. If he or she wants help from you, let them make a specific request. That way you don’t put your foot in your mouth by coming off like you’re superior."

      "content": "Remind them about other talents. Give your loved one a much-needed self-esteem boost. It’s normal for someone’s self-esteem to take a hit after performing poorly in school. Take a moment to offer a sincere compliment on some other attribute. Remind the person what else he or she has going despite having a bad grade. You can say something like “I know it sucks that you got an F in math. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that in English. You’re the best student in that class!” Just make sure the compliment is true and the person knows you’re not just saying it to make them feel better. [2] X Research source"

It’s not really your job to fix the situation or make it better in any way, really. It’s up to your friend to deal with poor grades, but he or she will certainly appreciate you showing support and acknowledging that it’s a sucky situation. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell them that their grades are not a reflection of who they are as a person.",
      "content": "Tell them that their grades are not a reflection of who they are as a person. Just because the person got a bad grade does not mean that they are not \"good\" at that or able to do it. A bad grade is just a measurement of the person's skill at that particular point, and a bad grade can be improved with extra studying and practice. It's just a temporary reflection of what they knew at that point. For example, you could say, \"I know that you don't understand multiplying fractions right now, but I know that you'll work extra hard to get a better grade on the next test!\" Or, you can say something like, \"I know that you're not happy with this score, but it doesn't mean that you are 'dumb.' It just means that you didn't understand this concept.\""

      "content": "Help them set realistic goals. [10] X Research source As a friend, you can motivate your friend after making a bad grade by suggesting that he or she set a goal to improve the grade. Setting a goal can give your friend something to focus on and making strides to reach it can offer a needed confidence boost. Keep in mind that this goal should be realistic and attainable, not a stab in the dark. For instance, if your friend made an F on his or her report card, it would be unreasonable to strive to get an A by the end of the next grading period. Maybe the person can set a goal to bring the F up to a C or a B, which is more feasible."

      "content": "Recommend that your friend start communicating with teachers. Sometimes, teachers have no idea whether or not a teaching method is successful. Encourage the student to go in and talk to their teacher about what he or she is not retaining well. Perhaps the teacher can offer additional assignments to ensure that the material is understood or even suggest online learning tools to practice at home. [13] X Research source Your friend may also need to adopt the habit of speaking up in class and asking questions as the material is being taught. Practice at home with him or her raising his hand and asking a question to achieve a better understanding. Recommend that they go over their old tests with their teacher to narrow down which areas they don't understand or which portions of problems they are getting stuck on. You could also suggest that they ask their teacher for extra tutoring."
