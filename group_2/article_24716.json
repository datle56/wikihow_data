      "content": "Wrap scare tape around tree branches, railings, and fences. You can purchase a reflective tape known as “scare tape” or “deterrent tape” online or at your local home and garden store. This tape has a holographic or shiny exterior that reflects sunlight, shining in birds eyes and deterring them from your property. It also makes a rustling sound in the wind for additional repelling ability. Try wrapping it around tree branches, railings, fences, or anywhere else you’d like to keep birds away from. [2] X Research source Scare tape is completely harmless to birds: it simply makes your property look unappealing to them. [3] X Research source For a cheaper option, you can also use aluminum foil. Try placing it in the dirt around any vulnerable plants and slightly burying the edges to keep it in place. [4] X Research source Both scare tape and aluminum foil will lose their effectiveness as their shininess fades so be sure to replace them regularly."

To keep birds out of your trees , try hanging strips of foil, shiny party streamers, old CDs, or aluminum pie plates from the branches. You may want to hang a few from the eaves above your deck or patio. These objects will make your property uninviting to birds without actually harming them.

You can purchase fake bird predators online or at your local hardware or home and garden store. Birds can adapt to non-moving objects, so be sure to move the predators around at least once a day to ensure birds continue to think that they’re real. [7] X Research source If you’re having trouble with geese, use a fake coyote instead, since owls and snakes may not be large enough to scare these bigger birds.

Again, be sure to move it frequently so the birds don’t figure out it’s not real."

      "content": "Put up wind chimes for a more subtle option. Sound can be a good weapon to keep birds away, but it doesn’t have to be particularly loud or grating to be effective. In some cases, wind chimes can provide enough unexpected noise to frighten birds away. You can either purchase a commercial wind chime or make your own . [9] X Research source Unsurprisingly, wind chimes will be less effective if you live in an area without much of a breeze."

Mimicking the noises birds make when they are distressed or the sounds of a predator species (like a hawk or eagle) can help you create the impression that your property is unsafe for birds. You can purchase a device that emits these sounds by searching online or visiting a well-stocked hardware store. You can also mimic these noises yourself by searching “bird distress calls” or “bird predator calls” on YouTube and then playing the sounds over a speaker placed in a window. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Playing the alarm calls for a few hours may keep birds away for weeks at a time, or you may need to play them every evening to prevent birds from coming onto your property to roost.

Run fishing line in a criss-crossing pattern high over your pool or flat roof by tying it to trees, eaves, flagpoles, or other high items. If the wire is thin and you hang it high enough, you likely won’t even be able to see it. Birds, however, will be annoyed by the impediments to their flying and will likely find somewhere less difficult to land.

They can be attached anywhere birds tend to roost including parapets and open ledges, roof ridges, signage, railings, and external lighting fixtures. When properly installed, they can create an “unperchable” environment for pesky birds. [17] X Research source Although they may appear menacing, anti-roosting spikes do not actually harm birds. They simply create a surface that is difficult for them to land and roost on. Anti-roosting spikes can be expensive and take time to install. However, they are one of the most reliable deterrents and will continue to work for years. For a lower cost alternative, try using a slinky (the coiled metal children’s toy). Simply extend the toy and attach it to the top of a railing using duct tape. The barrier of the coils will function like anti-roosting spikes, making it difficult for birds to find a comfortable spot to perch and roost."

Commercial repellents usually come in a paste or gel from, but you can also find them in sprays and powders online or in your local home and garden store. The repellent provides a sticky, slippery, or tacky layer on top of surfaces that make it difficult for pesky birds to perch and roost. Make sure to cover all likely gathering spots (such as railings and ledges) or the birds will simply find another space on your property to congregate. Commercial bird repellents can be a great option for renters who can’t install more permanent solutions to keep birds away. Bird repellent is nontoxic to birds and other animals, but it can stain painted surfaces. To protect any painted areas, cover them with masking tape before applying to substance.

Birds are attracted to anything they can eat, so make sure to keep your trash enclosed in latched bins, a garage, or a shed. Make sure to clean up after any outdoor meals and always clean your grill after you use it. If you feed your pet outdoors you can take measures to keep birds away from pet food . Put your dogs on a regular feeding schedule (which reduces leftover food) and always store your kibble properly by keeping it in an animal-proof container or, better yet, storing it indoors. Pesky birds such as pigeons can also be attracted to seed you put out for other species. To discourage unwanted birds from visiting your lawn, always put seed into birdfeeders and keep the ground beneath them cleaned up. You may need to stop feeding all birds for a few weeks until the unwanted species goes away.

Use rust-proof wire mesh to screen over any open areas, including chimneys, attic vents, soffits, and eaves. Consider installing mesh screens or other commercial protectants into your gutters as well. As a bonus, this can also help keep your gutters free of leaves and other natural debris. [25] X Expert Source Elmer Bensinger Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 5 February 2021. If you’re concerned about birds become ensnared in the mesh, purchase a hard, non-flexible metal screen with openings less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.

Usually made of plastic, bird netting is a larger scale and more flexible option that functions similarly to wire mesh, sealing off enclosed and semi-enclosed areas. Hang it in large spaces such as balconies, garages, barns, courtyards, balconies, or hangars to physically block birds from entering. You can purchase bird netting online or at your local home and garden store. [30] X Research source Bird netting comes in different sizes meant to keep different types of birds away. 4 inches (10 cm) mesh bird netting keeps out gulls; 2 inches (5.1 cm) mesh blocks pigeons; 1.125 inches (2.86 cm) mesh excludes starlings, grackles, blackbirds, and similarly sized birds; 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) bird netting keeps out small birds like sparrows and swallows. [31] X Research source Bird netting can be more dangerous to birds than other deterrent options. If poorly installed, birds can become trapped inside and smaller species, like sparrows, can become tangled in the netting itself, damaging their beaks and feet. Even when properly installed, birds’ legs and feet can occasionally get entangled. [32] X Research source"

Look for collections of twigs, mud and other objects on your property. Then put on rubber gloves and a respirator (to protect yourself from the mites or diseases) before removing and disposing of the nesting items. You may need to repeat this several times before the birds decide to give up and nest elsewhere. [36] X Research source Before removing the nest, make sure to check local and national animal protection laws.
