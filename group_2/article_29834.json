      "content": "Shortcuts allow you to send Snaps to multiple people at once. Rather than searching for each added friend in your contact list, you can compile them into groups to send Snaps with a single button. Each Shortcut can be labeled with a single emoji. Shortcuts are private to you. Other Snapchat users will not be notified you are using a shortcut. When you and a friend send at least one Snap to each other every day, you build a Streak. If you have ongoing Streaks with multiple friends, using Shortcuts can help keep your Streaks active by sending a Snap to all Streak friends with one click."
