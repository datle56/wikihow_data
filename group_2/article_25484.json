      "content": "See if he makes eye contact with you when you're around. If you notice the guy looking you in the eyes, try meeting his gaze with a smile , and hold it for a few seconds. If he doesn't look away, he might be interested in you, especially if he smiles back. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that this can just be him acknowledging you, or he may be in the habit of looking everyone in the eye.

      "content": "Watch whether he finds excuses to touch you. If a guy is always ready with a hug, he frequently touches you on your arm or shoulder, or he looks for reasons he can by physically close to you, he might like you. However, he might just be a touchy person, so pay attention to whether he acts like that with other people. If you're the only one, he probably has a crush. [6] X Research source If a guy ever makes you feel uncomfortable by touching you or pressing close to you, firmly tell him to stop and step away from him. Don't worry about hurting his feelings. If he's a decent guy, he'll apologize and avoid doing it again in the future. If it continues, stay away from him."

      "content": "Check whether he's following you on social media. If you notice that a guy constantly likes your posts or is following you across multiple social media platforms, it could mean that he can't get enough of you! Of course, if he's a social media butterfly, it might not mean anything, but if he's not super active, it's a good sign he's into you. [10] X Research source Don't overanalyze his social media behavior. It's easy to decide that one \"like\" on Instagram means he's your soulmate, but you'll drive yourself crazy if you read that much into it. If he mostly messages you online but doesn't talk to you much in person, he's probably feeling shy and trying to get to know you better, or he may even be working up the courage to ask you out."

That way, he'll have a chance to be the one who texts you first. If you and the guy are good friends, he might just want to talk. Remember, you're looking for clues that all add up to a big picture."
