These actions are against the law and are concrete grounds for termination. Abusive behavior. Does your boss drag you into their office (or out in the middle of the office) to scream and berate you when you make an error? There is no room for abusive behavior in the workplace. Everyone should be respected. Unfair management practices. Does your boss play favorites and leave out opportunities for other staff members? Are you and your co-workers given the shaft for certain promotional advances when you are more qualified than the boss’s pet ? Intellectual theft, or stealing another employee’s ideas and passing them off as their own. Stealing material items isn't the only grounds for theft."
