      "content": "Enjoy smaller meals to reduce the chances of reflux. Rather than having 3 large meals throughout the day, try to have 5–6 smaller dishes instead. Eating smaller meals gives your body time to digest and prevents your stomach from over-distending. After you eat, avoid lying down or putting pressure on your stomach for 2–3 hours to prevent any acid from entering your throat.

      "title": "Rest your vocal cords by keeping quiet.",
      "content": "Rest your vocal cords by keeping quiet. Your vocal cords let you speak, sing, and yell. The more you use them, the less they are resting and healing. Try to avoid talking or singing for long periods of time and let your voice rest as much as possible. As you first start to heal your vocal cords, try to only speak once or twice a day for about 3 days. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Speak at a normal volume instead of whispering.",
      "content": "Speak at a normal volume instead of whispering. Although it seems backward, whispering is actually worse for your vocal cords than speaking at a normal volume.

      "content": "Swallow or exhale forcefully instead of clearing your throat.

      "title": "Avoid taking decongestants.",
      "content": "Avoid taking decongestants. If you have a cold or sinus congestion, you may have been prescribed a decongestant. Vocal cords need a lubricant when they rub together so that they don’t get damaged as you speak. Decongestants remove most of the moisture from your nose and throat and can irritate your vocal cords. Try to avoid taking decongestants until your vocal cords are healed. [7] X Research source Antidepressants, medications prescribed for Parkinson’s disease, and medications prescribed for some neurological diseases can also be drying. Research the side effects of any medication you are on and talk to your doctor about your options."

      "content": "Keep a humidifier in your home. The air you breathe goes past your vocal cords in every breath that you take. If you live in a dry climate, the air you are breathing may be drying out your vocal cords and irritating them. Use a humidifier in your home to put moisture into the air you breathe and keep your vocal cords lubricated.
