      "content": "Practice a basic jump. Master the form of the basic jump before you try any variations or tricks. Hold the rope with your hands at hip height and keep your elbows slightly bent. Make sure your upper arms are close to your sides. Roll your shoulders back and down and keep your chest out. Jump one to two inches off the floor, giving the rope just enough space to slip under your feet. Land on the balls of your feet. Keep your elbows close to your sides as you turn the rope. The movement should come from your wrists and forearms, not from your shoulders. Make turns that are no bigger than two inches, as any bigger will cause you to jump too high. [5] X Research source Make your jumps small and consistent. Do 10-15 jumps to warm up and get the feel for the basic jump. If you get tired before you finish 15 jumps, drop the rope but keep your arms and legs going. You can work up to using the rope full-time."
