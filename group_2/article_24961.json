      "content": "Mix warm water and dish soap in a small bowl. Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water into the bowl, then add about 2 to 3 drops of soap. You can use whatever dish soap you have on hand, but it’s best to use a mild soap. Stir it in until the water is soapy. [1] X Research source Mild dish soaps aren’t designed to cut through heavy grease and don’t have strong artificial scents. There is a chance that harsh cleaners could damage your case. Dish soap is great for removing mild stains and removing debris that could cause new stains to form."

      "content": "Scrub the case with a clean toothbrush dipped in the soapy water. Remove your phone from the case first and set it somewhere far from the water. Brush the entire case, especially in spots where you notice stains. Try scrubbing around stained spots in a circle. Make sure you also get the brush into the case’s smaller spots, such as around the camera and charge port openings. [2] X Research source You can use a cloth or sponge to wipe the case clean, but you won’t be able to get into the nooks and crannies without a brush."

      "content": "Rinse the case off in clean water. Hold it off under running water in your sink. Make sure you eliminate all of the soap, including in the hard-to-reach spots. If there is any debris left on the case, scrub it again with a toothbrush, applying more soapy water as needed. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry the case off with a clean towel. Shake off the excess moisture, then wipe the entire case from front to back. Try to remove as much of the remaining moisture as possible. It will finish air drying faster if you’re able to wipe it fairly dry first. [4] X Research source Remove as much of the moisture as possible so your case can finish air drying faster."

      "title": "Place the case on a countertop for 1 hour to air dry.",
      "content": "Place the case on a countertop for 1 hour to air dry. Since the case will probably have some moisture on it, don’t put it on your phone right away. Set it in an open spot with plenty of air circulation. Spread out a clean towel there, then place the phone case on top of it. Let it finish drying out before putting it back on your phone. Make sure the case is completely dry. Water can linger in the smaller spaces, like the hole for the charging port, and end up inside your phone. While the case is drying, you can clean your phone screen or disinfect your phone in the meantime."

      "title": "Wash your phone case weekly to prevent stains from forming.",
      "content": "Wash your phone case weekly to prevent stains from forming. Your phone case comes into contact with lots of debris, so frequent cleaning is a good idea. If you have the time, take out your phone to give the case a thorough scrubbing with soap and water at least once a week. It will prevent the material from yellowing, too. [5] X Research source Your phone case will collect lots of debris from your pocket or purse. It also gets plenty of oil from your hands, causing it to turn yellow over time. Your case will last much longer if you spend time maintaining it."

      "content": "Dampen a clean microfiber cloth lightly in rubbing alcohol. Remove your phone from the case first. Then, pour the rubbing alcohol onto a small cloth. Use only a little bit of the rubbing alcohol. Shake and wring out the excess moisture before cleaning your case. [6] X Research source Rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, is good against medium stains you can’t remove just by washing with soap and water. Even if it fails to remove a stain, it eliminates bacteria. Rubbing alcohol can potentially discolor some clear cases, so double-check with the manufacturer before using it. Test it out in an inconspicuous spot first. Use it only when necessary and don’t soak your case in it."

Wipe the case in a circle, putting extra effort into any tougher stains you see. Make sure you also get the hard to reach spots, like the case’s corners and openings. Another option is to use a spray bottle to apply rubbing alcohol directly to the case. Be careful to avoid soaking the case, since you only need to apply a little bit of the rubbing alcohol to clean it. If you have rubbing alcohol-soaked cleaning wipes, you can use those as well."

Open nearby windows or turn on fans if you have to in order to get a good draft blowing through the room. Once the case finishes drying, you can safely put it back on your phone. [8] X Research source Rubbing alcohol dries much faster than water does, but you should leave the case to dry for a while in order to protect your phone from moisture damage. If your phone audio sounds muffled without the case, you can try cleaning your phone speaker ."

Then, cover the surface with baking soda. Make sure the stains are completely covered in baking soda. [9] X Research source You can’t really use too much baking soda, so keep adding more until the case and its stains are well-covered. Baking soda is effective on tough stains that you’re unable to remove any other way."

[12] X Research source Make sure the spot you choose has plenty of air circulation. You can open windows or turn on nearby fans to get air flowing through the room.

      "content": "Buy a new phone case. If your clear case has turned yellow and the previous methods haven't helped, you'll need to buy a new phone case. Clear phone cases have a natural yellow tint that may not be noticeable at first. As the case is exposed to elements such as UV rays, heat, and light, the yellow will darken. The material and quality of the case and exposure will determine the speed of degradation. Consider a case of a different material, such as an Otterbox case . If you want to purchase another clear case, you can also decorate it ."
