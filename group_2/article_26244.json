      "content": "No—Instagram will eventually ask you to add a phone number. You can still create an account without a phone number, but Instagram will ask you to provide one in the future. This is dependent on a few factors, such as: you previously added your number, but didn't confirm it, some time has passed since you last updated your contact information, Instagram received information from your device, and you have yet to add one, but Instagram wants to show you how. [1] X Research source Phone numbers can be used to verify your identity and protect your account with two-factor authentication . With the rise of spam accounts, Instagram has introduced this requirement to reduce the amount of spam on the platform. VoIP services, such as Google Voice , can provide you with a different phone number to use, but you must have an existing number to claim one. It's best to avoid third-party services that claim to verify your Instagram account with a temporary number. Instagram uses this number to protect your account; it's very likely you'll get locked out of your account once the service expires."
