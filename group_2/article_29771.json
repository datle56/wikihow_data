This braid will not work if you have snags in your hair as you move through the steps. IF you have curly or wavy hair, blow-dry it straight before you start.

      "title": "Gather your hair.",
      "content": "Gather your hair. You need to decide how thick you want your French rope braid to be. If your beginning section is larger, then each section of the French braid portion of your braid will be thicker. Gather a small section of hair at the crown of your head. You can do this as a side braid as well. Just pick a section of hair on the side of you head that you want to braid. The braid follows the same path as the middle braid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start your braid.",
      "content": "Start your braid. Like with the traditional rope braid, you will only need 2 sections of hair for this braid. Divide the section in your hand in 2 down the middle. Twist the 2 strands counterclockwise around your fingers. Make sure you keep the twists tight as you twirl them. Cross the twisted strands clockwise over each other, holding the strands lightly so they don't unravel. For a French rope, you'll twist the hair as you go, so don't worry if you only have the base of the strand twisted for now. That is the part that is incorporated into the braid, so as long as that portion is twisted, your braid will look great. If you want a less twisty French braided portion, you can leave the strands untwisted and just cross them over each other."

    {
      "title": "Twist and cross more of your hair.",
      "content": "Twist and cross more of your hair. Once you have crossed the two initial strands, grab the section of hair directly beside the right section. It should incorporate some of hair from the side of your head where your twisted strand sits. Incorporate the new hair into the strand, twisting it counterclockwise into the other hair. Repeat on the left side. Add and twist the hair counterclockwise with the other section of hair. Both strands should have an equal amount of new hair incorporated into the strand so the braid will stay even. If you want a smaller, tighter French braid, make sure you grab smaller sections as you move down your hair. This will take a little longer but will give you a closer weave to the braid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue the braid.",
      "content": "Continue the braid. Cross the now thicker sections of hair clockwise over each other, just as you did with your first 2 pieces of hair. Incorporate more hair into the strands, twisting as you did with the previous section and then crossing them. Repeat until you have run out of hair at the sides of your head. Make sure to add hair to both sections before you cross them over each other. If you are twisting rather than folding the sections, make sure to twist counterclockwise and cross the sections clockwise. If you want a half French rope braid, you can choose at what length that you want the braid stop. Once you've decided a length, tie the two strands together with an elastic band."

      "title": "Finish the braid.",
      "content": "Finish the braid. Once you get to the nape of your neck, you need to start a traditional rope braid. Keep the sections of your hair twisted in the counterclockwise direction, crossing them clockwise as you finish the lower area of your braid. If they are not as tight of twists as you would like, twist them a little more before you finish the braid. Close off the end with an elastic band. You can make this into a bun at the bottom as well. Once you have braided the ends, twist the braid into a bun. Secure it with bobby pins."

      "content": "Comb your hair. To do this braid neatly, you need to have well-combed hair. You don't want your hair to get caught in a tangled mess as you are making your braid. You can also dampen your hair, which will help it twist into cleaner sections. You can also spray your hair with a leave-in conditioner or smoother. This can help with fly away strands of hair and keep the braid looking tighter. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Put your hair in a ponytail. If you want to make a tight, structured braid, start with your hair in a ponytail. Grab your hair, pulling it up to the height you want your ponytail. Secure it with an elastic band. You can do a side ponytail instead of a traditional center ponytail. It just depends on what style you are going for. To make a side ponytail, just brush your hair to the side and secure it with an elastic band.

Make sure to keep your fingers tight on the twists. If you let them go, they will unravel and you will have to start over. [6] X Research source If your hair is too long to twist all at once, you can pinch the top of the section, twist the hair, and then move down an inch to twist the next section of hair. Continue this for the entirety of each section."

You should be crossing them in the opposite direction from the way you twisted your hair. If you twist and cross in the same direction, your braid will turn into 1 big twist instead of a 2-strand twist. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source"

If you want your hair to look fuller, you can gently fluff out the ropes in your braid to give it width. You can also add a barrette over the elastic or use a decorative band instead to add a little flourish to your braid. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source You can dress this braid up or dress it down. It is very versatile. Add a beanie if it's cold outside, or add a ribbon or flower to the base of your ponytail to make it softer and more feminine. [11] X Research source"
