In order to lose weight, you’ll need to be in a calorie deficit, which means you burn more calories than you consume. You’ll most likely need to cut out extra calories from your diet. Safe weight loss (losing 1-2 pounds per week) requires you to cut out or burn off about 500-1000 calories daily. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It is not recommended to cut out more than 500-1000 calories from your diet daily because you run the risk of being unable to meet your nutrient goals. Although weight loss and healthy eating go beyond calories, it's important to know whether or not you're eating enough calories for your body and lifestyle. Combine counting calories with exercise to maximize how large your calorie deficit is daily."

In general, aim for 1-2 servings of fruit and at least 3-4 servings of vegetables per day. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. Choosing a different colored fruit or vegetable is an easy way to eat different vitamins and antioxidants. A serving of fruit usually consists of 1 small fruit or 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, while a serving of vegetables usually consists of 1-2 cups of leafy vegetables.

In fact, eating more vegetables can help you feel full, which makes it easier to stick to your diet. If you’re not a big fan of vegetables, registered dietitian Kelly Gomez says, “[Experiment] with recipes where you can hide ingredients. There was a big TikTok video that went around about [blending zucchini] in a pasta sauce so you can still get the micronutrients… Even if you’re trying to mask the taste, that’s totally fine.”"
