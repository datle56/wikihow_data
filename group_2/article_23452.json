      "content": "When you feel hungry, you might actually be dehydrated . If you start feeling like you want a snack, drink a full glass of water first. Some studies suggest that drinking water before a meal can make you feel fuller faster, too. [2] X Research source While drinking water is a good way to curb hunger, drinking sugary drinks isn’t.

By drinking a glass of water, you're allowing yourself time to notice if you're genuinely hungry or if you're feeling hungry because of your emotions. If plain water isn't your favorite, try drinking sparkling or carbonated water instead."
