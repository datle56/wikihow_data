      "title": "Maybe, but reviving a dead vape probably isn’t worth the effort.",
      "content": "Maybe, but reviving a dead vape probably isn’t worth the effort. As you can probably guess from their name, disposable vapes aren’t meant to be reused. Trying to make a dead vape work can lead to burns, injuries, and exposure to harmful chemicals. It’s probably safer and cheaper to cut your losses and buy a new one. That said, if you're determined to try and fix your vape, we'll explain your options. However, it's a tricky and dangerous process to try and replace the battery or refill the cartridge. Many solutions to reviving a dead vape involve taking the vape apart and working with its internal components, so only proceed if you have experience working with electronics."

      "title": "Unblock the airflow sensor.",
      "content": "Unblock the airflow sensor. Disposable vapes use airflow sensors to detect when you take a puff. If the sensor is blocked by condensation, it may not trigger when you inhale, causing the vape not to hit. Try covering one of the intake vents with your finger to increase the pressure of the airflow. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Unclog the cartridge.",
      "content": "Unclog the cartridge. Vape cartridges can get clogged by condensation or dirt, which often results in the vape not working. If the battery isn’t dead and you’re not out of e-liquid, try cleaning the cartridge using a toothpick or a thin needle. Be careful not to damage any internal components. [2] X Research source Avoid storing your vape in a dusty or dirty area and keep it at room temperature to avoid further issues."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unblock the battery connection.",
      "content": "Unblock the battery connection. The connection between the battery and the coil can sometimes be blocked by debris or residue. Remove the battery and clean the terminal with a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol. Then, make sure the battery doesn’t have any cracks or leaks and reinsert it, ensuring it’s properly aligned with the coil and firmly set in place. [3] X Research source Always be careful when cleaning the inside of a vape, as it’s easy to damage internal pieces. Wear protective gear like gloves and safety glasses to help prevent injuries."

      "title": "Clean the battery contacts.",
      "content": "Clean the battery contacts. If the battery connection is working correctly, there may be a problem with the contacts. If your vape allows you to do so, remove the battery and cartridge from the disposable vape. Use a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol to clean the contacts on the battery and cartridge. Make sure the contacts are completely dry before reassembling the vape. [4] X Research source Because disposable vapes aren’t meant to be reused, many models may not allow you to remove the cartridge and battery. The best way to determine if this is possible is to consult your user manual and then remove the mouthpiece to access the inside compartment."

    {
      "title": "Toss the vape if it short-circuited.",
      "content": "Toss the vape if it short-circuited. Because vapes are electronic, it’s possible yours suffered an electrical failure. The vape may have short-circuited due to moisture or another internal component may have failed. This is more common in lower-quality or cheaper vapes. [5] X Research source There's no way to fix this, so you'll have to get a new disposable vape."

      "title": "Determine if the battery is rechargeable.",
      "content": "Determine if the battery is rechargeable. Not all disposable vapes come with a rechargeable battery. The most obvious way to determine if your vape is rechargeable is to look for a USB port. Most rechargeable vapes use a lithium-ion battery and have a charging cable. Check the manufacturer’s website or your user manual for information on your battery type and how to charge it. Do not recharge a single-use battery. If your vape doesn’t have a USB port, it likely isn’t rechargeable, and recharging the battery could be dangerous. In disposable batteries, electricity moves in one direction. Trying to charge them could cause an electrical fire and injuries."

    {
      "title": "Charge the battery in 7-10 minute intervals.",
      "content": "Charge the battery in 7-10 minute intervals. If your disposable vape has a charging port, you can recharge the battery . Make sure you use the correct charger that is compatible with your device. Many disposable vapes use a USB-C or micro-USB port. Let it sit for a few minutes while it charges. [6] X Research source Most rechargeable vapes have an indicator light that will pulse or change color when they’re charging. Do not leave the battery unattended. If you see smoke or the wires start getting too hot, unplug the charger immediately."

      "title": "Replace the battery only if you’re experienced with electronics.",
      "content": "Replace the battery only if you’re experienced with electronics. When you replace the battery in a disposable vape, you’re exposing yourself to wires and other electrical elements. This process is tedious and involves processes like soldering and shrink tubing. Attempting to replace the battery could result in serious injury."

Once again, you’ll hold the battery in one hand and the cartridge in the other. Then, align the threads on the cartridge to the ones on the battery and twist the cartridge clockwise until it’s snug. [13] X Research source Make sure not to overtighten the cartridge as this could damage the battery. Dispose of the old cartridge properly. Since empty vape cartridges still contain traces of nicotine, they can be harmful to wildlife, pets, and the environment. Rinse the empty cartridge under running water to help remove nicotine particles. Then, reach out to your local hazardous waste authorities to determine the best way to dispose of the cartridge.
