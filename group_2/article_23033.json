      "content": "If meat is the main dish, aim to have at least 1 ⁄ 2 lb (8.0 oz) of meat per person. Estimating how much meat to serve for dinner or an event doesn’t have to be rocket science! Just stick to the general rule that you typically want to serve at least 1 ⁄ 2 lb (8.0 oz) of meat per person if the meat is the main focus of the dish. [1] X Research source If meat is simply a component of the dish, stick with around 1 ⁄ 4 lb (4.0 oz) or 1 ⁄ 3 lb (5.3 oz) per person. For example, a steak dinner or Thanksgiving feast would include 1 ⁄ 2 lb (8.0 oz) of steak or turkey per person because the meat is the focus of the meal. If you’re having spaghetti and meatballs, aim to have 1 ⁄ 4 lb (4.0 oz) of meatballs per person. For buffet-style meals, aim to have more meat than you would with a plated dinner to accommodate for larger appetites. Now, this doesn’t include leftovers, so make a little extra if you enjoy having extra meals handy."

      "content": "For BBQ Aim to have at least 1 ⁄ 2 to 3 ⁄ 4 lb (8.0 to 12.0 oz) of meat per person for large barbecue style events. Whether you’re serving ribs, pulled pork, chicken, hot dogs, or burgers, make sure you have enough variety for everyone. [4] X Research source It’s always better to have more food than not enough, so order or make more rather than less. Bulk up your BBQ food options with delicious sides, like mac and cheese, corn on the cob, and coleslaw. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that fattier meats shrink when cooked. For instance, beef brisket loses half its weight once cooked, so 1 ⁄ 2 lb (8.0 oz) of meat quickly turns to 1 ⁄ 4 lb (4.0 oz). Accommodate for this by buying 25% more meat than you think you’ll need.

      "content": "For tacos A typical taco uses about 1 ⁄ 8 pound (2.0 oz) of meat. So, to determine how much meat you’ll need per person, figure out how many tacos everyone will eat. Adults usually eat 2 to 3 tacos each with kids eating between 1 and 2. Multiply the number of tacos by the number of guests, then multiply that number by 2 ounces. [7] X Research source For example, say you’re serving 5 adults who’ll likely eat 3 tacos each. 5 x 3 is 15, and 15 x 2 is 30. This means you’ll need roughly 30 oz (1.9 lb) of meat for the entire meal. Remember, meat can shrink once it’s cooked, especially when cooked at higher temperatures.

      "content": "For sandwiches If you’re serving up some classic cold cuts or lunch meats, the general rule is to serve 6 oz (0.38 lb) of meat per person. This is enough to make 1 sandwich per person. [10] X Research source If you’re serving a large crowd, multiply the number of people by 6 to find out how many ounces of lunch meat you’ll need in total. For instance, say you’re hosting a luncheon with 25 guests. 25 x 6 is 150, so you’ll need 150 oz (9.4 lb) of lunch meat in total. Consider dividing the 6 oz (0.38 lb) portion size between 2 or 3 types of deli meats. This way, people can get a variety of meats on their sandwiches, like turkey, chicken, and ham."

[11] X Research source Whether you’re making dinner for the family or hosting a backyard BBQ, this is important! Do a headcount or rough estimate of how many people you think will be there. Then, multiply that number by the ounces or pounds of meat you’ll eat. For example, say you’re hosting a dinner party with 10 guests. If pork chops are the main dish, you’ll multiply 8 ounces by 10, giving you 80 ounces. This means you’ll need 5 pounds or 80 ounces of meat in total to serve everyone."

      "content": "Who will be attending. Is your event serving primarily adults, children, or elderly folk? Knowing who you’ll be feeding can help you determine portion sizes, as age can play a big part in appetite and overall likes and dislikes. Say you’re hosting an event for a teenage boy’s birthday party. You’ll likely want to serve more meat than you would when entertaining elders, as teenagers tend to have a bigger appetite. As another example, if your guests are mostly kids, you might want to stick with more crowd-pleasing and simple meats, like drumsticks, hot dogs, and burgers."

Because of this, it’s important to factor in that you’ll need more meat if you serve bone-in cuts rather than something boneless. For example, you usually need 1 ⁄ 2 lb (8.0 oz) of bone-in ham per person but only 1 ⁄ 3 lb (5.3 oz) if it’s boneless. [12] X Research source"
