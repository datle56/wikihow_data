Play through the game normally up to this point. For reference, Brawly is the Fighting-type gym leader located in Dewford City. [1] X Research source He is the second gym leader you encounter."

You will be instructed you to take the goods to Slateport City. A convenient way to get to Slateport is to take a ride on Mr. Briney's boat (located in Dewford City, the same town as Brawly's gym). Before Mr. Briney can give you a ride, you need to rescue his pet Wingull, Peeko. Peeko is held captive by a Team Magma grunt in Rusturf Tunnel. Defeat the grunt to rescue her. [2] X Research source"
