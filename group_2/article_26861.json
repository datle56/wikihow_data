      "title": "Eat healthy fats.",
      "content": "Eat healthy fats. Breasts are made of fatty, adipose tissue, so they will not appear until you have gained body fat. Monounsaturated fats are the best choices for increasing breast size. Healthy fats include olive oil , nuts, cheese, avocados, yogurt , and granola . [1] X Research source Women who have less than 17 percent body fat may stop ovulating and menstruation. If you have already gone through puberty, but you are not having regular periods, then raising your body fat in a healthy way will help you to grow breasts and return to normal menstruation and ovulation. Avoid other fats that are unhealthy, like trans fats and saturated fats from fast food and processed food sources. These fats usually end up collecting on areas of the body that women want to avoid being fuller, such as thighs, hips, and the stomach. They can also cause other health problems, including high cholesterol . [2] X Research source Refrain from consuming processed foods, sugars, and sodas which may help you put on weight but will certainly lead to other unhealthy conditions."

      "content": "Stop wearing a bra . A 15-year French study recently reported results that bras cause women's breasts to sag over time. Researchers found that going braless increased the elasticity of the breasts making them perkier. This study goes against previous reports that bras support women's breasts and fight sagging. However, keep in mind that this study only applies to women ages 18 to 35 who have never worn a bra before. The study found that women who never wore bras had nipples on average seven millimeters higher (relative to their shoulders) than women who wore bras regularly."

The hormones in birth control pills can regulate your period, make periods less painful, and reduce the symptoms of PMS. If you are a teenager who has not yet used birth control pills, then talk to your parents and doctor about monitoring your hormone levels. [13] X Research source Note, however, that weight gain should not be the only reason you opt to start taking the birth control pill. It is a form of medication and will have other side-effects on your body, so think carefully about taking it."

Look at your mother and grandmothers' breast sizes. If most women in your family have larger breasts, they are likely to get bigger as you go through puberty. [15] X Research source Examine your breasts in the mirror. Notice whether the areolas, the area around the nipples, \"stick out\" a little, meaning they look like little mounds on top of your breasts. If they do, then your breasts are still in their growth phase. Keep in mind that you may not reach your full breast size until you are in your late teens or even in your early 20s.
