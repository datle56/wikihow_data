      "title": "“Is it possible” is a way to ask if something can be done.",
      "content": "“Is it possible” is a way to ask if something can be done. “Is it possible” is a common, grammatically correct phrase and polite way to find out if something can be done or if it is achievable. It often leads to a discussion about different options that can get the thing done. For instance, you might ask a friend if it’s possible to move your dinner reservation to a different day because you have to stay late at work. [1] X Research source “Is it possible to get dinner on Friday instead of Wednesday?” “Is it possible for you to pick me up on your way to Mia’s house?” Variation : “Is that possible” is a way to ask if something specific can be done that you were previously talking about. You often say this to confirm if the specific thing is possible to do. “What about changing the decorations from pink to purple? Is that possible?”"

      "title": "Use “Is it possible” in professional or casual conversations and emails.",
      "content": "Use “Is it possible” in professional or casual conversations and emails. “Is it possible” is a polite and respectful way to ask a question, so it’s appropriate to use it in professional or casual conversations. For instance, write it in emails to coworkers to ask if they can meet with you or to suggest changes to a presentation. Or, say or text it to your friends to check about the possibility of something. “Is it possible to change the layout of the presentation? I think it would be better to start with a short introduction.” “Is it possible to finish the project by Friday? Ezra wants to know if we can push up our deadline.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Would it be possible” is a more polite version of “Is it possible.”",
      "content": "“Would it be possible” is a more polite version of “Is it possible.” “Would it be possible” essentially means the same thing as “Is it possible”—it’s another way for you to find out if there’s a chance of something happening or getting done. However, the addition of “Would” makes your question sound less direct or demanding and more polite and respectful. [2] X Research source “Would” is a modal verb that implies the “something” you’re asking about is hypothetical, or might happen but it isn’t a reality. This makes your question sound less direct and thus more polite. [3] X Research source “Is it possible” is usually reserved for asking about things that aren’t hypothetical—in other words, the thing you’re asking about exists. Example : “Would it be possible to get a salad with my meal instead of bread?” vs “Is it possible to get a salad with my meal instead of bread?” It’s common to add “would” in front of requests or commands to make them sound more respectful and pleasant. For instance, “Would you get me a glass of water” is more polite than “Get me a glass of water.”"

    {
      "title": "Use “Would it be possible” to sound more formal and polite.",
      "content": "Use “Would it be possible” to sound more formal and polite. Because “Would it be possible” is a very polite way to ask a question, it’s appropriate to use it in formal situations with authority figures or people you don’t know well. For instance, you might say this to your boss to ask if you can leave work early. You can also say “Would it be possible” to your friends to make your request sound kinder and gentler. [4] X Research source “Would it be possible to leave early on Friday? I’ll ensure all my work gets done before then.” “Would it be possible for you to lower the volume of your music? It’s a bit loud.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“If possible, could you…?”",
      "content": "“If possible, could you…?” Adding “if possible” to your question is a very polite way to make a request since you acknowledge that there’s a chance the person might not be able to fulfill it. An even more polite and formal way to make a request is to say, “If at all possible.” [5] X Research source “If possible, could you stop by the store after work? We’re out of milk.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Is there a chance…?”",
      "content": "“Is there a chance…?” “Is there a chance” is another considerate way to ask if something can be done. With this phrase, you’re asking someone if there’s a high or low likelihood of them being able to fulfill your request. “Is there a chance you could get those project reports to me by Monday? There are a few things I want to review before the meeting.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Is it feasible…?”",
      "content": "“Is it feasible…?” If you want to know if something can be done easily or conveniently, use this phrase. “Is it feasible” means almost the same thing as “Is it possible,” except you’re usually asking about how difficult or practical it would be for the person to fulfill your request. So, it’s a polite way to ensure the person won’t be inconvenienced. “Is it feasible for you to take on more responsibilities at work? I know you’re already involved in a lot of projects.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Is it achievable…?”",
      "content": "“Is it achievable…?” Use this phrase when you want to know if something can be done or completed successfully. You might be more likely to see this phrase used in professional or business communications, as it is often a way to ask if a goal or project is doable. “Is it achievable to reach our production goals earlier this year? I want our team to do better than last year.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Is it likely…?”",
      "content": "“Is it likely…?” “Is it likely” is another respectful way to ask someone if it’s possible to do something. You usually ask this when you want to understand how probable it is for your request to be fulfilled. “Is it likely that you’ll be able to come to my party? I want to make sure I have enough food for everyone.”"
