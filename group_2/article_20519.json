I love hanging out with you, but I can totally get you a ride home if you need it.” You can add to your date’s confidence by throwing them a thoughtful compliment. “You have such a nice voice. I love listening to you speak.” A second date will be way more likely to happen if your date felt great the first go-round—and you can make sure that happens!"

If you’re sitting on your phone, playing games, calling someone, texting, or even checking emails, your date may feel like slighted. Similarly, if you were hurt by an ex, it may be super tempting to bring up your breakup. But this usually isn't a great idea, because it can make you seem like you're not over your last partner. [14] X Research source If you need to use your phone, head for a bathroom break first. This way, you can respond to an email without making your date feeling ignored. If the conversation is headed in the direction of relationships/breakups reframe your comments so they aren't directly about your ex. Don't say, “My ex, Rachel, made me feel totally alone when we broke up.” Instead try, “When you break up with someone, the hardest part is feeling lonely.”"
