      "content": "Distract yourself. If you haven't started crying yet, but think you might, try distracting yourself from your sad thoughts. Play a game on your phone, or try to joke around with a friend, or try engaging deeply in your math book, or listening carefully and fully to what your teacher is saying. [1] X Research source Doodling or drawing in your notebook can also help distract you from your sad feelings. [2] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 28 October 2020."

      "title": "Create distance.",
      "content": "Create distance. If you are feeling overwhelmed by your feelings and you are about to cry, try creating some distance between yourself and your thoughts. To gain distance, try imagining yourself as an outsider viewing the situation that is making you sad. You can also try referring to yourself in the third person when you think about your situation.

      "title": "Be mindful.",
      "content": "Be mindful. If you are sad about something that is not relevant to the present moment (e.g., something that happened in the past or will happen in the future), try focusing on only the present. To be mindful, pay full attention to your bodily sensations, all the information coming in through your senses, and your thoughts about those perceptions and sensations."

      "title": "Smile.",
      "content": "Smile. You may be able to improve your mood by smiling, even if you don't feel like it. This is called the facial feedback hypothesis and it suggests that the relationship between emotions and the face is a two way street: though we typically smile when we feel happy, some evidence suggests that smiling may cause us to feel happier or otherwise help us to be less sad.

This will raise your cheeks and facilitate your smile."

    {
      "title": "Change your thoughts.",
      "content": "Change your thoughts. Try to change your mood by thinking about something really funny or something that makes you really happy. You can also try thinking about what is making you sad in a different way. [7] X Research source For example, you could try thinking about something hilarious you saw on the internet or something nice that your significant other did for you. To think differently about what is making you sad, consider this example. Say you are sad because you received a bad grade on an exam, and that you are upset because you think it means you are not smart. Try instead thinking about your bad grade as a challenge that you can surmount on the next exam by studying harder."

      "content": "Say you have bad allergies. Some allergies cause tears and puffy faces or eyes. You could say that you have an allergy that sometimes gives you these symptoms. To make it more believable, try following up with something about how it is for you to live with that allergy. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, to keep the conversation light, you could say that it is super annoying to have allergies that make you look like a puffer fish."

Maybe it was some dust or an eyelash a bug or some eraser residue; whatever you decide to say, first look for something plausible in your environment you could have gotten in your eye and blame your tears on that. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that whatever you do, don't lie and say that you got something dangerous in your eye, like a chemical. If you do this your teacher may rush you to the nurse, which is a waste of everyone's time. You will also cause people to needlessly worry and you may have to come clean about lying, which could get you into trouble."

      "content": "Say you were laughing hysterically earlier. Sometimes we laugh so hard we cry. If you are wanting to hide your tears because you do not want someone to know that you were or are sad, and they weren't around you a minute or two beforehand, you could say that you were laughing about something really funny. Tell them a funny joke that you know or a funny situation that you encountered in the past to make it more convincing. Who knows, by recalling this funny situation, you may even cheer yourself up!"

      "content": "Say you are short on sleep. Whether or not it is actually true, some people think that our eyes water when we don't get enough sleep.

Say that you're tired or that your head hurts and you need a quick rest. Let out a few tears while you pretend that you are taking a rest. Only do this if your teacher won't get upset; she may call on you and draw the attention of the whole class on you."

      "title": "Avoid talking.",
      "content": "Avoid talking. Sometimes our voices tremble when we are sad, which will give away your tears. Try avoiding talking while you are sad. If it is not possible to avoid talking, try talking in a lower tone of voice than you normally do and speak extra forcefully. Because you are sad you will probably sound more normal even though you think you are talking extra loud and deep."

      "content": "Get a tissue and 'blow your nose'. If you don't have one but are able to go get one, find a tissue. You can pretend that you have to blow your nose, but before you do, discreetly wipe your eyes of their tears. Try to turn away from others when you pretend to blow your nose; they will probably think you are just being polite being by not blowing your nose in their directions."

If anyone sees any tears remaining and asks about them, you could jokingly say that you sneezed so hard you must have blown a gasket (i.e., you sneezed so hard it caused you to tear up). If you know that you are prone to crying, consider packing some tissues in your bag for when you need them. Or, if you don't have a bag on you, put a few tissues in your pocket."

      "content": "Minimize the chance you will be heard. Once you are in the bathroom, make your way to a stall so that you can be alone. If you are worried about making crying noises, try running the faucet or flushing the toilet when you feel that you need to really let the tears out so people are less likely to hear you. If you are at lunch or recess, by moving away from others you will be less likely to be heard or seen crying."

      "title": "Let it all out.",
      "content": "Let it all out. Once you are alone in the bathroom or you have flushed the toilet so no one can hear you, let yourself cry until you can't cry anymore. After you have let out all your tears and you think you are over your sad spell, give yourself a minute to recover. If you are at lunch or recess, look around and make sure no one is too close by, then let it all out. Holding in your emotions can sometimes have negative consequences for your health, so consider letting out your feelings when you feel comfortable doing so."

      "title": "Wait for your face to clear up.",
      "content": "Wait for your face to clear up. After crying, your face might be red or puffy. Before you head back to the classroom, wait a few minutes for evidence of your crying to disappear. If you can without being seen, try speeding up the process by running cold water over your face. If your face is still red and/or puffy when you head back to class, try placing your hand in front of your face and scratching the top of your forehead as you walk back into class and take your seat. This way you will cover up most of your face and it will just look like you had an itch. When you enter the classroom, you can also do a fake yawn, which will scrunch up your face and help to hide that you were crying. You can try this alone or in combination with scratching your head. To wait around while at lunch or recess, do your best to stay as far away from your classmates as you can."

      "content": "Block others' view of your face. If you are sitting on the left or rightmost side of the classroom, you can continue to hide your puffy face or any additional tears by resting a hand on your face in a way that will help to block others' view of you. If you are sitting on the leftmost side of the classroom, you can rest your right hand on your face, or if on the rightmost side, your left hand. Be careful to not look like you are falling asleep when you do this otherwise your teacher may call on you and put unwanted attention on you."
