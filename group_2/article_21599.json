      "title": "Short Fade",
      "content": "Short Fade A short fade is fairly short on top, then it fades down even shorter. This style is great for oval faces because it keeps volume off the sides, and the top is short enough to show off your symmetrical features. This is a versatile look that can work for casual settings, a professional environment, and everything in between. [1] X Research source Best Hair Textures: There’s no wrong hair texture for a short fade—it works for everything from fine to coarse hair, as well as straight, coily, and everything in between. What to Ask For: When you ask your barber for a fade , let them know where you want your hair to start tapering down. A high fade starts tapering close to your temples, a mid fade will start fading closer to your ears, and a low fade will taper closer to the nape of your neck. How to Style: Because your hair is fairly short on top, you don’t have to do much with this style. If you want to add a little texture on top, work in a small amount of texturizing powder or spritz salt spray on your hair while it’s still damp."

      "content": "Textured Crop/French Crop With a textured crop (also called a French crop ), the sides are faded high, and the top of your hair is left a little longer, then point-cut to give it a messy texture. This modern look is casual and cool, and the unkempt texture adds some contrast to the soft features of an oval face. [2] X Research source Best Hair Textures: Any—it adds texture and fullness to thin hair, or it can help show off curly hair while adding structure that complements an oval face. What to Ask For: Ask for either a French crop or a textured crop that’s faded short on the sides. Let them know about how long you want the top to be—this is a pretty versatile cut, so the top length is up to you. How to Style: Shake in a little texturizing powder to enhance the messy look, then comb the front of your hair straight down or down and to the side."

      "title": "Short Afro",
      "content": "Short Afro If you have coarse or coily hair, wear your hair longer on top and shorter on the sides in an afro fade . The extra volume on the top will elongate your oval face, and the shorter sides will keep your face from looking too wide. Best Hair Textures: Afros work best with hair that’s coarse or coily. What to Ask For: Tell your stylist you want an afro fade—let them know what length you want on top, whether you want a high, mid, or low fade, and how long you want the hair to be on the sides. How to Style: Use a pick to detangle your hair, then work in a moisturizing cream . Then, create the shape you want by brushing your hair with a sponge brush in a circular motion."

The classic style is typically side-parted and worn up and back. It’s an instantly-refined look that shows off the symmetry of an oval face. [3] X Research source Best Hair Textures: The Ivy League haircut will work for any hair texture, but if you have thin hair, you may need volumizing products to get the lift you want. What to Ask For: Ask for an Ivy League, Harvard, or Princeton cut, and bring pictures of the length you want on top. How to Style: Comb your hair up and back while it’s wet. If your hair tends to fall forward, use a little thickening paste or powder for added volume."

      "title": "Undercut",
      "content": "Undercut An undercut is a timeless look that’s longer on the top and shorter on the sides. It’s typically a disconnected cut, meaning there’s a dramatic difference in length rather than a gradual fade. The closer cut on the sides makes an oval face look longer, and the length on top allows you to play around with different styles. [4] X Research source Best Hair Textures: An undercut works really well with thicker hair textures. If you have thinner hair, talk to your stylist about the best way to style the top to make it look fuller. What to Ask For: Ask for an undercut, but be specific about what you want the top to look like. How to Style: You have a lot of options for styling an undercut —you can brush it up and back for lots of volume on top, wear it slicked back for a classic, sleek look, or part it on the side for a neat but casual look."

Originally, pompadours featured long sideburns, but these days, most guys fade down their sideburns for a more modern, subtle look. And because this look keeps your hair off your forehead, this is a flattering look for oval faces. [5] X Research source Best Hair Textures: Pompadours work with thin or thick hair, and they can be worn straight or curly. What to Ask For: Tell your stylist you want a pompadour—but to make sure you get the length you want on top, bring pictures of what you’re hoping to achieve. How to Style: Work a styling product into your hair while it’s still wet—use pomade for a classic look or matte cream for a more natural modern look. Then, then use a round brush and a hairdryer to style your hair up and back, and set the style with strong-hold hairspray . [6] X Research source"

This isn’t a super dramatic look, so it’s versatile, and the shorter sides flatter an oval face. [7] X Research source Best Hair Textures: Wavy hair is probably the easiest to style in a mullet because of the natural texture, but any hair texture can rock a mullet. What to Ask For: You’ll definitely want to bring pictures of the style you’re going for here—think about where you want your sides to start fading, how disconnected you want the shorter top and the longer back, and what length you want the top and back to be. How to Style: Mullets are pretty low-maintenance, but if you want to add a little definition, spritz the top with sea salt spray while it’s damp, or work in a little texturizing powder after it dries."

      "title": "Mohawk or Faux Hawk",
      "content": "Mohawk or Faux Hawk If you’re into a bold, edgy look, try a mohawk or a fauxhawk . With a mohawk, your hair is cut very short on the sides, and only a strip in the middle is left long. With a fauxhawk, your sides are blended down from the longer section on top. Both of these styles are worn up and off the face, so they suit oval faces. [8] X Research source Best Hair Textures: Mohawks are pretty versatile, but it may be easier to get medium-textured hair to stay in place. If your hair is finer, consider a fauxhawk, and if your hair is coarse, a shorter mohawk may work better. What to Ask For: If you’re asking for a mohawk, all you really need to decide is how wide you want the top section to be. For a fauxhawk, you’ll need to let your stylist know how long you want the top, how wide you want the hawk to be, and how short you want the sides. How to Style: Comb your damp hair straight up, then spray both sides with strong-hold hairspray , blow-dry it, and finish by shaping it with your hands. If you need to style your hawk in a more professional way, comb it over to the side or use gel to slick it back."

Layers in hair add movement and dimension. Best Hair Textures: Fine and medium hair work especially well with long layers—if your hair is thicker or very curly, this style can add too much volume to the sides of your face, which can make an oval face shape look rounder. What to Ask For: Tell your stylist you want long layers. If you want a messier look, ask for shaggy layers—this works especially well with wavy hair. How to Style: If you want to add more texture to your hair, spritz in sea salt spray or work in mousse while your hair is damp, then let it air dry."

[13] X Research source Best Hair Textures: Man buns work with any hair texture, as long as it’s long enough to be pulled to the top of your head.

But if you want a man bun fade, ask your stylist to leave your hair as long as possible on top, then choose whether you want a low, mid, or high fade on the sides. How to Style: To style your hair in a man bun , pull your hair up to the crown of your hair, then wrap a hair tie around it and you’re good to go.

      "content": "Oval faces look great with almost any hairstyle. Stylist Frankie Sanderson says that “oval faces are the ideal shape because they’re very balanced. As stylists, we have to figure out how to create that same balance in someone who has a square-shaped, triangle-shaped, or diamond-shaped face.” That said, the most flattering styles tend to show off your face, like shorter cuts or cuts that you wear up or back. [18] X Research source Avoid styles that come down low on your forehead—this will make your face look rounder. To get the exact style you want, licensed cosmetologist Tiffany Carnevale-Russo recommends “bringing pictures to your stylist. They’re more explanatory than trying to verbalize what you’re looking for. Then your stylist can give you their opinions on whether that style is going to work for you.”"

      "content": "An oval face is a little longer than it is wide. Measure across the widest part of your forehead, jawline, and cheekbones. Compare the three measurements—if you have an oval face, your forehead will be a little wider than your jawline but smaller than your cheekbones. Also, pay attention to the roundness of your jaw—with an oval face, the edges of your face will be rounded instead of angular. [19] X Research source When you’re trying to determine your face shape, makeup artist Anjuli Yera, MD recommends to “divide your face into two halves, with the top half being from the cheekbones up. Determine whether the top of your face has a shape like a circle, heart, rectangle, square, diamond, oblong or oval. Then, look at the lower half of your face and determine its shape. Finally, join the two halves together.” Still not sure whether you have an oval face? Check out wikiHow’s Face Shape Quiz to find out."

Styles that have a lot of volume on the sides add extra width to your face, which can make your face look rounder. Similarly, avoid styles with heavy fringe that covers your forehead, since that will emphasize the roundness in your lower face. Styles with softer edges and volume on top tend to be most flattering for oval faces. If you do choose a cut with bangs, wear them swept over to one side or brushed up and back."
