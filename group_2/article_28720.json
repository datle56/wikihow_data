      "content": "Cancers are sensitive people who are often weighed down by emotions. They tend to intensely feel both their own emotions and other people’s emotions. If you’re there for your Cancer man as much as possible, you’ll likely form a really close bond with him because he knows he can turn to you for support and talk about anything with you. When you’re not around, he’ll be sure to miss you and wish you were there. [2] X Research source Check in with him throughout the day, especially if you notice that he seems withdrawn. Make sure he knows that you’re always open to talk or listen if he needs an outlet."

      "content": "Find a balance between comforting your Cancer man and having your own space. Although your Cancer man may be used to turning to you when he needs to be vulnerable, that doesn’t mean you can’t take a break at times, especially if you feel that you should be appreciated more. By taking a step back and letting him know you need some space, you can both make sure you’re not being overwhelmed by his emotional burdens, and make him miss you more because you’re not always there to listen to him.

      "content": "Cultivate an air of mystery . Though you may want to share all of your interests and problems with your Cancer man, you can intrigue him by keeping some things to yourself. Just like Cancers themselves can be a bit unpredictable and contradictory, you’re giving him something to wonder about on his own end. He’ll miss being around you as he tries to figure out just what makes you so special, and how he can make you feel loved. [4] X Research source For example, wait for him to ask specific questions rather than giving him all of the details right away."

      "content": "Cancers want to hold on to old friends who understand them. They tend to be possessive because they want to maintain tried-and-true friendships⁠—after all, you’re the one he usually confides in. By investing time in your other friendships and social commitments, you’re showing your Cancer man what he’s missing out on. He’ll wish he was there with you when he sees all the fun you’re getting up to! [5] X Research source Be active on social media— post photos and updates! Mention your schedule and other hobbies when you’re around him."

      "content": "You don’t always have to be the one who reaches out first. Even though you want to be there for your Cancer man, it will make them realize how much they miss you and want your attention if you hold yourself back at times. By moving away a little from being the initiator, you’re giving your Cancer man a chance to reach out and show their appreciation for you. [6] X Research source If you realize that you’re usually the one texting or calling first, hold off and wait for him to initiate. Similarly, if you’re always the one setting up plans, wait to let him do it instead."

      "content": "Cancers are homebodies who thrive in stable, predictable environments. They like being in the comfort of their own homes and living in a space that is cozy and safe. Use what you know about what your Cancer man likes to help make his home lovely and secure for him. He’ll appreciate your efforts and miss you a little extra when you’re not around to share that space with him. [9] X Research source For example, ask him what kinds of decorations or colors make him feel happiest. Showcasing your cozy home may also make a Cancer man see you as good match for a domestic partner. Cancers really value family and a stable home life, and they may already be thinking about your potential futures together.

      "content": "Cancers like to know what to expect. They’re less spontaneous than other signs and want to know how the day is going to go. Try to figure out what your Cancer man’s routines are⁠—or ask him what they are⁠!—so that you can integrate yourself smoothly into his life. That way, he won’t ever feel caught off guard. Once you’re a part of his daily life routines, he’ll find himself missing you if you’re ever absent. [10] X Research source For example, ask him what his daily schedule is like and how he wants to arrange his day. He’ll feel in control of his life and happy about how considerate you’re being. Rather than planning surprise outings, try to work events into your Cancer man’s daily patterns or schedule events in advance with him."

      "content": "Cancers are nostalgic about the past. They tend to be attached to tradition and older forms of creativity, like stories or paintings. If you find your Cancer man being sentimental and getting caught up in the past, try and share the moment with him. He’ll be extra aware of your absence when you’re not there to experience and talk about those reflective moments with him. [11] X Research source Instead of suggesting that he live in the present, hear him out and ask him what he misses, and why. Ask him for art recommendations to look into so that you can understand where he’s coming from."
