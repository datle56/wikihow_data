[3] X Research source A whip stitch works well for moccasins. Complete a whip stitch by tying a knot in the end of the sinew and starting at the bottom of the fabric, poking the needle up through both layers, and back down in an equal line with the upward stitch to create a tight stitch that hugs the outside of the two pieces of leather together. Continue to poke the needle through the two layers at a slight angle, coming up next to the previous stitch. [4] X Research source Work from the top of the toes around to the heel and back to the front toes. For a more polished look, plan for a larger seam allowance and fold the edges of the leather template inward before sewing."

Cut out the rectangle using scissors and proceed to snip the leather with your scissors into strips, leaving about one inch of solid, uncut leather on top. You can make each fringe the same size or alternate random widths. Take the fringed leather piece and trace the solid part of the leather around the rim of the moccasin with the fringe facing outward. Be sure to have the two sides of the leather rectangle meet in the back of the shoe so that the fringe seam matches the heel seam. Thread your Glover's needle with enough artificial sinew to stitch the entire rim of the moccasin. A piece as long as the distance from your fingers to your elbow will be more than enough. [5] X Research source Sew on the fringed piece of leather to the top rim of the moccasin, using whatever creative stitch you desire. You can also use a different type of thread such as colored silk to personalize your moccasins even further. Repeat with the other moccasin."

If you want to be absolutely sure that your beads won't come off, you can add a bit of hot glue to the center of the knot to prevent it from unravelling."
