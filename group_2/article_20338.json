      "content": "See if the girl is open to kissing other girls. Before you try to get the girl to kiss you, you should make sure that your advances will actually be welcomed, so don't be too forward/harsh. If the girl is a lesbian or bisexual, then she's obviously open to kissing girls, but if she's just bi-curious, open to new experiences, and loves to experiment, then you may have a shot at it too but be gentle in your approach and give signs that you are interested. Though you can always ask her what she thinks, there are some other ways to know if she's open to kissing girls: If you want to know whether she's open to kissing girls, you can bring up some lesbians in the popular media, such as K.D. Lang, Ellen, the Indigo Girls, or a number of other women. If she's excited to talk about them and mentions more gay content, then it may be more likely that she's open to kissing girls. Though liking these women doesn't make her a lesbian, it indicates that she's accepting of women who like to kiss women. If you know the girl pretty well, you can also just try casually asking her if she's kissed a girl before. Even if you're both just bi-curious, this conversation shouldn't make her feel too uncomfortable if she knows you well enough. You can also just bring up other girls kissing to gauge her reaction. You can say, \"Did you see Mandi and Anna kissing each other in the halls?\" See what she thinks."

      "content": "See if she'd be open to kissing you . Even if the girl is a proud and open lesbian, that doesn't mean that she'd want to kiss any girl who comes in her path just because she's gay, and that's including you. Read the signs to see if the girl is into you or not. If she flirts with you, leans close to you when she talks, occasionally runs her hands through your hair, and gets very touchy-feely with you, then it's more likely that she wants to kiss you. If she's always complimenting your looks and doesn't do it in a superficial way, then she may be telling you that she likes you. If she's looking at your lips and makes intense eye contact, then she may want to kiss you. Just keep in mind that if you're both straight and just want to experiment, then it's different from you being straight and wanting to kiss your lesbian friend just for fun. If you think it would be \"cool\" to make out with your lesbian friend but don't really have feelings for her, she may be very offended and think that you don't take her sexuality seriously."

      "content": "Find a private place. You want to make sure that you keep this between the two of you for now. Unless you're looking for that drunken make-out in a bar situation with your straight best friend, it's best to keep things private if the girl means something to you. Unless you're both out, she may not be comfortable kissing you in a public, or even a semi-public setting, and the kiss will mean more anyway if you're alone. Here are some private places to try to kiss the girl: Invite her over to watch a movie. Dim the lights and watch her body language as the movie progresses. You could try to kiss her during the movie or afterward. Invite her over for a sleepover. If you're the right age, then having a sleepover can be a good way to get more intimate with the girl and to try to get her to kiss you in a private place. Just make sure you read the signs carefully and try it when it's almost time for bed. If you try to kiss her right away and she's not into it, that would make for an awkward evening. Go for a walk to a private place in the evening. Go for a walk through a park or garden as the sun is setting and find a private spot there. This would also be a more romantic setting."

If she nuzzles into you or returns any kind of affection, look at her. If she is gazing back at you, look at her mouth. If you notice that she's looking at your mouth, she is definitely ready. If her eyes are closed or half closed, reach under her chin and gently tip her face up so that you can look at her. [4] X Research source"

If she responds warmly, by kissing you back, you can kiss her again, and let the kiss deepen as the moment grows. But for a first kiss, try to use some restraint and make it really romantic and wonderful.

When you kiss her, hold her and make it romantic and sweet. If this is your first kiss of many with this girl, you'll both have very fond memories of this moment, so make it count.
