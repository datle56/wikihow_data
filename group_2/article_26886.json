      "content": "Pour 4 cups (950 mL) of warm water into a large jar. If you don't have a big jar, use a bowl or pitcher that's large enough to hold a little over 4 cups (950 mL) of liquid that will give you enough room for the other ingredients. [1] X Research source If you'd like to halve the recipe, pour just 2 cups (470 ml) of warm water into a jar and halve the remaining ingredients. For bubble solution that lasts longer, use distilled water . If you're not concerned about storing the solution, it's fine to use tap water."

      "content": "Stir in 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar. Add the sugar to the container and stir it for a few minutes so the sugar dissolves completely. The sugar dissolves faster in warm water than in cold. [2] X Research source If you're using a sealable jar, screw the lid on tightly and shake it until the sugar dissolves. Sugar sounds like an odd ingredient to add to bubble solution, but it binds the ingredients together so your bubbles and solution last longer. If you don't have any sugar, you can leave it out, but it will be harder to blow bubbles."

      "content": "Stir in 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of liquid dish soap. Go slow and steady with your mixing or your bubble solution will foam up. If you're using a jar, don't put the lid on and shake to combine the soap—use a long-handled spoon to stir it gently. [3] X Research source"

Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water into a bowl or container with a pour spout and add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of liquid dish soap, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of glycerin , and 1 teaspoon (5 g) of granulated sugar. [4] X Research source If you can't find glycerin, use corn syrup instead. Corn syrup acts like glycerin to slow down evaporation, so your bubbles are stronger and last longer. [5] X Research source"

If you want to store the solution, pour it into an airtight solution and put it in a cool, dark place—the fridge is a good spot. Then, plan on using it within 6 months. [8] X Research source Throw out the bubble solution if it looks cloudy or begins to smell bad."

Pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of bubble solution into a container and slowly stir in 5 to 10 drops of food coloring. Repeat this using different solutions for a rainbow of bubble solutions! [9] X Research source Keep in mind that the food coloring will mix with the original color of the dish soap. For example, if you add red food coloring to blue dish soap, you'll get purple! Use clear dish soap if you want to make yellow, orange, or red bubbles."

To make a stronger scented bubble solution, stir in 15 to 20 drops of your favorite essential oils—you can use a single scent or combine fragrances for a custom bubble solution. [10] X Research source For instance, if you're using lemon dish soap, add lavender essential oil to make a lemon-lavender-scented bubble solution. Avoid adding more than 15-20 drops since essential oils are very concentrated!"
