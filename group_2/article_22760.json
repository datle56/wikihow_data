      "title": "Locate the fin spines.",
      "content": "Locate the fin spines. Before you start grabbing haphazardly, it’s important to know exactly what you’re trying to avoid. All species of catfish have small, pointed spines emerging from the front edge of the dorsal fin (the one on the back) and pectoral fins (the ones just behind and on either side of the head). For this reason, you’ll want to keep your hands away from the front of the fins at all times. [1] X Research source These spines contain a small amount of non-lethal hemolytic toxin, which can prevent blood from clotting properly if the sharp tips manage to break the skin. [2] X Research source Contrary to popular belief, it’s impossible for a catfish’s whiskers to “sting” you. They’re soft, flexible organs that are used to aid in finding food, and pose no threat to anglers."

      "title": "Wrap your hand around the backside of the catfish.",
      "content": "Wrap your hand around the backside of the catfish. Position the webbing between your thumb and forefinger on the rear edge of the dorsal fin. When a catfish is removed from the water, its spines extend instinctively. The dorsal fin spine can actually serve as a “backstop” where you can wedge your hand. It’s generally safer to place your hand behind the spines rather than in front of them, as you’re less likely to slip and run your fingers over them accidentally. Take your grip carefully to avoid getting poked, especially if the fish is still alive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your fingers on either side of the pectoral fins.",
      "content": "Place your fingers on either side of the pectoral fins. Angle your hand so that your thumb and four remaining fingers are pointed toward the fish’s mouth. Make sure your fingers are resting just behind the fins to stay clear of the spines on the frontal edge. [3] X Research source If possible, slip your fingers underneath the fish’s belly and press your fingertips together for a more secure grip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab the catfish from underneath instead.",
      "content": "Grab the catfish from underneath instead. If for some reason you’re unable to take hold of your catch from the back, modifying your hand positioning slightly will allow you to grip it safely from the other side. This time, cover the fish’s belly with your palm and bring your thumb around so that it sits at a safe distance from the dorsal spine. Then, anchor your fingers behind the pectoral spines where they can’t jab you. [4] X Research source Pinch the pectoral fin opposite your thumb between your middle and forefinger for added control. The firm bones behind each pectoral fin make a perfect place to grip a medium-sized catfish that can’t easily be managed with one hand. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the catfish.",
      "content": "Lift the catfish. Squeeze the fish’s body gently with your whole hand, applying equal pressure all the way around so it doesn’t slip out on you. Keep your grip fixed, only making minor adjustments if necessary. As long as you maintain a safe hand positioning while holding onto the catfish, you shouldn’t have to worry about getting pricked. The combination of slick skin and caked-on mud from the river bottom can make catfish particularly tough to handle. A fresh catch may twist and wriggle suddenly in an effort to free itself. If you get caught off guard, you could lose it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your other hand for support.",
      "content": "Use your other hand for support. A full-grown catfish can get very heavy, so keeping another point of contact on the tail section will make it a lot easier to lift. A two-handed grip will also allow you to control a fresh catch if it begins thrashing around. Make sure your support hand stays far away from the spines, as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Release the catfish cautiously.",
      "content": "Release the catfish cautiously. Whether it’s destined for an onboard cooler or you’ve decided to return it to the deep, you’ll need to exercise caution when letting go. Lower the catfish so that it’s as close to the water as possible. Loosen your grip in one smooth motion, being careful not to let your hand brush along the fish’s back. [6] X Research source Instead of attempting to toss the catfish away from you, let it slip beneath the surface nice and easy and get moving on its own. Since your fingers will be behind the spines, it will simply swim harmlessly away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch out for smaller catfish.",
      "content": "Watch out for smaller catfish. Despite their appearance, young swimmers and smaller species like Madtom and channel catfish present the most danger to fishing enthusiasts. This is because their hidden spines are smaller in diameter, often having needle-like points. Fortunately, their diminutive size makes them easier to handle, provided you take the proper precautions. [7] X Research source There’s little to fear from larger prized catfish, since their spines tend to be thicker and dulled with age."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear gloves to protect your hands.",
      "content": "Wear gloves to protect your hands. If it’s your first time for catfish, or you’ve had one too many bad experiences in the past, consider investing in a pair of rugged outdoor gloves. The durable material will act as a buffer between the spines and your skin. If you’re in a pinch, you could also cover your hand with a towel before handling your catch. One disadvantage of wearing gloves is that you won’t have the same kind of delicacy and sensitivity when it comes to handling. Thicker pairs may also make the fish harder to hold onto."

      "title": "Seek medical attention for a catfish sting.",
      "content": "Seek medical attention for a catfish sting. Should you or anyone in your expedition happen to be pierced by a spine, get to a hospital right away. A doctor will know the best way to clean and bandage the wound in order to prevent infection. In the meantime, scrub the affected area with warm water and antibacterial soap and keep light pressure on it to slow the bleeding. [8] X Research source Use a pair of tweezers to remove any pieces of the spine that break off inside the wound. [9] X Research source It’s not advisable that you leave a catfish sting untreated, even if it doesn’t seem that severe—this is one scenario where the old outdoorsman’s adage “rub some dirt in it” doesn’t apply!"
