      "content": "Cut the legs off of a pair of jeans. Start by cutting one of the legs off, just below the crotch. Fold the jeans in half, then use the cut leg as a guide for the second one. This will ensure that the bottom of the bag is even. [1] X Research source Denim shorts, skirts, and capris will also work. If you are using a skirt, cut it ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) longer than you want the bag to be. You can use jeans that you already own, or buy a pair from a garage sale or second hand store."

      "content": "Cut open the crotch at the seam, then cut the seam off. Begin by cutting along the crotch seam so that the pants open up like a skirt. Next, cut the crotch seam off of the pants completely—this is the folded, top-stitched part. Doing this will even up the bottom of the pants and help reduce bulk. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn the pants inside out and fold them in half the other way.",
      "content": "Turn the pants inside out and fold them in half the other way. You want the zipper to be on one side edge and the back seam on the other side edge. You will have a front pocket and a back pocket on both sides of the folded jeans. [3] X Research source If you are using a denim skirt, simply turn it inside out."

      "title": "Sew down the new side edges so that they are straight.",
      "content": "Sew down the new side edges so that they are straight. Sew straight down from the zipper to the bottom, cut edge of the pants. You will have a little triangle that used to be the crotch. Repeat this step for the back seam. [4] X Research source Use a pen and ruler to draw guidelines if you have to. If you are using a denim skirt, skip this step."

Sew across each flap, about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from each side edge. This will make the base of the bag wide enough so that it can stand up on its own when you set it down.

If you want a fancier one, however, you should add the embellishments now before you add the straps and lining. Start by turning the bag right side out. Next, add some patches, embroidery, buttons, or studs—whatever you like! You can even stitch on some crocheted lace or a cut up doily onto the bag. Some items, such as studs, will need special tools."

Weave a bandana or a leather belt through the belt loops for a rustic touch. Add a snap, button, or zipper closure to the bag. Decorate the bag further with fabric paint. Add some decorative pins or patches."
