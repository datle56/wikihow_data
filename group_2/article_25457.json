However, some severe breaks may require further medical intervention. [8] X Research source If the pain is so severe that you can't walk on the toe, see your doctor right away. If the toe looks like it's pointing in the wrong direction or is otherwise badly misshapen, see your doctor right away.

Do this in 20-minute increments, pausing for 40 minutes before applying ice again. Do this until you can get to the doctor. The ice will help reduce swelling and stabilize the toe. Keep your foot elevated as much as possible, and don't attempt to walk far on it.

Most toe fractures and breaks do not require a cast; instead, the doctor will show you how to \" buddy tape \" your broken toe to the toe next to it with medical tape and cotton wads.
