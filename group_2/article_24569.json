      "content": "“Jazakallah khair” translates to “May Allah reward you with goodness.” “Jazakallah khair” (جزاك اللهُ خيرً) is an Arabic expression that is mostly used by Muslims. This polite phrase is similar to “shukran” (the Arabic word for “thank you”) and expresses your heartfelt gratitude to someone who helped you out, showed you kindness, gave you a gift, or congratulated you about something. [1] X Research source In Arabic, Jazakallah means “May Allah reward you” and khair means “good” or “goodness.” Can you shorten the phrase? Some people shorten the phrase to just “Jazakallah,” but most people consider this incomplete, as it doesn’t clarify how Allah is rewarding the person—it could be good or bad. So, “Jazakallah khair” is seen as the full, correct phrase. Example sentences : “Jazakallah khair. I really appreciate you helping me move in.” “You’re too kind, you didn’t have to get me a gift! Jazakallah khair.”"
