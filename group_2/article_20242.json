This simply is not true and just happens to be the negative side of western culture. Care about your appearance, but don't let that consume you. Project self-esteem by dressing in a way that makes you feel attractive. Another way to improve your self-esteem is by challenging your negative thoughts like: Discard an all or nothing mentality that could lead you to think: \"if he doesn't notice me in this dress, then I must be ugly.\" Be proud of yourself instead seeing a positive as a negative like: \"I was only chosen to lead the debate because no one else wanted to.\" Change the way you handle negative thoughts. For example: If something got to you during school, come up with thoughts or activities that will reduce your stress.
