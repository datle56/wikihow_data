      "content": "Wait until you are at least 17 years old. This is the minimum age required to join the Australian Army, though you can begin your application when you are 6 months away from turning 17. You must have your application approved in writing by both your parents or legal guardians if you want to apply to join at 17 years old, as you are still considered a minor. [1] X Research source There are no gender restrictions to join the Australian Army. If you are under 17, but older than 12 years and 6 months, you can join the Australian Defence Force Cadets to start developing leadership, team-building, and survival skills as well as get a taste of what it’s like to be in the Army. There is no set maximum age at which you can join the Australian Army, as it varies by role. However, as a rule of thumb you can’t join if you are less than 3 years away from the compulsory retirement age for a specific role."
