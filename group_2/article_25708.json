You may see a warning that your document will be changed to \"plain text\" instead of \"rich text,\" or that special formatting and images won't be saved properly.

As you edit your HTML document in this tutorial, you can keep checking back and seeing how your web page changes. Note that this does not actually create a website online. It will not be accessible by other people, and you do not need an internet connection to test out. This just uses a browser to \"read\" your HTML document as though it were a website."

[3] X Research source The \"start tag\" contains instructions. For example, it might tell the browser to display text as bold . You also need an \"end tag\" to let the browser know where the instructions apply: in this example, all text between the start tag and the end tag will be bold. Write end tags inside angle brackets as well, but start with a slash after the first bracket. Write start tags in between angle brackets: < start tag goes here > Write end tags in between angle brackets, but put a slash after the first bracket: </ end tag goes here > Keep reading to learn how to write functional markup tags. For this step, all you need to remember is the basic format they are written in: < > and </ > If you are using other HTML tutorials as well, you might see them refer to the tags as \"elements\" and the text in between start and end tags as \"element content.\""

To make your website more visible on search engines, use one or more <meta> start tags (no end tags necessary), each with exactly one name attribute and one content attribute, for example: <meta name=\"description\" content=\"write a description here\">; or <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"write a list of keywords, each separated by a comma\"> <link> tags are used to associate other files with the page. This is mainly used to link to CSS stylesheets, which are made using a different type of coding to alter your HTML page by adding color, aligning your text, and many other things. <script> tags are used to link the page to JavaScript files, which can cause the page to change as the user interacts with it."

Try to figure out what each unfamiliar HTML tag does, or look it up online for the answer. While you cannot edit other people's web sites, you can copy the HTML you find into your own document, then play with it to see what different options do.

Better yet, learn CSS to have much more control over your web page's layout and appearance. Once you have CSS down, the next step for web designers is typically JavaScript."
