      "content": "Rectal prolapse occurs when a portion of a dog’s rectum sticks out. If you see a protrusion sticking out of your dog’s anus, it’s probably their rectum mucosa. This is the tissue on the inside of your dog’s rectum, and when it sticks out, it’s called a rectal prolapse. [1] X Research source There are two kinds of prolapse: Partial: Also known as a mucosal prolapse, this is when the tissue either sticks out a little bit or pops out and goes back in. Complete: If a chunk of tissue is protruding, it’s visible, and it remains outside of your dog’s body, it’s a complete prolapse."

      "content": "Vaginal prolapse develops when a female dog’s vaginal tissue inverts. It’s basically identical to rectal prolapse in terms of what physically happens—the only difference is where. With vaginal prolapse, the tissue inside of your dog’s vagina is visible and sticks out past her vulva and labia. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Vaginal prolapse seldom occurs and can be caused by UTIs and constipation. Vaginal prolapse is often accompanied by rectal prolapse."

      "content": "No, see a vet as soon as possible to get treatment. You cannot repair your dog’s prolapse at home without seeing a vet first. A prolapse may not be a “go to the vet right now” emergency, but a prolonged prolapse can lead to increasingly more dangerous and dramatic damage, so see your vet as soon as you possibly can. [3] X Research source In the meantime, put a cone on your dog and keep the area moist until you can see the vet. A complete prolapse is a much more serious condition than a partial prolapse. The big problem with a prolapse is that your dog’s rectum or vagina is exposed to the open air. This creates a pathway for foreign bacteria to directly reach your pup’s internal organs. A prolapse is not a diagnosis, anyway—it’s a symptom of something else, like diarrhea or constipation. Your vet needs to see your dog to find the underlying cause that triggered the prolapse."

If you notice a chunk of red tissue popping out when your dog uses the bathroom, it’s a partial prolapse even if their anus or vagina goes back to normal. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Straining or difficulty using the bathroom",
      "content": "Straining or difficulty using the bathroom A prolapsed anus or vagina is very uncomfortable, and your dog is unlikely to have an easy time using the bathroom. You may notice your dog taking a really long time choosing a spot to defecate or urinate, and they may spend an abnormal amount of time straining to relieve themselves. [6] X Research source If you’ve got a long-haired breed and they’re taking an unusually long time to use the bathroom, pull their hair back when they’re done to make sure they don’t have a prolapse."

When your dog has a prolapsed vagina, they’ll spend a lot of time and energy licking their vagina.

      "content": "Chronic constipation or diarrhea Any sort of irritation on your dog’s intestinal system can trigger a prolapse. If they’ve had diarrhea for an extended period of time, the pain can cause inflammation that leads to prolapse. Constipation may make your dog strain excessively, which will weaken their muscles and cause the prolapse, as well. [8] X Research source When it comes to vaginal prolapse, UTIs are a common risk factor. [9] X Research source If your dog just has general diarrhea or constipation, see a vet and go over your potential options. The treatment here could be as simple as adding fiber to your dog’s diet or changing their food."

If you aren’t giving your dog preventative medications for worms, this is a likely trigger for your dog’s prolapse. [10] X Research source If a dog has intestinal worms, they may vomit, have a pot-belly appearance, or seem more lethargic than normal. Treating worms is easy, but you do have to see a vet to get a diagnosis and medication."

Then, they’ll either give your dog probiotics, antibiotics, or a prescription diet to treat whatever the underlying condition is. [13] X Research source So long as you treat whatever caused the prolapse, pushing the tissue back where it belongs may be all your vet needs to do. If the issue occurs again, your vet may recommend a minor surgical procedure to physically repair the problem."

After pushing the prolapse back into place, your vet will stitch a portion of your dog’s anus shut. Don’t worry, they’ll leave enough room for your dog to defecate, but the string will prevent the rectum from popping out. [14] X Research source The suture should remain in place for at least 2-3 days. Depending on the material your vet chooses, you’ll either return to the vet to have the suture removed, or it will dissolve on its own."
