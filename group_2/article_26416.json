Maybe you have elegant collar bones, strong, sturdy thighs or set of wide, quarterback-caliber shoulders. Whatever it is, don't be afraid to play it up! When you shop for clothes, choose your hairstyle, and pick out colors to wear, think about how you can make your favorite features stand out. The change you make can be small, like buying more v-necks to reveal your pretty neck, or putting your baseball hats away to show off your high, handsome forehead. On the other side of the coin, you can downplay features you don't want to show off. Don't get too carried away with this, though - it'll be obvious you're trying to hide something. Instead, focus on the features you're proud to accentuate."

      "content": "Show off your hair. Hair is one of the first things people notice about each other, so looking your best means finding a style and hair care routine that makes your hair look great. No matter what your hair color, texture and length, there's a style out there that will bring out its beauty. To find that look that works best for you, try the following: Find a haircut that works for your face shape . For example, longer, layered looks look great with oval-shaped faces, while pixie cuts are pretty on rounder faces. Care for your hair in a way that keeps it healthy. Dyeing it too much, using glue-in weaves, chemical straightening and other treatments can damage your hair, making it look dry, dull or limp. Style your hair every day before you go out, even if it just means combing it and adding some pomade or gel. If you're going to a fancy event, take the time to wash, dry and style it well. If you have facial hair, keep it neat and trimmed, whether you have a full beard or long sideburns. If you're losing hair, there are a number of methods you can try to make it thicker. However, don't feel like you have to cover it up with a combover or cap. Getting regular trims and washing your hair regularly will keep you looking nice. Own your hair, no matter what it looks like!"

You may aspire to fit into a size that's a little too small, or perhaps you drape yourself in fabric in order to hide something you don't particularly want to show off. Either approach to wearing clothes results in a distorted look. Put your best foot forward by choosing clothes that are the correct size for you. Believe it or not, you will look a lot better!

      "content": "Don't feel like you have to cover up. Do you love wearing shorts in the summer, but you're embarrassed to expose your thighs? Wear them anyway! Wear sleeveless shirts, take off the bulky sweatshirt, and put on strappy sandals when you feel like it, no matter your body shape. If you're covering yourself up when you wish you could wear something less confining, it will show in your demeanor. Unless you want to do this for personal reasons, there's no reason you can't bare as much skin as you want, no matter your size or shape. That said, don't bare too much skin in venues where it's inappropriate. You wouldn't want to show up in a short cocktail dress when everyone else is wearing formal floor-length gowns, or wear a sleeveless shirt to a nice event where others are wearing collared button-downs."

It doesn't matter what your style is; as long as its an expression of your personality, you'll be able to rock it. If you've always worn a black hoodie and jeans, and you're not sure how to branch out, start by changing up one piece at a time. Wear a neatly ironed collared top instead of a sweatshirt one day. Does it make you feel good? Do you feel like yourself in it? If not, try a different style next time. Keep changing it up until you start getting a feel for what you like. Swapping clothes with a stylish friend can be a helpful way to experiment without shelling out too much money.
