      "title": "Use a water based lubricant during sex.",
      "content": "Use a water based lubricant during sex. The friction produced during sex may trigger an outbreak. To reduce friction during sex, use a water based lubricant. Always wear condoms as well if you suffer from genital herpes or you may pass the condition on to your partner. Do not use a lubricant that is oil based or that has the spermicide nonoxynol-9 listed in its ingredients. Oil based lubricants can weaken condoms and nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes. [7] X Research source Avoid sex when you are having an outbreak. You are more likely to transmit herpes when you are having an outbreak so it is best to avoid intercourse altogether when sores are present."

      "title": "Look into adding lysine to your diet.",
      "content": "Look into adding lysine to your diet. Lysine is an amino acid that is used for preventing and treating cold sores. Lysine acts by blocking the action of arginine (which increases the multiplication of the herpes virus). Lysine may be taken whenever you are having a herpes outbreak or prior to onset of symptoms. Talk to your doctor before deciding to include Lysine as a supplement, especially if you have kidney disease or if you are pregnant or nursing. Follow the product instructions if you decide to include Lysine as a supplement."
