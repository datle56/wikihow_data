      "content": "Learn about her personality. If you don't already know very much about the girl, ask some of her friends to tell you what she likes. This may be pretty easy to find out if you share mutual friends. Finding out what she likes can help you identify things you have in common so you can bond with her over them. [1] X Research source For example, you may find that she loves the same types of movies that you're passionate about. Try catching movies at the same time so you run into her and have something to talk about. Of course, if you’re crushing on a girl who’s in a relationship and you don’t even know her that well, it’s probably best to keep it that way. Why invite unnecessary temptation?"

      "content": "Spend time with her while in a group. Some people can become instant friends while others need to spend a bit of time in each other's company. Create emotional bonds by hanging out together, having fun together, and becoming comfortable around each other. If you're both hanging out in a group, make a point of seeking her out to talk to her. She'll probably be flattered or at least willing to talk to you since you've shown an interest in her. [2] X Research source Realize that this won't happen overnight (if it ever happens). You'll probably need to spend a considerable amount of time together to form an attachment."

Don’t profess your love and never say anything nasty about her current partner. Instead, just make casual small talk, ask her opinion about something, or talk to her about things going on in her life. [3] X Research source Just paying attention to her will signal to her that you care about her. This will increase her feelings of friendliness towards you, even if she's in a romantic relationship. Being a supportive friend can actually encourage the girl to reconsider her current relationship. She may realize that you make a better partner. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. If you like a girl, it's easy to think that you need to be the kind of person she'd like. But if you’re dishonest with her, you'll weaken the emotional bond you're building with her, and you'll also set yourself up for disappointment later on when you're not happy pretending any more. Be honest from the get-go so she becomes interested in starting a relationship with the real you. [5] X Research source For example, if she competes in several sports but you don't enjoy being athletic, don't pretend to enjoy or participate in sports for her sake. If you feel the need to lie to be more attractive to her, consider that maybe she's just not right for you."

She may feel less pressure if you simply ask her to go do things together without labeling these outings as dates. If she always agrees to spend time alone with you, she's probably interested in you too. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all.

Even group hangs can give you opportunities for one-on-one time: for instance, at dinner with friends, try to sit next to her so you can carry on private conversations and joke around together."

A thoughtful gift will show her you know her well and that you care—without being as direct as a verbal declaration of love. [7] X Research source The classic is giving the girl flowers or something romantic like a poem, but don’t default to clichés unless you know she’ll enjoy it. Depending on what she likes, you could do something original that she may appreciate more than flowers: for example, if she's really interested in original artwork, paint her something. Don't worry that whatever you give her isn't professional quality or expensive. The point of the romantic gesture is to signal your feelings for her."

Let her know that you have fun hanging out in a mutual group too, but place the emphasis on your time alone. You could also mention how important she's become to you or how your feelings have developed towards her. [8] X Research source If you're anxious about hinting to her in person, consider texting or calling her. You might find that you have more courage when communicating electronically.

These may be signs that she's interested in starting a romantic relationship with you. If she gives you the cold shoulder, tells you to stop it, or seems uncomfortable, give her some space. If she doesn't respond well to your flirting, consider moving on. If she does like the flirting, continue paying her attention and trying to spend more time together. Flirting is fun, of course, but ask yourself if you'd like to date someone who flirts with other people behind your back. [9] X Research source"

Crushing on a girl in a relationship is common, but confessing your feelings is risky: she might reject you, and it could affect your friendship. Or she might reciprocate and end her relationship. Before you go all-in and ask her out, ask yourself if your feelings for her are worth possibly messing up your friendship with her, or if they’re worth messing up her relationship. [10] X Research source Are you really looking for a romantic relationship? Or is she just attractive to you because she's \"forbidden fruit\"? [11] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If she rejects you, are you prepared to move on emotionally if she remains in her current relationship? Realize that even if she still wants to be friends after you’ve confessed your feelings, her current partner might not be happy about it (understandably so). The level of commitment of her current relationship may tell you whether it's worth it to insert yourself into it: if she's married, it's almost always best not to meddle. But if she's just in a short-lived fling, it may not be a big deal to tell her how you feel...but then again, it may be worth just waiting it out, too."

Avoid jumping straight to asking her to be your girlfriend or asking her on a date, as she could see this as presumptuous and may feel you don’t respect the boundaries of her current relationship. Instead, tell her you’ve been struggling with feelings for her and it’s gotten to the point where you think it’s best to let her know about them . Rehearse what you want to say ahead of time so that you're as calm and collected as you can be in the moment.

You might be good friends, but if she's still in the other relationship, it's because she's choosing to remain. Don't tell yourself that she's secretly in love with you or is just waiting for you to ask her out again. [14] X Research source Even if she still wants to be friends and her partner is OK with it, ask yourself if it’s serving you to stay close to her. It may help you to get over her if you spend less time with her, and maybe even try seeing someone else. Be good to yourself. Falling for someone is nerve-wracking on its own, but falling for someone you can't have can be brutal. Don't torture yourself by waiting for her: move on. You're worth it."
