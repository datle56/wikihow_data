      "content": "Stand on higher ground. You can help even out the height difference by initiating the hug from a spot where you are standing on higher ground than she is. You can be just high enough to be at the same height or you can actually be taller than her. [1] X Research source If the height difference is significant, you could stand on the stairs or even on a box or something nearby. Being outdoors offers a lot of options for choosing higher ground. You could stand on a curb while she stands on the sidewalk. You can stand at a higher point on a hill. Look for tree roots or a rock that you can stand on."

      "title": "Stand up straight.",
      "content": "Stand up straight. Since you are already shorter, don’t make it worse by slouching. Lift your head up high and keep your shoulders broad but relaxed. You’ll put yourself in a better position for the hug as well as project confidence showing that her tallness does not bother you. Raise yourself onto the balls of your feet just slightly. Don’t stand on your tiptoes but you can give yourself a small one inch boost to even out the height difference a little bit. Standing up straight with your head high, your shoulders raised, and your feet flexed can add two or three inches to your height."

      "content": "Hug the girl while she is sitting down. In general, it’s harder to hug when someone is sitting down, but if you are shorter it can help. Simply lean down to her level with your arms over her shoulders, hands touching her back, and lay your head on her shoulder or against the side of her head. This may feel like you’ve created an awkward angle, but it will help you feel better because you will be taller in this type of hug."

      "title": "Put your arms around her midsection.",
      "content": "Put your arms around her midsection. As the shorter person, it won’t work to put your arms over her shoulders as you would with someone shorter. Wrap your arms around her ribcage, keeping your forearms close to each other. You can vary your hand placement in this position. You can place your hands up on her shoulder blades while keeping your elbows by her sides. If its a more romantic hug, you can also keep your hands low on her back reaching one toward each of her sides."

    {
      "title": "Turn your head to the side.",
      "content": "Turn your head to the side. When you give a face-to-face hug to a taller girl, one main goal is to make sure you don’t awkwardly stick your face into her chest. The easiest way to avoid this is to turn your head to the side. If your head has to touch her chest, it’s better to lay your ear against her chest rather than putting your face into her chest. Any girl would much rather you got an earful of her heartbeat than a faceful of her chest. If you are only a few inches shorter, this really won’t be a big issue. It’s most important when you are short enough that your face is at her chest level."

    {
      "title": "Position for a side hug.",
      "content": "Position for a side hug. If you are short enough that your face is closer to her chest level, you can avoid that awkward closeness by giving her a side hug instead. Do this by angling one side of your body toward her and one side away. Slip one arm around her back and pull her toward you. Your shoulder will be slightly under her shoulder and your bodies will be touching from the chest down to the hips. For added intimacy to compensate for less body contact, you can tilt your head toward her as an invitation for her to lean down and touch your head with hers."
