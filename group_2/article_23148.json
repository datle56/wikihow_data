If he understands why you have no sexual desire right now, he may be less upset. [7] X Research source “You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t been wanting to have as much sex lately, and I wanted to tell you why. I think that I’ve just been super overwhelmed with my new job and with the kids, so I haven’t had much time to think about sex.” “I know we haven’t been having sex as much, and that’s because of me. I wanted to explain that while I’m going through menopause, my hormones are a little out of whack, which sometimes makes my sex drive do weird things.” Your husband may be upset that you two aren’t connecting as much, which is valid. But he should also care about why your sex drive has gotten lower so he can help you with any issues that you’re having."
