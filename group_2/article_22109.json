You'll be surprised at how little changes like that can impact your diet. Always talk to your doctor before radically changing your diet.

      "content": "Get 7-9 hours of sleep every night. Develop a sleep routine that you stick to every night before bed. Start by picking a consistent bedtime. About an hour before that time, disconnect from all gadgets, take some time to relax your mind and body, put on some comfortable pajamas, and get into bed. This kind of routine will help calm your mind and let it know that you're getting ready to rest for the night. [4] X Research source The exact recommended amount of sleep you need can vary by age. For school-age children, it is recommended they get around 9-11 hours of sleep per night. Teenagers need 8-10 hours, while adults over 65 need at least 7-8 hours of nightly sleep. Avoid bright screens an hour before bed. This includes phones, tablets, computer screens, and televisions. The blue light from the screen can make it difficult for you to fall asleep."

Activities like yoga, meditation, taking a warm bath, or giving yourself a massage may help you relax your body from the stress of the day. [5] X Research source Even if you don’t feel like you have a lot of time to spend on relaxation, try to take just 5 minutes each day to help your body unwind. For a simple relaxing practice, try a progressive muscle relaxation. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and slowly tense the muscles in your feet for a count of 3 breaths. Then, let the muscles relax completely. Continue this pattern up your body, focusing one-by-one on your legs, glutes, core, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, jaw, and face. Use apps like Headspace or Insight Timer to guide you through meditation. These are great resources for beginners. Meditation helps grow the muscle that allows you to better react and respond to the stuff of life. [6] X Expert Source Amy Wong Leadership & Transformational Coach Expert Interview. 30 April 2020."

At the beginning of each day or the night before, take a few minutes to write out your plan for the day. Include work tasks and duties, errands, hobbies, and chores, as well as personal time, family time, and time for relaxation. [7] X Research source Don’t worry if you can’t accomplish everything you plan. Having a schedule helps keep you on task, but there are things like traffic jams and work emergencies for which you can’t easily account. If you don’t get to something the day it is scheduled, reschedule it for later. You can even consider assigning priorities to different tasks. Picking your kids up, for example, would be a high priority, while washing the car might be a low priority. That way, if you have to reschedule items, you can see what absolutely needs to be done and what can wait."

Try writing down one or two large life goals. Then, break that goal down into several smaller goals. After that, break those goals down into actionable steps. [8] X Research source For example, if one of your goals is to be healthy, two of your smaller goals may be to run a 5K and get a 6-pack. You can then break each of those down into individual workout plans to achieve those goals. Try to keep your goals reasonable. It’s okay to dream big, but saying you want to be the richest person on earth is a lofty goal that’s out of reach for the vast majority of people. Instead, try setting a goal like saving enough that you can buy a house or retire comfortably. Use a journal to help you keep track of your goals. Using a journal lets you write them down, reflect on them, and adjust them periodically. Setting and working towards goals can help give you confidence. Goals may even be beneficial for your mental health. [9] X Research source"

Start simple by creating a budget that enables you to cover your current cost of living. Once your budget is in place, think about tackling other financial goals such as saving for retirement, buying a home, or paying off your debt. Your budget should account for all your cost of living expenses including your rent or mortgage, household bills, groceries, car payments or transit passes, credit card and student loan payments, and any other recurring charges you may have. Even small financial changes can add up. Investing just $5 a week in your debts, for example, can help reduce them by an extra $260 by the end of the year. If you are struggling to get your finances in order, you can consider using a free app like Mint to help you track your spending and develop a budget.

By the same measure, you can set aside certain times that are specifically for non-work activities. If you run every day, for example, you could make 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. your designated running time.

If you find that your job is overwhelming or so inflexible that it prevents you from taking care of yourself or your family, it may be time to find a new job. Look for a place that offers the sort of flexibility you need to ensure that you can manage your daily life. If your feelings towards work are less than ideal, thinking about why that is can lead to potential avenues for improvement.
