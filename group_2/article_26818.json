Once the ingredients are all mixed together, you'll need to work quickly; the last thing you'd want to do is scramble for additional ingredients and supplies. This recipe will make approximately 1 softball-sized bath bomb. If you'd like to make a different size or amount, adjust the recipe while keeping the proportions the same. For example, if you wanted to make 2 softball-sized bath bombs, you'd start with 2 cups (440 g) of baking soda instead of 1 cup (220 g)."

Place 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda, 1/4 cup (40 g) of cream of tartar, 1/2 cup (64 g) of cornstarch, and 1/2 cup (120 g) of salt into a glass or stainless steel bowl. Don't use plastic or aluminum bowls, as the oils may react with them. [1] X Research source You can use any type of salt you want. Epsom salt is a class choice for bath products, but you can also try sea salt or non-iodized table salt. If you can't find cornstarch, add 1/4 cup (55 g) of baking soda and 1/4 cup (60 g) of salts. Keep in mind that this will cause the bath bomb to fizz more and last not as long. [2] X Research source"

If you don't have a whisk available you can improvise one with 2 forks or a set of chopsticks. Don't worry too much about doing this perfectly. The goal here is to mix up the dry ingredients. You can even put them into a sealed jar and shake the jar."

      "content": "Mix the oils and food coloring in a separate bowl. Measure out 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of essential oil and pour it into a clean bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (30 mL) of oil and 1 to 2 drops of food coloring. Stir everything together with spoon. The oil is optional, but it will make the bath bomb more nourishing for your skin. Vegetable oil, sweet almond oil, coconut oil, or olive oil are all great choices. The food coloring may be difficult to mix into the oil, especially if it is water-based. Consider using an oil-based food coloring instead. [3] X Research source Avoid getting the essential oil directly onto your skin as it may irritate it. Once the oil is in the bath bomb, however, you'll be fine."

The exact amount of extra moisture you'll need will vary, so it's best to add it little by little as you work. In general, you'll need less than a tablespoon. Spray in some water whenever you have difficulty working the mixture. You should end up with a mixture that is crumbly but holds its shape when squeezed together. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick a mold. Almost anything can be used as a mold, but plastic and glass items work best. You can pick something big enough to hold a few cups for one big bath bomb or use smaller molds for little bath bombs. Plastics can soak up undiluted essential oil, but this is less likely to happen after you've mixed everything together. The most popular \"mold\" is a spherical plastic Christmas ornament. Look for the 2-part, snap-together type of ornament commonly sold at craft stores. It will make the round, softball-sized shape often seen in commercial bath bombs. Chocolate molds come in many cute shapes that are perfect for making bath bombs. Tart and cupcake tins also work well. [9] X Research source"

A bath bomb that looks pretty when you make it may not necessarily make the best-looking bath. Keep a record of which combinations you've tried and which work out best. Make sure to always use dyes that are non-toxic, non-staining, and water soluble."
