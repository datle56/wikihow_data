Plus, girls tend to like people who are unique but confident, and who march to the beat of their own drum. [1] X Research source In other words, if you’re true to yourself and comfortable in your skin, you’re more likely to win her over! Don’t try to copy other kids or follow trends and fads that aren’t really you. She’ll likely be able to tell that you aren’t being sincere, and she may not like it. For example, if you’re not a sporty person, don’t pretend to be one just to impress her. Eventually, she’ll realize the truth, and she may be upset that you weren’t honest with her."

Use deodorant, but don't overwhelm her with cologne or body spray. You want to be free of body odor, but you don’t want to overdo it! Instead of just throwing something on in the morning before school, take a second to put together an outfit that shows off your personal style. Pick clothes you feel comfortable and confident in. If you’re starting to develop some acne, consider asking your parents to help you get medicine or treatment for it . There are acne creams, face washes, and spot treatments available at drug stores, or if your acne is more severe, a dermatologist may be able to help.

      "content": "Remember that the nice guy always wins. Girls in real life usually don't like the cocky players you see in the movies and on TV. They prefer guys who act like gentlemen , who treat girls (and everyone) with kindness and respect. These qualities make girls want to be around you more, and they may even help you catch her eye. [4] X Research source Make an effort to be polite and have good manners. This means shaking her parents’ hands if you meet them, holding doors open for her, and saying “please” and “thank you” to people. Be kind to everyone. Don’t say mean things to her, and don’t say mean things about other people in front of her, either. Stick up for her. If she's put in an uncomfortable situation — a fight or an argument — be there to offer support. Stand up for her if someone says something nasty about her; do this for other people you care about, too."

If you have a crush on a girl and you want to win her over, this can give you a lot of motivation to start working on some of your flaws or learn some new skills. And, once you’ve started, she may be impressed by what she sees! For example, if you have a temper, work on cooling it down. Girls don't like guys who suddenly blow up and cause a scene. Be aware of what sets you off, and try to avoid it. Develop your conversation skills . If you plan on impressing her, you're going to need to have multiple conversations with her, so it’s a good idea to brainstorm some interesting conversation topics and good questions to ask her. Learn a cool new skill or take up a hobby. It’s pretty attractive when someone is passionate about their interests! Some good ideas of things to learn include magic tricks, playing an instrument, cooking, or photography. It doesn't matter what you choose, as long as you enjoy it."

Things like this give you an opportunity to talk to her and get more comfortable around her. [6] X Research source If you’re nervous about spending time with her alone, start by doing things as a group.

Are you close to them?” “What is your relationship with your parents like?” “What’s your favorite type of music?” “If you could only watch one movie for the rest of your life, what would it be?”"

All of these things can be subtle hints that you like her as more than a friend. [8] X Research source Be sure to keep things respectful when you’re complimenting her appearance–you don’t want to make her uncomfortable. Stick to comments about her hair, eyes, fashion sense, or style, and avoid making comments about her body. For example: \"Wow, you have really pretty eyes,\" \"You look really nice today,\" or \"Did you get a haircut? I love it!\" You can also compliment her skills or her personality, such as: “Your drawings are so cool. Do you want to be an artist when you get older?” Or, “You were so great at your soccer game yesterday. That last goal was amazing!” If you have a cell phone, you may also want to ask her for her number, so that you can text each other and converse even when you aren’t at school."

There are a few things, however, that you’ll want to plan out before you ask her on the date: Decide where the date will be and what activity you’ll be doing. If you take time to come up with a plan, rather than just asking her to hang out in general, it’ll show her how much you care. For example, depending on her parents’ rules about dating, you could ask her to see a movie, go on a group date, or meet up at a school sports game. Find a nice, relatively isolated place to ask her out, away from friends and distractions. A bench or empty lunch table at school could work, or if you’re hanging out with her in a group, the two of you could break off and walk alone for a few minutes. Plan to look your best on the day you’ll be asking her out, so that you’re putting your best foot forward. Wear something you feel comfortable and confident in."

Here are some examples of what to say: \"Hey, so that movie we were talking about last week? I got a couple tickets to it, would you want to go together on Friday?\" \"You know the state fair happening this weekend? My friend has a booth and I'm thinking about going. Would you want to check it out together?\" \"I was thinking about going to the football game on Friday.

It’s okay to be nervous—pretty much everyone is when they ask someone out! Just take some deep breaths, and go for it. You’ve got this! If you can't find the courage to directly ask her out, don't ask a friend to do it for you. She might think it's a joke and not really consider it. It’s better to wait a little while, build up more confidence, and then ask her out on your own."

If you're extra confident that you can hold a conversation with her for a while, the park or a restaurant also work. Pay for her, if you can. Whether it's tickets for the movies, admission to the zoo, or food at a restaurant, you want to demonstrate that you're a gentleman and that you're generous. Be respectful and give her personal space. If you're at the movies and you want to put your arm around her, make sure to ask her if this is okay, rather than just doing it. This goes for any kind of physical contact, such as holding hands or hugging. Smile, relax, and most of all, have fun! If you feel nervous when you're on the date, remember, she's probably just as nervous as you are. Just focus on being in the moment and having a good time as you get to know each other better."

      "content": "Check in with yourself before making things official with her. After dating for awhile, you might want to ask her to be your girlfriend. This is a pretty big decision, and there are a few questions you should ask yourself beforehand. For example: Are both of your parents okay with you two becoming boyfriend and girlfriend? Some parents are okay with their kids dating in middle school, while others have rules about waiting until you’re a bit older. It’s important to make sure that both of your parents are okay with it first. Do you have enough time for a relationship? When you’re in a relationship, you need to spend a fair amount of time with the other person. If you’re already busy with commitments to sports teams, extracurricular activities, or schoolwork, it may be hard to find enough time to spend with your girlfriend. Do you feel emotionally ready for everything that comes with dating? Dating can be a pretty emotional ordeal, and there can sometimes be drama or heartbreak involved. Do you think you’ll be able to deal with this, or does it seem too stressful? If you think over these questions and decide you’re ready for a relationship, go ahead and ask her if she wants to be your girlfriend. Remember to accept her answer respectfully, no matter what it is!"
