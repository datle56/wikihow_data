      "content": "Develop a personal sense of style. A big part of acting mature is being able to own your own sense of style, based on your tastes and preferences. Don’t expect to wake up one day and have personal sense of style. Instead, let your sense of style evolve as you evolve. As you grow older, your taste in clothing will change over time. It may help to focus on a certain style of dressing, like surfer girl style or ladylike style, and then tailor it to fit your personality and your tastes. One way you can develop your own sense of style is to find an older style icon and emulate their style. This could be a classic film star like Carey Grant or Grace Kelly, or it could be your mother or father’s style in the 70s or 80s. Look at how your style icon dresses and carries themselves. Try to find clothing that has a similar cut or look and style yourself after an older style icon. If you’re trying to create an outfit for a night out, you should think about dressing mature and still true to yourself. This could mean higher necklines and lower hemlines, but also an element that is true to your personality or sense of style, like a cool necklace or a vintage coat. The idea is to project confidence and maturity with how you wear your clothing, rather than what you are wearing."

One way you can show off your skills or abilities is to invite him to an event or setting that will allow you to demonstrate them. This could be an art show displaying your artwork, a sporting event where he can watch you play, or an office event where you can show off how well-regarded you are among your co-workers. You can also share this information in conversation by asking the older guy what he is most proud of or asking him about his skills and abilities. He may then reciprocate by asking you about your skills and abilities, thereby allowing you to share them without appearing cocky or egotistical. For example, you could suggest: \"Let's talk about things we are proud of\" or ask him, \"What do you feel you are good at?\""

[7] X Expert Source LeTisha Underwood Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 14 December 2021. These are both signs of immaturity and an inability to be emotionally open. Older guys can have more developed emotional maturity due to their age and experience, so meet him halfway by being willing to share your feelings if you are upset or bothered by something or someone. This means also being honest with him if he does something that annoys you or makes you uncomfortable, as this will show him you can be confident and straightforward. [8] X Research source Keeping your feelings and emotions to yourself may seem like an easy to avoid conflict and appear relaxed and easygoing, especially if you are trying to appear cool and collected to an older guy. But being dishonest about your feelings will only lead to conflict later on and less trust between you and the older guy. If the older guy is as mature as he seems, he will react to your honesty with compassion and gratitude. For example, if the older guy does something that upsets you, rather than get upset and start a screaming match or give him the silent treatment, you can respond by suggesting that you both discuss the issue and try to resolve it together. If he forgets your birthday, for example, you may tell him: \"I'm sure you didn't mean to be hurtful, but when you forgot my birthday I felt really hurt. It felt like you didn't value a day that's important to me. Can we talk about it?\" Reader Poll: We asked 473 wikiHow readers how they addressed insecurities in a relationship, and 70% of them said that the most helpful approaches were open communication and honesty.
