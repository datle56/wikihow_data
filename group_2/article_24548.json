      "content": "The Ivy League is a cross between a classic crew cut and a side part. Also known as the Harvard Clip or Princeton cut, the Ivy League is a type of crew cut that leaves enough hair in front so it can be parted to the side. It features short, tapered sides and back, with slightly longer hair on top. This creates a classic and refined look that’s perfect for professionals, students, and anyone else who wants a polished style without spending hours at the salon. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Request an Ivy League haircut or a classic crew cut with a side part.",
      "content": "Request an Ivy League haircut or a classic crew cut with a side part. For a classic Ivy League haircut, ask your barber to leave 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 cm to 5 cm) of hair in the front, gradually shortening it toward the crown. Add texture throughout your hair to make it easier to style at home, and have them trim the sides between a #2 or #5 clipper guard, depending on how short you want it. [2] X Research source Grow out the hair on the sides so it’s somewhere between 2 to 5 inches (5 cm to 12.7 cm). Otherwise, you’ll have to choose a short and faded variation of the Ivy League cut. Show your barber reference photos of Ivy League haircuts that have the bangs, graduation, and styling you like. The key to a flattering haircut is to be clear about what you want!"

Repeat this process 2 to 3 times until your hair is the perfect shape. Before blow-drying your hair, apply a heat protectant spray over your strands, avoiding the scalp area."

For straight hair, use a smoothing shampoo and conditioner to minimize frizz and add extra shine. For wavy, curly, or textured hair, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to hydrate your strands and minimize heat damage."
