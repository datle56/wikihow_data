[16] X Research source Historically, Hawaiian Pidgin stems from sugar cane plantations, where native Hawaiians, English speakers, and immigrants from other places all needed to communicate. Thus, Hawaiian Pidgin is influenced by several other languages: Chinese , English , Filipino , Japanese , Korean , Portuguese , Spanish , and Hawaiian. Eventually, people started using Hawaiian Pidgin outside plantations in the 19th century. Thus, today, many Hawaiian slang words are derived from ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, Pidgin, English, or a combination of the three."
