      "content": "Hag stones are stones with a natural hole going through them. These stones, also commonly known as adder stones, are formed when water erodes the mineral to create a natural, circular hole through the middle of it. Because of this, hag stones are most commonly found on the beach or near rivers. [1] X Research source Any rock can become a hag stone, though many of them are made of flint, sandstone, or limestone. Even a seashell can be a hag stone if it has a hole formed from water erosion. Minerals of any age can be a hag stone. The age depends on the type of rock being eroded, as some minerals take longer to degrade than others."

      "content": "Hag stones are believed to have magical properties. According to British folklore, hag stones are good luck and are capable of warding off witches (or hags) and negativity—hence the name “hag stone.” The belief is that only good things can pass through a hole, and bad luck and evil thoughts get “stuck” in the middle of the stone. [2] X Research source This may come from the centuries-old belief that magic cannot work on moving water, so because hag stones are created by water, they act as a “shield” against evil magic. Hag stones are also known as Odin stones, adder stones, hex stones, fairy stones, holey stones, and eye stones because of their magical associations. According to folklore, hag stones are called adder stones because they’re formed from the hardened saliva of several serpents, with the hole being created by their tongues."

      "content": "Hag stones are believed to ward off evil. One of the most common hag stone superstitions is that they can protect you from evil spirits and witches. Many believers hang hag stones above their doorways or wear them as talismans to keep negative energy away. [3] X Research source Historically, sailors tied hag stones to their ships with rope to stop witches from clinging to their vessels. The swinging of the stone was also believed to help break up storm clouds. Farmers would nail hag stones to their barn doors to prevent witches from souring their herd’s milk or from riding their horses at night."

      "content": "Many believe they allow you to see Fairyland. Another common superstition is that if you look through the hole in a hag stone, you’ll be able to see fairies. The hole acts as a “lens” that reveals a glimpse of the magical world usually invisible to the human eye. Legend has it that if you look through the stone under moonlight, you’ll see spirits and other magical beings. [4] X Research source Similarly, some believe holding or looking through a hag stone can help you see and connect with your ancestors and spiritual guides."

      "content": "Look on coasts and around moving water. Because hag stones are formed by water erosion, you’ll have the best luck finding them along the ocean coast or on the banks of a river. They’re also sometimes found in tide pools, especially if they contain Pholad clams, which sometimes burrow holes in stones to escape predators. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy one from a seller, but beware of fakes. You can purchase hag stones from various vendors both online and in-person, for fairly cheap, but there is a chance these could be man-made. While this isn’t a common practice, some sellers may drill holes in rocks and pass them off as natural hag stones. A reputable seller should be willing to answer any questions you have about their hag stones. [10] X Research source A common way to tell if a hag stone is man-made is to look for sharp edges on the inside of the hole. A real hag stone will have smooth edges due to erosion. It’s also suspicious if a very large hag stone only has one hole."
