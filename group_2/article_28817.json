For this trick, you'll need: two pieces of plain paper, a clear glass cup, a pen or pencil, scissors, clear tape, a coin, a table to perform the trick on, and a piece of cloth or fabric. Make sure the cloth or fabric you choose is big enough to cover the glass completely when you lay it on top of the glass."

Stick the shape onto the top of the cup, so the glass is covered with a piece of plain paper. Trim the edges with scissors so that when the glass is upside down on a bigger piece of the same plain paper, it is not noticeable. You only need four small pieces of tape, around the edge of the circle."

It's up to you, so you can get creative here."

With each circular motion, touch the coin very gently so that your hand pulls it towards the edge of the table a few inches. Continue doing this until the coin falls of the edge. If your table isn't over something that will muffle the sound of the coin falling, catch the coin with your other hand. You may need to practice this so that you can do it discreetly. While you're pulling the coin off the table with each circular motion, do some misdirection with your other hand and voice to keep the audience from looking too closely at the place the coin originally was."
