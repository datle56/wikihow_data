      "content": "Distract your child to try to head off a tantrum that’s just starting. Sometimes, if you can see that your child’s mood is starting to deteriorate, you might be able to stop the tantrum in its tracks if you act quickly. Try changing your child’s location, for instance, or offer them a toy or snack that might take their attention away from what they’re upset over. It won’t work every time, but it’s worth a shot! [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For instance, if your toddler is upset because they want an older sibling’s toy, you might take them to their room and point out the different decorations on the wall, then offer them one of their favorite toys. Avoid offering anything that the toddler isn’t usually allowed to have, like your phone. The next time they want that item, they won’t understand why they can’t have it, and it’s likely to lead to another tantrum."

      "content": "Try to stay calm if the tantrum continues. It’s really hard to keep your cool when someone else is screaming at you, even if that person is your own small child. However, if your toddler sees that you’re upset, it’s going to be even harder for them to calm down, so even if you don’t feel calm, try to pretend that you are. No matter what your child is doing, try to speak in a soft, even tone, and keep your movements controlled and deliberate.

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Remind yourself that a tantrum usually occurs because your child can’t express what they need, want, or are feeling. That can help you feel more compassionate toward them, which can help you stay more calm. If you need to and you’re in a situation where you can, it can sometimes help to step away for a moment to settle your nerves. For instance, you might take a moment if your child is safely in their room or if there's someone else who can supervise them for a few minutes."

      "content": "Ignore the tantrum the best you can. Usually, the best thing you can do during a tantrum is to wait it out, unless your child is doing something that requires immediate attention, like hitting, biting or breaking things. If your child is just crying, screaming, and lying on the floor, sit or stand nearby and wait for them to get all of their anger and frustration out of their system. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can talk to them later about how to manage their emotions better, but they probably won’t retain anything you say to them during the tantrum."

      "content": "Do your best not to give in to whatever they’re throwing a tantrum over. It can be really hard to say no sometimes, especially if you’re in public and you feel embarrassed by the tantrum. However, giving in will just make your child more likely to have tantrums in the future, because it reinforces the idea that if they scream and yell, they’ll get their way. [6] X Research source For instance, if they want a particular toy or a treat at the grocery store, don’t buy it for them. If they’re throwing a tantrum because they don’t want to sit at the table, it’s okay to leave for a moment to calm down, but then return to the table once the tantrum is over so your child knows they can’t get out of things by throwing a fit."

      "content": "Acknowledge your child's emotions to reassure them. While you don’t want to encourage a tantrum, it’s okay to tell your child that you understand how they’re feeling. Try using specific emotion words to describe what you think your child is experiencing. Even if it doesn’t calm them down right in the moment, you’re helping them build a vocabulary they can use to express themselves as they get older.

If it’s possible, sit down so you’ll have more stability, since they’ll probably fight against you. Keep holding them until they start to calm down to ensure they don’t hurt themselves or someone else. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For instance, if you’re sitting, you might place your child on your lap and hug them tightly to your chest.

If you're at home, take your child to a designated time-out space. This should be somewhere without any distractions, like your hallway or the bottom of the stairs. If you're in public, go somewhere private. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Sometimes, tantrums can occur because a child is feeling overstimulated.

Even if you’re feeling a little frayed, try to take a moment to reassure your child once they start to get control of their emotions again.

That will strengthen the bond between you, which can help them feel more secure. Over time, that might even help decrease the frequency and severity of their tantrums. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Show your child compassion by saying something like, “Hey it’s okay. We all get upset sometimes. I still love you.” You can also ask them to use their words to express how they’re feeling. At the age of two, they might not have quite the vocabulary to do this yet, but it will show them that you care about them, even when they’ve been acting badly."

Sometimes it can be hard to know what will make your child throw a tantrum—it can sometimes be something as small as handing them a blue cup when they wanted a purple one. However, try to anticipate what might be upsetting to your child, and come up with ways to side-step them whenever possible. [14] X Research source For instance, don’t give your child a toy that’s too advanced for their age, as they might become upset when they can’t work it properly. On an older sibling’s birthday, you might have a small toy wrapped for your two-year-old to open so they don’t get upset that they don’t have a present. It can help to avoid going down the toy or candy aisle in the grocery store if you think your child might throw a tantrum there, as well."

      "content": "Stick to a consistent daily routine as much as possible. Small children really benefit from a consistent schedule. That includes waking up, eating, napping, and going to bed at about the same time every day. By sticking to a schedule, your child learns what to expect from each day, which gives them a sense of order and control. That security can then cut back on tantrums. Doing this also helps avoid your child getting overtired or hungry because their naptime or meal came later than normal.

Everyone gets a little cranky when they’re hungry or tired, but small children are especially vulnerable to this. If you know you need to run errands or you’re planning a playdate, try to schedule them right after your child’s normal meal or nap times. That way, your child will be well-rested and well-fed, which may help them fend off tantrums while you’re out.

Since they won’t have the words to tell you how they’re feeling, this can lead to a meltdown. Try to evaluate whatever is going on around you, and if it starts to seem like too much for your child, step away with them for a moment.
