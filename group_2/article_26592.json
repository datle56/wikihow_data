      "content": "A low drop fade is a sharp fade that drops behind the ears. The fade starts below the hairline and sharply transitions from long hair to short as it approaches the neck. The curved fade creates more texture and fluff towards the top of the head, making this a great haircut if you want a little bit of extra volume. [1] X Research source If you want a taper fade with more contrast, a low drop fade is a great way to go."

      "title": "Ask your barber for a low fade that drops behind the ears.",
      "content": "Ask your barber for a low fade that drops behind the ears. Ask your barber to make sure the fade follows your hair and curves as it drops. Make sure to also let your barber know how long you want the top of your cut to be. Bring reference photos to make the process easier and leave with exactly what you want, including any customization you’d like.

      "content": "Visit the barber every 2-4 weeks and brush your fade upward between cuts. The hair on a fade grows out pretty fast, so visit your barber every 2-4 weeks for a touch-up. If you want to make it last longer, brush your fade towards the top of your head. Brushing it upward will emphasize the look of the fade even if your hair has grown out slightly.

      "content": "Rock a low drop fade with curly hair. A low drop fade helps your curls pop.

      "content": "Straighten your hair and get a low drop fade. A low drop fade can draw attention to the texture on top of your head.

    {
      "title": "Taper",
      "content": "Taper The taper is a similar cut that hangs low near the hairline, but instead of dropping down behind the ears it gradually fades around the neck. Instead of having a fade that goes all around, the taper is only near the hairline and the base of the neck."

    {
      "title": "Mid Drop Fade",
      "content": "Mid Drop Fade A mid drop fade has the same sleek drop as the low fade, but it’s higher on the head. So instead of dropping down the ears, it starts just above the taper below the hairline and drops as it curves around the head. This leaves a sharp fade that transitions into longer hair just above the ear."

    {
      "title": "High Drop Fade",
      "content": "High Drop Fade A high drop fade takes things a step further and raises the fade even more. It starts at the hairline and drops down as it approaches the back of the head, making for a strong fade that contrasts with the hair on top."

    {
      "title": "Burst Fade",
      "content": "Burst Fade Instead of dropping down, a burst fade bursts outward before dropping behind the ear. The key difference between a burst fade and a drop fade is that with a burst fade, the hair on the back of the head remains. A drop fade, on the other hand, has a clean fade all around.
