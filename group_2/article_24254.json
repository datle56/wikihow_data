      "title": "Install an additional power outlet first",
      "content": "Install an additional power outlet first . Per national and international electric codes, your power outlet must be connected to a GFCI/RCD breaker to minimize injury caused by electric shock. If your toilet has a GFCI outlet conveniently nearby, you can chain another outlet to it; just attach the additional outlet to the \"load\" contacts on the breaker. If your toilet does not have a GFCI or RCD nearby, you should contact an electrician to have one installed. This outlet needs to be positioned at the same height as other ground-level outlets so that the 1-meter cable can plug into the wall."

      "content": "Turn off and disconnect the toilet from the water supply. Because you will be installing a bidet, you will need to turn off the water supply to the toilet using the valve feeding from the wall. After doing so, you will need to empty the toilet tank by flushing the toilet to minimize backflow. Then, with a bucket to catch the water, remove the tubing from the water inlet to disconnect the water supply."

      "title": "Install the junction valve.",
      "content": "Install the junction valve. To do so, start by inserting the rubber fittings and washers into the valve to prevent leakage. After all the fittings are in, screw the nuts of the junction valve to the underside of the toilet or to the water supply. The nuts should be snug, but not too tight."

      "title": "Install the base plate.",
      "content": "Install the base plate. Start by assembling the paper template included with the Washlet to provide a guide to where you need to place your marks. If you have a toilet with a curved back, move the inserts to the back holes before mounting."

      "title": "Verify the size of the bowl.",
      "content": "Verify the size of the bowl. Measure the distance from the holes to the edge of the toilet. If the distance is 47 centimetres (19 in), then you have an elongated toilet. If the distance is 42 centimetres (17 in), then you have a round toilet."
