Dip your toes into fundraising when you volunteer for your local committee. This might only involve making phone calls and speaking to local Republicans. At the end of the call, you hit them up for money. Suggest more creative fundraising methods. For example, you can have a sponsored walk to raise funds. Each volunteer solicits pledges from people they know, e.g., fifty cents for each mile walked. Consider holding a fundraiser meal. The candidate will attend, and you can charge people for tickets to attend. To maximize attendance, price reasonably and ask attendees to contribute on the side if they can. [3] X Research source"
