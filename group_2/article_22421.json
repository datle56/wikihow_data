    {
      "title": "Keep the person from falling.",
      "content": "Keep the person from falling. When someone has a seizure, they can fall and injure themselves. To help them not get hurt, find a way to keep them from falling if they are standing. One way to help with this is to put your arms around them or catch their arms to hold them upright. Protect their head if you can. You may also try to guide them carefully to the floor if they still have some control of their movements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the person on their side.",
      "content": "Place the person on their side. If the person is lying down when you find them, try to get them onto their side with their mouth angled towards the floor. This helps protect them by letting the saliva and vomit out of the side of their mouth instead of having it slide back into their throat or windpipe, which could cause them to inhale it. [1] X Research source Leaving a seizing person on their back can lead to choking and breathing fluids into their lungs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clear away any harmful objects.",
      "content": "Clear away any harmful objects. People who have seizures may injure themselves by hitting furniture, walls, or other nearby objects. To help the person avoid injury, move all objects around them as far away as possible. It is especially important to move any sharp objects from around the person. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Moving the objects is easier than moving the person. However, if the person is walking around confused, try to steer them away from dangerous places, like traffic, high areas, or sharp objects."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect the person's head.",
      "content": "Protect the person's head. Some seizures may cause the person to hit their head against the floor repeatedly. If their head is striking the floor or an object, protect their head with something soft, like a pillow, cushion, or jacket. [3] X Research source Do not restrain their head or any other part of their body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Time the duration of the seizure.",
      "content": "Time the duration of the seizure. If someone near you has a seizure, you should try to time the length of the seizure. Seizures generally last between 60 to 120 seconds (one to two minutes). Seizures that last longer than that can indicate a bigger problem, and you should call emergency services. [4] X Research source Use a watch if you have one for a more accurate time. However, you can count in your head how long the seizure lasts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid placing anything in the person’s mouth.",
      "content": "Avoid placing anything in the person’s mouth. Never place anything in a seizing person’s mouth, even if you think it will help prevent them from hurting their mouth or teeth. People who are seizing will not swallow their tongue. Putting things in their mouth may cause the seizing person to break a tooth. You should never place your fingers in their mouth. The person could bite your finger and injure you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Refrain from holding the person down.",
      "content": "Refrain from holding the person down. During the seizure, never hold the person down. Never try to restrain them or keep them from moving. This will cause them injury. The person could dislocate their shoulder or break a bone. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for medical identification jewelry.",
      "content": "Check for medical identification jewelry. Some people who have seizures may wear medical identification jewelry. Look on the person's wrist for a bracelet, or around their neck for a necklace. Medical ID jewelry may give you the information needed during an emergency. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source When you have a chance, you can look in their wallet or pockets for any medical ID card."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remain calm.",
      "content": "Remain calm. Most seizures only last for a few minutes and are no reason to panic. You should stay calm to help the person who is seizing. If you panic or act stressed, the person seizing may also become stressed. Instead, remain calm and talk reassuringly to the person. [7] X Research source You should also remain calm after the seizure. Staying calm and helping the person remain calm can help with their recovery."

      "title": "Call emergency services unless the person commonly has seizures.",
      "content": "Call emergency services unless the person commonly has seizures. If you know that someone has a history of seizures, then you do not need to call emergency services unless the seizure lasts for more than 2-5 minutes or if there is something different about this seizure.

[9] X Research source If you don't know the person, check for a medical bracelet to see if they regularly have seizures.

      "content": "Call for help if a person has unusual seizure activity. Most people's seizures are over after a few minutes, and then they regain consciousness and become aware of their surroundings.

      "content": "Find help if the person has a seizure in a dangerous situation. Seizing when someone is in a dangerous situation can lead to injury or death.

    {
      "title": "Monitor the person for injuries.",
      "content": "Monitor the person for injuries. After the seizure is over, wait until the person is calm. Then, you should turn the person onto their side if they are not in that position already. Look over the person’s body to check for any injuries that may have occurred during the seizure."

      "title": "Clear the mouth if they are having trouble breathing.",
      "content": "Clear the mouth if they are having trouble breathing. If you notice the person is having trouble breathing after they have calmed, use your finger to clear the mouth.

      "content": "Allow the person to rest. Give the person a safe area where they can rest. Make sure any tight clothing around their neck and waist is loosened.
