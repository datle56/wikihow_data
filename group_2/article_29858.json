      "title": "Fold a letter size sheet of paper in half.",
      "content": "Fold a letter size sheet of paper in half. Use an 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper. Make a vertical (hotdog) fold down the middle of the sheet to create a long, thin rectangle. Check that the corners of the paper match up exactly. [1] X Research source You can even use shipping paper. Or use recycled toilet paper. Use your thumb or a flat-edged tool, like a butter knife or a wooden tongue depressor, to create a sharp crease. This will help your plane fly once it’s finished."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfold the paper and bend the top corners toward the crease.",
      "content": "Unfold the paper and bend the top corners toward the crease. Fold the left corner first, then fold the right corner to meet it in the center. Make sure the outer edges of the paper are touching each other at the crease line. This will form triangular flaps on each side of the paper and will turn the top of your paper plane into a point. The bottom edge of the flap should be a straight line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend each of the triangular flaps toward the middle to sharpen the point.",
      "content": "Bend each of the triangular flaps toward the middle to sharpen the point. Carefully fold the left triangular flap in toward the middle crease, then press it down to create a smooth crease. Next, fold the right triangular flap toward the middle. Press along the crease to make it sharp. Once this is finished, you should have a sharp, narrow point at the end of your plane. [2] X Research source The paper should look like a dart. Most of the paper now will be in the shape of a triangle, with a point at the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the paper in half along the vertical crease.",
      "content": "Fold the paper in half along the vertical crease. Re-fold the paper along the vertical crease you made in the first step. Check that both sides line up evenly. Then, run your finger or a blunt-edged tool along the crease to make it sharp. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make wings on each side by folding down the edges.",
      "content": "Make wings on each side by folding down the edges. Lay the paper on a flat surface with the crease facing your body. Fold down 1 side of the paper to about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the bottom crease. Check that the edge of the flap is parallel to the bottom crease, then press down on it to create a wing. Next, flip the paper over and repeat on the other side to create the second wing. [4] X Research source You should have a finished dart plane. Test it out to see if it flies!"

      "title": "Fold a letter size paper in half.",
      "content": "Fold a letter size paper in half. Use an 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) sheet of paper to craft your dart. Make a vertical (hotdog) fold by bringing the long sides together. Make sure the edges line up exactly. Then, use your finger to flatten out the crease. [5] X Research source When making creases, make sure they are sharp and crisp. Use your thumb or a straight-edged tool, like a wooden depressor or a butterknife."

    {
      "title": "Unfold the paper and bend the top corners toward the crease.",
      "content": "Unfold the paper and bend the top corners toward the crease. To make the dart point, fold each of the top corners down toward the center crease. Fold in the left corner first, then fold in the right corner to meet it. Make sure the edges of the folds meet in the center, then press down on the creases to make them sharp. The flaps should make two triangles, and the tip should be in a point."

    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over and fold the outer edges in toward the center crease.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over and fold the outer edges in toward the center crease. Turn your paper onto the other side with the triangular flaps facing down. Take the outer pointed edge and fold that corner to the center crease. Repeat on both sides. [6] X Research source At this stage, you will have three layers of triangular folds. The bottom corners of the top triangular layer should meet at the center crease. The edges of the paper should be mostly in the shape of a triangle, with the bottom edge still flat."

    {
      "title": "Fold the tip down toward the base of the paper to make a flat tip.",
      "content": "Fold the tip down toward the base of the paper to make a flat tip. Bend the tip and line it up with the folds in the triangular flaps. Then, press down on the fold to create a sharp crease. [7] X Research source At this point, your plane should have a flat tip where the point used to be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the paper in half along the center crease.",
      "content": "Fold the paper in half along the center crease. Match the edges of the paper exactly to create a symmetrical fold along the center crease. The folds done in steps 3 and 4 should be on the inside of the paper. Press down on the crease to make it sharp again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the back edges into wings.",
      "content": "Fold the back edges into wings. Place your dart plane on a flat surface with the crease facing you. Then, take the back edge of the paper and fold it down toward the crease. Line the edge with the crease, then press down on the fold to create a wing. Flip the paper over and repeat to create the other wing. This plane flies better at a slower speed. The nose will cause it to fall if you throw it too fast."

      "title": "Make 8 1 in (2.5 cm) folds from the top of your paper down.",
      "content": "Make 8 1 in (2.5 cm) folds from the top of your paper down. Use an 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper that’s positioned vertically on your work surface. Fold the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of the paper down. Make sure the edges line up evenly, then press down to create a fold. Repeat this 8 times, folding each time on top of the previous fold, for eight folds. When you’re finished, the paper will be half its original size. Make sure the folds are lined up exactly on top of one another and tightly folded. The creases should be sharp and crisp. To achieve a sharp crease, use your thumb or a blunt-edged tool, like a wooden depressor or a butterknife."

    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over and fold it in half.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over and fold it in half. Turn your paper over so that the folded edge is facing toward your work surface. Check that the folded edge is pointed up. Next, take the left side of your sheet and fold it over. Make sure that the edges are lined up evenly, then press down to create a sharp crease. [8] X Research source You should now be able to see the folds."

    {
      "title": "Make wings by folding the sides down over the crease.",
      "content": "Make wings by folding the sides down over the crease. Turn the paper so that the bottom of the crease is facing you. About .5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) from the crease, fold your paper flap down to create a long wing. Then, flip the paper over and bend the other side in the exact same spot. Use your finger to press down on the folds and make them sharp. The folds should be on the bottom of the plane. The kite plane is capable of great distance and accuracy."
