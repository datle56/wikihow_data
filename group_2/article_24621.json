      "title": "Speak with Elder McNamara in the Hidden Valley Bunker.",
      "content": "Speak with Elder McNamara in the Hidden Valley Bunker. The Hidden Valley Bunker can be found southeast of Sloan in the Mojave Wasteland. There are four different bunkers at this location. The bunker with the Brotherhood of Steel is directly west of the fast travel icon on your map once you have located the Hidden Valley. Elder McNamara will tell you that the Brotherhood doesn’t usually accept outsiders into this organization but can make an exception if you complete a heroic act in the name of the Brotherhood. He orders you to install a remote signal transmitter on top of Black Mountain. Black Mountain is controlled by dangerous supermutants under the rule of Tabitha."

      "title": "Head to Black Mountain and reach its top.",
      "content": "Head to Black Mountain and reach its top. During the day, Black Mountain is patrolled by super mutants, but during the night, cloaked Nightkin patrols the roads. Nightkin are a tougher opponent, as they are invisible and can quickly sneak up behind you. Heading up the mountain during the day can be easier since you can see what you are up against. Along the road leading up to the mountaintop you will come across Neil’s Shack and Neil himself. If you have a speech skill of 50, you can persuade Neil to help you kill Tabitha and reach the top of the mountain."

Once you have entered the broadcast building, head to the opposite door from inside and exit to the fenced-off area outdoors. Under a false rock, which can be found under the staircase, is a key to enter the second floor of the broadcast building."

      "content": "Take care of Tabitha by killing her. Be prepared to face Tabitha when entering the second floor. She is a level 20 super mutant and can be a tricky foe if you are under this level. Bring along at least 5 Stimpacks to heal yourself from this fight. Once you have killed Tabitha, you will need to plant the transmitter."

You will be immediately recruited as part of the Brotherhood of Steel and be given a T-45d Power Armor. A matching helmet will come along with the armor and the proper training to be able to wear it. The training is a special Power Armor Training perk, which is added to your character. Without this perk, you will be unable to wear any power armor."

If you decide to oust Elder McNamara in the quest “Still in the Dark,” Edgar Hardin will become the new Elder. When you ask Hardin if you can join the Brotherhood of Steel, he will mention that you need to do a heroic act in order to join. He will order you to kill the Van Graffs located in Silver Rush."

      "content": "Kill the Van Graffs. Destroying the Van Graffs can be a difficult task for newer players. There are a few ways to take this challenge on. If you kill Simon outside of the Silver Rush at the front door, you won’t have to give up your weapons when you enter the building. If you choose not to kill Simon, you can buy or steal energy weapons from inside the store. During the quest “Birds of a Feather,” the fourth customer will attempt to blow up the Silver Rush. Allowing him into the store will result in killing all the Van Graffs inside except for Simon. If you decide to barge your way into the store, expect a heavy firefight as there are over a dozen Van Graff troops inside. It is recommended that you are over the level of 20 and are wearing a full suit of armor, whether that is raider armor or just leather."
