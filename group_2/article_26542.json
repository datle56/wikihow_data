After their transformation, the werewolf – also known as a \"lycanthrope\" meaning \"wolf-man\" – ravages the land with their enhanced physical abilities , like super speed and strength. A person becomes a werewolf by getting bitten by one, getting cursed, drinking water from a wolf's paw print, being conceived under a new moon, or making a deal with Satan (depending on which version of the myth you refer to). [8] X Research source The werewolf became a pop culture icon in the United States with the release of The Werewolf of London in 1935 and The Wolfman in 1941. In the former, actor Henry Hull's character is bitten by a werewolf and turns into one himself, while in the latter, the main character (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.) accidentally kills a werewolf and becomes one in the process."

[10] X Research source In reality, the seventh son of the seventh son portion of the lobizón myth originated from Russian emigrés to Argentina. In Russia, it was customary for the Tsar to \"adopt\" seventh sons of seventh sons as their godchildren. Gauchos in Argentina built the legend of the werewolf on top of this tradition."
