      "content": "Reddit is not safe for children under the age of 18. Reddit contains a vast amount of content, much of which is not appropriate for young children. There are many subreddits that allow content that is pornographic, violent, or profane. You can also find content promoting hate speech, extreme views, and dangerous activities. [1] X Research source Content that is not appropriate for children under 18 is marked as \"NSFW\" or \"Not Safe for Work.\" You can set your account to block content that is marked as NSFW, but minors can easily toggle this off. No parental password is required. [2] X Research source Officially, Reddit does not allow users under the age of 13. This does not mean that Reddit is appropriate for children over the age of 13. It is recommended that parents supervise children age 13 and older."

The fact that users can stay anonymous on Reddit makes it more attractive to those who have bad intentions.

This includes your name, location, password, job or school, or anything they could use to track and find you."

Unlike other social media platforms, Reddit does not require you to use your actual name or any identifiable information. As long as you do not share any personal information in your username, profile, posts, chats, or direct messages, it is possible to stay anonymous on Reddit. However, Reddit may collect information on your profile and the way you use it. Reddit also allows you to make your profile not searchable on Google and other search engines. If you are conducting illegal activity on Reddit, law enforcement may subpoena information about your profile and the way it's being used from Reddit."

Do not open any files or executables that you accidentally download from Reddit. Do not provide any personal information in links that you click.
