Hardware and software issues: Certain features may not work properly or may not work as well, and some apps may not be able to run. Security risks: Many custom ROMs do not allow the same level of encryption that the manufacturer's ROM allows. Installing custom ROMs may make you more susceptible to malware, viruses, and security breaches. [1] X Research source Data loss: During installation, you may lose the data on your phone. Be sure to back up all data you want to keep before proceeding. You may brick your phone: In the worst-case scenario, installing a custom ROM may cause permanent damage to your phone and render it inoperable and unable to boot up."
