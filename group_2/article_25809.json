Do you think the person who made the video missed something and could improve it? Are you hoping to start a discussion thread? Leaving mean or thoughtless comments is more likely to get you blocked than noticed, so think about your comments before posting them. As an example, maybe you watched a beginner's dance tutorial video on YouTube; maybe you’re a beginner, and even though the tutorial was aimed at people like you, you felt that it was still too difficult. You want to communicate to the teacher in the video that you found the dance routine difficult to learn."

      "content": "Read other comments to avoid being redundant. Before commenting on a video, skim through as many comments as possible to ensure you’re not just repeating what someone else has already said. If you do find a comment that says what you want to say, consider liking (clicking on the “thumbs up” icon below the comment) and/or replying to it rather than posting a new comment altogether."

What a waste of time — learn how to teach!!!!” Try using comments like “Thank you for making this tutorial! I’m a beginner, and even though the tutorial is made for beginners, I really struggled with it. For me, I think it would have helped to have the dance broken down into more sections, with a couple of run-throughs after each section. At the end, instead of jumping straight to the full routine with music, it would have helped me to go through it twice more slowly and without music.”"

      "title": "Add something to the conversation.",
      "content": "Add something to the conversation. Ideally, social media is about sharing ideas and building connections. If the only comment you have after watching a video is “that was dumb,” you’re not really helping anyone out or adding anything to the conversation. Maybe the video is dumb; if that's the case and you feel like you must comment on it, try being informative, supportive, or, at the very least, witty. In the dance tutorial comment example, the user has made their comment informative by offering advice on how the video creator could improve it. Ideally, the creator will consider this advice for their future tutorials. For added helpfulness, the person commenting could even share a link to another video of the routine that they find more helpful (if one exists)."
