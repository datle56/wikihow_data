If you are having trouble getting the wire into a nice round shape, wrap the wire around a pen or marker and use the pliers to tighten the wire."

      "content": "Bend back the ends of each ring with the pliers. Use the pliers to bend back about 1/4\" of wire on each end and fold it so that it is aligned with the ring wire. Bending back the wire will redirect the pointed ends of the wire so that they are not pressing against your inner and outer lip. When you bend back the wires, make sure that the ring opening is wide enough to easily slide over your lip. This space should be about 1/4\" wide, but you may want it narrower or wider depending on the thickness of your lower lip. [3] X Research source"

Use the pliers to help you straighten the wire if it is too difficult to straighten with your fingertips. The wire does not have to be completely straight like a pin. It can be a bit wavy as long as it is no longer in the shape of a paperclip."
