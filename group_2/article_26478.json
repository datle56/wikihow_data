      "content": "Eat breakfast every day. Starting your day off with a healthy breakfast gives you the right foundation for eating well all day long. Because your metabolism slows down at night, eating breakfast in the morning can boost your metabolism to a more active state. If you skip breakfast, you'll be more likely to eat too much or lose your willpower to eat nutritious foods later in the day. Eat a lot of protein and fiber at breakfast to keep you full for several hours. Fruit, eggs, and vegetable smoothies are great breakfast choices. Avoid eating pancakes and other baked goods for breakfast. These give your body a shot of sugar without wholesome nutrients, so you'll get hungry faster. Plus, you'll be starting the day at a dietary disadvantage."

Soluble fiber, which is found in fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, lowers insulin levels in your body and leads to fat loss. Eating plenty of fiber with every meal will also make you feel full faster, so you won't be as tempted to eat high-calorie foods. Eat whole fruits and vegetables. [4] X Expert Source Mor Levy Volner, IBCLC, RDN International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Fresh, whole vegetables and fruits like apples, cherries, oranges, broccoli, spinach, kale, and sweet potatoes have a lot of fiber. Eat whole grains. Try steel cut oatmeal instead of instant, and choose whole wheat over white every time. Quinoa is another delicious whole grain to incorporate into your diet. Don't drink fruit juice. Fruit contains a lot of sugar, which is fine when you consume it along with the fruit's fiber. But when a fruit is juiced, its sugars are extracted and the fiber is discarded, leaving you with pure sugar."

      "content": "Don't eat foods with empty calories. For some people, it really is that simple. Certain foods are more easily converted to fat in your body. They provide a lot of calories, but the calories don't come with the nutrients and fiber your body needs to stay healthy. The first step to losing fat is cutting back or eliminating foods like: Sugar. Sugary sodas, baked goods, and candies can lead to a greater accumulation of fat. When you cut these foods out of your diet, you'll likely see results within the first week. White flour. Processed white flour that is used to make bread, pastries, cakes, pasta, and other wheat products should be avoided. Fried foods. The process of frying food makes it much less nutritious, leading to more fat. Cut back on french fries, fried chicken, and any other food with a fried breading. Most fast foods fall into this category. Processed snacks and meats. Snack foods, pre-packaged dinners, bacon, and lunch meat are processed with chemicals and preservatives that are bad for your health. They pack a lot of calories without nourishing your body, so avoid these while you're trying to lose fat. Use smaller plates so if you fill your plate it's less likely that you'll end up not eating all your food as if you would with a larger plate."

      "content": "Lift weights. Exercising with weights builds up muscle and keeps your metabolism high for an extended period of time, helping you to lose fat. [5] X Research source Even when you are not exercising, muscle will burn more calories than fat will. If you're new to weightlifting, get started by joining a gym and asking a personal trainer to help you with some beginner's exercises. Keep these tips in mind: Work each muscle group. Make sure you do exercises to work out your arms, back, chest, abdomen, and legs for full-body fat loss. Focus on performing 2-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions at 70-80% of your one repetition max. Do not simply lift the heaviest weights you can because form is more important than the amount of weight lifted, and form is usually sacrificed to focus on lifting heavier weights. Don't overdo it. Make sure you have a few rest days between workouts, and don't work the same muscle groups two days in a row. Your muscles need time to repair after workout sessions to get stronger."

      "content": "Get into cardio. Mixing resistance training with cardio workouts is the key to successful fat loss. Cardio exercises get your heart pumping and help you burn a lot of calories. Any type of cardio is fine, but try to choose an exercise you enjoy doing, so you'll be motivated to stick with your workout regimen. The best type of cardio to do for fat loss is HIIT (high-intensity interval training). HIIT involves doing intense bursts of cardio with short rests in between. HIIT keeps your body guessing and burning more calories than long periods of steady intensity. Cycling, swimming, and running are great cardio exercises. Do one of these activities for half an hour four times a week, or mix them all up. Work out with a friend. Sometimes having a friend along can turn a dreary workout into a fun catch-up session. Find a friend with similar goals and motivations, and set up a schedule to exercise together several times per week."

Being more active in general can make a big difference in your daily calorie burn. Try these tips to be more physically active, especially if you have a job that involves sitting all day: Take the stairs. This is a classic tip, but it really does make a difference! Instead of taking the elevator or escalator, walk up the stairs. When you leave the building, walk down the stairs. Take a walk during your breaks. Even if it just means leaving the building to eat lunch outside, get up and go somewhere. Take evening walks with a friend or partner. After dinner walks help you unwind, digest your food, and burn a few extra calories. Walk, bike, or take public transportation to work. Driving involves less physical activity than any of these transportation methods. Even taking the bus or train to work requires more activity than driving, since you have to walk to the bus or train station first."

Aim to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week if you are of average weight. Losing more than that can be damaging to your body.

Without it, you'll lapse into old habits, and you may even end up gaining back more than you initially lost. Take a positive view of your body. Think of yourself as a strong, capable person with a body you can use to experience the world. Being thankful for your body's strengths will help motivate you to take good care of it. On the other hand, if you tend to internally berate yourself for not looking the way you want to look, it's going to be harder to give your body the care and attention it needs to shed fat."
