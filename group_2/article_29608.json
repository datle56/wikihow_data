On the Google Voice page, click “Accept” on the Terms and Conditions that appear in a small dialog box and then select “I want a new number.” You will be asked for a forwarding number. Enter your number in the first text field, and then select the type below (e.g., if the number entered is a mobile one, select “Mobile” from the drop-down list). Remember, the number must not be tied to any Google Voice account. Click “Continue” when you’re done. Click “Call me now” in the next dialog box, and Google Voice will send a code to the number entered. Type in the code into the text field on the dialog box once you receive it. In the next dialog box, enter your area code in the first text field and click “Search now.” Google Voice will provide available numbers for you to choose from with that specific area code. Select one by clicking the circle before the number, and click “Continue.” Remember the number. Google will process the number selected and display it to you in the last dialog box. Write it down if you want so you don’t forget it, and then click “Finish.” You now have a Google Voice number. When you make calls, this number will be displayed in the caller ID."
