Groundhogs have bushy tails like squirrels. [3] X Research source They are longer, wider, and furrier than a gopher’s tail. Gophers’ tails have very little hair, often resembling a mouse or rat’s tail. [4] X Research source"

Looking for where damage is on your plants is a great way to tell whether you’re dealing with a gopher or groundhog. Gophers really like eating plants’ roots and stems, which they usually find while they’re underground tunneling. Groundhogs typically only eat the leaves and flowers off plants, though they also love fruit. [10] X Research source Adding a border fence around your plants can deter gophers and groundhogs. Use a wire fencing and insert it about 2 feet (60 cm) deep into the ground around your garden. [11] X Research source Then, ensure that the fencing extends about 3 feet (91 cm) high above the ground. Gophers are considered herbivores, but they sometimes accidentally eat bugs and beetles as they dig. [12] X Research source"

You’re less likely to actually see them, while groundhogs tend to stray from their burrows and walk around above ground. [13] X Research source While gophers rarely leave their tunnels, groundhogs hibernate underground in the winter. If you do see any animal activity from November through February, you’re probably dealing with a gopher, not a groundhog. [14] X Research source"

However, gophers also leave behind numerous unsightly mounds as they tunnel. [17] X Research source A groundhog’s damage usually stems from their burrowing. They’re notorious for burrowing under sheds, porches, and paths which can cause structural damage. [18] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Gopher removal : The best way to get rid of gophers is to set a trap in their tunnel. Find the gopher’s main burrow by inserting a gopher probe into a fresh mound. Poke the probe around until you feel the soil give away. Then, use a shovel to dig into the tunnel and insert the gopher trap inside. For a humane way to get rid of gophers, flush their tunnels with a garden hose. This usually works best on new tunnels. Groundhog removal : To get rid of groundhogs in your yard, place a wire cage trap full of apple slides or carrots near their burrow entrance. Once you’ve caught the groundhog, release them about 5 miles (8 km) away from your home or dispose of them humanely."
