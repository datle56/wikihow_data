      "title": "Make a paper disk.",
      "content": "Make a paper disk. The height of your cone will be determined by the radius of your circle. The larger the radius, the taller the cone. You can print the template in the document above, and trace the shape onto the paper you want to use. If you choose to make your own disc, do your best to make the shape as round as possible. Improper measurements will have a big effect on your cone's result. It's a good idea to put extra effort into making the circle as round as possible. For your disk shape, you can also use a compass, or trace a round object, such as a lid or container."

    {
      "title": "Draw a triangle wedge.",
      "content": "Draw a triangle wedge. Use the template to cut out two sides from the circle to make your wedge. To draw your own wedge, make a mark in the center of the disc. Draw out two straight lines from the center point to make a wedge with your ruler. If the lines are closer together it will make a smaller wedge which will result in a cone with a broad bottom. Use a compass protractor to pinpoint the centre of your disc if you're unsure where to place your dot. If you're using a protractor tool to outline the disc to begin with, it can save you time to make the centre dot before you trace the disc around it. You can also draw your own triangle wedge using a ruler and pencil."

      "title": "Cut the triangle wedge out of the circle.",
      "content": "Cut the triangle wedge out of the circle. To make a cone with a small bottom, cut out a larger triangle wedge. Use scissors or a precision knife to cut out your wedge as straight as possible. If you run into any cutting mishaps, you will probably need to start over again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the cut sides of your disc together.",
      "content": "Bring the cut sides of your disc together. For your cone shape, bring one cut end of your disc over to the other in a cone shape. Hold it together and make sure the lower ridge of both sides overlap evenly. With this, your disc should have the desired cone shape you're looking for. Unfurl the paper and try again if the sides don't meet properly at first. Don't make firm creases in your paper. Your cone should be rounded."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the inside of the cone closed.",
      "content": "Tape the inside of the cone closed. Once you tape the two sides side by side so that the paper makes a cone. Tape the inside of the cone by bridging the two sides so that they slightly overlap and bridging the overlap with tape. With that done, your cone should be ready to go. One straight piece of tape will give your cone the best stability. Multiple pieces of tape inside will make a mess. It is helpful to have one hand applying the tape while the other holds the shape of the cone."

      "title": "Cut out a wide triangle.",
      "content": "Cut out a wide triangle. [1] X Research source If the common disc method isn't to your liking, you can make a cone shape starting out with a paper triangle. In order for it to be rolled properly into a cone, there must be one long side, and two shorter sides of equal length. The bigger the triangle, the bigger your cone will be. Take care to make your measurements and cuts as accurate as possible. Slight errors can make your cone lopsided, or, worse still, too short to tape around. Similarly, you can make the same process work with a half-circle. A half-circle will result in a smoother top. [2] X Research source If you don't want to make measurements yourself, triangle templates are available. Make sure you're using a template with one long side and two shorter sides of equal length.

      "title": "Roll the far corners of your paper into the centre.",
      "content": "Roll the far corners of your paper into the centre. [4] X Research source Take one of the far corners and roll it into the centre so that the paper's edge is touching the middle of your triangle. With your other hand, bring the other corner and roll it overtop so that it wraps around the other corner. When this is complete, you should have a general shape of a cone in place. If you're having difficulty rolling the corners together, it may be that you didn't cut your triangle out wide enough. The far corners are the opposite ends of the wide triangle. Hold the first corner roll in place while you roll the other corner. [5] X Research source One hand should be used for each corner."

      "title": "Make adjustments to your cone.",
      "content": "Make adjustments to your cone. [6] X Research source Unless the rolls were perfect, chances are you'll have to shift the paper around a bit in order to make the cone even. Tighten the rolled folds as necessary. If you think you rolled the two corner folds unevenly, feel free to try again. If there are excess lengths of paper jutting out from the cone shape, it may be that your original sheet wasn't an even shape. If this is the case, you can keep moving forward by cutting off any excess with a precision knife. So long as you have an even base for your cone, people won't be able to notice mishaps you had in the process of making it. It's a fairly quick process, so it pays to do it a few times until you get it right."

      "title": "Fold the loose edges into the cone's opening.",
      "content": "Fold the loose edges into the cone's opening. Excess flaps of paper should be folded into the cone. This makes the cone look smother, and also helps the folds hold their form. If the rolls have been done correctly, there should at least be a triangular end that should be folded inward. [7] X Research source If for whatever reason you don't have enough paper to fold over, you can get over this issue by running a strip of tape across the base, from the outside to the inside of your cone. Try squeezing or loosening your grip on the cone if the folding slot isn't apparent enough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the cone.",
      "content": "Tape the cone. Although folding your loose edges should stabilize the cone's shape, taping the seam inside the cone will help ensure it holds. Take a strip of tape and line it up along the seam. If you think there's still a risk of it falling apart, take additional strips and line them across the top and middle of the seam. With taping done, you should have a functional cone. The loose edge can be taped down as well."

      "title": "Choose the right paper.",
      "content": "Choose the right paper. If you have a solid idea what you're making a cone for beforehand, it helps to consider the material you'll be using. Certain types of paper suit certain projects better than others. Printer paper is fine for purely decorative cones. It offers a lot of potential to be coloured or drawn on. A thick construction paper is best if you're making party hats. [8] X Research source Parchment paper is a good choice if you're making a funnel to bake with."

      "title": "Cut off the tip for a funnel.",
      "content": "Cut off the tip for a funnel. If you're making a cone for the sake of baking, a funnel is needed. Take a pair of scissors and cut the tip off. From that opening, you'll be able to control the pour of icing or syrup by squeezing the funnel. If your funnel hole isn't big enough, you can try to cut it again. Keep in mind, however, that the higher you cut up the cone will result in an exponentially bigger funnel hole. It's best to keep your funnel cutting careful and restrained."

      "title": "Draw a pattern on your cone.",
      "content": "Draw a pattern on your cone. If you're making a decorative cone or a party hat, it's fun to add a pattern. Take your favourite pencil crayons or markers and draw something. Patterns (like jagged edges or swirls) are best for a cone, but you can also draw words on it. For the sake of a party hat or dunce cap, writing a word (like \"Happy Birthday\") can help to specify the cone to the given occasion. Draw a pattern in with pencil first if you're worried about making mistakes. It may be easier to draw your pattern on the paper before you make it into a cone."

      "content": "Look up ideas for added inspiration. [9] X Research source There are countless ways you could go about decorating a paper cone. Although you should try coming up with ideas yourself, it can be inspiring to look up creative projects other people have done. Experiment with different cone-making techniques. Decorate your cone with a fresh type of material. The possibilities with home crafts are endless."
