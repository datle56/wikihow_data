      "content": "Answer the questions you know first. You’ll obviously want to answer as many questions as possible without running out of time. In addition, knowing the right answers to the questions above and below a tricky true or false problem can help you find a pattern. Guessing based on a true or false pattern is better than just guessing randomly. [1] X Research source When answering the questions that you know on a test that has a separate answer sheet, make sure that you skip the same questions on the answer sheet as you do on the test itself. This way, your answers won't become off set. Reader Poll: We asked 316 wikiHow readers how they manage their time while taking a test, and 59% of them agreed that the best strategy is to skip difficult questions and come back to them later.

      "content": "Choose the opposite answer if the surrounding answers are the same. Suppose you know the answers above and below a tricky question are both true. Chances are, the correct response to the tricky question is false. There is a low probability that the same correct response will appear three times in a row. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Guess false if there’s an absolute modifier.",
      "content": "Guess false if there’s an absolute modifier. Absolute modifiers are words that don’t allow for exceptions, such as all, everyone, never, and always. There aren’t many things that always happen without any exceptions, so questions that have absolutes are usually false. When a question with an absolute modifier is true, it’s often a well-known, common sense fact that doesn’t make for a good test question."
    },
    {
      "title": "Guess true if you see words like some, most, or a few.",
      "content": "Guess true if you see words like some, most, or a few. In-between words, as opposed to absolutes, are more likely to be true. If a statement allows for exceptions, it’s more probable that it’s true at least some of the time. Other in-between words include usually, often, seldom, and frequently."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose true if you’re totally stumped.",
      "content": "Choose true if you’re totally stumped. Go with true if none of the other true/false tips apply, and you have no clue what the answer is. Recalling a fact is easier than inventing a falsehood, so test makers tend to include more true answers than false. [3] X Research source For instance, if you’re stumped on a question with no absolute or in-between modifiers, and if the answer above is true and the one below is false, your best bet is to go with true."

    {
      "title": "Make a guess before looking at potential answers.",
      "content": "Make a guess before looking at potential answers. Often, an answer choice may be listed as an option in order to trick you. When you first read a question, try not to look at the choices or cover them with your hand to avoid doubting yourself and getting stuck. Try to make a guess off of the top of your head. Then, read the choices and see if any of them are close to your guess. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Eliminate outliers and the highest and lowest numbers.",
      "content": "Eliminate outliers and the highest and lowest numbers. Rule out choices that are funny, obviously wrong, or seem totally out of left field. If the possible answers are numbers, rule out the highest and lowest choices, then guess between the options left in the middle range."

    {
      "title": "Look for grammatical clues.",
      "content": "Look for grammatical clues. It might seem like a no brainer, but a test maker might occasionally overlook a question that only makes grammatical sense with one answer. Read the question and possible answers carefully, and eliminate the choices that don’t match the question’s grammar. [5] X Research source For instance, if a question asks, “A salamander is an,” and “amphibian” is the only choice that starts with a vowel, you’ll know it’s the right answer."

    {
      "title": "Guess “all of the above” if it only appears once on the test.",
      "content": "Guess “all of the above” if it only appears once on the test. If only one question has an “all” or “none of the above” choice, that’s probably the right answer. However, use your best judgement if you’re confident that at least one choice doesn’t fit. If you’re completely stumped and can’t rule out any choices, going with all or none could offer a good probability of choosing correctly. When all or none of the above are choices in every question, they’re the correct response as often as 65% percent of the time. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask to see past exams.",
      "content": "Ask to see past exams. Ask if your teacher keeps past exams on file and if they’d be willing to share them with you. You can get a feel for the types of questions they ask and look for patterns in correct answers. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that it’s always better to study the material instead of trying to outsmart your teacher. If you have a choice between studying your notes or figuring out how often “True” is the right answer, go with studying."

      "title": "Find out if blank answers are marked incorrect.",
      "content": "Find out if blank answers are marked incorrect. Ask your teacher or find out whether your standardized test takes points off for blank answers. Some test makers discourage guessing by deducting points only for incorrect responses. If you don’t get points off for a blank response, it’s best not to guess. [8] X Research source The SAT used to have a guess penalty. It ignored blank responses and deducted points only for wrong answers. However, College Board got rid of the guess penalty in 2016. The PSAT, ACT, and AP tests don’t use a guess penalty either. For each of these tests, you get a point for a correct answer and zero points for a blank or incorrect answer. [9] X Research source Standardized tests are subject to change, so make sure you know if an updated test includes a guess penalty."

Instead of spending too much time trying to make a good guess on a tricky question, breeze through all the questions you can answer confidently. You wouldn’t want to run out of time and leave an easy question blank. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for context clues in the rest of the test.",
      "content": "Look for context clues in the rest of the test. You might find a clue to a tricky question elsewhere in a test. Other questions might jog your memory or give you a context clue that shines a spotlight on the right answer to a hard question. [11] X Research source For example, suppose a multiple choice question asks if a weta is a plant, insect, fish, or mammal. A later question asks, “How many species of weta have entomologists identified?” If you know entomologists study insects, you’ll know the answer to the earlier question."
