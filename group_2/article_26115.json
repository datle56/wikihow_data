      "title": "Make a list of what people or things matter to you.",
      "content": "Make a list of what people or things matter to you. When looking for a life plan, it makes sense to prioritize some areas of your life. List all the things that you value in your life. You might list your family, friends, a certain hobby, nature, or career. Take the time to think deeply about the things without which you could not imagine living. For example, while you might like playing basketball, is this one of the most important things in your life? Perhaps it is. If not, it is likely a hobby."

      "title": "Determine your core values.",
      "content": "Determine your core values. You have your own moral compass, which guides you through life. What are the values you want your life to reflect? Do you strive to be honest? Perhaps you want to be caring and considerate towards others. Maybe you have a strong sense of social justice. Defining your values will help you determine your future actions. For example, if you prize honesty, there are some careers that might not be the best for you. CIA agents, for example, cannot disclose to others what they really do. On the other hand, if you care passionately about social justice, perhaps you could consider studying social work. For additional tips, see Live Life to the Fullest ."

      "title": "Find your calling.",
      "content": "Find your calling. Every person has their own talents and strengths. Aim to live your life in reflection of your unique calling. Finding your calling does not mean following someone else’s path. [1] X Research source Instead, seek to define what you do well and how you can live a life that incorporates your strength and perhaps helps other people as well. For example, you might be a talented teacher and musician. Perhaps your calling is to teach children piano lessons. On the other hand, you might be a great listener and care about helping others. You might be well-suited to be a psychologist. If dinosaur bones excite and fascinate you, perhaps your calling is paleontology and spreading knowledge about dinosaurs and environmental change to a new generation."

      "title": "Name your goals.",
      "content": "Name your goals. By making goals for life, we can live with a purpose. Do know that at any given time, your goals might change. You can adapt your goals as you move through life. If you have some structure, however, your life likely will be a bit easier. For example, you might want to become a physician. Your mini goals could be attending college, gaining entrance to medical school, graduating, and beginning to practice medicine. Each of these goals will have sub-goals. If your goal, on the other hand, is to have children, first you should think about how you want to have them. Do you want a partner with whom you can raise them? Do you prefer to adopt? What are the different strategies you can pursue to fulfill this goal?"

    {
      "title": "Prioritize.",
      "content": "Prioritize. After you have ascertained the people who matter to you, your values, and your goals, create priorities. At different points in life, you might prioritize different aspects. For example, while in school, your studies might take precedence. Later, your relationship or children might take more of your focus. By keeping your priorities in mind, you can better schedule your life. See Prioritize for additional tips."

      "title": "Build strong relationships with close ones.",
      "content": "Build strong relationships with close ones. Take the time to build solid relationships with the people about whom you care. Listen to their problems. Help them when necessary. When you offend them, apologize and strive to do better. Practice kind gestures like giving people rides or birthday cards. See Have a Healthy Relationship for more advice. Additionally, practice these behaviors: Build a circle of trust. Make sure your family members and friends know they can share their thoughts openly with you. Do not tell other people's secrets. If someone asks you to keep a confidence, do so. Be compassionate towards others. Even if someone wrongs you, if they are sincere in their repentance, show them forgiveness. Do not bring up their past transgressions in moments of anger."

      "title": "Promote healthy communication.",
      "content": "Promote healthy communication. Be direct when speaking to others. Listen carefully and attentively. If you have disagreements, try to fight effectively. That is, do not call each other names. Instead, discuss your problems calmly. Make sure you listen to the other person's point of view. For example, it might be wise during arguments to repeat the other person's point of view. This shows you understand. You might say, \"What I'm hearing you say is that you are annoyed by the fact that I am always home so late.\" Ask rather than assume. If you feel a relationship is suffering in some way, talk to the other person openly and candidly."

      "title": "Be a good neighbor.",
      "content": "Be a good neighbor. Part of living a good life comes from building a tight-knit local network. If you have neighbors, be helpful to them. Watch their cat when they go on vacation. Offer to shovel an elderly neighbor’s driveway. Practice neighborliness and you might find it is contagious."

      "title": "Serve your community.",
      "content": "Serve your community. One way to live a good life is to contribute to the community in which you live. You might volunteer at a soup kitchen or run a clothes drive for refugees.

      "content": "Travel. See what there is to see in the world around you. Explore new areas in your neighborhood or town or if your budget allows, travel farther.

      "content": "Practice hobbies. In addition to your calling and life purpose, you also need to have plain fun! Find hobbies that interest you and incorporate them into your routine.

See Express Gratitude for ideas on how to express your gratitude to others. Practice counting your blessings before bedtime by journalling about three positive moments from your day.

      "content": "Keep problems relative. Part of living a good life is not getting wrapped up in the daily problems we all face. While it is important to Handle Problems, take a moment to think about what is going well in your world. Perhaps you saw someone escort an elderly lady across the street. Maybe the children at your local school are collecting food for the homeless. Do you still have your health? Are you not penniless? Do you still have loved ones? Though you might be missing some of these things, keeping your problems in a relative position is helpful."

Listen carefully for the different animals’ and insects’ noises. Smell the plants or fresh rain. The world is filled with amazing attributes. Take a moment to let it sink in. Consider taking a reflective, multi-sensory walk in which you do not focus on any technology. Rather, look around you, notice different buildings or trees in your environment. Focus on the smells coming from a bakery or fresh-cut grass. Listen to people's voices or the wind in the trees.
