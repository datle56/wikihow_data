      "content": "Day 1: brisk walking for 60 minutes. Running will help you shed pounds, but running every day can be tough on your joints. Aim to walk for about an hour a couple days a week, at a pace of 2.5 to 3.5 miles (4 to 5.6 km) per hour. Make sure you’ve got good posture: head up, shoulders and back relaxed but straight. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Walking is also the best way to begin running, if you’re not a runner already. If you want to lose a lot of weight quickly, you’ll likely need to run every day. However, this isn’t really sustainable, and not giving your body time to rest can lead to injury. If you’d like to challenge yourself, increase the incline on your treadmill."

HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training, and it refers to a training routine in which you alternate short bursts of intensive exercise with short periods of rest. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The result is a super effective workout in a short amount of time. To implement HIIT in your treadmill exercises, alternate sprinting for 1 minute with walking for 30 seconds. Do this for 10 to 20 minutes. Before launching into your HIIT workout, warm up by walking at a moderate pace for about 5 minutes, and cool down afterwards by walking for another 5 minutes and then stretching once you’re off the treadmill. Though the average HIIT workout is pretty quick, it makes up for it by being super intensive. In fact, studies show HIIT burns 25-30% more calories than other workouts do. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re new to working out, you might only be able to do your HIIT routine for a few minutes. That’s OK! Over time, you’ll be able to do it for longer."

While running is a great way to slim down, combining your cardio with strength training will help you achieve better overall health. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source So on your third day, jog at a moderate pace—3.5-4 mph (5.6-6.4 km/h)—for about 20 minutes, and then change things up a bit with some strength training exercises, like tread pushes or lateral shuffles . The best thing about these exercises is you don’t need any equipment to do them besides your treadmill! To do a tread push , walk on the treadmill as you usually might—only keep the treadmill off the entire time. Try to walk for 20 minutes to give your large posterior muscles and your core a great workout. To do a lateral shuffle , stand sideways on your treadmill with your knees slightly bent. Turn on your treadmill and set it to a slow-to-medium speed, without an incline, and shuffle along sideways for 45 seconds, and then switch sides. [5] X Research source Do this for 20 minutes. Keep challenging yourself to avoid plateauing. Start out with a leisurely jog in your first week—maybe 4.5 mph (7.2 km/h) or so. Try to increase your speed a bit each week."

This is a good day to stroll and catch up on your favorite podcast or television show—or to hop off the treadmill and enjoy a walk in the park or around your neighborhood. Don’t just reserve exercise for one half-hour or hour-long window each day; build it into your day! Walk to work when you can, play with your kids, mop the floor, take the stairs instead of the elevator—small bouts of physical activity can really add up over time. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you do watch TV or listen to music or a podcast while you're on the treadmill, just be sure you're staying alert. Getting too distracted can result in a serious injury."

Stop the treadmill, hop off, and do kettlebell swings for 30 seconds. Next, do push-ups for 30 seconds. Then do a 60-second plank to really work your core muscles.

If you're new to these drills, just do one to warm up for 2 to 5 minutes. Trying to speed through too many new drills at once could lead to injury. Sprint for 30 seconds at a low incline, and then walk for 90 seconds. Set your treadmill to a slightly higher elevation and sprint for another 30 seconds. Then walk for 90 seconds.

      "content": "Eat fewer calories. Exercise is essential to staying in good shape, but it’s cutting calories that’ll really help you slim down. This doesn’t mean starving yourself—not only is restricting calories unhealthy, it’s just not manageable. To lose about a pound or 2 (0.45 to 0.91 kg) a week, cut down your caloric intake by about 500 calories. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The average person needs about 2000 calories to maintain their weight, so a 500-calorie deficit will mean you’re eating about 1500 calories per day.

[14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source There are loads of apps you can download to help you count calories, including My Fitness Pal and Lifesum . You can also track your daily exercises on these apps. Counting calories is helpful for a lot of people, but they may not be useful if you struggle with disordered eating.

[17] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Cutting calories can help you slim down, but this means that the calories you do eat need to be energizing and filling, so be sure to include plenty of protein in your diet . Try to ensure about 35% of your daily caloric intake comes from lean protein, like fish, chicken, chickpeas, and lentils. For instance, if you weigh 155 pounds, you’d multiply 155 by .36 and get 55.8 grams of protein. In kg, you’d multiply 70.3 kg by .8 and get 56.24. You can also use the USDA’s DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) app to calculate just how much protein you need."

      "content": "It’s possible to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in a month, but 4-8 pounds (1.8-3.6 kg) is more manageable. With vigorous exercise and strict dieting, you can lose 10 or more pounds (4.5 kg) in a month, but if you want to implement a manageable, long-term workout routine and diet, aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds (0.45-0.91 kg) per week so that you don’t get burned out too quickly. [18] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source How many calories you’ll burn depends on your body type, how intensively and frequently you work out, and how many calories you consume a day. 1 pound is equal to about 3500 calories, so when you're first starting out, try to enter a calorie deficit of about 500 calories a day to lose a pound (0.45 kg) a week. However, keep in mind that the more you weigh, the more calories you'll burn per day, so after a few months, your weight may start to plateau unless you cut more calories. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can determine roughly how many calories you burn on the treadmill in 1 minute by using this equation: (0.035 X body weight in kg) + ((Velocity in m/s ^ 2) / Height in m)) X (0.029) X (body weight in kg) [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if you're 1.6 meters tall (or about 5.25 feet tall), weigh 60 kg (or roughly 132 lbs.), and usually walk at 1.4 meters a second (roughly 3.1 mph), you'd calculate (0.035 X 60 kg) + ((1.4 x 1.4) / 1.6 m)) X (0.029) X (60 in kg) = 5.7855. [21] X Research source In other words, if you weigh 132 lbs. (60 kg) and are 5.25 feet (1.6 m) tall, you'd burn about 5.8 calories a minute walking at a pace of 3.1 mph, or 348 calories an hour."
