      "content": "Decide on a type of armor. You can create the following types of armor in Minecraft: [1] X Research source Leather armor - Reduces all damage by 28 percent. It's the weakest armor in Minecraft, but it requires no smelting and no special tools (e.g., pickaxes) to obtain. Iron armor - Reduces all damage by 60 percent. Gold armor - Reduces all damage by 44 percent. Since iron is infinitely more plentiful than gold, gold armor is a comparative waste of time and resources, but it helps a bit with piglins."

You may need to kill more or fewer than 24 cows depending on how much leather each drops. Iron - Mine iron blocks, which resemble grey stone with orange speckles, with a stone pickaxe or better. You will need to mine 24 iron ore to get 24 raw iron. Gold - Mine gold blocks, which resemble grey stone with yellow speckles, with an iron pickaxe or better. You will need to mine 24 gold ore to get 24 raw gold. Gold blocks are typically found deep underground. Diamond - Mine diamond ore, which resemble grey stone with light-blue speckles, with an iron or diamond pickaxe. You will need 24 diamond ore . Diamond is very deep underground, and very rare."
