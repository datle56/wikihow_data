This can minimize the risk of further irritation and clear away bacteria or germs that could cause infection. Use a gentle, non-foaming cleanser to wash your face. Avoid using anti-aging creams.

      "title": "Pat your skin dry.",
      "content": "Pat your skin dry. Rubbing your skin dry can easily irritate already fragile skin. After you’ve cleansed your skin, gently pat it dry with a clean towel. This can prevent further irritation."

      "content": "Dab on a hydrocortisone cream. Put a 1% hydrocortisone cream on top of moisturizer twice a day. Focus the cream on irritated areas for up to two weeks.

      "title": "Consider a vitamin C cream.",
      "content": "Consider a vitamin C cream. Use a mild vitamin C cream instead of hydrocortisone if you prefer something more natural. At a concentration of about 5%, vitamin C cream may soothe your skin and help it heal faster. Avoid exposing any area with vitamin C cream to the sun. Vitamin C creams and lotions can make you especially sensitive to the sun. Covering yourself up can protect you from sunburn and further irritation and inflammation."

      "title": "Avoid the sun or wear sun protection.",
      "content": "Avoid the sun or wear sun protection. If you’ve over-exfoliated, you took off not only dead skin cells, but new ones as well. This can expose delicate, new skin that is prone to sunburns. Protect your skin and promote healing by staying out of the sun if possible. Wear sunscreen or sunblock even if you’re just running errands. This can minimize the risk of sunburn, further inflammation and irritation, and hindering the healing process."

    {
      "title": "Go au-natural.",
      "content": "Go au-natural. Wait a few days to a week to return to your normal skincare and makeup routine. This gives your over-exfoliated skin time to heal completely before you apply anything with chemicals on it. It can also minimize irritation and speed up the healing process."

    {
      "title": "See a dermatologist.",
      "content": "See a dermatologist. If you notice your irritation worsening or it won’t go away after a week, make an appointment with your dermatologist. They can determine if you have severe damage or an infection on your skin. Depending on their exam, you may receive a prescription for a stronger cortisone cream or a prescription barrier repair cream. [3] X Research source"
