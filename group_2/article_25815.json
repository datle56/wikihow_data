      "content": "Sit down and talk about your separation. If you leave without saying anything, your partner won't understand what happened or why. If you want to leave them for good, tell your partner that you need to discuss something important.

Having this conversation may be painful, but it’s the most direct and respectful way to end things. [2] X Research source You can say, “Listen, we need to talk” or “I need to talk to you about some important things.” If you're in an abusive situation , make plans to get to safety immediately.

      "title": "Your partner is likely to ask you this question.",
      "content": "Your partner is likely to ask you this question. Spend some time thinking about all of the reasons and motivations you have for ending your relationship. You want to be able to cite examples of why things between the two of you have not been going well lately. [4] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. Work on coming up with answers so can respond clearly and directly. [5] X Research source If it helps, make a list of possible questions and your responses. Anticipate questions like, “Why?” and “What did I do wrong?” You might respond, “I need to do this for me” or “It’s not all your fault, this just isn’t working.”"

      "title": "Keep the focus on you and your feelings, not their faults.",
      "content": "Keep the focus on you and your feelings, not their faults. Talk about why you feel unhappy and why you want to end the relationship. Try not to point out mistakes they’ve made or things that you dislike about them. It’ll make it easier for them to hear what you’re saying without getting defensive. [6] X Research source For instance, instead of saying, “You don’t make time for me and I don’t like how little you do around the house,” you could say, “I don’t feel like my needs are being met.” You might say, “I just don’t feel the same way I once felt and I need to do this for me.” If they have their own concerns, listen to them. [7] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. But keep your own reasons focused on yourself."

      "title": "Avoid vague or contradictory language so there’s no confusion.",
      "content": "Avoid vague or contradictory language so there’s no confusion. It can feel tempting to break the news gently to avoid upsetting them. But your best bet is to tell them in no uncertain terms that you want to end the relationship and move on. Avoid open-ended statements that could leave doubt in their mind about whether you really want to leave them. Stick to clear, direct statements. [8] X Research source Instead of saying something like, “Unless things just suddenly changed, I don’t think we can be together,” try something direct like, “I want us to move on” or “I’m sorry, but it’s over and I need you to accept that.” Reader Poll: We asked 1129 wikiHow readers who've broken up with their partner, and only 4% of them agreed that the best thing to do is to suggest staying friends. [Take Poll] So while it may be tempting to try to soften the blow, it’s better to set firm boundaries about ending the relationship."

      "content": "Encourage everyone to see your separation as a positive step. Your separation may not come as a huge surprise to them, but once things are officially over, they need to know. Some of your mutual friends may take sides, which is understandable, but it can make the separation harder. Encourage everyone to see your separation as a good thing that will eventually make both you and your ex happier. [9] X Research source You could say, “If you can please respect our privacy while we work on figuring out the next steps, we’d greatly appreciate it.”"

It may be impossible to avoid hurting their feelings with the news, but it’s much better than them finding out another way. [10] X Research source Try saying something like, “Mommy and daddy won’t be together anymore, but we both still love you and it’s not your fault.”"

      "content": "Separate your belongings and start fresh somewhere else. Spend some time taking an inventory of what’s yours and what’s your ex’s in your home. Then, pack up your belongings and move them to your new space as soon as you can so you don’t have to spend additional time around your ex. If you aren’t able to find a new place easily, consider moving in with a friend or family member temporarily.
