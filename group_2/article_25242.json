      "title": "While it isn’t mandatory, a tip is generally recommended.",
      "content": "While it isn’t mandatory, a tip is generally recommended. Dog groomers do a lot of work, and it is generally considered good etiquette to tip them after they’ve groomed your pup. However, it is not required. Many people do not tip their dog groomers, so you won’t be alone if you forego a tip. [1] X Research source People typically tip workers who don’t make a lot in hourly wages and rely on tips to get by (i.e. servers, bellhops), or service-based workers who perform a task you can’t do on your own (i.e. hairstylists, bartenders). Dog groomers fulfill both of these requirements, so it makes sense that you’d tip."

      "title": "15-20% is considered a standard tip for a dog groomer.",
      "content": "15-20% is considered a standard tip for a dog groomer. The average dog grooming session costs about $80. [2] X Research source At a typical 15-20%, that comes out to $12-16 a session. [3] X Research source If you want to tip a little more or less than that it’s okay, but aim for at least 15% if you can. You can use a standard tip calculator to determine how much you should give based on the total bill."

    {
      "title": "Definitely; if you aren’t doing a percentage, a $20 bill is fine.",
      "content": "Definitely; if you aren’t doing a percentage, a $20 bill is fine. Unless you paid for the ultra-super-high-end 2+ hour grooming service, it’s totally fine to hand over a crisp $20 and call it a day. A cash tip is generally more appreciated than a credit tip anyways, so a single $20 bill is likely a good way to go. [4] X Research source You can give the groomer $10-15 if the session was fast and it wasn’t particularly expensive if you want to stick to the 15-20% guidance. If it was a 2+ hour session that cost over $100-150, aim to stick to the 15-20% guidance."

    {
      "title": "If you work with one groomer, give them double the tip.",
      "content": "If you work with one groomer, give them double the tip. If you go to a different groomer every time you get your pup groomed, don’t worry about a holiday tip. However, if you have a groomer you really like and you’ve been using them all year, consider doubling your normal tip."

    {
      "title": "The groomer went above and beyond.",
      "content": "The groomer went above and beyond. If you paid for a standard trim but the groomer noticed some plaque on their teeth and gave them a brush free on the house, it warrants an additional tip. Groomers often go out of their way to make sure a dog gets everything they need, even if the owner didn’t pay for it ahead of time. If your groomer took really good care of your furry friend, throw them some an extra 5-10% if you can. [5] X Research source Ask what’s included in the grooming session ahead of time so that you know precisely what you’re paying for. That way, you can figure out if the groomer did go above and beyond."

      "title": "Your dog was especially difficult to work with.",
      "content": "Your dog was especially difficult to work with. Do you have one of those dogs? If you know your 80 lb (36 kg) Rottweiler tends to growl and fidget every single time a stranger so much as touches them, consider throwing your groomer an additional 5-10%. [6] X Research source If you aren’t sure how your dog behaves with the groomer, just ask! When you come back to pay, you might say, “How was my boy? Did he sit still for you?”"

      "title": "You’ve got a big dog or they have a unique coat.",
      "content": "You’ve got a big dog or they have a unique coat. It takes a lot longer for a groomer to clean up an Irish Wolfhound than it does to trim a chihuahua, but groomers often don’t change their prices based on the size of the dog. To make up for their time, consider tipping 20-25% (or more) if your dog has unique needs, your dog is especially large, or your dog has a difficult coat to groom. [7] X Research source Breeds with crazy coats, like Komondors, Pulis, and Afghan hounds are typically very time consuming for groomers and warrant a larger tip if you can swing it. [8] X Research source If you’re doing any kind of special cut because you’re showing your dog, consider an additional tip."

      "title": "Your groomer is covered in scratches and/or fur.",
      "content": "Your groomer is covered in scratches and/or fur. If you go to pick your pet up and your groomer looks like they’ve been through the ringer, you might throw them some extra cash for their hard work. Groomers get bit and scratched occasionally on the job—it just goes with the territory—but it’s still nice if you can show them you appreciate the effort, especially if your dog hurt the groomer. [9] X Research source If you know your dog has a tendency to scratch or nip, mention it ahead of time when you’re taking your dog in to be groomed."

      "title": "The services were minor and it didn’t take very long.",
      "content": "The services were minor and it didn’t take very long. The average dog grooming session takes about 2 hours, but if you just took your dog in for a quick trim and nail filing and the groomer is done in 15 minutes, don’t sweat a big tip. [10] X Research source A tip will still 100% be appreciated, but your groomer will likely understand if you don’t tip. If you want to tip 5% or something like that for a quick trim, it’s totally okay."

      "title": "Tip is included in the bill for the grooming.",
      "content": "Tip is included in the bill for the grooming. This isn’t especially common in the dog grooming business, but some salons and grooming boutiques will include a service charge in the overall bill. If your groomer explains that there’s a service fee or tip built into the total price, don’t worry about tipping."

    {
      "title": "The groomer really screwed up.",
      "content": "The groomer really screwed up. Did you ask for a light trim and they basically shaved your poor pup? Your dog limping because the groomer nicked two of their nails down to the quick? If the dog groomer obviously botched the job or they were downright neglectful, it’s perfectly reasonable to forego the tip. [11] X Research source You may still want to tip if you get the vibe that the groomer really gave it their best effort, they’re new, or extremely apologetic."
