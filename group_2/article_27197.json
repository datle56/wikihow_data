      "content": "Stack two sheets of felt, one on top of the other. This will create the sole of your slipper. Both sheets can be the same color, or two different colors. You can use plain felt from the arts and crafts store, but you'll get a nicer-looking and longer-lasting slipper if you use 5-millimeter thick felt from the fabric store instead."

      "title": "Trace your foot onto the felt, using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.",
      "content": "Trace your foot onto the felt, using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Make sure that you don't trace too far under your arch. To prevent this from happening, look down at your foot while you are tracing it. If you can't see what you are drawing, you are going too far under the arch. Make the lines and curves as neat as you can."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut out your foot shape.",
      "content": "Cut out your foot shape. Instead of tracing your foot again for the other slipper, simply trace the sole you just cut out onto more felt, and cut that out too. You want to end up with four foot shapes, two for each sole."

      "title": "Place a sheet of felt over the top of your foot, and trace your toes.",
      "content": "Place a sheet of felt over the top of your foot, and trace your toes. Start tracing from the inside of your arch, all the way around your toes, and finishing at the other side of your foot. Remember to draw over the top of your foot as well."

      "content": "Cut the toe piece out, leaving a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance for the seams. If you'd like to save some time, cut two pieces of felt at the same time. This will give you the toe piece for your other slipper."

    {
      "title": "Pin the toe piece between the two sole pieces.",
      "content": "Pin the toe piece between the two sole pieces. Pin the toe piece to one of the sole pieces first, making sure that the edges meet up; the toe piece will bubbly up a bit. Next, pin the other sole piece on top, sandwiching the toe piece in between."

      "content": "Sew around the slipper using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide hole at the bottom of the heel so that you can turn the slipper. To prevent bunching, cut little notches or slits into the toe area of your slipper. Be careful not to cut through the stitching, however."

      "content": "Turn the slipper inside out through the 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) hole you left. If you need to, use a long, thin tool, like a knitting needle, to push out the curves and seams."

      "title": "Stuff the slipper with stuffing or batting.",
      "content": "Stuff the slipper with stuffing or batting. If you'd like to use batting, cut a sole-shape out of polyester quilt batting, and slide it into the sole. If you are using stuffing, simply fill the slipper with it, making it fuller in the arch area."

      "title": "Sew the hole shut.",
      "content": "Sew the hole shut. You can do this using a sewing machine and a straight stitch for something quick and simple. You can also fold the edges in by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), and sew them shut with a ladder stitch for a seam-less finish."

You only need to trace one foot, because you can easily flip the pattern over. Avoid going too far under your arch.

Your original pattern lines probably look very sketchy, especially for the top pattern piece. This won't give you very nice slippers. Smooth and straighten your paper out, then carefully trace around the lines you drew, leaving behind a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter border). Make the curves as neat as possible. If you added bumps for your toes, be sure to omit them for the final pattern."

If the pattern is too small, or doesn't fit right, you will need to make another one. If the pattern is too big, cut it down a little bit smaller, and try it again. If the pattern fits just right, you are ready to move on! Pin the pattern together ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters) from the edge."

Toe: 1 piece per slipper If you used two different colors for the sole, consider matching the toe piece to one of them."

If you are doing it by hand, consider using a heavy-duty thread, or even embroidery thread. You can use a thread color that matches the felt, or even a contrasting color. If you are using a sewing machine, you can use a basic stitch for something plain and simple, and a zigzag stitch for something fancier. If you are doing this by hand, you can use a straight stitch for something easy, and a blanket stitch for a nice, rustic touch."

You can leave your slippers as they are, or embellish them further with small decorations, such as: Add some simple embroidery to the toe piece using embroidery thread in a contrasting color. Stitch some designs onto the toe piece using seed beads. Add a blanket stitch to the raw edge of your toe piece. This will look great if you used a blanket stitch on the rest of your slipper. Stitch or glue on felt shapes or appliqués."

Make sure that the curves are nice and neat, and not \"sketchy.\" You can do this with a pen to distinguish it from the original pattern. It might still be a good idea to do this if you used a slipper to trace the pattern. Remember, it is always easier to cut down something that's too big than the other way around."

Pin the left side of the elastic to the left flap, and the right side to the right flap. Avoid stretching the elastic if you can. Next, stitch the elastic in place using a some X-shaped stitch. This will allow the slipper to pull open and close. [2] X Research source"
