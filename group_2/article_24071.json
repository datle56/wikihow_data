      "title": "Buy sliding closet doors and tracks that will fit your closet opening.",
      "content": "Buy sliding closet doors and tracks that will fit your closet opening. Sliding closet doors and tracks come in a variety of sizes. You’ll want to compare the measurements you took to the product specifications for the doors and tracks you're looking at so you know they'll fit in your closet opening. Look for a set of 2 sliding doors that comes with a pair of tracks. Look for doors that are slightly shorter than the height of your closet opening. [3] X Expert Source James Mansfield Construction & Design Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. It’s OK if the tracks you buy are longer than the width of your closet. You can cut them to size later on. Just make sure the tracks aren’t shorter than the width of your closet or they’ll be too small. If you have a particularly wide closet, you may need to buy more than 2 doors. If you do, look for tracks that can hold 3 or more doors."

      "content": "Cut your tracks to size with a hacksaw if needed. First, subtract 1–2 millimetres (0.039–0.079 in) from the width of your closet opening using the measurement you took earlier. Then, cut the top and bottom tracks to that length. Mark where you need to cut the tracks with pencil and then carefully saw along the line with the hacksaw. [4] X Research source When you’re finished, position the tracks in your closet opening to see if they fit. If they’re still to big, measure the width of the closet opening again and cut more of the tracks off."

To line the bottom track up with the top track, measure the distance between the side of the top track and the front edge of your closet opening.

      "content": "Screw the bottom track into place. Just like you did with the top track, drill the screws that came with the set into the screw holes along the bottom track. When you're finished, the top and bottom track should be securely in place and lined up with each other.

Then, latch the wheels on top of the door onto the back runner of the top track. The runner is what the wheels roll along so the door can slide back and forth. Each track has 2 runners — 1 in the front and 1 in the back. The first door will go on the back runners, and the second door will go on the runners in the front of the tracks. [8] X Research source"
