      "content": "Jupiter in the 8th house brings sudden gains in wealth. If you have Jupiter in the 8th house on your star chart, you’re likely to experience a large increase in wealth—specifically wealth, property, or other assets given to you by other people, possibly through inheritance. For example, you might gain wealth from your spouse or in-laws if they decide to bail you out of a financial jam. [2] X Research source If you work in commerce or want to sell something valuable, this may be a positive that your finances will improve drastically through the inheritance (and sale) of whatever valuable assets you’re given. In astrology, when Jupiter’s path takes it too close to the Sun, it becomes “combust,” meaning some of its strength is sapped by proximity to the Sun. To know when Jupiter is combusting, check the current day’s star chart on a site like CafeAstrology . If you see Jupiter within 11 degrees of the Sun, that means Jupiter is combusting. When Jupiter is in combust, you may notice that your wealth gains become delayed or get taken away from you—so it’s a good idea to handle your money carefully during this time."

[4] X Research source Generally, “the occult” refers to obscure supernatural beliefs that fall outside the scope of organized religion. You may also be interested in more traditional spiritual and religious practices—but your fascination with hidden things and mysteries also drives you to understand the occult. You may even decide to use your occult knowledge as part of your job. For example, you might become a professional astrologer or do tarot readings for people."

      "content": "Secrets and mysteries captivate Jupiter in the 8th house natives. The 8th house gives you a secretive nature; you may come off as mysterious or reserved to others and be great at keeping secrets . People trust you implicitly (and, as a result, don’t hesitate to confide in you when they have a secret). On the flip side, you also don’t reveal your secrets easily, and it takes a lot to get past your defenses—which only makes people more curious about you. [5] X Research source Despite your secretive nature, you may actually have a large social circle without really trying to (because so many people trust you and find themselves fascinated by your aura of mystery)."

You have a strong awareness of the people around you and high levels of empathy. According to astrology, your intuition may even signify subconscious psychic abilities, which you can use to comfort people and understand their needs instinctively without needing to ask.

In other words, focus on using your abilities to help others as much as possible! You also believe in the power of positivity. Because you’re compassionate and sensitive, you likely feel that sending good vibes out into the world will, in turn, allow good things to come to you. You tend to be emotionally charged and a little impulsive, so remember to think carefully before you act —especially if Jupiter is under stress (like going through a combustion, for example)."

You may have higher levels of sexual energy due to Jupiter in the 8th house and have more luck in finding intimate partners! In astrology, when Earth is passing (or being passed by) another planet, there’s an illusion that the planet moves backward—though it’s really because they’re moving at different speeds. This is called “retrograde.” Jupiter is in retrograde for roughly a third of each year (about 4 months). If you’re unsure when Jupiter is in retrograde, check this list of dates ! When Jupiter is in retrograde, it may restrict (and decrease) your sexual activities. If you’re married or have a life partner, it may also cause friction with your in-laws."

      "content": "Natives of Jupiter in the 8th house may struggle to connect with others. Your reserved, secretive aura gives you a certain allure but makes it harder to form true connections. You may have trouble sharing your thoughts and feelings with people and may appear to lack warmth or empathy (even though you’re very much a warm-hearted person inside!) You can read everyone else intuitively but won’t give anything away about yourself. [10] X Research source How to overcome this challenge: Openness is the key to connecting with others. Work on being more expressive and revealing more about yourself little by little until you feel more comfortable opening up to people."

It’s where you cultivate intimacy with others, but it also rules the subconscious—your fears, secrets, and taboos. The 8th house rules death and rebirth, thus reflecting your ability to examine and tame the darkest parts of your personality. It also governs secrets, sharing, and the idea that you must let things go in order to face your future freely. [12] X Research source The 8th house’s natural zodiac sign is Scorpio. Its ruling planet is Pluto (which also rules Scorpio). There are 12 houses in total—and on astrology charts, the houses form a wheel that maps out the sky, with planets continually transiting from one house to another. Each house represents an aspect of life, from the 1st house (which governs first impressions, new beginnings, and your perception of yourself) to the 12th house (which governs mental and spiritual health). In most astrology systems, the 1st house begins on the zodiac sign situated on the eastern horizon when you were born, with the rest of the houses continuing in a counterclockwise circle across the sky."

[13] X Research source Jupiter in the 8th house also has a few favorable sign placements (meaning its positive effects may be amplified based on which zodiac sign Jupiter was placed in at the time of your birth). These sign placements include: Cancer-Jupiter. Jupiter is exalted in Cancer, meaning Cancer is where it reaches its maximum power and influence. This placement blesses you with wisdom, knowledge, empathy, creativity, and enhanced mental capabilities! Sagittarius-Jupiter. Jupiter is at home in Sagittarius; thus, this placement gives you determination, willpower, and a keen interest in spiritualism and travel. Pisces-Jupiter. This placement enhances your virtues and sense of morality, encouraging you to help others in need while blessing you with popularity and a good reputation. Capricorn-Jupiter. Jupiter’s fall is in the sign of Capricorn, meaning this is an awkward astrological fit. However, that can be a good thing: this position creates hardship, but it turns you into a hardworking person capable of overcoming limits and restrictions.
