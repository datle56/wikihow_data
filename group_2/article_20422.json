As long as you match the majority of the job specifications, apply for the job. If you really need a job fast, apply more widely. This doesn't mean that you should apply for jobs you are totally unqualified for, but think outside the box when considering what jobs you are qualified for. The skills we have from one position can always translate into a variety of other, slightly different, jobs. You may also consider applying for jobs outside of your geographic location or outside of your desired shift hours. No job is perfect, but having a job is usually better than no job."

It's easiest to use the pre-formatted resume templates that come with all modern word-processing software. This will allow you to simply input the information and not worry about menial and frustrating formatting issues. Remember, however, that these templates may need to be customized to suit the job you are applying to. A resume should list all your relevant experience. It's important to think creatively about what experiences and skills could be considered relevant, but you should also use caution when listing experience that could be deemed irrelevant. It has to be a happy medium. It's a good idea to write a brief, 2-3 sentence career summary at the top of your resume. This will help employers quickly identify your skill set and whether or not you're a good fit for the role. [1] X Expert Source Katrina Georgiou Career Coach Expert Interview. 25 June 2020.

Cover letters should accomplish several things, distinguishing you from other applicants and illustrating your personal value as a future employee. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Use professional and formal language, as well as form, when composing your cover letter. Start your letter with a formal greeting. The job listing may tell you who to address applications to. If not, feel free to address your letter to \"whom it may concern\" or to the company or job search committee in general. Start the body of your letter with an engaging line that tells the reader who you are, what you are applying for, and why you should get the job. The beginning of the letter should help you stand out from the crowd but not rely on humor or cheap tricks. Conclude your letter by restating your interest in the job and why you think you would be a perfect fit. It may be tempting to reuse letters, especially when you are applying for a bunch of jobs, but be sure to individualize every cover letter you submit to the job you are applying for. For instance, if you are looking for a managerial position, you want to tailor your resume for jobs of that nature. However, if you are also seeking a position that is not in management but in the same field, highlight your experience within that role as opposed to your managerial skills."

When asked these kinds of questions, make sure to give specific examples that show how you've mastered these kinds of skills in your previous positions.

When asked, \"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\" if you don't answer with a position slightly above your job title, it will look like you don't really have interest in the job.
