However, even with the best of care, most people's hairlines are bound to thin some as they age.

Shampooing the hair places stress on the hair and follicles and can speed up thinning. You only need to shampoo your hair 2–3 times per week. On other days, give your hair a quick rinse to keep it clean. When you do shampoo your hair, lather it up slowly with gentle movements to avoid tearing out hairs. Rinse the shampoo out using warm to lukewarm water. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you’re buying shampoo, look for a gentle shampoo that clears your pores without the use of harsh chemicals. Herbal shampoos are especially beneficial. Look for ones containing chamomile, aloe vera, ginseng, horsetail, rosemary, biotin, cysteine, proteins, silica, and vitamin E, or make an herbal shampoo yourself. Check the ingredients and make sure that your shampoo does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate. This is a fairly common ingredient in many commercially produced shampoos, but it can cause already weakened hair to further shrink and break. Avoid using scented shampoos, which often contain aggressive chemicals that can harm your hairline."

Hair that remains properly moisturized will be stronger, thicker, and less likely to break.
