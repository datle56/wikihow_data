      "content": "Know what clothing betas are worth. Clothing betas are clothing items that were released during the beta testing period of the game, which lasted from July to September 2010. They're commonly traded for den betas, which are rarer and are a step up to getting a spike. Clothing betas include: Rare Fox Hat. They're worth a quarter of a den beta (meaning you can usually trade four of them for one den beta) or 8-10 Rare Item Monday items. The Freedom Fox Hat and Fluffy Fox Head are not clothing betas. Worn Blanket. They're worth a quarter of a den beta, except for the black version, which is worth 3-4 den betas. The Rare Item Monday, Leap Year, and Spring versions are not clothing betas, but the Rare Item Monday version (light blue) is still worth 4-5 other Rare Item Monday items, and the Leap Year (bright purple) version is worth a blue long collar. Rare Bow and Arrows. They're worth a quarter of a den beta. This excludes the Rare Friendship Bow, which is not a clothing beta. Non-rare Bow and Arrows are not clothing betas, but are still worth a few Rare Item Monday items. Flower Crown. The colored versions are worth one den beta, while the black, white, and Rare Item Monday versions are worth 1-2 den betas (possibly more). The Jamaaliday and Freedom versions are not clothing betas. Jamaaliday Bow. The colored versions are worth one den beta, the black version is worth three den betas, and the white version is worth 3-4 den betas. The Rare Big Bow is not a clothing beta, but is worth 4-6 Rare Item Monday items. Cupid Wings (non-glossy). These are worth one den beta."

Good choices for adventures to play include: Return of the Phantoms - This is a non-member adventure, but there is an Arctic Wolf passage, allowing you to possibly get two rare items in one adventure. When played on Hard Mode, you can get prizes like Bow and Arrows (the raspberry-colored Bow and Arrows included), Pirate Swords, Worn Blankets, rare Fox Hats, and more. The Phantom Portal - This is another non-member adventure with a Lion and Fox passage, allowing you to get three rare items in one adventure! This adventure rewards Worn Blankets, Pirate Swords, Bow and Arrows, Slingshots, and even rare Fox Hats if played on Hard Mode. If played on Easy Mode, though, this adventure only gives Crystals, Explorer Crates, Phantom Pipes, and Gems. The Forgotten Desert - This is a members-only adventure and is also the only adventure that actually rewards Spiked Wristbands. It no longer rewards Spiked Collars. Getting one from this adventure is especially rare, but den and clothing betas are rewarded more often. Items such as these could be used to get actual rare Spiked Collars and Spiked Wristbands!"

Be sure to buy new items, Diamond shop Items, items that are leaving soon or are on clearance, etc."

Non-member den betas are worth more than member-only den betas, as they came out earlier. Walls and floors (except for Wood Floor and Tan Carpet) are worth less than any other den betas. Den betas include Small Table, Orange Mat, Blue Mat, Rocking Horse, Gecko Plushie, Basket of Candy, Globe, Scarecrow, Fly Trap, and Traffic Cone. These are worth 25-30 Rare Item Monday items or 5-6 clothing betas each. Porch Swing (2011 version), Television, Open Sign, Art Easel, Robot, Bubblegum Machine, Zios Sculpture, and RC Car. These are worth 20 Rare Item Monday items or four clothing betas each. Yellow Sweets, Spaceship Gray, Planet Walls, Pink Forest Walls, Flower Carpet, Blue Vines, Blue Shag Carpet, and Moon Dirt. These are usually all worth 10-15 Rare Item Monday items or 1-2 clothing betas each, but some players don't consider these den betas. Red Brick Walls. These are worth a little more than other walls (two clothing betas), but are also sometimes not considered a den beta. Wood Floor. This is worth a bad-decent short collar or 5-6 other den betas. Tan Carpet. This is worth a good short wristband-bad long wristband or 2-3 other den betas. Cami's Frog. This is worth a decent long wristband or three other den betas. The Claw. This is worth a bad long wristband or 2-3 other den betas. Pot O' Gems and Mira Statue. These are usually worth 20 Rare item Monday items or four clothing betas each, but some players see these as fake den betas"

When trading, it's important to know what you should be looking for. \"Short\" spikes are collars or wristbands with shorter spiked edges. \"Long\" spikes are collars or wristbands with longer spiked edges and shorter spiked edges in between the longer ones. These are worth more than short spikes. \"Bad\" spikes are spikes with the least valuable colors, which are orange and green. Green is only very slightly better than orange. \"Decent\" spikes are spikes with somewhat more valuable colors, which are yellow and pink. Yellow and pink are usually seen as equal, but some players may consider yellow \"bad\" rather than \"decent.\" \"Good\" spikes are spikes with average rarity, which are blue, red, purple, and black. However, blue may be considered \"decent\" rather than \"good\" to some players, and some players consider black spikes to be their own category rather than \"good.\""

Usually, smaller Animal Jam YouTubers with less subscribers give you a larger chance of winning, due to less fans entering their giveaways. Watch the whole video, as watching the entire video will help you to understand the rules and who is currently in the lead and when the giveaway will end. Consider joining giveaways in livestreams by \"somewhat\" popular players. They usually give away better items, but you also have less of a chance of winning."
