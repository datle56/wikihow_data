      "content": "High Valyrian is a fictional language in the Game of Thrones series . Within the GOT universe, High Valyrian is an ancient language primarily associated with the Targaryen family, who originally came to Westeros from the Valyrian Freehold. The Valyrian Freehold was a great civilization that fell into ruin hundreds of years before the start of the show, so by the time the story takes place, very few people speak High Valyrian. [1] X Research source There is also a language called “Low Valyrian” in Game of Thrones, which is meant to have evolved from High Valyrian after it fell out of use. Most of the characters in the series speak the “Common Tongue,” which sounds like the English language to the viewer."

      "title": "No, High Valyrian isn’t a real language.",
      "content": "No, High Valyrian isn’t a real language. It’s a fictional language that was created by George R. R. Martin, the author of the Song of Ice and Fire book series, and linguist David J. Peterson. [2] X Research source Peterson expanded upon the High Valyrian phrases in Martin’s novels in order to create a full, authentic-sounding language for the TV show. This makes High Valyrian a “conlang,” or a “constructed language,” which means that it was intentionally made up by someone, rather than evolving naturally. [3] X Research source Peterson has stated that Latin and Greek have some similar sounds to those found in High Valyrian. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Although High Valyrian is a made-up language, it does function like a real one. Thanks to the work of Peterson, High Valyrian features many of the characteristics associated with real languages and it follows a consistent set of grammatical rules, which gives it an authentic sound. In fact, High Valyrian is such a complete language that people can actually learn it and become fluent in it, and there’s even a Duolingo course for this purpose! [5] X Research source Here are some of the traits that make High Valyrian sound so “real”: High Valyrian has different noun cases, just like real languages. The 8 different cases in the language are: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, comitative, and vocative. It also has different grammatical genders (not related to biological sex), similar to Spanish or French. There are four in total: lunar, solar, terrestrial, and aquatic. [6] X Research source High Valyrian is a “head-final” language, like Japanese. This means that within sentence structures, the head of the phrase comes after its complements (a noun comes after its adjectives, for example). [7] X Research source"

Since the Targaryen family originally came from the Valyrian Freehold, they brought the language of High Valyrian with them and continued to speak it, but mainly to each other. As a consequence, High Valyrian was spoken in Westeros between the Targaryens, but other Westerosi people didn’t typically speak it."
