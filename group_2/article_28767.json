      "title": "Buy or use an old pleated skirt if possible.",
      "content": "Buy or use an old pleated skirt if possible. Making a pleated skirt from scratch can be very difficult to do properly, as pleats are a complicated sewing procedure. If you don't have one of your own, you can purchase one from a school uniform store or large department store like Walmart. Even if it’s not technically a “cheerleader” skirt, many school uniforms still call for pleated skirts. If you don't want to spend money on a new skirt, visit consignment stores in your area. These skirts are worn by students of all ages — from kindergarten through high school. You may be able to find an outgrown or unneeded pleated skirt that fits you for a fraction of the original price."

      "title": "Take your measurements.",
      "content": "Take your measurements. [1] X Research source You will need two basic measurements for this skirt: waist and length. Wear whatever undergarments you'll be wearing with your costume, but don't take these measurements over other clothes. Waist: Decide where you want the skirt's waistband to sit. Most cheerleader skirts reach fairly high up, to around the navel. Use a measuring tape to measure your waist at that level, holding it snugly. Make sure not to suck your stomach in, so the skirt won't be too tight while you're wearing it. Make a mark with a pen or sticker to mark your chosen waistline on your body. Length: Measure from the mark or sticker on your waistline to wherever you want the skirt to fall on your leg."

      "title": "Cut your fabric.",
      "content": "Cut your fabric. You can purchase fabric at many craft and design stores. The length of the fabric should be your length measurement, plus an inch or so for the hem and waistband. For the width, multiply the waist measurement by three (to allow for the pleats), then add 2 inch for the seam and zipper. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hem the bottom of the skirt",
      "content": "Hem the bottom of the skirt . If you wait until after you’ve turned the flat fabric into a tubular skirt and created the pleats, hemming the bottom of the skirt will be very difficult. Your hem measurement should be about 1 cm above the bottom edge of the fabric. Using a pencil, make light marks all along the fabric to show where the hem should fall. Make accurate 1 cm measurements throughout, so your hem will be even. Fold the bottom of the fabric up so the edge just touches the marks you’ve made on the inside of the skirt. Pin the fabric into place with sewing pins. Either thread a needle and sew the hemline by hand or use your sewing machine to create your hem."

      "title": "Mark your seam allowance.",
      "content": "Mark your seam allowance. Once you’ve hemmed the bottom of the fabric, lay it out flat with the hem pointing toward you. The left and right sides of the fabric, from this position, will be the edges that are sewn together to form the seam of the skirt. You’ve given yourself 2 inches of extra width, so measure 1” on each edge (left and right) of the fabric and mark your seam allowance with a pencil. Just as with the hem markings, make a series of accurate measurements from the top to bottom of the fabric to give yourself a line you can follow later. [3] X Research source Mark a vertical line down the midpoint of the fabric’s width at this point as well. To find the midpoint, measure the entire width of the fabric and divide it by half. Mark your vertical line at that half-measurement. All marks should be made on the “inside” of the skirt."

    {
      "title": "Mark your pleats.",
      "content": "Mark your pleats. [4] X Research source Measuring from the left seam allowance mark (not the edge of the fabric), make a pleat mark every 3 inches until you reach the end of the fabric. Look at the pleat marks you’ve made, and think of them as falling in a 1-2-3, 1-2-3 pattern. Place a pin through each “1” pleat mark at the un-hemmed top edge of the fabric. Pull the 1” seam and zipper allowance on the right side of the fabric down and pin it out of the way."

This creates a pinned pleat. Repeat this process by pinching the fabric at the third pin (1-3) and pulling it over to pin 1-4. Remove pin 1-3 and pin the fabric into place at that spot with pin 1-4. Continue doing this until you reach the edge of your fabric."

Just as with the hemline, you can either sew this by hand with a needle or use a sewing machine if you have one. Just make sure to sew in the opposite direction in which you created your pleats to make sure your pleats don’t bunch up."

Sew down each pleat in a straight line from waistline to the 2” mark to create a fitted waistline at the top of the skirt. Otherwise, the skirt will flow more like an A-line skirt."

      "title": "Make a waistband.",
      "content": "Make a waistband. [8] X Research source Measure the width of the top edge of your skirt and cut out another piece of fabric in this width. The length should be the thickness of your desired waistband (an inch to 1.5 inches should suffice) multiplied by 2. Fold this fabric in half along its vertical axis so you have a wide piece of fabric folded over to half its length. The “inside” of the fabric should be facing out. Sew the two long edges of the fabric together with a needle or sewing machine. When you’ve finished, turn the fabric right-side-out like you would with a sock. This will be the waistband for the top of your skirt. Iron this flat as well."

Unpin the seam allowance that you tucked away earlier. Arrange it so the raw edge of seam allowance lines up with the raw edge on the other side of the skirt fabric. [9] X Research source Pin those two raw edges together down the entire length of the seam allowance. The extra seam allowance should still extend out to the side of the pins. Lay the zipper along the seam allowance where it will be inserted, then mark where the bottom of the zipper ends."

Make sure the zipper’s teeth are lined up with the seam, and that the zipper is facing outward. When you pin the zipper into place, you should be looking at the inside fabric of the skirt and the back of the zipper. The pins should all be on one side of the zipper — either the left or the right. Sew down the unpinned length of the zipper. Then, remove the pins and sew up that side. Then, turn the skirt right-side-out. Snip through the loose stitches you created along the top of the skirt to reveal the zipper."

The easiest way to accomplish this is with snap fasteners that can be purchased online or at any arts and crafts store. They can also be called “press studs.” Simply sew them into place using needle and thread. Be sure that they’re placed properly so they close neatly. With this final step, you’ve created your own pleated cheerleader skirt!"

For two-color pom poms, buy two tablecloths — one in each of your desired colors. You will also need a pair of scissors, electrical or duct tape, and a ruler. You can find these materials in the party section in grocery stores or at most party or dollar stores. You can also buy premade pom poms if you don't want to make them yourself."

Remove it from its packaging and arrange it so that the cloth is folded in half. It should have a large width and short height. Cut along the folded end to separate the fabric into two pieces. Keeping the two pieces in place, fold them over again so you’re looking at 4 layers of fabric that are the same width, but even shorter in height.

Lay a ruler down perpendicular to the tape so that it creates a straight line down to the edge of the fabric on one side. Cut along the ruler up to the tape, but don’t cut through the tape.
