      "content": "A jeweler can handle the sizing for you with another ring for reference. This is one of the most effective ways to sneakily check her size, because you’re going off of a ring that she already wears and you’re getting the help of a professional. [1] X Expert Source Nicole Wegman Jewelry Professional & Founder of Ring Concierge Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. That being said, you should be careful that the ring you choose definitely fits her well and is worn on her ring finger. Plus, you’ll need to choose a ring that she won’t notice is missing. [2] X Research source A properly fitted ring will slide over the knuckle with only a bit of struggle, then sit snugly at the base of the finger without causing pain or tingling. [3] X Expert Source Nicole Wegman Jewelry Professional & Founder of Ring Concierge Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. When trying to find a ring she won't miss, you need to avoid accidentally picking a ring that she doesn't wear because it doesn't fit. Ask her how this ring feels. Or, admire it up close. While you do this, subtly check that it twists but isn’t loose enough to slide off her knuckle."

      "content": "Your own finger can be a great reference to compare to your girlfriend's. If you have a moment alone with her rings, try on one that you know she wears on her ring finger. You may find that it fits perfectly (jackpot!). Or, you may need to get creative. Slide the ring as far down on your finger as possible, then mark the ring's final location on your finger with a marker. Show the jeweler your marking and her ring, and they may be able to get an accurate sizing. If you can't get ahold of one of her rings, simply compare your finger sizes. This won't be an exact science, but it can get you in the right range. When your hands are next to each other, take a moment to consider your ring fingers' size difference. Is your finger's circumference much larger than hers? If that's the case, recall your ring size. Your girlfriend's ring size will be smaller than yours. Your jeweler can help you figure out an approximate size."

      "content": "There’s a good chance that people close to her know her size already. The downside here is that you may need to let your girlfriend’s mom, sister, or pal in on your plans. The upside is that you avoid big stunts and she’s less likely to find out. Even if the person you choose doesn’t know, they may know someone who does. “Hey! So I don’t want you to freak out, but I need Thelma's ring size. It’s really important that you don’t tell anyone just yet. Do you know it? Or if you don’t, do you know someone who would?”"

      "content": "When a friend asks, your girlfriend will be unlikely to tie it back to you. Pick one of your girlfriend’s pals that you know you can trust. Let her in on your plans and emphasize the importance of keeping everything under wraps. Ask her if she has ideas to get your girlfriend’s ring size or suggest a few you think would work well yourself: [4] X Research source “Take her shopping and try on rings together. Admire a couple she wears up close and subtly check how they fit. Make sure you remember the size.” “Ask to try on her ring. Casually ask her size to compare it to yours. ‘What size are you? If you're an 8 and I'm a 6, it makes sense that it's loose.’”"

      "content": "By having your girlfriend try on your friend's ring, you can ballpark her size. Get the help of an engaged or married friend and invite them over for dinner and drinks. As the good times roll, your pal can ask your girlfriend to try on her dazzling engagement ring just for fun. The two of you can gauge whether it's a close fit to get in a ballpark range. You may even luck out with a ring that fits perfectly. [5] X Research source Unless you get a perfect fit, this method may not get you the exact sizing. But being in close range is valuable. Afterward, you can always narrow things down using another strategy. For example, you could ask a friend of your girlfriend's to try on rings with her. Combined with the info you already have, this can help you zero in on her exact size."

Maybe your little sister is graduating from college or your mom’s birthday is coming up. You could even claim that a friend she doesn’t know is proposing to their girlfriend! [6] X Research source “Hey! Could I borrow your finger for a second? I’m trying to buy a ring for my sister, but I have no idea what size to get. You guys have got to be similar.” “You remember Sarah? She’s proposing to her girlfriend. But she needs to subtly get her ring size. I told her I’d grab yours for reference.”"

      "content": "Dummy rings can reliably (but secretly) help find her ring size. There are tons of different reasons you may have “found” or “won” a cheap ring that you want her to wear. You could’ve earned it at an arcade, found it on the ground, or bought it at the gas station because you thought she’d like it. Make sure that you know the ring's size before you give it to your girlfriend and observe carefully when she tries it on. Determine whether the fit is loose, tight, or just right. [7] X Research source Make sure your ring doesn't have an adjustable band. If your ring has one, it will make it impossible to gauge her size from it."

      "content": "You can ask for her size in conversation as long as you have a solid cover. When you ask a question for a funny reason or in a joking way, it helps to kick suspicion. Ask yourself whether or not this strategy is likely to work in your relationship. Is your girlfriend already suspicious about the proposal? Is silly banter common in your relationship? Are you a good liar? If you're confident you can pull it off, look for opportunities to joke about your girlfriend's ring size or plan a joke ahead of time. [8] X Research source “Wow, look at this finger. Who’d have thought that was a size 105. Oh, those don’t exist? Prove it. What size is your finger then?” “I heard your ring size is actually a tenth of your foot’s length, every time. I’m serious! You don’t believe me? Fine, let’s test it on you.” “I read that people who love coffee have smaller fingers. The only way to know for sure is to test it out, and you’re the perfect candidate.”"

If you're not positive that you have the right size, don't stress. Your jeweler can let you know if your ring choice will be easy to resize. [9] X Expert Source Nicole Wegman Jewelry Professional & Founder of Ring Concierge Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. For most standard rings, resizing is a simple, doable process. Just make sure you're aware of the ring types that can't be resized: [10] X Research source Quartz, wood, tungsten, rose gold, and titanium rings Rings with gemstones all around the band Rings with tension settings"
