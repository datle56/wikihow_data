Before installing SKSE, you need your copy of Skyrim to be registered with your computer (and have all the necessary game folders and files in place so you can mod them later). So, open up Steam (or GOG) and launch the game if you haven’t already. You don’t have to do anything else here; launching the game and then closing it is enough! You can skip this step if you’ve already launched Skyrim at least once."

Just remember: SKSE doesn’t support Windows Store or Epic Games Store copies of Skyrim . Make sure you’re downloading the correct version for your game; the options include: [1] X Research source Anniversary Edition (AE) build. Download this if you’re using the latest version of Skyrim on Steam. Currently, that means game version 1.6.1170. GOG Anniversary Edition (AE) build. Download this if you’re playing Skyrim AE on GOG (rather than Steam). Currently, that’s game version 1.6.1179. Special Edition (SE) build. Download this if you aren’t using the Anniversary Edition upgrade; if you’re playing SE, your game version is 1.5.97. Classic build. Download this if you’re using the original, classic version of Skyrim (with no Legendary Edition, Special Edition, or Anniversary Edition upgrades). VR build. Download this if you’re playing Skyrim VR (Virtual Reality). If you don’t know what edition you’re using, navigate to your Skyrim game folder and right-click on the game executable. Select Properties → Details and check the edition under “Product version.”"
