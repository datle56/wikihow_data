It will also help cut down on them reaching out to you, which will tempt you to talk to them. Avoiding contact with them gives you space to process the complex emotions you have after the breakup. [1] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I need time to process, so don't expect to hear from me for a while.\" Be vague about how long you want to stay no-contact. If your ex asks, just be honest and say something like \"I don't know—I just need some time to myself to regroup.\" Avoid giving them an exact date or telling them it's temporary. They'll miss you more if they don't know that they'll hear from you in a month or two."

In the immediate aftermath of a breakup, it's not a good idea to make any important life decisions—and getting involved in another relationship is an important life decision. You need some time to sort out your emotions so you can think with a clear head. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source How long do you need? You'll see people say \"30 days\" or \"6 weeks\"—the truth is, the process is different for every person and every relationship, but these can serve as guidelines. Coming up with a time limit at first will help make it easier for you to handle not reaching out to your ex because it's just a temporary thing. After a couple of weeks, though, you'll likely get used to not talking to them. Mathews agrees that \"even if your instinct is to reach back out after a couple of days or a couple of weeks, hold on, do not do that prematurely, because your chances of actually getting the person back\" are much greater if you wait for the flood of emotions that follows a breakup to subside.

Schewitz notes that \"there is a true grieving process that happens in a breakup just like if you lost somebody to death... so let yourself feel it.\" [4] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019."

      "content": "Adjust the rule if you have to be in contact with each other. If you and your ex work or go to school together, or if you have children together, complete no-contact might not make sense. This might also be the case if you happen to run into each other in public and can't avoid interacting. Just adjust the rule so that it suits your situation, keeping the following in mind: [5] X Research source Let your ex know that you only want to talk to them for specific reasons. For example, you might say, \"Don't call or text me unless it's something about the kids.\" Don't initiate conversations with your ex unless it's for a logistical reason or is related to the reason you can't go complete no-contact (such as a work-related reason). If they contact you, be polite but firm and keep your response brief. You might want to remind them that you don't want to be in contact with them right now. If they start to talk personally and you're not ready for that, immediately end the conversation. You might say, \"I appreciate your concern, but I'm not ready to talk to you about that yet.\""

      "content": "Stop all contact with your ex. \"No contact\" doesn't just mean talking to your ex directly—it also includes less direct methods of communication, such as social media. Block your ex on social media and you'll find it much easier to resist the urge to post things that are intended as a message for your ex. You might even tell mutual friends that you don't want to hear anything about your ex for a while. [6] X Research source If you're using the more standard form of no-contact, you don't have a personal relationship with your ex at all—it's almost as though you pretend they don't exist for a while. For Schewitz, though, this doesn't have to be so strict. She feels that it's fine if you \"need to reach out every once in a while.\" [7] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019."

      "content": "Post actively on social media about your new life. Don't shy away from posting pics and updates from all the activities you're doing and social events you're attending. If you and your ex haven't blocked each other, it's possible they'll see these posts and start to miss you a little—especially if your life seems fun-filled and exciting! Even if you have blocked each other, it's likely they'll hear about all the things you've been doing through mutual friends. If you're worried that your ex will forget about you and move on during the no-contact period, lean on mutual friends to remind them of you from time to time. At the same time, Mathews cautions you to \"just check your motivation [and] do what you want to do because you want to do it, not because you think it's going to elicit a certain response from somebody else.\" [9] X Expert Source Suzanna Mathews Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. Schewitz is more open about the idea of intentionally posting something to make your ex jealous: \"Is it your best moment? Probably not. Is it gonna kill or hurt anyone? Probably not that big of a deal. To make you feel better, as long as you're not hurting somebody in the process, I don't think it's the end of the world, but certainly not the most mature way to go about it.\" [10] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019."

The process of recovering from a breakup isn't linear—there will probably be times when you're pretty upset with your ex and are tempted to complain to your friends or online. But these words could get back to your ex and if you want to get back together with them, you don't want them to think you're still mad at them. [11] X Research source You don't have to praise your ex if that doesn't feel authentic. You don't have to lie about how you feel about them either. Just try to keep a positive outlook to it. For example, if someone asks if you're still friends with your ex, you might say, \"I'm taking some time to myself right now, but I'm open to a potential friendship in the future.\" This is especially important if you and your ex have children together. It can be really harmful for kids to hear one of their parents badmouthing the other. [12] X Research source"

If you feel confident in yourself and also feel like it's worth giving that relationship another shot, reach out to them and let them know. For example, you might say, \"Hey, I was just thinking about you. It's been a while. Feel like grabbing coffee somewhere and catching up?\" If you don't feel like you're ready, it's fine to extend the no-contact period (even indefinitely). Schewitz notes that it's different for everyone, but if \"you haven't figured out why this happened for you and not to you, you're still kind of in a victim mentality.\" [13] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019.

      "content": "Bring up the relationship in person. Don't try to talk to your ex about the breakup until the two of you are face-to-face. When you do bring it up, don't rehash the arguments you had at the end of your relationship. Instead, own up to your part in the demise of the relationship and let your ex know that you'd like to try to start again, if that's what you want to do. [14] X Expert Source Suzanna Mathews Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. Mathews recommends that you come from a place of \"some growth and some reflection\" so that you're \"able to speak to what would be different\" because otherwise, \"you're just going to fall into the same old patterns.\" [15] X Expert Source Suzanna Mathews Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. For example, you might say, \"I've been thinking about everything that happened towards the end of our relationship and I just want you to know that I'm sorry. I know that I was at least partially to blame and I have some ideas to fix those issues.\" Keep it kind of vague at first to give them room to ask you questions about it and open up. When they talk, listen actively to what they're saying. Remember—they'll be more receptive to giving the relationship another shot if they feel heard. Showing that you're willing to own your contribution to the breakup will likely encourage them to take responsibility for their own part. This enables the two of you to heal together."
