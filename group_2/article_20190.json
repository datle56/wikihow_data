      "content": "Direct your Sim to stargaze as soon as it gets dark. At 7 PM, the sun will go down. Once this happens, click on the telescope and choose Stargaze . [2] X Research source Don't pick \"Look Through\" on the telescope. This is the option that comes up during the day, and it carries no chance of abduction (and you'll likely get an angry neighbor running into your house and shoving you if you use it). There's no specific timeframe for abductions. A Sim can be abducted at any time during the night as long as they're stargazing. Certain hours don't raise or lower the chances."

      "title": "Keep them stargazing the entire night, if possible.",
      "content": "Keep them stargazing the entire night, if possible. The longer your Sim stargazes, the higher the chance of abduction is. However, if they stop for any reason and then start again, the chance of abduction resets. If your Sim's motives decline too much, press Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + C , type boolprop testingcheatsenabled true , and hit ↵ Enter . Hold down ⇧ Shift , click on the mailbox, click *House... , and choose Make All Happy . If you have Nightlife, Open For Business, or Pets, you can use maxmotives to fill your Sim's motives and motivedecay off to freeze their motives in place. However, this will affect every Sim in the household, not just the stargazing one."

If you have FreeTime, Sims whose primary aspiration is Knowledge can purchase the Summon Aliens aspiration benefit, which will significantly raise the chance of alien abduction. This can be used at any time of day to get your Sim abducted, and can also be used with any telescope. [4] X Research source Go to your Sim's Inventory tab. It's the one that looks like a treasure chest. Open the Aspiration Rewards section. (It'll have your Sim's aspiration icon next to a treasure chest.) Open the Lifetime Aspiration Benefits window. This is the icon with two Sims and a treasure chest, next to the buyable aspiration rewards. Click on all the rewards in the Knowledge column. These rewards are \"Slower Need Decay - Social and Fun\", \"Impart Knowledge\", \"Eureka!\", and \"Summon Aliens\". Click on the telescope and choose Summon Aliens . Your Sim will walk over to the telescope, shine a light through the eyepiece, and be abducted soon afterwards."
