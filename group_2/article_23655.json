Do an easier version of the exercise you will be doing for the workout, such as running, swimming, or cycling. [2] X Research source Marching in place or walking at a comfortable pace are great ways to warm up your body for any workout. If you’re going to be swimming laps, then you could warm up with 5 minutes of treading water or a slow-paced breaststroke."

After you have warmed up, begin your intervals by doing your preferred form of exercise, such as running, swimming, or biking. Time yourself exercising at 90 to 95% of your maximum capacity for 4 minutes. This should feel difficult, but not painful or uncomfortable. Calculate your target heart rate and then check your pulse after your first interval for more certainty that you are in the 90 to 95% range. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you find it easy to hold a conversation while you are doing the interval, then work harder. Increase your speed or add resistance, such as by increasing the incline on a treadmill or riding your bike up a hill. [4] X Expert Source Kyle Kenny Master Trainer & Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 2 November 2021. If you’re doing an exercise where you cannot add resistance, such as swimming or dancing, then pick up the pace until you are working at 90 to 95%."

You can simply do an easier version of the exercise you just did, such as biking at a moderate pace on a flat surface, swimming at a slower pace, or walking.

After you finish the first interval, do another 4 minute interval at 90 to 95% of your maximum capacity followed by a 3 minute period of active rest. Exercise at a moderate pace while you do the 3 minutes of active rest. Then, repeat the process twice more. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you struggled to sustain 4 minutes of high-intensity exercise, only do 2 or 3 minutes of high-intensity exercise instead."

Do this interval a total of 3 to 4 times for a great Vo2 workout.
