      "content": "Looksmaxxing is a viral trend focused on improving one’s appearance. According to “looksmaxxing,” your physical attractiveness gives you a step up in life. People who participate in looksmaxxing (mainly young men) strive to improve their appearance through things like bodybuilding, skincare, and even surgery in hopes of gaining better social status. [1] X Research source The term itself uses a popular slang suffix, “-maxxing,” which is used to describe an effort to maximize or perfect some aspect of yourself—in this case, looks."

      "content": "There are different degrees, or “levels,” of looksmaxxing. The practice has many different aspects. “Softmaxxing” refers to less invasive habits like bodybuilding, skincare, and styling. “Hardmaxxing” is much more extreme, and includes things like plastic surgery, facial implants, extreme fasting (“starvemaxxing”), and other more permanent, potentially hazardous activities. The community also uses other specialized vocab to discuss physical flaws, like “canthal tilt” (angle of the eyes), “interpupillary distance” (distance between them), and “mewing” (a tongue exercise said to improve your jawline).

      "content": "Looksmaxxing started in 2015 on niche internet forums. The concept itself began on sites like Lookism.net and Incels.me. Both are sites that serve as discussion boards for self-professed “incels.” Users on these sites often advise each other on their perceived shortcomings in an effort to help each other gain social prominence and success. [3] X Research source “Incel” is short for “involuntary celibate” and describes a person who blames their own features, shortcomings, or even women for a lack of romantic success. [4] X Research source “Looksmaxxing” as term found popularity after the creation of a site called Looksmaxxing.com, which is devoted to the practice."

      "content": "There's nothing wrong with wanting to improve your appearance, but looksmaxxing is flawed. In fact, it can even be dangerous. Looksmaxxing falls into the age-old trap of holding its participants to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards that can be counterproductive to real, genuine happiness. Looksmaxxing communities often try to “help” each other by pointing out physical flaws that each person needs to change. Often, though, these “flaws” are just normal features, and are nothing to be ashamed of. And looksmaxxing isn't just hurtful and dangerous, it can also be completely off base. The participants who want to improve their romantic status, for instance, waste tons of time and effort trying to achieve physical qualities that aren't actually necessarily more attractive than the qualities they already have. This is especially true when qualities like self-awareness, kindness, and generosity are still widely reported to be some of the most attractive qualities a person can have."

      "content": "There are easier, more effective ways of improving your image. Don’t get us wrong; striving to be the best you can be is a totally worthwhile practice. But striving for an arbitrary ideal of “perfection” is a dead end, especially when simpler things like a proper diet, regular exercise, and a consistent sleep schedule are actually proven to transform not just your body, but your mind, too. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In this way, “softmaxxing” almost has the right idea. The trouble comes when you try to change yourself into another person according to what others say you should be, rather than becoming the best version of yourself. The other pitfall of looksmaxxing is the slippery slope of more and more extreme practices. In the insular looksmaxxing community, positive things like exercise can very quickly escalate into risky behaviors like eating disorders. Here's the takeaway: if you're considering looksmaxxing, you'll be way better off if you focus on genuinely getting healthier and working on your most important inner qualities too, like your empathy, passion, and kindness. Anyone who tells you that looks are objective and can be gamified, especially with unsafe practices, is either lying to you or just plain wrong. At the end of the day, you'll be a happier, healthier, more attractive version of yourself if you avoid classic \"looksmaxxing\" and lean into safer self-improvement methods."
