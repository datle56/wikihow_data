      "title": "Check the cables and that the TV is connected to a power source.",
      "content": "Check the cables and that the TV is connected to a power source. Look behind the TV and make sure that the cable going to the wall isn't damaged (showing frayed, exposed, or drastically bent wires) and that it is plugged into a good power source. Extension cords or surge protectors may provide unreliable power, so plug the TV directly into the wall outlet. If the cables look good but the TV won't power on, try plugging it into a different outlet to see if that's the source of your problem."

      "title": "Power cycle the TV.",
      "content": "Power cycle the TV. Turn off your TV and unplug it from power. While off and unplugged, press and hold the Power button on the TV for another 15 seconds so it can discharge any residual power in the capacitors. [2] X Research source Leave the TV powered off and unplugged for another 2 minutes. Once the 2 minutes have passed, plug the TV back in and turn it on to see if the issue is resolved. If not, continue to the next troubleshooting step."

      "title": "Check the backlights.",
      "content": "Check the backlights. The backlights may have malfunctioned and won't light up the screen like they should; in this case, you won't be able to see the TV screen when the red light is flashing to know if it's on or off. Luckily, you can use a flashlight to see if this is the problem. With the TV turned on, point a flashlight at the TV screen (the flashlight needs to be on). Holding the flashlight close to the screen, move it around to different areas and look for faint images. If you see something, your TV screen is still working, but the backlights are not . If you bought the TV recently, call the store you bought it from or contact Hisense for a warranty claim. If you're confident in your repair abilities, you can replace the backlights ."

You want to use different ports in case the one you're currently using is damaged and causing the red light to flash. [3] X Research source Unplug the HDMI cables and inspect them for damage. Replace any cables with visible damage. Plug undamaged cables into different HDMI ports."

      "content": "To prevent the blinking red light, regular maintenance is essential. Dust your TV using a damp (not soaking) microfiber or lint-free cloth, focusing on cleaning the vents to prevent overheating. Avoid using harsh cleaning chemicals on your TV, keep the firmware updated, and use a quality surge protector. If the TV is wall-mounted, make sure it's mounted with the appropriate unit to maximize air flow and prevent overheating. To update the firmware on your Hisense TV, go to Settings > Device Preferences ( Android TV) /System (Roku) /Support (VIDAA)/ My Fire TV or Device & Software (Fire TV) > System Update."

      "title": "The reasons for your blinking red light may vary across TV models.",
      "content": "The reasons for your blinking red light may vary across TV models. Here are some of the most common ones: 2 Blinks: This means there is a connectivity issue. However, if you can turn the TV on and there's no picture, the backlight can be malfunctioning, or you have a bad power supply. 3 Blinks: This points to the internal circuit board. Several things can cause this issue, including the motherboard capacitor being burned or an incompatibility between the TV and one of the connected devices. 4 Blinks: This points to the backlight inverter wiring. Several things can cause this issue, like ruined connections, damaged components, and issues with the T-Con board, which processes video signals from the display. 5 Blinks: This implies motherboard failure. You need to unplug the TV from the power immediately so there's no additional damage. This likely indicates that you need a new TV. 6 Blinks: This means something is wrong with the power supply board, backlight, cooling system, or internal temperature sensor. 7 Blinks: This indicates an error in the internal circuits. This includes components like the LED backlight, capacitors, and the inverter board. 8 Blinks: A Hisense TV light blinking 8 times means there's a possible hardware failure or cable connection error. 10 Blinks: This indicates an issue with the power supply, mainboard, or LED driver/strip. A blinking white light indicates that there's a software glitch or firmware-related problem that you can fix by updating your firmware."
