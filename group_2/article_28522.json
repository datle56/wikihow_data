      "content": "Twitch used to have password-protected streams, but they don't now. The theory is that a password-protected stream could feature \"adult\" content, and since that's not welcome on the platform, Twitch got rid of the feature. If you are an Affiliate or Partner with Twitch, you can set up and use a subscriber stream. This way, only your most loyal fans, subscribers, moderators, and VIPs, can tune in and watch your stream. To start this, go to your broadcaster dashboard and change the \"Audience\" to \"Subscribers.\" Finally, click to begin your stream. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "For an unlisted, but still public, stream, try making a new account. A new account has lower chances of being picked up by the algorithm that suggests streams to people. Start a stream without tags, categories, or a title so there's no information that someone could search to find your stream. Once you have a stream without any identifiers, you can grab the link and share it with your friends or family. There's no guarantee, however, that a random person won't stumble across your stream."
