      "content": "Reduce your stress levels. The body responds to stress in variety of ways. One of the ways which the body reacts to stress is by derailing the normal menstrual cycle. When a person is stressed the body releases certain chemicals. During stressful events, the hypothalamus releases cortisol. Cortisol has the effect of decreasing luteinizing hormone which causes decreased levels of progesterone and estrogen. If the levels of these hormones drop it leads to irregular menstruation, scanty menstruation or no menstruation at all. Therefore, the faster the body is relieved of stress, the earlier the normal amount of blood and the normal menstrual cycle will return. There are different ways to relieve stress such as yoga, visualization and progressive muscle relaxation."
