Please make sure that you make the part as real as possible so your model can be more advanced. The move tool will allow you to move the part by scratching the 2 lines, which moves the part upwards and left/right. The scale tool will allow you to control the size of the part. The 3 movable circles will change the overall size, width, length, etc. respectively. The rotate tool will rotate the part when its circles are touched. It will allow the part to bend in all possible directions and angles. The transform tool is an advanced version of the move, scale and rotate tools, with many more possibilities for the part. Use the material option located at the model tab to change the texture of the part. With it, you can make your model more realistic by making, for example, a wood look like wood. Use the color option located on the model tab to change the color of a part/model."
