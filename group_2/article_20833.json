      "title": "Hold your cat in your lap.",
      "content": "Hold your cat in your lap. How well you restrain your cat will play a big role in your ability to give her eye drops. One way to hold her is in your lap. When she is resting comfortably in your lap, place one of your forearms across her body to keep her in place. The length of her body should be against your abdomen. You can sit wherever is most comfortable for you—couch, chair, bed, etc. The forearm across her body should be your non-dominant arm. For example, if you are right-handed, your left forearm should lie across her body. If you think she is going to scratch, wrap her in a towel so that only her head is sticking out. [1] X Research source If you would like to sit on the floor but holding your cat in your lap won’t work, try positioning her such that she is in between your knees and unable to get away. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your cat on a table or raised surface.",
      "content": "Place your cat on a table or raised surface. It may be easier and more comfortable for you to have your cat on a surface that is about at your waist level. If the surface is a little slippery, place a towel down first so your cat has some traction under her. You can also wrap her in a towel. It may take some trial and error to determine whether holding your cat in your lap or restraining her on a table will work best."

    {
      "title": "Position your cat’s head.",
      "content": "Position your cat’s head. To give your cat eye drops, you will need to hold her head steady with your non-dominant hand. Place the thumb of this hand on one side of her jaw and your fingers on the other side. In effect, her head should be cradled firmly in your hand, with your hand under her chin. Gently, tilt her head upward to make it easier to give the eye drops."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean your cat’s eyes.",
      "content": "Clean your cat’s eyes. For the eye drops to be most effective, your cat’s eyes will need to be free of discharge. If necessary, clean your cat’s eyes by putting a small amount of sterile eyewash solution on a cotton ball and wiping around her eyes. [3] X Research source Along with the eye drops, your veterinarian would already have recommended an eyewash solution to clean your cat’s eyes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your cat’s eyelids.",
      "content": "Open your cat’s eyelids. Use the thumb of your non-dominant hand to pull down your cat’s lower eyelid. This will create a small pouch into which you can administer the eye drops. [4] X Research source Although convenient, it is not necessary for the drops to go into the pouch. The drops will disperse quickly across your cat’s eye, so you do not have to worry about placing the drops in a particular spot on her eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position the applicator tip above your cat’s eye.",
      "content": "Position the applicator tip above your cat’s eye. Hold the applicator tip about two centimeters (one inch) above your cat’s eye. It is very important that you not touch your cat’s eye with the tip. [5] X Research source Not only would this be irritating to your cat, but it would also contaminate the tip. If you’d like, aim the tip towards the pouch you created with your thumb. [6] X Research source It may help to rest the heel of your dominant hand on top of your cat’s head. This will allow you to have a steady aim of the drops and prevent you from accidentally touching your cat’s eye with the applicator tip. Place the bottle cap to the side on a clean surface. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Administer the eye drops.",
      "content": "Administer the eye drops. Squeeze the bottle and quickly dispense the prescribed number of eye drops into your cat’s eye. [8] X Research source Be careful not to dispense more than the prescribed amount. If both of her eyes need to be treated, repeat the same procedure to put drops in the other eye. If your cat seems restless and refuses to be still, consider trying again later when she is more calm. You do not want her moving around so much that you can’t get the drops into her eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your cat still.",
      "content": "Keep your cat still. Even if your cat was a willing participant in getting the eye drops, she probably will not want to stay still after you’ve finished giving her the drops. In fact, she may want to start rubbing at her eyes. It is important that you keep her restrained gently until the drops have a chance to disperse over her eyes. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not massage her eyes.",
      "content": "Do not massage her eyes. You may think that massaging your cat’s eyes will help spread the eye drops across the eyes. However, the drops will disperse quickly on their own. Your cat may enjoy having an eye massage after getting the drops, but it is not necessary from a medical standpoint."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your cat a treat.",
      "content": "Give your cat a treat. A good way to distract your cat after giving her the eye drops is to give her something tasty to eat. Your cat would love a scrumptious treat, [10] X Research source like a small piece of tuna, after the perceived indignity of receiving eye drops. You could also time the eye drop administration with mealtime so that you could reward her with a meal afterwards. [11] X Research source You will probably need to give your cat eye drops several times a day, so be judicious with your treats. You do not want her to fill up on treats each time you administer the drops."

      "title": "Watch your cat for signs of discomfort.",
      "content": "Watch your cat for signs of discomfort. Usually, eye drops are not uncomfortable for cats. If anything, your cat will blink a lot after the drops hit her eyes. However, if the drops are bothersome, she may paw at her eyes or even try to rub her face across the floor. Contact your veterinarian if your cat becomes extremely bothered after getting the eye drops."
