    {
      "title": "A lukewarm Christian is a Christian who is indifferent to God.",
      "content": "A lukewarm Christian is a Christian who is indifferent to God. Though they may consider themselves members of the church, they may not practice their faith daily. They may not feel any passion or love for Jesus Christ and doing good works, nor do they tend to feel they need anything from God. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may not think they need anything from God.",
      "content": "They may not think they need anything from God. The way they may see it, their life is set up exactly the way they want and there's nothing they need to ask him for. If this is the case, they may not feel much gratitude for what they have or appreciate how blessed they are. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may care more about material comforts than about God.",
      "content": "They may care more about material comforts than about God. As such, they may think more about staying comfortable in their personal bubble than praying, studying the Bible, and helping the less fortunate. Because they prefer their lives to remain the same, they may avoid doing anything that \"disrupts\" that sameness, like participating in more church activities. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may consider themselves holier than other Christians.",
      "content": "They may consider themselves holier than other Christians. Lukewarm Christians may compare themselves to the Christians around them and think they're better than them. They may think that because they're more successful or that they show up to church on time on Sunday, they're a better person. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Praying to God is often an afterthought or an obligation.",
      "content": "Praying to God is often an afterthought or an obligation. They may not make time to talk to God one-on-one and have an in-depth conversation with Him. When they do, they may only do it out of a sense of obligation and not out of pure love and passion for their heavenly father. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may rarely talk about their faith to anyone.",
      "content": "They may rarely talk about their faith to anyone. They might not talk about their faith on social media or in their everyday conversations, and not because they're a shy person. Instead, they may avoid it because it makes them uncomfortable – perhaps because they don't want to be rejected by the secular world. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may give little time and money to good works.",
      "content": "They may give little time and money to good works. They may give only a small amount to charity or none at all. They may also avoid volunteering to help those in need or go on missions, claiming that they're too busy or they don't have the right personality for it. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may attend church but not heed the sermons.",
      "content": "They may attend church but not heed the sermons. They have a regular seat in the pews, but their mind may wander from the pastor's words to other thoughts. While the pastor delivers new insights into the Word of God, they may be thinking about what they're going to do after church and how they can't wait until the sermon is over. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They may not believe they can feel fire for God.",
      "content": "They may not believe they can feel fire for God. In their heart, the lukewarm Christian may not believe they'll ever feel the passion other people feel for Christ or be driven to do virtuous deeds, like go on missions or become a pastor. They've been lukewarm for so long that they may have decided they aren't the type of person who can be passionate about their faith. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Jesus chastises \"lukewarm\" Christians in Revelation 3:15-16.",
      "content": "Jesus chastises \"lukewarm\" Christians in Revelation 3:15-16. In this passage, Jesus describes the wealthy church members of Laodicea as being \"neither cold nor hot,\" meaning they're not passionate in their faith but they're also not unbelievers. He says he wishes they were one or the other, and that he's going to \"spit\" them out, meaning cast them away. [10] X Research source \"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.\" Revelation 3:15-16"

      "title": "Jesus offers forgiveness to lukewarm Christians who repent.",
      "content": "Jesus offers forgiveness to lukewarm Christians who repent. In Revelation 3:19, Jesus says, \"Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.\" While being lukewarm displeases God, He assures us that if we express regret for our sinful apathy and try becoming \"hot\" for our faith, He will forgive us. [11] X Research source \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.\" Revelation 3:20"

      "title": "Ask God to forgive you and help you stop being lukewarm.",
      "content": "Ask God to forgive you and help you stop being lukewarm. Just as Jesus said He would forgive the Laodiceans for being lukewarm, He'll forgive you, too, if you sincerely repent and ask for his forgiveness. While you're at it, ask him to start a fire for him and His Word in your heart, so that you can truly please him. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn to God for all your needs, big or small.",
      "content": "Turn to God for all your needs, big or small. Even if you think you already have everything, remember that all your abundance comes from your Creator. Don't take his mercy for granted and instead, ask him for everything you need, from food to good health to the means to pay your bills. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Dedicate a special time each day to pray and read scripture.",
      "content": "Dedicate a special time each day to pray and read scripture. Use this time to communicate your needs, but also to thank God for his blessings and pour your heart out about all your worries, fears, hopes, and dreams. This is the best way to reconnect with him and light the spark of your faith. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Discuss your faith with other people.",
      "content": "Discuss your faith with other people. Talk to friends, family, and fellow church members about Christ. Join a Bible study group or start your own and have regular meetings every month. Most importantly, says church ministry expert Cameron Diamond, find a spiritual leader like a pastor who knows God better and can help you draw closer to Him."

      "title": "Participate in church instead of just attending it.",
      "content": "Participate in church instead of just attending it. Volunteer to help teach the children's Sunday School class, lead the Youth Group, or sing in the choir. Sign up for mission trips or work church sales to raise money for missions, church repairs, and local outreach. Offer to run the church's social media pages, so you can encourage other lukewarm Christians to turn back to God. [15] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Involve yourself more in acts of charity.",
      "content": "Involve yourself more in acts of charity. Diamond recommends donating 10% of your income to a verified charity (or however much you're able to spare). Organize fundraisers for charities that need more money to provide services for the needy. Volunteer at a local food drive, a homeless shelter, or a rest home."

      "title": "Believe that you can leave being \"lukewarm\" behind.",
      "content": "Believe that you can leave being \"lukewarm\" behind. God teaches us in Ephesians 4:22-24 to \"cast off\" our old selves and \"to be made new\" in the attitude of our minds. We are created to be like Him, He says, \"in true righteousness and holiness.\" If God believes you can go from lukewarm to hot, then you should, too. [16] X Research source \"You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\" Ephesians 4:22-24"
