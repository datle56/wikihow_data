      "content": "Understand the pros and cons of home birth. Up until quite recently in history, the vast majority of births occurred in the home. As of 2009, however, in the United States, only about 0.72% of all births were home births. Statistics for most other developed countries are similarly low. Despite their relative rarity in developed nations in the modern era, some pregnant people greatly prefer home births to hospital births. There are numerous reasons why a parent might choose a home birth over a hospital birth, and most home births are safe, although studies suggest home birth is associated with a higher risk of infant death, seizures, and nervous system disorders than hospital births. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Though the elevated rate of complication is still not very high in absolute terms (corresponding with only several births experiencing complications per every 1,000), undecided parents should understand that home births may be slightly more risky than hospital births. On the other hand, home births offer certain advantages that hospital births may not be able to, including: [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Greater freedom for the person in labor to move, bathe, and eat as they see fit A greater ability for the person to adjust their position during labor The comfort of familiar surroundings and faces The ability to give birth without medical assistance (like the use of painkillers), if desired The ability to meet religious or cultural expectations for birth Lower overall cost, in some situations"

      "content": "Know when home birth should not be attempted. In certain situations, births carry an increased risk of complication for the child, the parent, or both. In these situations, the health of the pregnant individual and their child outweigh any minor advantages a home birth may offer, so the birth should be carried out in a hospital, where experienced doctors and life-saving medical technology are available. Here are situations in which an expectant parent should definitely plan to give birth in a hospital: [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When the patient has any chronic health condition (diabetes, epilepsy, etc.) When the patient has undergone a C-section for a previous pregnancy If prenatal screening has revealed any health concerns for the unborn child If the patient has developed a pregnancy-associated health condition If the patient uses tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs If the patient has twins, triplets, etc. or if the child hasn't settled into a headfirst position for delivery If a birth is premature or late. In other words, don't plan a home birth before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week."

      "content": "Know the legality of home birth. Generally, home births are not prohibited by most state or national governments. In the UK, Australia, and Canada, home birth is legal, and, depending on the circumstances, the government may provide funding for it. However, the legal situation in the United States surrounding midwives is somewhat more complicated. In the United States, it is legal in all 50 states to hire a certified nurse midwife (CNM). [4] X Research source CNMs are certified nurses who usually work in hospitals—though it's rare for them to make house calls, it is legal to hire them for home births in every state. In 36 states and Washington, D.C., it is also legal to hire a direct-entry midwife or certified professional midwife (CPM). [5] X Research source Direct-entry midwives are midwives who attained their status through self-study, apprenticeship, etc. and are not required to be a nurse or doctor. CPMs are certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). CPMs are not required to carry insurance and are not subject to peer review."

      "content": "Make arrangements with a doctor or midwife. It's highly recommended that you have a certified midwife or doctor accompany you for your home birth. Make plans to have the midwife or doctor come to your home well in advance: meet and discuss your birth with them before your labor is likely to begin, and keep their number on hand so you can call if your labor begins unexpectedly. The Mayo Clinic also recommends making sure the doctor or midwife has easy access to the consultation of doctors at a nearby hospital, if possible. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may also want to consider finding or hiring a doula—someone who provides continuous physical and emotional support throughout labor. Wellness coach Giselle Baumet advises, “Since at home you have fewer options for pain medications, I recommend that you take a comprehensive course that includes the process of birth, how to cope with contractions, breathing and relaxation techniques, breastfeeding, and how to care for yourself during postpartum.” [7] X Expert Source Giselle Baumet Mindset & Wellness Coach Expert Interview. 1 November 2021."

      "content": "Decide on a plan for your childbirth experience. Giving birth is an emotionally and physically draining experience, to put it lightly. The last thing you'll want to do during labor, when you may be in intense distress, is to have to make quick, important decisions about the way the birth will proceed. It's far smarter to create and review an approximate plan for your birth well before you enter labor. Try to account for every step of your delivery, from beginning to end. Even if you're not able to follow your plan exactly, having the plan will likely give you peace of mind. In your plan, try to answer questions like the following ones: [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Besides the doctor/midwife, which people, if any, do you want present for the birth? Where do you plan to deliver? Note that, for much of your labor, you will be able to move around for comfort. What supplies should you plan on having? Talk to your doctor; usually, you'll want lots of extra towels, sheets, pillows, and blankets, plus waterproof coverings for the bed and floor. How will you manage the pain? Will you use medical painkillers, the Lamaze technique, or another form of pain management?"

However, as with every birth, there is always a small chance that things can go wrong which threaten the health of the child and/or parent. Because of this, it's important to be prepared to rush the birth giver to a hospital in the event of an emergency.

Though you'll be able to adjust your position and even walk around for most of your labor, it's a good idea to have a place in your home set aside as the final site of childbirth. Choose a safe, comfortable spot—many birth givers prefer their own bed, but it's possible to give birth on sofas or even on a soft part of the floor. Regardless of the location you choose, make sure that, by the time labor begins, it's been recently-cleaned and it's well-stocked with towels, blankets, and pillows. You'll probably also want to use a water-tight plastic sheet or covering to prevent blood stains. [10] X Research source In a pinch, a clean, dry shower curtain will work as a water-tight barrier to prevent stains. Though your doctor or midwife will most likely have these things, you may also want to have sterile gauze pads and ties ready nearby for cutting the baby's cord."

      "title": "Have your attendant monitor the dilation of your cervix.",
      "content": "Have your attendant monitor the dilation of your cervix. During the first stage of labor, your cervix dilates, thinning and widening to allow for the passage of the baby. At first, discomfort may be minimal. Over time, your contractions will gradually become more frequent and more intense. You may start to feel pain or pressure in your lower back or abdomen that increases as your cervix dilates. As your cervix dilates, your attendant should perform frequent pelvic exams to monitor its progress. When it's fully dilated with a width of about 10 centimeter (3.9 in), you're ready to enter the second phase of labor. [15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may begin to feel an urge to push, but your attendant will usually tell you not to do so until your cervix has dilated to 10 centimeter (3.9 in). At this point, it is usually not too late to receive pain medication. If you have planned for this possibility and have painkillers on hand, talk to your doctor or midwife to assess whether they are appropriate."

You may feel a strong urge to push: if your cervix is fully dilated, your birth attendant will give you the OK to do so. Communicate with your doctor or midwife, notifying them of any changes in your condition. They will instruct you when to push, how to breathe, and when to rest. Follow these instructions as well as you are able. This stage of labor can last up to 2 hours for first-time birth givers, while in subsequent deliveries this stage can be far shorter (sometimes as short as 15 minutes). If you're not fully dilated, wait for your go-ahead. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't be afraid to try different positions, like getting on all fours, kneeling, or squatting. Your doctor or midwife will usually want you to be in the position that is most comfortable and allows you to push most effectively. As you push and strain, don't worry about accidentally urinating or defecating - this is extremely common and your birth attendant will expect it. Concentrate solely on pushing out the baby."

      "title": "Push the baby through the birth canal.",
      "content": "Push the baby through the birth canal. The force of your pushing, combined with your contractions, will move your baby from the uterus into the birth canal. At this point, your attendant may be able to see the baby's head. This is called \"crowning\"—you can use a mirror to see it yourself. Don't be frustrated if, after crowning, the baby's head disappears—this is normal. Over time, the baby's position will shift down the birth canal. You'll need to push hard to get the baby's head out. As soon as this happens, your birth attendant should clear the baby's nose and mouth of any amniotic fluid and assist you in pushing the rest of the baby's body out. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't be afraid to scream, cry, wail, or groan. This is very common during contractions and birth pains. Breech birth (when a baby's feet come out before their head) is a medical condition that carries added risks for the baby and will most likely necessitate a trip to the hospital. Most breech births today result in C-sections."

[18] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source After giving birth, the birth attendant may recommend initiating breastfeeding.

In the third and final stage of labor, you must deliver the placenta, which is the organ that nourished your baby while it was in the womb. Mild contractions (so mild, in fact, that some people don't notice them) separate the placenta from the uterine wall. Soon after, the placenta passes through the birth canal. This process usually takes about 5-20 minutes and, compared to delivering a baby, is a relatively minor ordeal. [19] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your placenta doesn't come out or doesn't come out in one piece, go to the hospital.
