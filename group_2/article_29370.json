      "content": "Choose a mask template. Type \"masquerade mask template\" into Google and hundreds of results will pop up. If you've never made a mask before, you might want to start with a simple design. Choose a template with a plain outline and plenty of inner white space if you want to add a lot of customization. [1] X Research source The standard mask goes a bit above the eyebrows and ends at the top of the cheekbones, but yours doesn't have to. You can always draw your own design, but at least check out some of the templates for inspiration and guidance for sizing."

      "title": "Print your chosen template on thick paper or cardstock.",
      "content": "Print your chosen template on thick paper or cardstock. For a sturdier mask, use cardstock, which you can get at any craft, art, or office supply store. Print the template out on letter-sized paper -- anything smaller won't accommodate the mask size, and anything bigger will just waste paper. [2] X Research source Before printing, make sure your printer can handle the thickness of cardstock, or change the settings to accommodate thicker paper. If you only have access to plain paper, try printing out several templates and layering them on top of one another to create a stronger base."

      "title": "Add details to the outline (optional).",
      "content": "Add details to the outline (optional). Use a pencil and lightly sketch any additional elements you want onto the cardstock. Attaching flames or swoops onto the outline can make it more interesting and even change its shape entirely. Consider flames, swoops, hearts, stars, horns, and geometric shapes. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut out the mask.",
      "content": "Cut out the mask. Be careful! Use a good pair of scissors to prevent any snags or tears. If you added extra elements, don't forget to include those when cutting around the template. Leave a little extra room on the sides if you are attaching a band or some type of holding device, like a dowel stick."

      "title": "Mark your mask for painting.",
      "content": "Mark your mask for painting. If your template didn't come with design elements already in place, lightly sketch out what you want yours to look like. Creating a design for the surface of the mask might include multiple colors and textures. Sketching those outlines ahead of time will help you maintain symmetry. Make your marks light! You don't want to see them through your paint."

      "title": "Paint your mask with acrylic paint.",
      "content": "Paint your mask with acrylic paint. The choice of color is a personal one, but traditional colors include deep reds and metallic hues. Use a small paintbrush to ensure clean lines. Paint on several coats to get a rich hue. If you're doing multiple colors, let one color dry completely before starting another one. Take care as you hold the mask; if your fingers touch the wet paint you could smear it (or get it on your clothes)."

      "title": "Allow the paint to dry fully.",
      "content": "Allow the paint to dry fully. Set your mask on a covered surface in an open area where it won't be disturbed. Be patient -- drying might take a while. Depending on the type and brand of paint you used, this could take up to 4 hours. It needs to be completely dry before you add anything else to it. Check the packaging of your chosen paint for specifics about drying time."

Masquerade masks are traditionally loud and flashy, so use decorative materials like rhinestones, glitter, colorful feathers, sequins, gem-style stickers, curly ribbons, plastic gems, glitter glue, and anything else that interests you. Stick with your originally planned theme and don't overcrowd the surface. [4] X Research source What you choose is totally up to you, but do consider weight, bulk, and tackiness. Too many embellishments may leave your mask looking overdone."

If you don't have a dowel, you can use chopsticks, a firm straw, or a very carefully rolled up piece of card. [5] X Research source"

Some masquerade masks have handles coming from the middle, others have them from either side, and some masks have no handle at all. It's up to you! Allow the glue to dry fully. Hold the dowel in position for 30 seconds to make sure it's secure and in place."

If you'd rather not hold the mask up to your face constantly, attach a string or ribbon so that you can tie it on instead. Use a hole punch to make small holes on both sides of the mask. Then, thread the string through the holes. [6] X Research source Be careful taking it on and off so that you don't tear the paper!"

Shake the paint bottle to remove air bubbles from the tip. Trace your pattern with the fabric paint right onto the tulle, taking care to create smooth lines. Start with the eye details first, then work your way out to the edges. [10] X Research source The paint gives your fabric mask definition and style. You can skip it and just have a plain fabric mask, if you prefer. Be careful not to rest the edge of your hand on the template as you apply paint! If you do use more than one color, be aware that the colors may run together where they meet. You may want to do one color first, let it dry, then apply the other."

Go for ribbon that's .25 in (0.64 cm) wide so that it will easily fit through the slits you created. Thread each ribbon through one of the slits, then knot it through the other slit to secure it in place.

[14] X Research source If the person acting as the \"mold\" is slightly claustrophobic or under the age of 5, a half mask is recommended. If your design is intricate, you may want to let your helper apply the plaster to your face. That way, it will be perfectly molded to your face shape.
