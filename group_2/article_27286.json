      "content": "Empty a small packet of flavored gelatin into a mixing bowl. A 3-ounce (85-gram) packet of gelatin will be enough to fill at least one ice cube tray. Keep in mind that this also depends on the size and shape of the wells in the tray. These gelatin ice cubes are literally frozen. They are a great way to add a splash of color to drinks without melting and blending colors/flavors. If you have a large enough measuring cup, use that instead. It will make the pouring step easier."

      "title": "Whisk in the required amount of boiling water into the bowl.",
      "content": "Whisk in the required amount of boiling water into the bowl. Most 3-ounce (85-gram) packets of flavored gelatin will call for 2 cups (475 milliliters) of boiling water. If your package calls for a different amount, use that amount instead. [3] X Research source Be sure to whisk well so that the gelatin is completely dissolved."

      "title": "Stir in half of the required amount of cold water.",
      "content": "Stir in half of the required amount of cold water. 3-ounce (85-gram) packets of flavored gelatin will typically call for 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water. You want to use half that amount, so about ½ cup (120 milliliters) of cold water. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the flavored gelatin into an ice cube tray. If you mixing bowl does not have a spout, use a soup or sauce ladle to scoop up the gelatin, and pour it into each well. A silicone ice cube tray will work the best."

      "title": "Freeze the flavored gelatin.",
      "content": "Freeze the flavored gelatin. Don't wait for it to set. Simply tuck the entire ice cube tray into the freezer. Leave it there until the gelatin freezes. This will take at least 4 hours. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of juice into a bowl. You can also use a 4-cup (950-milliliter) measuring cup instead. For something that looks more ice-like, use a clear or blue-colored juice. [6] X Research source You can also use water if you do not care about the flavor. These gelatin ice cubes are merely cut to look like ice. They are perfect for winter themed parties or desserts where you need something that looks like ice. You can also try to use a clear soda.

      "content": "Stir in 4 packets of unflavored gelatin, then let the gelatin bloom. Tear open 4 packets of clear, unflavored gelatin, and add them to the water. Give the mixture a brief stir. Wait for the gelatin to bloom. This will take about 5 minutes. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Microwave the mixture until the gelatin melts. Make sure that the bowl or measuring cup you are using is safe to use in the microwave. If it isn't, pour it into a container that is. Heat the mixture in the microwave until the gelatin dissolves. This will take about 1 minute on HIGH. [9] X Research source"

This will make the cubes easier to pop out. [11] X Research source If you are using a silicone ice cube tray, then you can skip this step. Use a regular ice cube tray with wells that are shaped like cubes. This will make them look more like ice cubes. Save the novelty trays that are shaped like fish, hearts, stars, dinosaurs, etc. for another project."

      "content": "Cut the gelatin into cubes, then remove the gelatin. Aim to make the cubes about ice cube sized, about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) square. You can also make them rectangular instead. If the cubes are stuck to the pan, you can try soaking the bottom of the pan in warm water for a few minutes. If you used an actual ice cube tray, you can leave the cubes as they are after popping them out, or you can cut them into smaller cubes."
