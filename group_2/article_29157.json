It shows you're happy, fun, and that you don't take life too seriously. Here are some ideas: Go for physical humor. Make funny faces, pretend you're stuck in slow-motion, hop on him for a piggyback ride (if that's cool, of course), or start a well-meaning food fight. Put on a show. Do a foreign accent or pretend you're him -- lightly mocking him as a form of flirting , of course. React to him in silly ways. Are you snuggled up against him? Start purring like a cat! When he says, \"Oops, sorry, I drank your last soda,\" you respond with, \"THAT'S IT. I'M MOVING TO CANADA.\" And then you smile and launch into how excited you are to play hockey and watch the beavers."

Sure, once in a while you get the person who can pull off being absolutely hilarious because they're so dry, cynical, sarcastic, and a little dark and twisty, but generally you want to be around those people in small doses.

      "content": "Get to know him. Humor is subjective. What you find funny won't necessarily be the same thing even your best friend finds funny. So in order to know what tickles his funny bone, get to know him! What TV shows does he like? What comedians? What kind of humor does he use to amuse others? All of these are cues as to what gets him giggling. The most aptly-timed joke on, say, Foucault won't be appreciated by the type of guy who prefers laughing at toilet humor. And it works the other way around, too. Does the guy you're eyeing prefer bro banter? Is he into witty non-sequiturs about current events? Can he be slayed by a play on words in Klingon? Find out!"

You don't have to laugh at every joke he makes like your world has just been altered. If he drops a dud, laugh at him , albeit playfully. Did he just try an unfunny, stereotypical, sexist, blonde joke? Oh, honey. Let him know how cute he is for trying with a fake chuckle and a forced grin."

If not an impression, can you drop a line from a movie or challenge him to up his game to Christopher Walken? Establishing a banter can develop a rapport between you two, creating a bond that won't easily be broken. Whether his humor is self-deprecating or straight out of Family Guy, go with it.

There are few things worse than a person that embarrasses themselves and gets all self-conscious and shameful. So when you spill that soda on yourself, just say that you're saving it for later and that brown looks better on you than white, anyway. Also, it's like two-for-one perfume. You're just being frugal! Studies actually show that embarrassing yourself can actually get people to like you and trust you more. It sort of makes sense -- when you show you're down-to-earth, light-hearted, and just a plain human like they are, it takes away any possible intimidation and stress. [4] X Research source"

Bored so incredibly that you're practically gnawing off your arm for something to do? Why would you not bust out the macarena? As long as he's the type that doesn't embarrass easily, that is.
