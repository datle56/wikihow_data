      "content": "Mix 1 tbsp (14 g) of baking soda with 5-6 drops of essential oil. Pro house cleaner Raymond Chiu tells us that a simple baking soda and water solution makes a fabulous odor eliminator. First, Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda to a small bowl or dish. Then, if you like, mix 5 to 6 drops of an essential oil into the baking soda with a spoon or fork until they are well combined. Essential oils are totally optional, but they do add a little extra pizazz. The baking soda will absorb odors to help freshen the air on its own, while the essential oil replaces the odor with something nicer. Use your favorite essential oil to scent the air freshener, or even mix two or more oils to create a custom scent. Lavender, chamomile, peppermint, lemon, eucalyptus, and rosemary essential oils are all good options. Check out Amazon’s selection of essential oils for a wide variety of options."

      "content": "Pour the baking soda mixture into an empty spray bottle. When the baking soda and oil are well mixed, transfer the mixture to a clean, empty spray bottle—16–32 fl oz (0.47–0.95 L) works best. Use a spoon or a funnel to carefully add the powder to the bottle to avoid making a mess. [1] X Research source It doesn’t really matter what size bottle you use. With a smaller bottle, though, the baking soda may not completely dissolve, but you can always refill it with water as you go to use up the excess baking soda. Also, use a bit of painter’s tape and a marker to create a label for the bottle, so you always know what’s inside it."

      "content": "Spray the air freshener wherever you need it. After you've shaken the bottle to fully mix all of the ingredients, you're ready to use the air freshener. Cleaning pro Andrew Outman suggests using it to eliminate odors in the air. Or, target specific items, such as your sofa or a pair of sneakers. Or, use the spray as a gentle odor remover and cleaner for countertops. It’ll take up to an hour for the baking soda to do its thing. If the odor still linger, give it another spray after a little while."

      "content": "Mix ½ cup (90 g) of baking soda and 15 to 25 drops of essential oil in a jar. Cleaning specialist Jennifer Rodriguez says that a container of baking soda makes a great passive air freshener. Add ½ cup (90 g) of baking soda to a jar or any other container. Optionally, add 15 to 25 drops of an essential oil to the container and use a spoon to carefully stir the two together until they're fully combined. A jar with a 2-piece lid works best, since we’ll be making a breathable lid that keeps the baking soda in while still letting it do its job, but any small container will work, really. Eucalyptus, lavender, mint, lemon, or rosemary essential oils are great choices that offer fresh, natural scents. Outman adds that charcoal is a good substitute for baking soda. In either case, keep the container out of reach of children and pets."

      "content": "Secure a breathable lid on the jar. Chiu says it’s best to cover the container, in case it spills, but to use a breathable lid. Swap the jar’s lid piece with a piece of linen or cheesecloth, then screw it into place. Or, Chiu says you might poke holes in the metal lid with a pin instead. Alternatively, use a rubber band to secure cheesecloth or linen over the container. Avoid using solid lids that won’t let the baking soda catch the odors in the air."

      "content": "Place the air freshener out wherever you need it. When the lid and covering are secure on the jar, the air freshener is ready to go. Rodriguez recommends using it in a fridge to eliminate bad food smells. Or, set it out on a table or countertop wherever you want to freshen the air. The kitchen and bathroom are ideal locations, but you also can place it in your bedroom, living room, or family room. If the air freshener seems to have lost its scent, shake the jar. That will redistribute and freshen the scent. Replace the baking soda in the container once every couple months, for best results."

      "content": "Grind 3 tbsp (1.7 g) of aromatic herbs, like rosemary or lavender. Baking soda alone is a great carpet deodorizer, but adding some common, aromatic herbs really elevates it and helps banish bad odors. Start by grinding 2 to 3 sprigs of the dried herbs in a coffee grinder or blender so they're fine enough to mix with the baking soda. [3] X Research source Use whatever herbs or aromatics you like! Lavender, lemon or orange rinds, mint, chamomile, and sage are all great options. Just be careful of aromatics that are potentially toxic to pets, like pine."

      "content": "Combine the herbs, 1 cup (180 g) of baking soda, and 30-40 drops of essential oil. Mix the herbs and baking soda in a jar. Then, add an essential oil of your choice, if you like. Place the lid on the jar, and shake well to thoroughly mix the ingredients. [4] X Research source Then, for best results, let the mixture sit overnight, so the aromas mingle. Use any essential oils that you like, but avoid tea tree oil if you have pets. It can be toxic to animals. Citrus essential oils lose their scents quickly, so you should avoid them if you want a long lasting scent for your carpet. Or, use an antimicrobial or antibacterial essential oil in your carpet freshener. Oregano oil, cinnamon oil, and thyme oil are good options. If you’re using essential oils, pair suitable oils with the herb choices. For example, lavender grounds with lavender essential oils will really pack a punch. Or, mix and match!"
