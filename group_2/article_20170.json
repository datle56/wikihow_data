I know I shouldn't get into fights with George. I let my temper get the best of me, but I really want to do better. I hope you can forgive me.\""

I know you want us to have the relationship that you never had with your sister, and I appreciate that. I love Jane to bits, even though she drives me crazy sometimes. I am the older one, and I should be more mature when she tries to annoy me on purpose. I understand that relationships take work, and you're only trying to prepare me for the ones I have in the future, as well as help me to develop a strong, lasting relationship with Jane.

Sometimes, your mom may forgive you quickly, but other times, it may take a while. In fact, some psychologists say there are stages to forgiveness, just like there are to grief. Your mom may go through denial, bargaining, anger, and depression before acceptance and forgiveness, though she may not go in order or even go through all those stages. Regardless, remember you must work to earn her forgiveness and trust back. Trust is kind of a hard process, so don't rush it. [10] X Research source"
