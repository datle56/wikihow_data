      "title": "Poke two holes in a disposable roasting pan.",
      "content": "Poke two holes in a disposable roasting pan. Use a pocket knife to poke two small holes in the lip of one side of the roasting pan. Ask an adult to do this step. Choose one of the shorter ends. This will now be the top of your gong. The holes should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) apart. The tip of a scissors blade could also be used instead of a pocket knife."

      "title": "Slide pipe cleaners into the holes.",
      "content": "Slide pipe cleaners into the holes. Place one pipe cleaner into each hole. Securely twist the ends of each pipe cleaner together. Each pipe cleaner should form a loop with the ends twisted together. You'll need two loops (one in each hole). The loops should be 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) in diameter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang the pipe cleaners from a cardboard tube.",
      "content": "Hang the pipe cleaners from a cardboard tube. Slide the cardboard tube of a wrapping paper roll or paper towel roll through the pipe cleaner loops, centering the loops on the tube. You could use a broomstick, measuring stick, or other large stick instead of the cardboard tube if desired. Just make sure that the stick itself is longer than the width of your roasting pan gong. This tube or stick will act as the support for your gong."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prop up the gong.",
      "content": "Prop up the gong. Place two desk or dining room chairs back to back. Rest the support on the back tops of both chairs so that the gong hangs in place. For added security, you could hold the support in place using more pipe cleaners. Alternatively, you could use two large, thick books or any other evenly sized sturdy pieces instead of the chairs. This \"stand\" needs to be able to stay in place without additional support, though."

      "title": "Wrap the end of a chopstick with tape.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of a chopstick with tape. Wrap electrical tape around one end of the chopstick, overlapping the tape until it forms a thick mass. Instead of a chopstick, you could also use a wooden spoon or 12-inch (30.5-cm) wooden dowel. The taped portion of the stick will be the head of your beater. The head should be about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) thick."

      "title": "Fill a plastic bottle.",
      "content": "Fill a plastic bottle. Fill an 8-oz (250-ml) plastic bottle halfway with a noise-making material. Tightly secure the cap on the top of the bottle. There are different options you can use for the filling. Pebbles, beans, rice, birdseed, beads, dry pasta, small washers, and paper clips will produce stronger noises. Sand, salt, and small erasers will produce quieter noises. You can also mix different filling materials inside one maraca or use a filling idea not mentioned here. The filling just needs to be small enough to shake around inside the maraca."

      "title": "Cut a cardboard tube lengthwise.",
      "content": "Cut a cardboard tube lengthwise. Cut straight down the length of one toilet paper tube. The cut should be as straight as possible. Only cut one slit down the length of the tube. Do not cut the tube completely in half. If working with a paper towel roll instead of a toilet paper roll, completely cut the paper towel roll in half crosswise before cutting it lengthwise. Only use one of these halves for one maraca handle."

      "title": "Attach the tube with tape.",
      "content": "Attach the tube with tape. Start wrapping the electrical tape around the bottom part of bottle, near the cap. Wind it around, overlapping the layers, until it also connects to the cardboard handle. Wrap slowly and do not leave any gaps in between layers of tape. To make the maraca more decorative, use tape that comes in a bright color or pattern."

    {
      "title": "Create a second maraca in the same way.",
      "content": "Create a second maraca in the same way. The second maraca is made in the same way as the first, so you will need to repeat the previous steps with a second 8-oz (250-ml) plastic bottle. Consider using a different filling for your second maraca. Many real maracas have different pitches, and using different filling materials can mimic these different pitches. For instance, if you place beans in one and rice in another, the rice maraca will have a higher pitch."

      "title": "Heat a dozen metal bottle caps.",
      "content": "Heat a dozen metal bottle caps. Remove the rubber liners from the inside of each cap, then heat the caps on a hot outdoor grill for about five minutes. This step should be done by an adult. Do not touch the metal caps as they heat up. Only touch them using tongs. This step is technically optional, but following it will improve the final sound of the instrument."

    {
      "title": "Flatten the caps.",
      "content": "Flatten the caps. After the metal caps cool to the touch, use a hammer to flatten them out as much as possible. Mainly, you'll need to focus on flattening the raised, bumpy ridge around the outside of the cap. Work carefully to avoid striking your fingers. You may need to perform this step with adult supervision, as well."
