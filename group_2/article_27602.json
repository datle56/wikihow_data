      "content": "Pour 1/2 cup (64 g) of maple and brown sugar oatmeal into a microwavable jar. McDonald's uses brown sugar oats for its oatmeal, so you can get pretty close to their recipe with brown sugar and maple instant oatmeal. [1] X Research source Pour 1/2 cup (64 g) or 1 packet of oats into a microwave-safe container to get started. [2] X Research source The oatmeal expands while it’s cooking, so use a container large enough so it won’t overflow. If you only have plain oats, then you can add 2 tbsp (10 mg) of brown sugar to get the recipe closer to McDonald’s. [3] X Research source This gives you the sweetness that you're craving from the McDonald's version. If you want to be healthier, you can use plain oats and skip the brown sugar to save about 30 calories. This recipe makes 1 serving, so increase it if you want to make more."
