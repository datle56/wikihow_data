      "content": "Yes, you can make your own essential oils if you plan on using them a lot. Real essential oils, like the ones you see online and in stores, are often made with “stills,” or large containers crafted from stainless steel. This equipment can be a bit pricey upfront, but may be worthwhile if you plan on making essential oils very frequently. [4] X Research source You can find still equipment on most all-purpose online marketplaces. These can be pricey and cost at least $100. There are essential oil-making kits you can buy with every piece of equipment you’ll need to make a variety of essential oils."

      "title": "Craft your own infused oils by soaking your favorite herb or plant in oil.",
      "content": "Craft your own infused oils by soaking your favorite herb or plant in oil. Fill a clean glass bottle or jar halfway with the herb or plant of your choice. Add in a carrier oil over the herbs, like olive, grape seed, or coconut oil, so there’s around 1 in (2.5 cm) of oil on top of the herbs. Place a square of wax paper on top of the glass jar before securing the lid in place. Wrap the jar in a paper bag, leaving it in a sunny spot for 1-2 weeks. Strain the infused oil through a cheesecloth into a new, clean jar, giving the new oil a day to settle. [5] X Research source It helps to roll the jar around in your hands once every 1-3 days while the oil heats up in the sunlight. This helps the herbs infuse into the rest of the oil. Store your jar in a cool, dark place when you’re not using it. These oils should be good for roughly 1 month before the ingredients start to go bad. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "You only need a carrier oil if you’re applying oils topically.",
      "content": "You only need a carrier oil if you’re applying oils topically. Carrier oils, like jojoba oil, coconut oil, and olive oil, are mandatory if you’re putting oils on your skin. However, smelling an oil is much safer than putting it on your skin so you don’t need the carrier oil. [7] X Research source If you still want to use a carrier oil for aromatherapy, you can! Sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, and fractionated coconut oil are all great options that won’t overwhelm the smell of the essential oil.

      "title": "You use water instead of oil if you’re using a diffuser.",
      "content": "You use water instead of oil if you’re using a diffuser. Diffusing your oils is the most popular way to do some aromatherapy. With a diffuser, you fill the machine with water and then add a few drops of your preferred essential oil to the water and turn the machine on. [9] X Expert Source Julie Brow-Polanco Master Herbalist & Certified Aromatherapist Expert Interview. 12 April 2022. There are waterless diffusers out there. If you have one of those, you don’t dilute the oil at all."

      "content": "Many essential oil fans find fractionated coconut oil to be odorless. Fractionated coconut oil is commonly used in commercial essential oil products. [10] X Research source Unlike regular coconut oil, the fractionated stuff is made by extracting the active compounds that cause it to be volatile. [11] X Research source As a result, it’s much more stable than regular coconut oil, and many essential oil enthusiasts think it’s the ideal option if you only want to smell the oil. Fractionated coconut oil is a bit more expensive than standard coconut oil."

      "content": "No, you can always buy pre-made oils if you’d like to save time. Search online or in your local wellness store for bottles of essential oils. These oils can be a bit pricey—still, shopping for pre-made oils can save you time if you’re eager to start playing around with different scent combinations. Just make sure you purchase your oils from reputable manufacturers. [12] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Manufactured oils are almost always going to be safer than homemade oils as well, since it can be hard to know if you’ve produced a safe concentration. Avoid “fragrance oils.” While they sound like they’d be great for aromatherapy, fragrance oils contain chemicals that may damage your diffuser. [13] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Certain essential oils cost more than others. For instance, 10 mL (0.34 fl oz) of lavender might cost at least $16, while 10 mL (0.34 fl oz) of orange essential oil might cost under $6. Other scents, like rose and chamomile, tend to be more expensive as well. [14] X Research source"

Grab a glass container with a narrow mouth (a laboratory flask is perfect) and fill it with your essential and base oils. Aim for 70% of your carrier oil, and 30% of your essential oil. Then, place 5-10 reeds or bamboo skewers inside of the container. The oils will soak slowly through your reeds or skewers and release their lovely aromas into the air. [26] X Research source Every week or so, flip the skewers or reeds upside down or replace them. This will keep one end from drying out entirely. If you don’t have a glass container that will work for this, grab a ceramic container. So long as it’s glazed inside (so that it doesn’t leak), it should be fine."
