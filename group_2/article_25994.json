      "title": "Find the instructions label on your furnace.",
      "content": "Find the instructions label on your furnace. Nearly every furnace will have a sticker on it that has instructions on how to light the pilot light of the furnace. The instructions label will also tell you where the gas valve and reset button are located so you can relight the pilot light. [1] X Research source Use a flashlight to locate the label if the furnace area is dark."

      "title": "Turn off the gas valve.",
      "content": "Turn off the gas valve. The first thing you need to do before you try to light the pilot light on your furnace is shut off the gas so there isn’t any chance of causing a fire or an explosion. Most furnaces have a small valve near the bottom of the furnace that have 3 positions labeled “On”, “Off”, and “Pilot.” Turn the valve so that it’s in the “Off” position. [2] X Research source Wait 5 minutes before you do anything else so any gas left in the pipes has a chance to clear out."

    {
      "title": "Switch the gas valve to pilot light.",
      "content": "Switch the gas valve to pilot light. After waiting 5 minutes, turn the gas valve to the position labeled “Pilot” or “Pilot Light.” You shouldn’t smell any gas coming from the valve. If you do, you may have a gas leak. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Press and hold the reset button.",
      "content": "Press and hold the reset button. Near the gas valve, you should see a small button or switch labeled “Reset.” Before you try to light the pilot light, locate the reset button and hold it down. [4] X Research source If you can’t locate the reset button, check the owner’s manual of the furnace to see if there is a diagram that shows the location of the reset button. If you don’t have the owner’s manual for your furnace, try looking up your specific furnace online."

      "title": "Light the pilot light valve with a long lighter.",
      "content": "Light the pilot light valve with a long lighter. Continue to hold the reset button as you ignite the lighter. Bring the flame to the pilot light valve and hold it steady until you see the pilot light reignite, then release the reset button. [5] X Research source You can use a long match or roll a piece of paper into a long tube to use to light the pilot light. It’s possible that you may need to relight the pilot light a few times until it stays on."

      "title": "Turn the furnace back on by switching the valve back to the “On” position.",
      "content": "Turn the furnace back on by switching the valve back to the “On” position. Once you’ve reignited the pilot light, turn the gas valve back into the “on” position and you should hear your furnace turn back on. The furnace should start to generate heat to the house soon afterward. If the pilot light continues to go out, you may have a broken or faulty thermocouple. Call a professional to take a look at your furnace. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Open the access panel covering the pilot light.",
      "content": "Open the access panel covering the pilot light. Many gas water heaters will have a small access panel that you’ll need to remove in order to access the pilot light and gas valve. Depending on your water heater, you may be able to just snap the panel off, or you’ll need to use a small screwdriver to remove the panel. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Switch the gas valve off.",
      "content": "Switch the gas valve off. When you open the access panel, locate the gas regulator valve and turn the switch until it’s in the “Off” position. The valve is usually located on the box that has the temperature control valve. [8] X Research source Wait 10 minutes before you move on to allow any residual gas from the tank to clear from the air."

      "content": "Set the temperature control valve to the lowest setting. Near the gas regulator valve, you’ll see a temperature control valve that allows you to set the temperature of the water heater. Turn the dial or switch to the lowest possible temperature setting. [9] X Research source For some water heaters, the lowest temperature setting is labeled “Pilot.” Turn the dial to that position."

      "content": "Turn the gas valve to the “Pilot” position. After you’ve lowered the temperature control valve, switch the gas regulator control valve to the “Pilot” position so you can reignite the pilot light. Some older water heaters may require you to hold the switch in the pilot position to relight the pilot light. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a long lighter to light the pilot light.",
      "content": "Use a long lighter to light the pilot light. With the gas valve in the pilot position, or with you holding the valve in the pilot position, use a long-stemmed lighter to light the tip of the pilot light’s valve. Keep the regulator valve in the pilot position for 1-2 minutes to allow the thermocouple to sense that the pilot light is on and the water heater to restart. [11] X Research source You can use a long match or a piece of paper rolled up into a tube to light the pilot light. Some modern gas water heaters will have a red button or switch near the regulator valve that is labeled something like “Pilot ignition” or “Ignite.” If your heater has an igniter, don’t use a lighter, just press the button to light the pilot light."

    {
      "title": "Reset the temperature setting and turn the gas back on.",
      "content": "Reset the temperature setting and turn the gas back on. Once the pilot light is back on and is burning smoothly, switch the gas regulator valve back to the “On” position. Then put the temperature valve back to the original setting. [12] X Research source Never set a water heater past 120 °F (49 °C)."

      "title": "Make sure everything is off.",
      "content": "Make sure everything is off. Turn all of the knobs to the off position and make sure the oven isn’t on. It’s very important that no gas is being released when you relight the pilot light or you could cause a fire or an explosion. [14] X Research source Make sure you don’t smell any gas in the kitchen. If you do, do not try to light the pilot light. Call a technician to repair your stove. Listen for a hissing sound that could indicate that gas is leaking from the stove."

There will be a lever or switch on the underside of the stovetop that you need to engage in order to raise the lid of the stovetop. Look for a small pipe that connects the burners on the left and a small pipe that connects the burners on the right. There is a pilot port in the center of each of the pipes. [16] X Research source If you can’t locate the pilot light ports, consult the owner’s manual to find them. Look up your stove online to find the pilot light ports if you don’t have the owner’s manual."

This is where you will need to light the pilot light. [17] X Research source Depending on the model of your oven, the pilot light hole may be in the front corner, back corner, or in the center near the door. Check your owner’s manual or look up your oven online to find the pilot light if you can’t locate it."

Light both pilot light valves. Then light the pilot light in the small hole at the bottom of the oven. Hold the flame until the pilot light ignites and stay lit. [18] X Research source You can also use a long match to light the pilot light. The pilot should ignite almost immediately. If it doesn’t, you may have a blocked gas line.

Then close the oven door. You should be able to use your stove or oven now. [19] X Research source Test the burners on the stovetop and turn on the oven to make sure they’re working. If the pilot light keeps going out, there may be something wrong with the gas lines. You may need to call a technician to fix a faulty gas line."
