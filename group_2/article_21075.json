Here is what you'll need to know: [1] X Research source The x-axis goes left and right, the second coordinate is on the y-axis. The y-axis goes up and down. Positive numbers go up or right (depending on the axis). Negative numbers go left or down."

Quadrant IV gets (+,-); quadrant IV is below the x-axis and to the right of the y-axis. (5,4) is in quadrant I. (-5,4) is in Quadrant II. (-5,-4) is in Quadrant III. (5,-4) is in Quadrant IV."

      "content": "Learn how to graph points if you're working with an equation. If you have a formula without any coordinates, then you'll have to find your points by choosing a random coordinate for x and seeing what the formula spits out for y. Just keep going until you've found enough points and can graph them all, connecting them if necessary. Here's how you can do it, whether you're working with a simple line, or a more complicated equation like a parabola: [7] X Research source Graph points from a line. Let's say the equation is y = x + 4. So, pick a random number for x, like 3, and see what you get for y. y = 3 + 4 = 7, so you have found the point (3, 7). Graph points from a quadratic equation. Let's say the equation of the parabola is y = x 2 + 2. Do the same thing: pick a random number for x and see what you get for y. Picking 0 for x is easiest. y = 0 2 + 2, so y = 2. You have found the point (0, 2)."

      "title": "Connect the points if necessary.",
      "content": "Connect the points if necessary. If you have to make a line graph, draw a circle, or connect all of the points of a parabola or another quadratic equation, then you'll have to connect the points. If you have a linear equation, then draw lines connecting the points from left to right. If you're working with a quadratic equation, then connect the points with curved lines. [8] X Research source Unless you are only graphing a point, you will need at least two points. A line requires two points. A circle requires two points if one is the center; three if the center is not included (Unless your instructor has included the center of the circle in the problem, use three). A parabola requires three points, one being the absolute minimum or maximum; the other two points should be opposites. A hyperbola requires six points; three on each axis."

      "content": "Understand how modifying the equation changes the graph. Here are the different ways that modifying the equation changes the graph: [9] X Research source Modifying the x coordinate moves the equation left or right. Adding a constant moves the equation up or down. Turning it negative (multiplying by -1) flips it over; if it is a line, it will change it from going up to down or going down to up. Multiplying it by another number will either increase or decrease the slope."

Here are the differences you will see as you modify the equation: y = (x-2)^2 is the same parabola, except it is graphed two spaces to the right of the origin; its base is now at (2,0). y = x^2 + 2 is still the same parabola, except now it is graphed two spaces higher at (0,2). y = -x^2 (the negative is applied after the exponent ^2) is an upside down y = x^2; its base is (0,0). y = 5x^2 is still a parabola, but it gets larger even faster, giving it a thinner look."
