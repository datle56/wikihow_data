      "content": "You can leave it in for roughly 2-6 weeks before you need to remove it. The specific time depends on the wig's quality, the type of hair, how well it’s installed, and how well you take care of it. Shampoo, wash, and condition the wig weekly to keep the hair healthy and clean. Always air-dry your wig since heat can put wear and tear on the strands. Also, brush out your wig regularly to prevent knots and tangles. [1] X Research source Don’t wear a lace front wig for more than 6 weeks. [2] X Expert Source Tiffany Pate Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 November 2021. Give your natural hair at least a few weeks to breathe before installing a new wig. Alternatively, get your hair taken back down, comb through, condition properly, then put it back up. [3] X Expert Source Tiffany Pate Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 November 2021. If you don’t want to go to the stylist to get the wig sewn directly into your hair every few weeks, get the wig sewn into an elastic band. That way, you can maintain that sewn-in seamless look, but you’ll be able to take it on and off whenever you want! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "If you take care of it, a quality lace front wig will last for years. So long as you don’t use a ton of heat, you keep the hair detangled, and you always have it reinstalled by a pro, the wig will hold up for years to come. [5] X Research source To make sure it stays in tiptop shape, cleanse and condition the wig when you take it off. Let it air dry completely and set it on a wig head or in a silk bag. [6] X Research source Store your wig in a dark, dry location when you aren’t wearing it."

      "content": "Human hair lace front wigs will last longer than synthetic wigs. Synthetic wigs tend to be cheaper, but they fall apart faster than human hair wigs do. If you want a wig to last (and look natural), get a high-quality human hair wig. Not only will the wig last longer, but you can style, cut, or color the wig just like it’s your real hair. [7] X Research source Coloring, treating, or adding chemicals may shorten a wig’s lifespan."

      "content": "Typically, it will stay put for about 2 weeks before it shifts in place. A 360 lace frontal sew-in will stay where it’s installed for about 2 weeks before it starts to come lose a bit and slide around a bit. If it isn’t a noticeable movement, you can leave it where it is. Otherwise, take it out and have it re-sewn into your hair. [8] X Research source With 360 lace frontal wigs, you want to treat them more or less identically to your own hair so that it blends with the natural hair on your crown. If you brush or style your natural hair a certain way, do the same thing with your 360 lace front wig. These frontals usually last about 6 months if you treat them right and don’t wear them for extended periods of time."

      "content": "It takes longer to install it, but it’ll be more secure if that’s your goal. It may take a few hours for a stylist to sew the wig in, but the wig won’t slide around on your head and it’s easier on your hair than glue. As a result, a sew-in wig is better if you don’t want to take the wig on and off every day, but you don’t want to deal with the chemicals or glue. [9] X Research source If your hair is already braided when you show up to get the wig sewn in, it’ll go much faster. Just make sure that your braids are tight. If they’re loose, the wig will kind of hang on your head like a helmet and it won’t look quite right."

      "content": "If you want to experiment with different hairstyles, sewing it in is best. Glued-in wigs are susceptible to moving around after a few weeks, and you can’t get them super hot. The elastic band wigs are convenient, but it can be hard to style them. A sew in front wig blends with your natural hair beautifully, and the threads that hold the wig in place allow you to brush, curl, or straighten your hair as you please. [10] X Research source The downside with the sew in wig is that it’s kind of pain to have them installed; the threading has to be done by an expert and you can’t really do it at home."

      "title": "A closure is better if you want volume up top.",
      "content": "A closure is better if you want volume up top. Closures are basically flat wigs that get sewn in or laid on top of your head. This is great if your hair is thinner up top and you want to add more volume. Unfortunately, they aren’t very versatile as frontals since you have to blend your hairline with the edge of your closure. However, if you don’t want to mess around with a bunch of styles, this may not be a big deal for you. [11] X Research source Closures are also generally cheaper than frontals and full wigs, which is great if you’re trying to save some cash."

      "content": "A frontal is ideal if you want a uniform hairline and versatility. Frontals run from ear to ear, so they disguise the entirety of your hairline. If you hate messing with your edges or you’re self-conscious about your hairline, this makes frontals a great choice. Because the hairline is so uniform, you have a ton of styling options as well. [12] X Research source You can do side-parts, ponytails, or buns with a frontal. If you like changing your hair style regularly, this is the way to go! Unfortunately, a good frontal is usually more expensive than a closure."
