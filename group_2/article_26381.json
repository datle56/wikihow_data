But, when you really want to make a good impression, put on a smile so you can come across as friendly and open. If you're having a hard time smiling because you feel overwhelmed or stressed, try to find an activity that helps you relax—like playing a sport, hanging out with friends, or taking a long bath. If those things don't help, try talking about your feelings to your parents or another adult you trust."

As a pre-teen, though, you'll probably look your very best when you keep your makeup subtle—if you wear it at all. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Here are a few basics you can try: Use concealer to cover acne spots, or dark spots under your eyes. [2] X Research source Opt for tinted moisturizer or BB cream if you need to even out your skin tone. Try a cream or powder blush to add a little color to the roundest part of your cheeks. Use an eyelash curler to make your lashes stand out. Finish your look with clear or tinted lip gloss or balm—save lipstick for special occasions.

It's up to you how much effort you want to put in—you might feel perfectly confident just running a comb through your hair before you head out the door, and that's fine! But if you want to add a little extra to your look, try out a fun style like a low ponytail, messy bun, pulled-back braids, or wearing your hair half up and half down. If your hair is shorter, try using a little mousse to keep it in place throughout the day. You could also use barrettes or headbands for a more feminine look. Try to embrace your hair's texture—if it's curly or thick, for instance, look for styles that look best with a lot of volume, like an updo or puffs."

Luckily, a swipe of a combination antiperspirant and deodorant every morning will help keep that under control. It can help keep you from getting damp or yellow stains under the arms of your clothes, too—so in addition to smelling great, you may look better, too. Just wearing deodorant won't prevent odors from building up on other parts of your body, so be sure to shower or bathe every single day, too! Wear clean clothes every day, since sweat and oils can build up and make them smell funky. If you want, you can add a light spritz of body spray or perfume, but don't go overboard—strong fragrances can be really overwhelming to the people around you."

As the hair on your body starts growing in—or the hair that's already there gets thicker and darker—you might decide that you'd be more comfortable removing it. If the hair is growing over a large area, like your legs or your chin, you're probably better off using a shaving cream or gel and a sharp razor. You could also experiment with waxing, but ask an adult you trust for help so you don't burn yourself with the hot wax. If you only want to remove a few hairs, like around your upper lip or your eyebrows, try plucking them with a tweezer."
