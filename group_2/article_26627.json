This medication is the first one that doctors will go to, as it has the fewest side effects and you only need to take it twice a week. It will most likely shrink the benign tumor and bring your prolactin levels down over time. [3] X Expert Source Damaris Vega, MD Board Certified Endocrinologist Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. Roughly 75% of patients respond to medication, so you’ve got good odds here. [4] X Research source This medication can cause nausea and dizziness, although most patients report no side effects. The other typical medication is bromocriptine, which is more prone to make you nauseous. With this medication, your doctor will likely have you increase your dose gradually to lessen the side effects. Doctors typically only prescribe this if cabergoline proves ineffective.

A surgeon will go in and remove the tumor so that it can't cause issues like increased prolactin levels.

However, it's less common today since medication and surgery are so low-risk. Talk to your doctor about whether radiation may be preferable to surgery. [10] X Research source In some cases, radiation may be the only option if you don't respond to the medication and your tumor can't be operated on safely. [11] X Research source Sometimes, you may only need one treatment, while other tumors may take more treatments. It depends on the size and type of your tumor. The most common side effect is hypopituitarism, where your pituitary gland doesn't produce enough hormones. Very rare side effects can include damage to nearby brain tissue, including lesions or nerve damage.

If you’re on a medication that’s causing your prolactin levels to increase, talk to your doctor to discuss alternatives. There may be a different treatment for the same condition that won’t throw your prolactin levels off. Once you switch meds, your prolactin levels should stabilize on their own.
