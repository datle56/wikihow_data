      "content": "Make a good first impression. First impressions are crucial, so make sure yours is stellar. First impressions are always the ticket to having people love you. If people see you dressing well, then they'll want to be friends with you. Get a look that suits you, and wear it with confidence and pride."

      "title": "Show confidence.",
      "content": "Show confidence. This is incredibly important, as it makes or breaks the whole process. You can be a shining beauty, but if you do not have confidence, you will not go very far toward your goal. Walk with your head held high, back straight and a smile on your face. You might feel awkward, but it doesn't actually look as bad as you think it does. Speaking clearly and loudly is also part of having lots of confidence. Try not to be overconfident, or people might start to think that you are stuck up or snobby."

      "title": "Be fun.",
      "content": "Be fun. Everyone loves to be around people who can make them laugh and smile. Having fun is what also attracts people to you. When other people see you having fun, they'll want to join in on whatever you're doing, so make sure you look like you're having fun! Be hyper, crack jokes, make people feel comfortable around you. Even if someone that isn't your type approaches you, that means you're off to a good start."

      "content": "Say hi. Even if you are just walking in the corridors, say hi to people. They will realize that you are a nice person and will want to know you better."

    {
      "title": "Love yourself.",
      "content": "Love yourself. This goes without saying. If you love yourself, then people will see that and respect your self image. Compliment yourself. Treat yourself to massages, manicures or pedicures, or just hang out with your friends while having fun."

    {
      "title": "Stay healthy.",
      "content": "Stay healthy. You don't necessarily have to be fit, but eating lots of fruits and vegetables as well as drinking plenty of water really helps. When the proper amount of water is consumed (8 cups per day), your skin will glow and water will flush out all of the toxins. Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables helps your complexion too. Exercise regularly, aiming for two-three times a week. Build it up from there. Join a dance class, get some yoga DVDs or go biking with your friends."

    {
      "title": "Be clean.",
      "content": "Be clean. No one likes a smelly girl. Shower once a day, or at least every second day. Wash your hair every second day. You should exfoliate once to twice a week. Salt mixed with body wash is good for your body, but mix in a little white sugar with your facial cleanser to exfoliate the face. Don't do this too often, otherwise it can irritate the skin. Brush your teeth - preferably with a whitening product - twice a day, floss once daily so as not to make your gums bleed and use mouthwash for minty fresh breath. Don't forget that spritz of perfume before you leave."

      "title": "Care for your skin.",
      "content": "Care for your skin. Develop a skin cleansing routine for oily skin. If you are blessed with naturally flawless skin, still wash with cold water every morning and evening to prevent those dreaded pimples. Those with skin problems - try to keep your products as natural as possible. Tea tree oil is perfect. Cleanse every morning and evening. To wet your face, use warm water to open the pores. Gently smooth the cleanser over your entire face in circular motions, then rinse with cold water. And don't forget to moisturize!"

      "content": "Groom yourself. Make sure you look presentable, that your clothes are neat. Try to get some fashionable items into your wardrobes - wearing 'fad' items can actually gain you some respect. But don't directly copy the trends (say, if black converse are in, get a red pair). Make it your own."
