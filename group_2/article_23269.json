      "content": "Look for a sticker or stamp. If it says “Made in Italy” or “Made in Venice,” it is not likely to be Murano glass. These are two ways outside glass makers try to convince tourists that the item was likely made in Murano without stating it is. [2] X Research source An item that is labeled “Made in Murano” may be counterfeit. Currently, many items are made in China and sold in Venice as Murano glass. Similarly, if the item says “Murano-style” it is unlikely to be authentic Murano glass."

      "title": "Ask the seller whether the piece of Murano glass is new or old.",
      "content": "Ask the seller whether the piece of Murano glass is new or old. New glass from Murano should be accompanied by a certificate from the factory, guaranteeing it is Murano glass. If bought and sold by art or antiques dealers, it should accompany the piece of glass in all sales. Murano glass made before 1980 is unlikely to have a certificate, so this is only a surefire identification method for new glass."

      "content": "Look for a signature on the glass itself. The following are master glass makers from Murano: Ercole Barovier, Archimede Seguso, Aureliano Toso, Galliano Ferro, Vincenzo Nason, Alfredo Barbini, and Carlo Moretti. There are many more master glass makers that worked at Murano glass factories over the years. [3] X Research source If the signature looks as though it has been scratched into the surface after it hardened, with a carbide-tipped pen, it is likely a counterfeiter trying to sell a fake piece as a designer original. You will need to move on to the next method to find whether the signature is in the correct place. Catalogs will tell you about signature and label placement."

      "title": "Hire a glass expert to help you identify the glass.",
      "content": "Hire a glass expert to help you identify the glass. If the authenticity is still in question, you should contact a local glass antique expert and show them all the information you have. Although experts are not 100 percent accurate, they will have an easier time identifying it than almost anyone else. If you can’t find an expert, try posting pictures and information on an antique glass forum. You may be able to discover more creative ways of identifying the glass. A good indicator that a Murano piece is genuine is the cross-hatched pattern sometimes found on bases and the pinch pliers artists use often have their own identifiable patterns. And remember: if a piece of Murano sounds too cheap to buy, it's more than likely to be fake because even a small 5\" vase can often cost hundreds of pounds."
