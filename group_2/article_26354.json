      "content": "Put in novelty contact lenses. A doll’s eyes are exaggerated in size and color, so you may want to enhance the color or look of your eyes. If you want defined irises (the colored section of your eye), find a contact lens that creates a dark circle around the iris. These are usually called \"circle lenses.\" Novelty contact lenses can be purchased without a prescription. [2] X Research source Choose your lenses based on the look you want. Novelty lenses also come in heightened colors (like blue, green, purple, or gold-brown). Put in your lenses before you put on your eye makeup. You don't want to have any smudges!"

      "content": "Use concealer. Create the base for the rest of your makeup. Choose a concealer that is one shade lighter than your skin tone. Carefully apply the concealer around your eyes, nose, and cover any dark spots and blemishes on your face. Repeat this step two more times, making sure to blend the concealer really well. Blending is the only way to create an even, smooth layer."

      "content": "Powder your face. Use a powder that matches your natural skin tone; lightly apply the powder by gently blotting your face with a fluffy applicator. Many powders come with an applicator. Do not rub the powder in—you want to maintain a light look. You want the powder to be seen as this is what creates doll-like skin."

      "title": "Apply your eye makeup.",
      "content": "Apply your eye makeup. This is the most important step of looking like a doll because dolls most notably have large, deep-set eyes. You can create the same look using makeup, even if your eyes aren't very large or deep-set naturally. [3] X Research source Take a light eye shadow color in a pinky color and apply this all over your eyelids to the bottoms of your eyebrows. Then use a reddish-brown shade of eye shadow and apply it to the outer corner of your eyelids. Make sure to blend your eye shadow. You can do this using your fingers or a small brush. After you’ve applied the darker shade of eye shadow, use lip liner or eyeliner to line your lower eyelid. (The liner should be roughly the same color as the darker eye shadow.) Starting at the middle of your lower eyelid, apply the liner just under the lashes, and move the liner towards the outer corner of your eye. Lightly blend the liner outwards. [4] X Expert Source Jamie Bushman Master Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 15 September 2021. Use the same liner to draw a line in the crease of your upper lid. Lightly blend. (Tip: If you don't have a defined lid crease, you can create one .) Apply white or nude eyeliner to your waterline, or the inner part also known as the waterline (try to not touch the inside of your eye) of your eye just above your lower lashes. [5] X Expert Source Jamie Bushman Master Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 15 September 2021. Apply a dark shade of mascara to your upper and lower eyelashes. You will need to apply quite a bit in order to get the lashes thick and long. [6] X Expert Source Jamie Bushman Master Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 15 September 2021. Apply false eyelashes. Choose a pair of lashes with a lot of lashes, but makes sure they’re not too long. You want to bulk up your eyelashes, but you don’t want them to be distracting. Apply the lashes to your top eyelids. If you're hesitant about using fake eyelashes, you can also draw on fake lower lashes with a liquid line. Just draw little wisps below your eyelid."

      "content": "Make those lips pop. Use a neutral, dark lip liner and apply to your outer lips. Next, use a brighter liner to fill in your lips. Blend these two colors together, making sure that some of the darker liner remains—you want definition! Finally, apply a pink, red or sheer lipgloss, depending on the color you want. This will really make your lips shine!"

      "content": "Style your hair or try a wig. In addition to flawless skin, dolls have shiny, perfectly styled hair. Think about how you want your hair to look - Long or short? Straight, wavy, or curly? Natural or enhanced or fake color? Decide whether you can style your own hair or if you should opt for a wig instead, which can be purchased inexpensively and can be styled in the way you want. Straighten or curl your hair or opt for a particular hairstyle. Volume is usually a good choice when trying to look like a doll. Many people find they are able to get more volume if their hair isn't freshly washed. Try using a dry shampoo on your hair and them a volumizing product throughout the roots. This will give needed volume to your hair and make it pliable for whatever style you choose. If you want to look dramatically different in length or color, try wearing a wig. You can find wigs at beauty supply stores and costume shops. Don't forget to secure the wig so it doesn't fall off."
