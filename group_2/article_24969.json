Depending on the dog’s breed and temperament, there are several reasons that they could be trying to jump the fence. The most common reason is boredom.

Take your dog for a walk, play their favorite games out in the yard, or teach them a new trick before leaving the dog to their own devices. If you tire them out with activities, then your dog will be too tired to think about jumping the fence once you leave. [7] X Research source Generally speaking, the amount of exercise your dog needs each day will depend heavily on the dog's age and breed.

Go to source In adult dogs, high-energy breeds like border collies need more exercise than low-energy breeds like pugs or basset hounds. Puppies and young dogs have more energy, which often appears in bursts of energy called the \"zoomies,\" and usually need several short walks or play sessions throughout the day. Older dogs may not have has high a tolerance for exercising as they once did, but proper exercise each day is still critical to their health. If you’re busy, hire a dog-walker to take your pup for a spin around the block."

With enough to do at home, your dog is less likely to be tempted by the fence.

Invest in an outdoor bed, perhaps in the form of a doghouse, so that your dog has an area of their own to feel comfortable in. Give your dog plenty of time with you to ensure that they don't feel lonely."

[11] X Research source Stash treats around the yard in tricky places that your dog will have to reach by sniffing around and exploring. Mental stimulation is just as important (and takes up as much energy) as physical activity, so give your dog’s mind a workout and keep them interested in staying put until you’re ready to bring them back inside.

      "content": "If your dog knows basic commands , you can stop them from climbing. Your dog may get over excited about something and try to jump the fence, but if you spot it, you can use commands such as “come” and “stay” to both stop your dog from jumping, and reward your dog for their good behavior, so they remember it in the future. [13] X Research source “Come” is the easier command to master, so teach your dog this one first. Make sure that, once your dog comes to you successfully, you give them lots of praise and treats! That’s how they'll learn to keep doing it in the future. [14] X Research source “Stay” may be harder for your dog, but they'll get it in time. Hold out your hand palm-forward when you give your dog the command, as though directing traffic. Your dog probably won’t be able to sit still for long at first, but with practice and patience, they will learn to do this for longer periods and from greater distances. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Desensitizing your dog to noises means they won’t react so strongly.",
      "content": "Desensitizing your dog to noises means they won’t react so strongly. If your dog’s protection instinct is flaring up and causing them to jump the fence, work on desensitizing the dog over time to common loud noises. Once your dog gets comfortable with the sounds around your home, they won’t feel the need to get nervous and chase after every random noise they may hear. [16] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Start by playing a sound or video recording of the noises that tend to trigger your dog at a low volume. When you do, make sure your dog is doing something they enjoy at the same time, like eating or playing a game. Gradually turn the volume up as your dog gets used to it. If your dog starts getting upset, just dial back the volume to a level they can tolerate and keep working on it from there. Remain calm and cheerful while you do this, so that your dog can learn that these noises are nothing to worry about. Play with your dog outside of desensitization training too, so that they don't only associate a certain game with those loud noises! Never punish your dog if they try to escape due to their fear, or separation anxiety from you; this will only make them more afraid. Instead, use the methods above to train your dog out of their fear.

      "content": "Coyote rollers keep coyotes out, but will just as effectively keep dogs in. Coyote rollers are essentially bars or piping that are attached to the top of a chain fence and roll when an animal tries to climb over them, causing that animal to fall back and making entry (and escape) impossible. [19] X Research source If you can’t deter your dog from climbing the fence with toys, scents, exercise or extra training, then consider embellishing your fence and making it harder to climb. You can pay to have specifically-made coyote rollers installed on your chain fence, or you can build makeshift rollers yourself. To make your own coyote rollers, you’ll need a round PVC pipe and sturdy rope. “Thread” the pipe using the rope and string it horizontally along the top of your fence in places that your dog usually climbs."

They act as angled extensions that form an “L” shape and attach to the top of the fence, making it extremely difficult for a dog to climb over. [20] X Research source When attached to the bottom of the fence, the L-footers even be buried under the ground, and serve as a barrier to stop the dog from burrowing under the fence."

      "content": "Use landscaping to your advantage. Strategically placed trees and bushes can deter your dog from climbing the fence. As a bonus, adding some new hedging can also give your yard some extra style! For example, planting a line of bushes within a few feet of the fence will stop your dog from making a full running jump onto (or over) the fence—and, once the dog realizes they can’t make the jump, they'll stop trying.

      "content": "If your dog can’t see through the fence, they're less likely to jump it. A solid fence is the natural choice for this, but if you have a chain link or other type of fence that your dog can easily see through, you can attach slats or bamboo fencing to it and restrict the dog’s vision. [22] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Sounds and smells may still be an issue, but generally, if your dog can’t see through to the other side of the fence, they won’t want to climb over it so badly. Still, it’s best to only start restricting your dog’s view outside the yard when you’ve tried everything else first. [23] X Research source Slats are thin strips of plastic that can be attached to a chain link fence to partially obscure the view from it. Bamboo fencing is less expensive than putting up a whole new fence, and can be zip-tied to your existing fence to block your dog’s view. It’ll take longer, but for a more carefully landscaped option, you could also grow vines along the fence to obscure vision through it."

      "content": "Consider using microchips, a collar ID tag, or tracking devices. It's smart to be prepared, just in case your dog gets out! At the very least, ensure that the tag on your dog’s collar has up-to-date contact information. Also consider having your dog microchipped, so that the dog can be easily identified if they are taken to an animal shelter. For a more proactive solution, a GPS tracking device for your dog’s collar can tell you exactly where they are at all times. [24] X Research source When you purchase a GPS tracking device, make sure the one you pick has a long range and battery life. However, because GPS trackers normally rely on satellites, they’re less effective in remote areas. [25] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Make an appointment with your dog’s veterinarian to have them implanted with a microchip. It’s a very common and easy procedure, and afterwards, a microchip company will have your (and your dog’s) information on file should the dog run away and need identifying."

The easiest way to make sure your dog doesn’t jump the fence is to be there, supervising their outside time—and taking them inside when you can’t watch them at every moment. [26] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source You may not be able to be present all the time, but make a habit of watching your dog as often as you can. Your dog will be far more focused on spending time with you, and you can in turn enjoy quality time with your canine best friend. Overall, if you make your yard an area of fun and excitement and spend more time there yourself, your dog will prefer to stay put instead of trying to jump away."
