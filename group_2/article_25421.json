That means its eye will look mostly black as the pupil fills it. Your cat is trying to see everything it possibly can because it is afraid, and eye dilation helps it do that. [3] X Research source You've probably noticed the same reaction in humans. When you're watching a horror flick, your eyes \"go wide\"--dilate--at the scary parts! Dilated eyes can also be a sign that your cat is excited, so don't assume this means your cat is afraid. Instead, check the rest of your cat's body language to determine if the cat is afraid or excited. Additionally, it's helpful to consider the current environment."

      "content": "Look for loss of bladder and bowel control. If your cat is truly frightened out of its wits, it may defecate or urinate where it is. You may see this happen when you carry your cat in a carrier, for instance, on the way to the veterinarian; your cat may use the bathroom simply because it's frightened. Your cat may do this at home, too, particularly if its afraid of another cat, as it may not want to use the same litter box as the other cat."

That is not necessarily your fault, as some cats are just more fearful than others. Still, you should take note of this behavior so you can try to find ways to deal with it if you can. If your cat is new, it may just take time to get used to you."

Dragging a fearful cat out from its hiding place will only make matters worse. You can still encourage it to come out with a calm voice and treats, but you shouldn't yank it out of its hiding place. If possible, place its food, water, and litter box closer to its hiding place. That way, it won't have as far to go to get what it needs."

Have the person sit still in a room. Encourage the cat to come into the room with a toy or treats and slowly move it toward the new person. If your cat gets upset, let it go back to the other room, though you can encourage it to come out again with treats or a toy. Repeat these sessions, and over time, your cat may become used to having strangers around and even approach one."
