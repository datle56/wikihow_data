      "title": "Mix mochiko with water to make a soft dough.",
      "content": "Mix mochiko with water to make a soft dough. Put 1 cup (160 g) of mochiko into a heat-proof bowl and pour in 3 ‚ÅÑ 4 cup (180 ml) of water. Use a wooden spoon to stir until the mochiko is completely combined with the water. The dough should be soft and pliable. [1] X Research source It's important to use the mochiko (sweet rice flour) or mochi flour. Avoid using glutinous flour since it will not mix properly and the mochi won't steam correctly. If the mochiko still looks dry once you've stirred in the water, add extra water 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time."

      "title": "Set up a steamer on the stove.",
      "content": "Set up a steamer on the stove. Put a large pot on the stove and pour 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water into it. Turn the burner to high so the water begins to boil. Then set a steamer insert into the pot and turn the burner down to medium-high. The water should be simmering. [2] X Research source Ensure that the bottom of the steamer insert doesn't touch the water. The steamer insert should be large enough to hold the bowl with the mochi dough."

      "title": "Put the bowl of dough in the steamer and steam it for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the bowl of dough in the steamer and steam it for 20 minutes. Once the water is simmering, place the bowl with the dough directly into the steamer insert. Lay a clean kitchen towel over the bowl so the sides extend over the pot. Then set the lid on the pot and fold the ends of the towel up onto the lid. Set a timer for 20 minutes to let the dough cook. [3] X Research source If you don't have a steamer basket, cover the bowl and microwave the mochi dough for 3 1/2 minutes. The kitchen towel will absorb the moisture from the steam so it doesn't condense on the lid and fall onto the dough."

    {
      "title": "Remove the dough and put it in a small pot.",
      "content": "Remove the dough and put it in a small pot. Turn off the steamer and carefully lift the hot bowl of mochi dough out of the steamer insert. Scoop the steamed dough into a small pot and set the pot on the stove. [4] X Research source The steamed dough will be gluey in texture at this point."

    {
      "title": "Cook the dough over medium heat while you stir in the sugar.",
      "content": "Cook the dough over medium heat while you stir in the sugar. Get out 2 cups (400 g) of sugar and set it next to the stove. Heat the steamed mochi dough in the pot over medium heat and stir in 1/3 of the sugar. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves. Then stir in the remaining sugar in 2 batches. [5] X Research source It should take you about 10 minutes to gradually add all of the sugar and cook it until it's dissolved. The mochi dough should now look stretchy, sticky, and smooth."

      "title": "Dust a baking sheet with cornstarch and put the mochi on it.",
      "content": "Dust a baking sheet with cornstarch and put the mochi on it. Set a rimmed baking sheet on your work surface and sprinkle enough cornstarch to cover the bottom of the sheet. Spoon the hot mochi onto the sheet. [6] X Research source The cornstarch will make it easier to handle the sticky mochi dough."

      "title": "Cut the mochi dough small, bite-sized pieces.",
      "content": "Cut the mochi dough small, bite-sized pieces. Dust your hands or a rolling pin and spread the mochi as thin as you like. Take a knife and cut the dough into squares or rectangles that are even in size. Dust the pieces with kinako (soybean powder) and set them on a serving dish. [7] X Research source It's important to cut the mochi into small pieces to reduce the risk of choking. Large pieces can easily become stuck in someone's throat and the gummy texture makes it difficult to swallow. If you prefer, just pinch off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of dough. Roll the dough between your palms until you form a ball of mochi."

      "title": "Store the mochi for up to 2 days, if necessary.",
      "content": "Store the mochi for up to 2 days, if necessary. The high amount of sugar will prevent the mochi from drying or cracking right away. For the best texture, try to eat the mochi as soon as possible. To store the mochi for the short term, put it in an airtight container and keep it at room temperature for up to 2 days.

      "title": "Add a few drops of extract if you want to flavor the mochi dough.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of extract if you want to flavor the mochi dough. Stir in just a few drops of your favorite flavoring extract such as strawberry, grape, almond, or lemon. If you'd like to make matcha-flavored mochi, add 1 teaspoon (2 g) of matcha powder to the mochiko. [9] X Research source For a chocolate-flavored mochi, stir 1/4 cup (45 g) of melted chocolate chips into the dough as you add the sugar."

      "title": "Roll and cut the mochi into decorative shapes, if desired.",
      "content": "Roll and cut the mochi into decorative shapes, if desired. If you want to serve mochi in fun shapes, make a batch of mochi and use cornstarch-dusted palms or a rolling pin to roll the mochi dough as thin as you like. Then dip small cookie cutters into cornstarch and press them into the dough. Remove the cookie cutters and gently push the decorative mochi out. Serve the mochi cut-outs right away. For example, cut the mochi into large squares or small triangles. You could also cut the mochi into stars, hearts, or leaves."

      "content": "Shape the mochi around sweet red bean paste to make daifuku. Make a batch of mochi and purchase or make anko (sweet red bean paste). Flatten a little bit of prepared mochi and place a spoonful of anko in the middle. Wrap the mochi around the anko to completely enclose it. Serve the stuffed mochi immediately.

      "content": "Fill a ball of mochi with fruit or chocolate to make a rich treat. If you want to make fancy mochi, steam a batch of mochi. Then press a fresh strawberry or blueberry into a small mound of mochi. Push the mochi around the fruit so it's completely contained. If you prefer a different filling, make or buy chocolate ganache. Freeze small spoonfuls of ganache and then wrap the prepared mochi around it. [11] X Research source Try freezing small spoonfuls of caramel to use as mochi filling as well."

      "content": "Wrap mochi around ice cream to make a cold dessert. Scoop your favorite ice cream into small balls and freeze it until the balls are completely solid. Then wrap enough prepared mochi around the ice cream to cover it completely. Freeze the mochi ice cream for 2 hours before you serve it. [12] X Research source Set the mochi ice cream at room temperature for 5 minutes before you serve it so the mochi softens just a little. If you made mochi ice cream, store it in the freezer for up to 2 months."
