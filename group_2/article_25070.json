      "title": "Spray a non-repellent spray on the nest to kill ants at the source.",
      "content": "Spray a non-repellent spray on the nest to kill ants at the source. Mix 0.8 fluid ounces (24 mL) of the pesticide per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a pump sprayer and cover each anthill in your yard. The pesticide kills most ants within 1 week. Non-repellent pesticides create a barrier that ants pass through so that they bring the poison back to the nest. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Always follow the specific directions for the pesticide you’re using. These are typically printed on a label on the container. Pay attention to where ants are coming from in your yard. They might be near your house, along a fence, or in the cracks of your pavement. Look for small mounds of dirt to find the ant nests. Limit spreading pesticides to every 6 months. Using too much pesticide at a time can be harmful to your health."

      "title": "Apply the pesticide around your home to stop ants from coming inside.",
      "content": "Apply the pesticide around your home to stop ants from coming inside. Add a non-repellent pesticide to a garden sprayer. Hold the tip of the garden sprayer 6 inches (15 cm) above the ground and spray around your home’s perimeter and 1 foot (0.30 m) up onto your foundation. Spray around wire boxes, pipe connections, and any other areas you notice ants entering and exiting your home. [2] X Research source Spray around windows and door frames as well. Apply the pesticides on a day when it isn’t windy so they do not blow away from the area you’re targeting."

      "title": "Spread granular pesticide across your lawn for larger infestations.",
      "content": "Spread granular pesticide across your lawn for larger infestations. Granular pesticides contain poison that ants carry deep into their nest, thinking that it’s food. Pour the bag of granular pesticide into a garden spreader and walk it across your lawn. The spreader throws the pesticide across your lawn for maximum coverage. Then, lightly water your lawn to wet the granules. [3] X Research source Some bags of granular pesticides have built-in shakers that allow you to spread them in concentrated areas or around the perimeter of your home. Keep pets and children inside for at least 1 hour to let the pesticide dry. [4] X Research source Mow your lawn right before you spread the pesticide so it reaches the ground."

      "content": "Place bait traps near your home for hands-off pest control. Set the bait traps where you notice ants entering or exiting your home. Bait traps have granules that attract ants and contain poison that kills them as it’s digested. Dispose of your old traps after 1 month. [5] X Research source Some bait traps contain liquid that attracts ants and traps them inside. It often takes several weeks for bait traps to work and kill the ant colony. Find bait traps at your local home and garden store."

      "title": "Pour soapy water into the anthill to target the entire colony.",
      "content": "Pour soapy water into the anthill to target the entire colony. Mix 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 mL) of mild liquid dish soap with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Rake back the anthill to expose the main opening. Then, slowly pour the water into the hole of the ant nest. The hot water along with the soap kills the ants and prevents them from escaping their nest. [6] X Research source Pour the solution into a spray bottle for a more controlled method of dispersing the water. Use it to kill stray ants you see in your yard and home. Pour the water into the nest in the early morning or late at night when most of the ants are inside. Boiling the water is often a more effective way to kill the ants. Just use caution when pouring it around grass and plants, as it can damage or kill them."

      "title": "Make homemade bait with boric acid to kill the ants within a few days.",
      "content": "Make homemade bait with boric acid to kill the ants within a few days. Add 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of boric acid and 1 cup (201 g) of sugar to 3 cups (710 ml) of warm water; either diluted liquid boric acid or a powdered boric acid works well. This creates a sweet, poisonous mixture that attracts the ants to take the bait. Pour the mixture into shallow containers or lids and place them along trails or wherever you see ants. The ants bring the bait to the anthill to share, which in turn kills the colony. [7] X Research source Keep the bait stations away from your children and pets. Boric acid is toxic to humans and animals if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Never use it in an area where you prepare food, and wear gloves and a face mask to protect yourself while using it. If you spill any boric acid, wipe it up immediately."

      "title": "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the anthill to dry out the infestation.",
      "content": "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the anthill to dry out the infestation. Use horticultural diatomaceous earth (DE) so it doesn’t kill your plants. Spread the DE around the ant nest as well as any trails you see in your yard. For preventative measures, sprinkle it around the perimeter of your house to keep ants outside. Diatomaceous earth dries the liquids inside the ants and kills them within a few days or weeks. Wear a dust mask so you don’t inhale the DE while you spread it. DE is safe to keep in your yard around children and pets."

      "content": "Pour white school glue directly into the anthill to plug up the opening. Use a rake to clear the top of the ant hill and expose the main opening. Then, squeeze a bottle of white school glue into the nest to clog the hole and fill the nest. The glue kills the ants that get stuck inside and pushes any surviving ants to a new nest.

      "content": "Make a repellent spray with orange peels and vinegar to steer ants away. Mix equal parts water and vinegar in a pot and drop in 2 to 3 orange peels. Bring the mixture to a boil on the stove, then turn the heat off. Let the orange peels steep in the water overnight before transferring the mixture to a spray bottle. Shake the bottle to mix the solution. Then, spray the mixture along your driveway, patio, doors, windows, and directly onto the nest to keep the ants away. [9] X Research source This method drives ants away rather than killing them. Use a blender to combine the orange peel with the water and vinegar to make a thicker solution that can kill some ants on contact."

      "title": "Sprinkle baby powder around the nest and along trails to repel ants.",
      "content": "Sprinkle baby powder around the nest and along trails to repel ants. Ants tend to steer clear of talc products, especially ones like baby powder that have a powerful scent. Spread the baby powder around the nests and use a funnel to pour it directly inside. Then, spread it where you see ant trails and across entry points to create a barrier against the ants. [10] X Research source Use baby powder around the perimeter of your house to keep ants out. Chalk, baking soda, petroleum jelly, and cinnamon are other effective substances that repel ants."

      "content": "Clean up food spills and don’t leave any food outside. Ants are attracted to any crumbs and spills you make. So, make sure to take in your food when you’re done eating and wipe up any messes as soon as they happen. If you feed your animals outside, rinse and take their food bowls back inside when they’re finished eating. Be sure to store any pet food and birdseed in air-tight containers, too. [13] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Throw away your garbage in tightly sealed bags to keep your garbage bin as clean as possible. Rinse off food scraps before you place cans and packages in the recycling, too. Removing an ant’s food source often makes any bait you set out more attractive, which can kill them more quickly."
