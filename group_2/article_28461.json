      "content": "Mix the soap and olive oil. On a small plate, combine 2 parts of antibacterial dish soap with 1 part of olive oil. Swirl the two together with a spoon until they’re fully mixed. [1] X Research source The antibacterial soap will kill any germs or bacteria on the brushes, while the olive oil will help break down stubborn makeup so the brushes rinse clean. Don’t use a paper plate for mixing the cleaner. The oil will seep through paper."

      "content": "Wet your brushes. Take the brushes that you plan to clean and run them under lukewarm water. Run your fingers over the bristles to ensure that they’re all completely wet. [2] X Research source Be careful to hold the brushes with the bristles facing down when you wet them. If water gets inside the brushes’ ferrell, the part of the brushes just below the bristles that holds them to the handle, it may loosen the glue so bristles start falling out."

      "content": "Dip the brushes in the cleaner and work it through the bristles. Coat all of the brushes’ bristles with the soap mixture. Next, run the brushes back and forth over the palm of your hand to work the cleaner in. Keep moving the brushes over your hand until the suds are no longer colored with makeup. [3] X Research source For extremely dirty makeup brushes, you may need to wipe off the suds and dip the brushes in the cleaner a second time."

      "content": "Rinse the brushes and air dry them. Once the soapy residue is no longer colored, run the brushes under lukewarm water until no suds come out of the bristles. Gently reshape the wet bristles with your fingers, and lay them flat to air dry. [4] X Research source If possible, lay your brushes flat on the edge of a table or counter so the bristles hang over the edge. That will keep any moisture from seeping into the ferrule.

      "title": "Combine all of the ingredients in a container.",
      "content": "Combine all of the ingredients in a container. Add ½ cup (118 ml) of witch hazel, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of liquid castile soap, 1 cup (237 ml) of distilled water, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of nourishing oil, such as olive, jojoba, or almond, in a mason jar or other container. Put a lid on the container, and shake it well to thoroughly mix all of the ingredients. [5] X Research source The witch hazel in the cleaner is antibacterial so it kills any germs on your brushes. The castile soap removes makeup residue and other dirt. The oil also helps break down makeup and helps condition the brushes too. Because the oil may separate from the other ingredients, always shake the cleaner before using it."

Place the brushes in the cleaner, and let them soak for 5 to 10 minutes. [6] X Research source If you prefer, you can put the cleaner in a spray bottle, spray some on the brushes, and then rub the bristles over a towel."

Run them under lukewarm water in the sink to rinse them, and carefully shape the wet bristles with your fingers. Set the brushes out on a counter or table to air dry. [7] X Research source Be sure not to dry the brushes with the bristles up in the air. Water can drip back into the brushes’ ferrule, which can cause bristles to fall out."

      "title": "Pour the alcohol into a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Pour the alcohol into a spray bottle. Add 5 ounces (148 ml) of isopropyl alcohol to a clean plastic or glass spray bottle. Make sure that there is enough room at the top of the bottle to mix in the water and oil. [8] X Research source For the best results, use 70% isopropyl alcohol in the brush cleaner spray. The alcohol doesn’t just serve as a disinfectant for the brushes; it also helps the cleaner dry more quickly so you can spot clean your brushes and use them right away. Your spray bottle should hold at least 8 ounces (237 ml)."

Shake the bottle well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully mixed. [9] X Research source The essential oil is meant to cover the alcohol scent of the cleaner, so you can use whichever fragrance you prefer. However, you may want to use an oil with antibacterial properties, such as eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender, or tea tree oil. Because the oil may separate from the other ingredients, always shake the spray well before using it."

Run the brushes back and forth over a towel or piece of paper towel. Allow the brush to air dry for a minute or two, and then use the brush as you normally would. [10] X Research source Feel the brushes’ bristles before using them after cleaning to make sure that the cleaner has dried completely."
