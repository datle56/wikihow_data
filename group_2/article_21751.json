      "content": "Determine where to hang your picture. If you're hanging a notably heavy picture, you should locate a stud in the wall and prepare to hang the picture there. For most average, medium weight pictures, though, you should be able to use nearly any space on the wall. Once you know where you plan on hanging the picture, use a tape measure to determine where the screw will go. Measure where the picture loop is on the back of the frame, then measure out the same dimensions on the wall. After you have determined where the screw will go, lightly mark that location with an \"X\" using a pencil."

      "content": "Place painter's tape over the mark. Rip off a small piece of painter's tape and poke a hole in the middle of it using the tip of your pencil. Place the tape on the wall so that this hole lies over the \"X\" on your wall. The painter's tape will provide an additional guide for you when you drill the hole into your wall."

      "title": "Place another bit of tape below the hole.",
      "content": "Place another bit of tape below the hole. Ripe off a slightly longer strip of painters tape and fold it in half lengthwise, with the non-adhesive side folded in. Stick one half of this tape to the wall, just a little below the \"X.\" The other half of the tape should lie roughly perpendicular to your wall, sticky side up. The adhesive on your mock shelf should catch most of the dust and debris that you'll produce when you drill into the wall, making the clean up process much simpler later on. Strictly speaking, this step is not entirely necessary, but it can be a big help. This tape shelf should be about 4 inches (10 cm) long or so, and positioned about 2 inches (5 cm) below the hole in your wall."

      "content": "Carefully drill a hole into the plaster. Check the instructions on the back of your package of screws and anchors to determine how big the drill bit should be. Then, use this drill bit and an electric drill to drill into the \"X\" on your wall. For an average set of wall anchors, you will usually need 1 3/16 drill bit. The drill bit will usually need to be just a fraction smaller than the anchor you plan on using. Again, though, it is best to follow the recommendation on the back of the wall anchor package when selecting the right bit. The drill will stop moving inward when it hits the end of the plaster. If it starts moving more slowly at some point, you may have hit a layer of lath beneath the plaster. You can drill into this layer slightly without causing much harm, but you should stop drilling once you feel it. Drill as straight and cleanly as possible. The side of your hole should be the size of your drill bit and no larger."

      "title": "Hammer an anchor into the wall.",
      "content": "Hammer an anchor into the wall. Place the anchor directly over the hole in your wall. Tap the anchor into the hole, using just enough force to drive it in without bending the anchor or cracking the wall. Remove the tape covering your hole before hammering the anchor inside. If your hole is not large enough, a plastic anchor will bend. If the anchor starts bending, you should take it out and make the hole a little larger. The anchor needs to be snug and straight inside the wall. Note that the anchor should also be flush with the wall. Wall anchors consist of a sleeve that expands into the wall once you drive a screw into it. As a result, the screw will sit more securely inside the wall. This sleeve also minimizes the amount of stress put on the plaster. Plastic anchors are among the most common and will usually suffice for this project. Note that there are also anchors made from fiber, wood, and metal, however, so you have a range of options to choose from. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fix the screw into your anchor. Place the screw in the hole of your anchor and use a screwdriver to wind it in. Do not make the head flush against the wall, though. Instead, let a small portion of the screw stick out. Since using a screwdriver can require considerable strength, you could opt to use your drill, instead. Make sure that you have the right size drill bit on it and work slowly to prevent the screw from driving too deep into the wall. The screw should jut out from the wall by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm)."

Most of the dust and debris should be on your tape. Fold the tape inward, sealing the dust inside the exposed adhesive. If you work carefully, you might be able to avoid spilling debris anywhere else. Use a dry cloth to wipe off any dust that does get on the wall and a broom or vacuum to get any debris off the floor."

      "content": "Clean and dry the wall. Before you attach an adhesive to a plaster wall, you need to clean the surface of the plaster to strip away any oils and dirt. Dry the plaster thoroughly when finished. Adhesive glue will not stick to a surface that is dirty or dusty. [4] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. Thoroughly drying the wall is important for the sake of the adhesive, but plaster is also fairly porous, so mildew and similar problems may develop if you allow it to stay damp. As such, drying the wall after washing it is twice as important. There are a few different ways you can clean plaster, but the simplest is to use warm water and mild liquid dish soap. Soak a non-abrasive washcloth in warm water, then place a bead of mild soap on the cloth. Work the soap into a small patch of suds on the cloth. Rub the area of your wall down with your soapy cloth. Scrub gently, using a circular motion. Rinse the cloth in warm water, then use it to wipe away any soap residue on the wall. Use a dry non-abrasive washcloth to wipe away all the moisture on your wall, using a circular motion again. Be as thorough as possible."

      "title": "Choose an adhesive hanger.",
      "content": "Choose an adhesive hanger. A simple adhesive picture hook should be enough to hang a light picture, but these hooks come in different shapes and sizes. When selecting one, look on the front or back of the package to determine whether or not the hook you've chosen is sturdy enough to support the weight of your picture. Keep in mind the side of the picture loop or wire hanging off the back of the frame. You should try to choose a hook thickness that this loop or wire will be able to fit onto. Extremely light pictures without frames might hang on the wall will nothing but a piece of double-sided tape. Similarly, moderately light pictures without frames might be able to hang directly on the adhesive square instead of needing a hook. If you want to be on the safe side, though, using the picture hook will still be your best bet under most circumstances."

One side of the adhesive square should be labeled “wall side,” while the other should be labeled “hook side,” “picture side,” or something similar. Attach the wall side of the adhesive to the wall, then press the hook on the hook side of the adhesive square. Place one hook on the wall at the location your picture loop or wire will sit. If your picture hooks are too thick to fit into the hoop hanging off the back of your frame, consider placing two hooks on the wall where the bottom edge of the picture will rest. These two hooks will need to be evenly positioned horizontally, and the space between them should be just a little smaller than the bottom width of the picture."

If using two hooks instead of one, you will use these two hooks like a shelf by resting the bottom of the picture on top of them. This step should complete the process."
