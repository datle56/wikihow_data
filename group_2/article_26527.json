[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try drinking some coffee if you find yourself craving food or going for seconds at meals. This may reduce your cravings until a meal or to get you through a long meal. Consider having decaf or half-caff if you don’t want to drink a full cup of coffee or its close to your bedtime. You should avoid caffeine within four to six hours of your bedtime, if possible. Drinking coffee too close to your bedtime can interrupt your sleep and promote weight gain."

Drinking coffee and water together throughout the day may help you stay fuller longer and avoid the temptation of eating. In addition, it can prevent you from drinking too much coffee and disrupting your sleep. Aim to get 3 liters of water a day if you are a man and 2.2 if you are a woman.

If you cannot drink black coffee, use skim milk and sugar-free sweeteners instead. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be aware that heavy whipping cream and half-and-half have 52 and 20 calories per tablespoon respectively. They also have a lot of fat. Table sugar has 49 calories per tablespoon. Adding just one tablespoon of each adds about 100 empty calories. If you usually add more, that can easily end up adding calories that promote weight gain. Eliminate butter if you add butter (as with bulletproof coffee). One tablespoon of butter is 102 calories and has almost 12 grams of fat. Both of these can keep you from losing weight. Try switching to a skim milk or heartier unsweetened nut milk like coconut for richer flavor. [7] X Research source Make sure to get unsweetened creamers and milks. Flavored milks often use sugar or other additives that add empty calories. Reading the nutrition information on the products can help you figure out how many calories each serving of a given product has. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Consider drinking iced coffee if the taste of plain black coffee is too strong. It often has a milder taste. Just make sure it’s not sweetened with sugar. Add flavors to your regular coffee.

But excessive coffee consumption can lead to increased stress levels and insomnia, both of which can lead to overeating.

Not only can this give you an added boost at work or during exercise, but may also suppress food cravings. Stick to the daily limits as much as possible. For example, if you can safely drink 4 cups of coffee per day, you could have a cup in the morning, one at lunch, one mid-afternoon and a cup at dinner.

This will allow you to safely drink coffee up to eight times a day and may help you more effectively lose weight. Make sure to read product labels to ensure you’re getting half-caffeinated coffee. The label may also indicate how much caffeine is in a cup. So long as you’re staying within the safe consumption limits every day, you can have as many cups of half-caff as you like. Make your own half-caff by mixing one-half cup of regular coffee with one-half cup of decaf coffee. Another trick is to drink a half a cup of regular coffee with a half a cup of hot water. If you use a Keurig, just leave the K-cup in the Keurig, and brew it again using the same K-cup."

Having three balanced and healthy meals every day can help you shed weight and burn excess fat. Whole foods that are high in vitamins and minerals, complex carbohydrates, and moderate amounts of fat can promote your well being and help you lose weight. [16] X Expert Source Lyssandra Guerra Certified Nutrition & Wellness Consultant Expert Interview. 3 March 2020. Subtracting 500 – 1,000 calories per day from your current intake is a good rule of thumb to follow when cutting calories. Remember that you shouldn’t go below 1,200 calories a day or you may not see any results (because your body thinks you are starving and is conserving energy and fat) and you will also be miserable because you’re not getting enough to eat. If you want to know an exact number, the National Institutes of Health has devised a new tool that can help you specifically pinpoint how many calories you need every day in order to lose weight. There are many different sites at which you can access this calculator including http://www.healthyweightforum.org/eng/calculators/calories-required/ . Incorporate different foods from the five food groups into your daily meals and snacks. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. Make sure to vary your choices so that you get a range of nutrients to promote your health and weight loss. Healthy foods often also have a lot of fiber, which can help keep you full throughout the day. Eat whole fruits and vegetables such as raspberries, blueberries, broccoli and carrots. Get your whole grains from foods like whole wheat pasta or bread, oatmeal, brown rice or cereal. For protein, eat lean cuts of meat like pork or poultry as well as cooked beans, eggs, or peanut butter. Your dairy will come from sources like cheese, yogurt, cow and nut milks, and even ice cream."

You might be excited to overhaul your diet, but doing so gradually can keep you from going back to bad habits. Consider beginning by replacing processed foods or junk food. For example, try brown rice with meals instead of white rice. You can also add more vegetables to your plate than rice. You could also make air-popped popcorn or bake kale chips instead of having potato chips. Let yourself cheat once a week or if you reach a certain goal.

For dinner, have a family dinner of fish with a small salad and a side of steamed cauliflower. If you want dessert, have some fresh fruit or a sugar-free popsicle. If you know you will be dining out, include this in your plan. Either look at the restaurant's online menu or call ahead to see what healthy choices they offer. Select a couple of different healthy options from the menu and put those on your plan. Make sure to stay away from buffets, breadbaskets, dishes in heavy sauces, and fried foods.
