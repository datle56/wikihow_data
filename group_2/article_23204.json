      "content": "Find out what year the building was built. Knowing what year a building was constructed will give you a good idea of whether or not aluminum wiring was used instead of another metal. If you do not already know, ask the building's owner or previous owner, landlord, or superintendent. If the building was constructed between 1965 and 1973, it is likely that is has aluminum wiring. If you can't get the information this way, visit the Library of Congress website at http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/ to see if historical records pertaining to the building are available. Helpful historical documents could include building plans or contracts."

Even if the building was built before the rise in popularity of aluminum wiring, don't assume that your wiring is not aluminum. If circuits were added or modified after 1965, installers may have used aluminum wiring for the repairs. Inquire with the building's management company, owner, landlord, or superintendent to see what electrical work was done on the building and when it was done.
