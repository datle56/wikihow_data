      "title": "Warm up first.",
      "content": "Warm up first. The ice rink is cold, so it’s important to get your blood pumping and warm up your muscles before skating to prevent injury. Focus on dynamic movements and stretches to get your joints and muscles ready for activity. Here’s what you can do: [1] X Research source Jog in place for 1 minute. Roll your neck from side to side. Move your ankles around in a circle. Twist your torso from side to side. Grab your foot and pull your heel back to your buttocks. Kick your legs forward and from side to side. Do jumping jacks ."

      "title": "Lace your skates up tight.",
      "content": "Lace your skates up tight. Before you get on the ice, it’s important to ensure your skates are on properly. A tightly laced skate helps protect your foot and ankle from injury, so tighten the laces until the shoe is snug over your foot. [2] X Research source Check the tightness of your skates with your fingers. If you can fit your fingers under the laces, it’s too loose. The perfect skate for you isn’t too big or too small. There should be enough room to wiggle your toes. Try putting on your skates and walking around off the ice to get used to them on a surface with more grip."

      "title": "Look straight ahead with your knees bent to maintain your balance.",
      "content": "Look straight ahead with your knees bent to maintain your balance. Now that you know the basics, it’s time to start moving! Stand tall with your knees slightly bent and your head up. Keep your upper body over your feet. Hold your hands out in front of you, and point your toes in the direction you want to go. [3] X Research source Think of it like stacking your hips, shoulders, and head on top of your feet. Looking down can throw you off balance, so always keep your chin and eyes up (especially when starting out). This position is preparing you to move forward. Plus, holding your body over your skates is a great way to practice and keep your balance. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Step or march to move forward.",
      "content": "Step or march to move forward. Skate forward by stepping or marching one foot at a time. Angle your toes slightly out, and make little movements. Push on your skate each time you bring a foot down to propel yourself forward. [5] X Research source Lean forward slightly to give yourself more momentum and keep your balance. Hold onto the rink’s barrier for help if you need it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put your feet in a “V” shape and push outwards to glide.",
      "content": "Put your feet in a “V” shape and push outwards to glide. Gliding is a form of marching that can help you move faster on the ice. Place your feet in a “V” position with your toes angled outward and your heels in. Take small steps, alternating between sliding one foot forward and back. [7] X Research source Push harder and faster as you get the hang of the movement to move quicker on the ice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Extend your foot behind you to do a stroke.",
      "content": "Extend your foot behind you to do a stroke. Stroking is the same as gliding, except you’re extending the motion. Start with your feet in the “V” position. Then, push off with one foot, extending the foot you pushed with out behind you. Bring the extended foot back down and repeat on the other side. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bring your toes out and in to swizzle.",
      "content": "Bring your toes out and in to swizzle. Swizzles are a fun and creative way to get around the ice. Start with your feet in a “V” position. Bend your knees and ankles and press inward. Let your feet move forward and separate with the motion. Straighten your knees and bring your toes together. Repeat this to create a “scissoring” effect with your feet going in and out. [9] X Research source Keep practicing swizzles until you feel completely comfortable with the move. Eventually, you can start lifting your skates off the ice in alternating patterns as you skate."

      "title": "Use your upper body to turn.",
      "content": "Use your upper body to turn. Turning while on the ice isn’t as hard as it looks! Simply move your head and shoulders ever so slightly in the direction you want to go, and let your feet follow. So, if you want to go right, angle your upper body to the right. This isn’t to say your feet won’t move at all while turning. Essentially, the direction your toes are pointed is the direction you’ll end up going. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn to stop.",
      "content": "Learn to stop. Before you start moving fast, make sure you know how to stop your skates . Stand with your feet together and push your feet apart, or stick one skate out sideways. This will help stop your momentum and slow you down. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Practice falling.",
      "content": "Practice falling. Falling is part of the sport—even the pros fall every now and then! In other words, falling is inevitable. So, get used to this feeling by allowing yourself to fall. When falling, practice these techniques to help prevent injury: [12] X Research source If you anticipate needing to fall, bend your knees and squat into a dip position. Fall sideways, leaning forward, and place your hands on your lap. As soon as you fall, roll over onto your hands and knees. One at a time, place your feet between your hands. Then, gently push yourself back up."

      "title": "Practice frequently.",
      "content": "Practice frequently. We know it sounds cliché, but practice makes perfect! The more you get on the ice, the easier skating will become. Just remember, even the pros had to start somewhere, so don’t be too hard on yourself. Ice skating can 100% be self-taught! There are hundreds of online tutorials out there to learn from. Plus, the more you get on the ice and learn for yourself, the better you’ll be. If you’re really serious about skating, sign up for ice skating lessons or hire a professional or coach to help guide you. Search for lessons or ice skating instructors near you by going to your local rink or searching “ice skating lessons near me” online."

      "title": "Opt for lighter clothes that are tight-fitting.",
      "content": "Opt for lighter clothes that are tight-fitting. When ice skating, wear clothes that are easy to move in and aren’t heavy or bulky. Skating is exercise, so your body will get warmer once you move around, preventing you from getting cold on the ice. Go for a fitted top with leotards, tights, or leggings. [13] X Research source Go with layers that are easy to take on and off. For example, you may start off with a fitter sweater, light insulated coat, or vest, but you can easily take it off to reveal a tight, long-sleeve shirt underneath. If you're skating in an outdoor rink, wear similar attire. However, you may want to choose slightly thicker fabrics or add layers. For example, wear a light tank top under a form-fitted sweater."

    {
      "title": "Wear socks or tights to protect your feet and ankles.",
      "content": "Wear socks or tights to protect your feet and ankles. To keep your feet warm, wear either skating tights or microfiber socks. It's important your feet are exposed to as little moisture as possible to keep warm. Use either tights or microfiber cloths when skating. [14] X Research source Opt for tall and thin socks that go above your ankle and skate. Additionally, wearing layers on your feet can help prevent blisters. Avoid wearing cotton or fluffy socks, as these can cause blisters and don’t breathe as easily."

      "title": "Keep your hands warm with gloves.",
      "content": "Keep your hands warm with gloves. If your hands get cold easily, don’t skip on wearing gloves! They don’t have to be anything fancy, just something to keep your hands warm. If you get too hot during your skate, you can simply take them off. [15] X Research source Consider bringing a backup pair of gloves with you. If you fall and touch the ice with your hands, your gloves will get wet, and once they’re wet, your hands will get cold."

      "title": "Wear skates that fit properly.",
      "content": "Wear skates that fit properly. Skates should be fitted for comfort and are available in most shoe sizes. When purchasing ice skates, it’s best to have your foot fitted by a professional. So, head to the ice rink or your local skate shop if you’re serious about getting into the sport. [16] X Research source A skate that is too small can cause blisters and be more difficult to skate in. A skate that is too large won’t support your ankle properly and can cause injuries. You can rent ice skates when you first start ice skating. This allows you to explore different brands and sizes to figure out what works for you. Ensure that the blades on your skates are sharpened before stepping on the ice, as dull blades won’t be as smooth to skate in."

      "content": "Think about wearing a helmet for safety. If this is your first time skating or stepping on the ice in a while, wearing a helmet might be a good idea. While this isn’t necessary skating attire, it can prevent injury if you fall on the ice. [17] X Research source Avoid wearing anything under your helmet."
