      "content": "Create a work area with newspapers and a drop cloth. Choose a room where you have a lot of space to spread out, such as your living room, a craft room, or your kitchen counter. Lay newspapers or a drop cloth on the floor to protect it. Have paper towels handy in case a stray drip lands outside the covered area."

      "title": "Find a face model.",
      "content": "Find a face model. You will need someone to act as a face model so you can mold the mask properly. Pick someone who does not mind being still for at least 30 minutes to one hour. Ask them to lay on the ground on their back or sit in a straight-backed chair with their face tilted upward. You can use your own face as a model for the mask, though this may be a little tricky to maneuver. It may be easier to find someone who can act as a face model, so you can mold the mask properly."

      "title": "Cut the bandage plaster into strips with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut the bandage plaster into strips with scissors. The strips should be about 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) wide by 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Make some of the strips shorter than others so you have a variety of strips to use. Cut about 10-15 strips so you have enough to cover the person’s face in two layers of plaster. [1] X Research source When you are finishing cutting the plaster strips, place them in a bowl."

      "content": "Use smaller strips for their nose and upper lip. Save the inner areas of their face for last. Be careful when applying the strips to the person’s nose and upper lip, as these can be sensitive areas. Make sure you do not cover the person’s nostrils with plaster, so they can breathe. Leave a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) gap around the nostrils."

    {
      "title": "Cover their eyes and mouth with plaster if desired.",
      "content": "Cover their eyes and mouth with plaster if desired. Let your model know that you are going to be covering these areas so they are prepared. Ask them to close their eyes and then use smaller strips to cover them entirely, pressing the strip into the contours of their eyes. Then, ask them to close their mouth and use a strip to cover their mouth. Covering the eyes and mouth is optional, based on the person’s preference. You may keep the mouth uncovered if you want the person to be able to speak clearly to others while wearing the mask. You may keep the eyeholes uncovered so the person can see while wearing the mask."

      "content": "Wait 12 to 15 minutes. Ask the person to remain still so the mask can air dry. As it starts to set, it may feel hard or a bit itchy. This is to be expected. Do not apply a hairdryer or a fan to the mask to speed up drying, as this can cause it to crack. It can also put your model’s skin at risk."

      "content": "Have the person move their mouth and jaw to help loosen the mask. Touch the mask to confirm it is dry to the touch. Then, ask the person to wiggle their mouth and jaw. They can also lift their eyebrows and crinkle their nose. This will help to loosen the mask."

      "content": "Pull the mask slowly from their face. Once the mask has been loosened, hold your two hands out in front of the person’s face. Grip the sides of the mask and slowly lift it away.

Put large bumps and raised spots on the mask for a scary look."
