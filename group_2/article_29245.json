      "content": "Decide on what style house you would like to make. There are multiple styles you can use for your builds in creative mode, but we will stick to the six basic styles if you're playing in survival. (The styles will be listed from top to bottom of the screenshot). Classical- Classical builds are mainly composed of large amounts of quartz, and feature large amounts of white blocks from the monochromatic scale. These builds typically have large pillars, vaulted ceilings, and slanted roofs. Modern- Modern builds are also composed largely of quartz. However, these builds feature buildings composed mainly of geometric shapes, and flat, clean surfaces. Historical- Historical builds are mainly composed of sand-based blocks and different varieties of stone. As their names suggest, they focus on ancient buildings, many of which are dilapidated. Industrial- Industrial builds are focused mainly along with the use of manufactured blocks, such as iron blocks, trapdoors, and glass. They are based around factories, and also support a geometric shape. Steampunk- Steampunk builds revolve mainly around structures with clockwork. They feature similar blocks to a rustic theme but typically have higher-pitched roofs, along with smaller ground floors than upper floors. Rustic- Rustic builds are among the most common, and feature typically small, cozy cottage builds. They use a large array of natural blocks such as wood and stone. They are also the most basic structures to build."

      "title": "Find a suitable location for your build.",
      "content": "Find a suitable location for your build. You generally want to build in a biome where the surrounding blocks are similar to those you're using in your build. You don't want to build a historical temple in a forest; likewise, you wouldn't want a classical house on the top of a mountain."

      "title": "Think about if you will use any other blocks in the color wheel.",
      "content": "Think about if you will use any other blocks in the color wheel. Aside from the blocks you will mainly use for your build, think about what other blocks you will use to add color to your build. (The colors will be listed from top to bottom of the screenshot). Analogue- Analogue colors are the most basic scheme, and revolve around two colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Complementary- Complementary colors are composed of two colors located on the opposite side of the color wheel. They will contrast dramatically but allow for a stunning final effect. Triadic- Triadic colors are perhaps the most complicated. They are composed of three colors equally spaced out on the color wheel. An example of this would be Redstone blocks, yellow glazed terracotta, and blue wool. Monochromatic- Monochromatic scales revolve around the spectrum of colors between black and white. Both of these contrast well and are helpful in balancing lots of colorful blocks."

      "title": "Decide on what light fixtures you will use.",
      "content": "Decide on what light fixtures you will use. You will need light to prevent any mobs from spawning in your house, and they can also provide a stunning effect if used correctly. You always want a light level above 7, as mobs can spawn on any solid blocks with a light level below 7. Experiment! Blocks like torches and lava are well known to give off light. However, blocks such as brown mushrooms, dragon eggs, and ender chests also give off light too."

      "title": "Set up a small base.",
      "content": "Set up a small base. You don't need too many items, just the basics. A bed, crafting table, furnace, a couple of chests, and a stonecutter, to help make certain stone-based blocks. You can also surround your base with a wall, although it is not needed if you go to sleep before the sun fully sets and mobs spawn."

      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. You may not have full diamond or enchantments yet, so it may be best to build your final house once you obtain these. Gathering your materials can take hours on end, and it may be easier to make a temporary house before your final one. Some materials for certain styles are harder to obtain than others. Therefore, if you don't want to risk going to the Nether for things like quartz, consider making a house with a different style, such as steampunk or rustic house."

      "content": "Form your walls. You could fill in all the walls and add windows later, but if you're short on materials, forming where your windows will go first is better. You don't have to make you house one big cube. Think about adding varying window shapes and roof heights for later."

      "content": "Start forming your second story. You almost always will need a second floor for more space, and adding a second floor will give you more depth in your build, as well as a grander looking house. Your second story doesn't always have to be the same size as you ground floor. You can make it bigger or smaller, depending on your needs."

To prevent mobs from spawning, light up your roof, as you don't want to get a creeper jumpscare just before you enter your house. Remember to use F3 to check the light level. The same rules apply for the outside too."

      "content": "Dig out a pool. Although it's mainly for detail, a pool is a great exterior item to have, and will match nicely on houses built in dry places, such as deserts and savannas. You need to light up the interior of your pool. If you pool has a light level below 7, Drowned can spawn, and can potentially kill you in large swarms. A great way to light up your pool would be to use sea lanterns."

When mobs come into contact with these, they are unable to jump out, and will take damage when they move. You can also build a wall around your property, although it takes much more resources. You will also need to add an overhang to prevent spiders from climbing over."

      "title": "Make some storage.",
      "content": "Make some storage. By placing chests horizontally from your walls and labeling the ends with items frames, you can make a clever storage system for all your necessities.

      "content": "Add a potion laboratory. Unless you are making a completely separate building specifically for potions, consider adding an area for making potions, with all the essential ingredients.
