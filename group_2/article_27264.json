      "title": "Using positive body language will make people more likely to talk to you.",
      "content": "Using positive body language will make people more likely to talk to you. Stand up straight, make eye contact with people, and smile! Try to avoid crossing your arms over your chest and looking closed off. The more open and friendly you look, the more people will want to get to know you. [1] X Research source Smile when you pass people in the hall or make eye contact in the cafeteria."

      "title": "The more you practice, the easier it will get!",
      "content": "The more you practice, the easier it will get! There are tons of ways you can strike up conversations with people at school and start getting to know them better. Compliment someone's backpack and ask them where they got it. If you see someone reading a book, ask what they're reading and if it's any good. Ask the person sitting next to you in class what they did over the weekend. People love talking about themselves, so asking a question about them is a great way to start a conversation. [2] X Research source Talking to people you don't know can be kind of scary if you're shy, but the more you try it, the less scary it will be."

      "title": "Give others a chance to talk about themselves.",
      "content": "Give others a chance to talk about themselves. When you're around someone, ask about their favorite classes, what they like to do after school, what bands or TV shows they're into, or even what they're having for lunch. Don't just jump from topic to topic—that can feel a little awkward. Instead, ask a question, then chat about that for a little while. When the conversation stalls, move to something new. [3] X Research source For instance, if someone says they're going to the skate park, ask what kind of skateboard they ride or what kind of tricks they can do. Share a little about your own experience skating too, even if it's just to say that you've never ridden! Asking questions lets the other person know that you're interested in what they have to say. This can actually make them more interested in learning about you, too."

      "title": "Look for tables with an open seat in the cafeteria.",
      "content": "Look for tables with an open seat in the cafeteria. If you’re feeling a little nervous, pick a table that only has one or two people sitting down. Head over and ask if you can sit there, then join in on the conversation. If you liked the people you sat with, ask if you can join them for lunch again the next day. [4] X Research source It's okay if you feel a little shy at first—that's totally normal!"

      "title": "They might need a friend, too.",
      "content": "They might need a friend, too. If you notice someone who's sitting alone at a lunch table or apart from the crowd at a pep rally, walk up and ask if it's okay to sit with them. Then, make casual conversation by chatting about your classes, what they're wearing, or something that's going on around you. [5] X Research source This can feel less intimidating than approaching a whole group of people, so it's a great option if you're feeling a little shy!"

Over time, you could become good friends with some of the other people on your team! [6] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019.

      "content": "Social events are a great way to meet people. It's totally fine to attend most of these events solo—just try to chat with as many different people as you can once you get there. However, if you feel a little strange going alone, ask an acquaintance if they want to buddy up and go with you. That way, you'll have someone to talk to no matter what. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Connect with people who share your interests.",
      "content": "Connect with people who share your interests. Most schools offer electives like band, art, theater, newspaper, and yearbook. When you make your schedule, ask your homeroom teacher or guidance counselor what electives are available, and sign up for the ones that sound like fun to you. The other students in the class obviously think that elective is cool too, so you already have something in common! [9] X Research source You may only be able to choose your electives at the start of the school year, or you may be able to update your schedule each semester. That might seem like a long wait, but it gives you plenty of time to think about what you'll enjoy the most!"

A good friend makes you feel like they're happy you're around—they should listen to you when you talk, treat you with kindness and respect, and accept you for who you are. [13] X Research source Pay attention to the way your new friends treat others, as well. If you notice them being unkind to others, they probably won't be a great friend to you, either."
