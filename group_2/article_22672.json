Cross the long end over the short one, wrapping it loosely over your head. Alternatively, you can wrap the fabric around your head more tightly if you prefer a sleeker look. To finish it off, affix the fabric with pins (or magnets) at the top and side of your head. [1] X Research source About the style: We call this hijab the “classic” for a reason! It’s super popular, commonly used, simple, and versatile. Hijab shape: Rectangular. Hijab fabric: Chiffon, cotton, jersey, satin, and woven (viscose or modal). Goes with: Any face shape.

Repeat this, crossing the fabric in the back of your head and the top, before finally tucking the leftover fabric into the hijab at the sides of your head. That way, you can take that loose fabric over your forehead and tuck it over the top knot to finish the look. About the style: Remember the iconic “Rosie the Riveter” poster?

      "title": "Hijabs come in a wide variety of materials.",
      "content": "Hijabs come in a wide variety of materials. A hijab is more than just a piece of fabric used to make a headscarf; you can use hijabs in different shapes, sizes, and fabrics. Most hijabs are designed to cover the hair and neck, though some can also cover parts of the face or chest. The choice of hijab can be a personal, cultural, or religious one. Hijab types and fabrics include: [10] X Research source Hijab types include: Amira hijab . A two-piece hijab designed to work without pins for ease of use. Bodysuit . Bodysuit hijabs are designed to fit to your head and neck (as well as the rest of your body), creating an all-in-one bodysuit and hijab covering. Keffiyeh . These hijabs are common in the Middle East and North Africa; they’re a symbol of Palestinian heritage, and the pattern on them is supposed to represent the Palestinian flag. Satin . Khimar hijabs are long and flowing; they cover the hair, neck, and shoulders and often extend all the way down to the waist. They’re especially popular in Egypt. Niqab . Niqab hijabs cover the face and leave just the eyes visible, indicating the wearer’s dedication to modesty. Shayla . Popular in the Gulf, the shayla is simply a type of scarf that’s usually wrapped around the head and fastened with pins at the shoulders. Slinky . Slinky hijabs are designed to be clingy and contour to the face and head. Tudung . Tudung hijabs are popular in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. They cover the head, neck, and chest for extra modesty. Turban . Turbans are simply headwraps. They’re very versatile and customizable, especially because they’re not specific to a single culture. Hijab fabrics include: Chiffon . A hijab made from chiffon, which is a sheer and very lightweight fabric ideal for formal dress. Cotton . Cotton is a universally popular fabric for hijabs because of its breathability and comfort. Jersey . Jersey fabric has a soft stretch, making it easy to use, versatile, and comfortable as a hijab. Satin . Satin and silk hijabs are glossy and smooth; like chiffon, they can be great for special occasions. Woven . Hijabs made from woven fabric usually have elaborate designs and textures that make them stand out."

      "content": "Keep a few neutral-colored hijabs. Neutral tones go with anything. In other words, neutral-toned items are “staple” pieces for a wardrobe. So, add a few different neutral-toned hijabs to your closet; neutral tones are building blocks for a well-rounded wardrobe. Even if none of your colored hijabs go with certain outfits, you can always grab a neutral-toned one. [11] X Research source Neutral tones include black, white, grey, brown, taupe, beige, and cream."

      "content": "Match the hijab to the color and pattern of your clothing. Take stock of your outfit. If it already has a bold pattern, consider choosing a solid-colored hijab that matches one of the colors in your outfit. If your clothes have solid colors, try picking a hijab with patterns or prints! This makes your outfit and hijab combination visually interesting and balanced without being too busy."

      "content": "Use the color wheel to pick a hijab. It’s not just for artists—the color wheel can help you assemble outfits! If you want some guidance when pairing hijabs and outfits, take a look at the color wheel. You could pair complementary colors (the ones that are opposite one another on the wheel) or analogous ones (colors next to each other). You can also opt for a more monochromatic (single-color) look. [12] X Research source Complementary color pairings—yellow and purple or blue and orange, for example—make for a visually bold look. Try these if you want your outfit to really stand out! Analogous color pairings (blue and green or yellow and orange, for example) are more harmonious and balanced. Monochromatic outfits have a simple yet sophisticated look. To get the monochromatic style, pick a hijab that matches your outfit or one that’s a lighter or darker shade (but still the same color)."

      "title": "Change up hijabs based on the season.",
      "content": "Change up hijabs based on the season. Opt for lightweight, breathable fabrics in summer, especially when paired with a turban-style hijab. In fall, try using layered styles to compensate for the cooler weather—and in winter, use heavier hijab fabrics like wool, cashmere, and fleece. You can also drape your hijab to give you some extra coverage against the cold! Here are some extra seasonal styling tips: [13] X Research source Spring : Spring vibes are often full of pastels (greens, lavenders, and soft pinks, for example) and floral prints. Try hijabs with pastels and prints, too! Summer : Go for bright, bold, colors and prints to capture that summer attitude. Summer is also the time to be minimal with your accessories (so you aren’t weighed down in the heat). Fall : Capture the fall vibes with earthy tones—deep reds, greens, and browns especially. Winter : If you want to adopt a “winter” theme with your hijab colors, neutral tones (with pops of color in your accessories) are the way to go."

      "content": "Try different styles and framing techniques. Experimentation is the name of the game! Don’t be afraid to try new things, whether you switch hijab styles or even just the way you frame your face with a hijab. You may get a better sense of your personal style. You can also play around with things like layering—or the way you drape your hijab. For example, you can layer your hijab with other garments, like a cardigan or kimono, to add some more style and personality to your outfit. As far as draping goes, you can try different techniques (like making more volume at the top of your head or letting the fabric cascade down the sides of your face) for some extra flair."

      "title": "Incorporate flattering accessories.",
      "content": "Incorporate flattering accessories. Hijabs pair beautifully with brooches, headbands, and statement earrings, so make sure you have a selection of them to use! Don’t skimp on helpful hijab accessories, too—like clips, pins, inner caps, and headbands. They can absolutely help hold your look together throughout the day. Add a brooch to your hijab when you want to step up the sophistication of your outfit. A pair of statement earrings can draw the eyes to your face and add a pop of color to your outfit, especially if you’re wearing mostly muted or neutral tones. Complete your look with a handbag or purse that matches your hijab and overall color scheme!"
