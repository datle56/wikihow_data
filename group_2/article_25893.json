There are a few types of non-game badges you can get: Sales badges: During major sales (such as the Summer Sale, for example), Steam will sometimes release a badge you can complete by doing various tasks. These badges can usually be completed without needing to buy anything. Steam Awards nomination badges: Each year, you can get a badge for participating in Steam Awards nominations. While you must spend some money to get the full 100 XP (as you must play a game you nominated), you can get 50 XP for nominating a game in every category. Steam Year in Review badges: At the end of the year, you'll get a badge if you view your Steam Year in Review (which is similar to a Spotify Wrapped ). Community badges: There are a few badges you can get for completing Steam community tasks. The most intensive badge is the \"Community Ambassador\" badge (which can be completed for free), but you can also get the \"Community Contributor\" badge if you get four profile awards (they can all be from the same person). There is also the \"Community Patron\" badge for giving five profile awards, but awards can only be purchased with Steam points, which in turn can only be obtained by spending money."

[4] X Research source Playing a game you own that participates in the trading card system will give you around half of the trading cards needed to complete that game's badge. Buying a game gives you Steam points, and also gives you access to that game's items in the Steam points catalog. These items can be sold for gems, which can be used to finish badges."

Each badge will give you 100 XP. To see all of your in-progress badges, hover your name in Steam and click Badges . About half of the trading cards for each game can be earned by simply playing the game, but the other half must be traded for or purchased in the Steam Marketplace. You can easily access the Marketplace listing for the card you need by clicking the badge on the Badges page, then scrolling down and clicking Search the Market next to the card. Alternatively, click Visit Trade Forum to find users looking to trade that particular card for a different card or cosmetic item. You can also use Steam gems to create trading card booster packs. A booster pack will give you 3 random cards from that game's trading card selection. You can only create one booster pack per game per day. The booster pack creator can be accessed from the Badges page. Steam gems can be earned by converting certain items (such as cosmetics, emoticons, backgrounds, etc.) into gems in your inventory. You can also sometimes earn gems from Steam seasonal events. Converting an item to Steam gems will also give you a badge."
