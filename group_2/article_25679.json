      "content": "Identify the 12 zodiac signs and their related sun sign dates.

The sun travels through all of the signs of the zodiac as the year progresses. Its alignment with each sign is as follows: [1] X Research source Aries: March 20 to April 22 Taurus: April 21 to May 22 Gemini: May 21 to June 22 Cancer: June 21 to July 22 Leo: July 21 to August 22 Virgo: August 21 to September 22 Libra: September 21 to October 22 Scorpio: October 21 to November 22 Sagittarius: November 21 to December 22 Capricorn: December 21 to January 22 Aquarius: January 20 to February 19 Pisces: February 18 to March 21"

      "content": "Look at the zodiac as a 360 degree circle to identify aspects. Aspects in astrology are the way that the planets align with each other in relation to their position around the earth. If 2 planets are in aspect in an astrological chart, they may form an angle, overlap, or be opposite each other. This changes the significance of their positions and you will have to interpret their positions in relation to each other. The 4 major aspects to look for on an astrological chart include: [3] X Research source Conjunction, which is when there is 0 degrees of separation between 2 planets and they overlap. Sextile, which is when there is 60 degrees of separation. Square, which is when the planets form a 90 degree angle. Trine, which is when the planets form a 120 degree angle. Opposition, which is when the planets are at opposite sides of the chart or have 180 degrees of separation."

      "content": "Identify the astrological symbols or glyphs. Before you can create or read a chart, you’ll need to know what all of the symbols on the chart mean.

Study the symbols and try drawing each one yourself to help familiarize yourself with them. [4] X Research source For example, the sun symbol is shaped like a circle with a dot at the center of it, while the moon looks like a crescent. Aquarius’ symbol looks like 2 parallel wavy lines, while Taurus looks like a bull’s head with 2 horns on top of it.

For example, you might be a Taurus with a rising sign of Gemini, or a Pisces with a rising sign of Leo. You need to complete an astrology birth chart to find your rising sign."
