If you’re having trouble coming up with an idea, consider some of these popular gift suggestions for eleven-year-olds: If they’re into fashion and accessories, get them some fun or chic jewelry, a scarf, or a hat—or take them on a shopping spree to get a new wardrobe! If they love books, get them the next book in their favorite series—or pick up your favorite book from when you were their age so they can enjoy it, too! If their favorite books are popular, you can probably find book-related merch, like T-shirts or bookmarks. If they’re a gamer, consider getting them a giftcard to Steam or Gamestop. Are they into board games? Get them the year’s coolest new board game—maybe you can even break it out at their birthday party! Experiential gifts are also great ideas: for example, you could take your 11-year-old loved one to a concert to see their favorite musician, to a sports game to see their favorite team play, to the zoo, or to an amusement park."

      "content": "Plan the party out at least 2 weeks in advance. “I would suggest not doing anything last minute,” Miller advises. She recommends having all the party-planning details mapped out two weeks in advance “to make sure that everything runs completely smoothly.” This includes figuring out how many people are coming and what dishes to serve, ordering a cake or finding a cake recipe to make, planning party activities and games, and purchasing decorations ."

      "title": "Invite guests 6 weeks before the party.",
      "content": "Invite guests 6 weeks before the party. Miller recommends sending out invitations no later than 6 weeks in advance. This will give people plenty of time to figure out their schedules and ensure as many guests can attend as possible. She also advises sending out invites electronically: “Although I love printed materials, I love letterpress, and I love hand calligraphy; we really try to be mindful of sustainability, and those beautiful pieces are typically just thrown away or recycled.”"

      "content": "Plan kid-friendly and kid-specific activities. For children’s parties, “it's really smart to bring in entertainment that is specific to the kids,” Miller says. This could be specific party games , video games, activities (like swimming or having a water gun fight), or anything you think the birthday kid and their friends would enjoy. If you can, Miller suggests hiring someone or inviting an adult guest who can “[lead] the kids in games, [show] them magic tricks…and read them exciting stories. And it's just so much fun. It's so exciting for the kids—also, craft stations.”"

      "title": "Be willing to go with the flow.",
      "content": "Be willing to go with the flow. You can plan out all the details perfectly, but, as Miller cautions, “inevitably, one thing is going to go wrong…and usually, it's a pretty big thing, and it's usually out of your control.” Her advice? “Expect it's going to happen. Be calm about it. If it's not the end of the world, which it typically isn’t, you can find a creative solution if you’re calm and relaxed.” “If you're uptight and screaming and freaking out,” she says, “then that doesn't give your mind the ability to open up and expand and figure out problem-solving.”"
