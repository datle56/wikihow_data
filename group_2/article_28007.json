      "content": "Squeeze a small bottle of clear or white glue into a bowl. Purchase a 4-ounce (118-milliliter) bottle of clear school glue. Open up the cap, and squeeze everything into a bowl. Make sure that you use the basic, all-purpose kind of school glue and not the \"washable\" kind. The washable kind of school glue does not work as well. [1] X Research source For more interesting silly putty, get the kind of glue that already has glitter and color mixed into it. For opaque silly putty, use regular white glue and for a clear silly putty use white glue."

      "title": "Add some color and glitter, if desired.",
      "content": "Add some color and glitter, if desired. Squeeze in a few drops of food coloring. Next, add in a few spoonfuls of extra-fine glitter. Stir everything together until the color is even and the glitter is spread evenly throughout. Skip this step if your glue already has color and glitter in it."

      "content": "Stir the borax water into the glue water. Keep stirring the two together again until the glue starts to turn into gel. You will have a clump of gel in your bowl, with some water, glitter, and color around it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the putty. Pick up the glob of gel from the bowl. Knead and squish it with your fingers for about 5 to 10 minutes. There may still be some water and glue in the bowl, which is fine. The borax will have picked up as much glue as it could have. [4] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, it may be a good idea to put on a pair of plastic gloves during this step."

When you are done playing with it, put it into a plastic, resalable container, such as a lidded box or a zippered bag. When you take it out again, you may need to knead it again for another 5 to 10 minutes."
