      "content": "Choose a hair dye that is 1 to 2 shades darker than your current color. If you go too dark, your hair will look stark, streaky, and unnatural. The darker pieces of hair might overshadow the gray hair and make it look as though your hair is currently graying. [1] X Research source A couple of shades darker will definitely give you more subtle results. If your hair is more of a brownish-gray, stick with dark-brown. [2] X Research source If you have dark-gray hair, consider going with black lowlights. This will make your natural gray hair look more like highlights. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide on the placement of the lowlights. You can apply the lowlights all over your hair, or just focus on the top part. You can even leave a few strands at the front of your face lighter; this will help frame your face better. [4] X Research source"

Purchase some volume 20 developer from a beauty supply store, then do the following: [5] X Research source Apply the developer to your dry, unwashed hair. Wait 10 minutes. Rinse the developer out.

You’ll need to shake the bottle well to mix up the two and make sure that you get a nice mixed consistency. Have a hair dye brush ready to use."

[10] X Research source Wash your hair using a color-safe conditioner next, then dry and style it as you normally would. Some dyes are different. If your dye has a different processing time, use that instead. Gray hair specifically may also have a different processing time. Call a hair stylist and tell them the brand of your hair dye to get an exact answer for how long you should let your dye soak in."

If your hair isn't all gray and is still clinging to its natural color, you may want to add some highlights to it as well. This will help brighten up your hair. Apply the highlights the same way as you did the lowlights. Here are some suggestions based on common natural hair colors: [11] X Research source Blond: apply both highlights and lowlights ranging from pearl to medium blonde. Brown: add some darker browns, such as espresso, but skip the highlights. Red: apply both highlights and lowlights in browns and blonds."
