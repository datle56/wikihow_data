      "content": "Use a stud finder to find the studs in the wall. The best way to do this is to use a stud finder, sliding it along the wall horizontally until the stud finder indicates where the stud is. Once you’ve located the studs, use a pencil to mark where they are. [1] X Research source You can also try to find the studs by looking for small dimples in the trim or knocking on the wall and listening for a solid sound instead of a hollow one."

      "title": "Use a drill to drill into the stud where you’d like to hang your shelf.",
      "content": "Use a drill to drill into the stud where you’d like to hang your shelf. To create the first hole for your special bracket, use a 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) drill bit to get started. Once you’ve created a small hole, switch to a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) bit and drill a hole for the bracket, making sure not to drill too deep. You can measure the bracket’s length and then use a piece of tape to mark the drill bit so that you don’t drill too far in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the bracket in the hole.",
      "content": "Secure the bracket in the hole. Place the bracket in the hole, turning it until you feel a slight resistance. Keep turning the bracket until it feels tightly secured. If you’re twisting the bracket and aren’t feeling any resistance, pull it back out. Twist the end that goes into the shelf clockwise so the bracket expands."

      "content": "Use a level to place the second bracket. To make sure your shelf is even and steady, use a level and the stud finder to decide where to place the other bracket that will hold up your shelf. Use a pencil to mark where the second bracket will go. [2] X Research source Make sure the distance between the 2 brackets isn't longer than the length of your shelf."

      "title": "Install the second bracket using a drill and secure it tightly.",
      "content": "Install the second bracket using a drill and secure it tightly. Follow the same process of drilling a hole into a stud using the drill bits. Place the bracket into the second hole, twisting it until it’s tightly secured. Remember not to drill too deeply when making the hole for the bracket. It’s a good idea to use the level again once you’ve placed the second bracket, just to make sure the 2 brackets create a level surface. If the brackets aren't level, you'll need to remove 1 from the wall and realign it."

    {
      "title": "Measure the distance between the 2 brackets carefully.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the 2 brackets carefully. Use a ruler to measure the distance from 1 bracket to the next so that you’ll know where to drill the holes in your shelf. You need this measurement to be exact, so take the time to measure it 2 or 3 extra times. Write down the measurement so that you don’t forget it."

      "title": "Drill the bracket holes into your shelf.",
      "content": "Drill the bracket holes into your shelf. Use your bracket measurements to draw dots on the back of your shelf where the holes will go using a pencil. Make sure the holes are straight and level with each other. Carefully drill the 2 holes into the wood — use a drill press to create the holes, if possible. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a drill press, you can create a jig to hold the wood. Keep your wood from moving by putting pieces of wood on either side of it with a thin slab nailed on top. Mark the depth with tape to ensure you’re not drilling too far. Measure your shelf to make sure it's the right thickness and depth for the brackets you chose. The specifications for the brackets should be labeled on the package they come in."

You would ultimately have 5 sides, with the back of the shelf being open. [5] X Research source You want your shelf to slide onto a cleat, which is why the shelf won’t have a back."
