      "content": "Buy 2 to 3 curtain rod Command hooks that match your curtain rod.They come in metallic finishes, you can find them in stores alongside other Command hooks. [1] X Research source You will need 1 hook for each side of your window frame, and another for the middle. [2] X Research source If your window is narrow, then you might be able to get away with just 2 Command hooks. Check the weight of your curtains and rods before choosing hooks. Use command hooks rated for the correct weight to support curtains and rods. If you can't find any curtain rod Command hooks, purchase the largest size that you can find with the highest weight limit. The combined weight of the curtain and rod must not exceed the weight value of ONE hook, regardless of how many hooks are used. Make sure that the hook part is big enough for the rod."

      "content": "Wipe gently the wall above the window frame with rubbing alcohol, do not rub. You don't need to wipe down the entire wall, just a rectangle that spans 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the frame, and 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) to either side of it. Use a soft cloth or paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol to do this. Do not use other types of cleaners, as they may contain oils, which can prevent the hooks from adhering to the wall. Rubbing alcohol will remove paint if rubbed too hard, wipe gently."

Place the Command hook against the wall where you want it to go, then trace the top, bottom, and side edges with a pencil. Place all of the hooks 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the frame. Keep 2 hooks 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) outside the frame, and 1 hook in the middle to ensure central loading of the weight. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim the top of the hooks down if they are too long. Place your Command hook against the wall where you made the pencil marks. If the top of the hook is in the way and bumping up against the ceiling, crown, or molding, cut it down with a saw, dremel, or bolt cutters. [4] X Research source Sand down any jagged edges with fine-grit sandpaper or a metal file. Don't cut the actual hook part. Only cut the rectangular or oval shape that the hook is attached to."

      "content": "Remove the red liner and press it against the back of the hook. Open your package of Command hooks, and find the adhesive strip. Find the side that is red, then peel that liner off. Once you have the liner off, press it against the back of the hook. If the liner is not color-coded, look for the word \"hook\" and peel that side off instead. Some adhesive strips have little pull tabs that are used for removing the adhesive from the wall. Make sure that this tab is sticking out of the bottom of the hook."

If your hook's liner was not color-coded, look for the side that is labeled \"wall.\" Peel the liner off, and press the hook against the wall, right between your pencil marks. Hold the hook firmly against the wall for 30 seconds. Make sure that the hook is oriented correctly. The hooked part should be pointing down, with the tip curving upwards."

Slide the hook upwards to reveal the rectangular base. Press the base firmly against the wall for 30 seconds, then slide the hook base into place. Skip this step if you are using a simple hook that does not slide off of the base."

It will also get rid of any sanding dust if you trimmed the hook down. Simply soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the outside surface. You should do this even if you just took the hook out of the packaging. You don't need to wipe down the back of the hook because you won't be painting it."

Masking the hooked part off will leave the original color behind, and help it blend into the rod. Tear off a piece of making tape, then wrap it around the hooked part of your Command hook. Stop when you reach the rectangle or oval that the hook is attached to. [5] X Research source"

If you are using the spray-on kind, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area and to cover your work surface with a sheet of newspaper. Shake the can before using it, and hold it several inches/centimeters away from the surface. Let the paint dry before moving on.

Use a small brush to apply the paint in neat, overlapping rows. Let the paint dry, then add a second layer if it is thin or streaky. [7] X Research source If you are working with spray paint , be sure to paint on top of a sheet of newspaper in a well-ventilated area. Use a sweeping side-to-side motion.

Most spray paints are ready to use after they finish drying, which should only take 15 to 20 minutes. Many interior wall paints, however, have a curing time in addition to a drying time. Check the label on your can of paint. Don't use the hooks if the paint feels tacky. It has not cured yet. If you use the hooks before the paint finishes curing, it may peel off."

In fact, sealing the hooks may mar any metallic finishes. The base of the completed hook will match your wall, and the hooked part will match your curtain rod."
