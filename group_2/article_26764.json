      "title": "Slice off an outer leaf of a fresh aloe plant.",
      "content": "Slice off an outer leaf of a fresh aloe plant. The outer leaves are more likely to be mature and contain plenty of fresh, healthy gel. Select leaves around the base of the plant, with healthy, green, rigid stalks growing close to the dirt. Use a sharp knife or clean pair of scissors to make a neat cut as near to the base of the leaf as you can. [1] X Research source Since Aloe vera gel is perishable, it's best not to make a huge batch at once, unless you plan to give some away. Cut off just 3-4 leaves in order to make 0.5–0.75 c (0.12–0.18 L) of gel. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source If your plant is young, be especially careful not to cut off too much at once. Cutting off all of the outer leaves could damage the plant."

      "title": "Rinse the leaf under cold water and cut away any yellow gel.",
      "content": "Rinse the leaf under cold water and cut away any yellow gel. Check the bottom of the leaf where you made the cut and trim away any portions that display a yellow or discolored discharge (in other words, any substance that isn’t the transparent aloe gel). This discharge contains latex, which may cause allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, place the leaf cut-side down into a container to allow any excess yellow resin drain for about 10 minutes, or until it stops dripping."

      "title": "Peel the leaves with a vegetable peeler or knife.",
      "content": "Peel the leaves with a vegetable peeler or knife. Use a vegetable peeler to carefully peel away the green skin of the leaves. Be sure to remove the thorns and cut through the inner white layer to the gel underneath. Peel off all of the skin on one side of each leaf, leaving a canoe-shaped half filled with gel. If you’re using a knife rather than a vegetable peeler, first cut away the thorny edges, then slice off the flat portion of the leaf’s skin, leaving the other side intact. If you have large leaves, cut them into smaller pieces before peeling to help manage their size as you work. Discard the skin as you go so it won't get mixed in with your gel."

      "title": "Scoop the gel out with a spoon or knife.",
      "content": "Scoop the gel out with a spoon or knife. The clear, soft gel is easy to scrape away from the skin. Use one hand to hold the leaf in place, and use the other to scoop it all out into a clean bowl until there's no more gel remaining in the leaf. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the aloe gel in a blender.",
      "content": "Mix the aloe gel in a blender. Freshly harvested aloe often has clumps or is even congealed into a strip, which makes it difficult to apply. To give your aloe a smoother consistency, place it in a blender and gradually pulse it on a low setting until it’s smooth and easily poured. Go ahead and add those white fleshy parts to the mixture, as well. They also contain aloe’s beneficial compounds, and can be used in the same ways once blended."

      "title": "Freeze the gel in an ice cube tray.",
      "content": "Freeze the gel in an ice cube tray. Pour your blended aloe gel into an ice cube tray, then place it in the freezer. Freezing aloe this way will keep it for up to 2 weeks. Anytime you need aloe, simply pop out a cube and rub it on your skin, or place it in a small dish to thaw for about an hour before applying it as a lotion. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix your aloe with honey or vitamin C to preserve it.",
      "content": "Mix your aloe with honey or vitamin C to preserve it. In a blender or a mixing bowl, simply mix an equal portion of honey into your aloe until the 2 are completely combined, then keep it in the refrigerator when you’re not using it. Honey is a perfect aloe preservative—it has an incredibly long shelf life, and is compatible with most of the things you use aloe for. [5] X Research source Store aloe this way for up to 1 year. [6] X Research source In addition, mix the gel with a natural preservative, like 500mg powdered vitamin C or 400 IU vitamin E for every 1/4 cup of gel you have. This preservation method will keep the gel for up to 90 days. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Store whole aloe leaves in the fridge for 4-5 days.",
      "content": "Store whole aloe leaves in the fridge for 4-5 days. If you harvested too many leaves, or simply won’t be using them on the same day, place your leaves in a plastic bag and store them in the fridge. Because the untreated leaves don’t have any added preservatives, they’ll only last a few days before they begin to wither. To make them last longer, place them in the freezer and store them there for 6-8 months. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub aloe on sunburns to relieve pain. Aloe gel contains compounds that help the skin stop itching and soothe irritation. Rub a generous dab of aloe on a sunburn or other topical burn and let it absorb into your skin. Reapply it as long as your discomfort persists. [9] X Research source"

Apply a small amount to shallow cuts or scrapes to relieve pain and help your skin recover.

      "content": "Use aloe gel as toothpaste. Just add a dab of aloe to a wet toothbrush, the same as you would your regular toothpaste, and get brushing! In some studies, aloe was more effective at controlling bacteria than commercial toothpastes. As an added plus, it’s easier on your teeth, since it doesn’t have any abrasive particles like many toothpaste products. [13] X Research source Be careful not to ingest the aloe when using it as a toothpaste, as aloe can cause dehydration if consumed orally."
