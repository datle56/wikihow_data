      "content": "Virgo is least compatible with Aquarius and Sagittarius. Virgo can appreciate the intellectual nature of both the air sign Aquarius and fire sign Sagittarius, but they might also come off as flighty and unreliable to a grounded Virgo. Sagittarius is often moody and impulsive, while Aquarius has their head up in the clouds and struggles with emotional connection. If your sun sign doesn’t match your Virgo’s, don’t despair! It doesn’t mean you’re entirely incompatible—it just means you might have to work to understand one another. Keep in mind that even if your sun sign has low compatibility with Virgo , you likely have other signs in your star charts that match up well."

      "content": "Virgos are slow to fall in love. They need time to fully develop trust in you and may hide their feelings until they’re sure they like you. Be patient as you work to woo your Virgo sweetheart: you’ll have to be dedicated and work hard to show that you’re the one. However, it’ll be worth the wait; Virgos are serious and fully committed once they fall. Take the initiative and ask your Virgo out on a date. Virgos tend to avoid being the instigator and rely on you to make the first move. Show your Virgo that you can be a steady, dependable partner. Follow through on your promises and be there when they need you. If Virgo feels that you’re messy and unpredictable, they’ll back off."

      "content": "This sign loves to perform acts of service. Virgo is a practical and hardworking sign; as such, your Virgo lover will want to help you out all the time. It’s Virgo’s way of showing you how much they care. They might not vocalize their affection as openly as other signs, but they’ll always be ready to do something for you without expecting anything in return. Make your Virgo feel appreciated by asking for help and advice. They’ll love having the chance to make your life easier (and maybe share their opinion!) Virgos like to please in the bedroom, too. Not only do they have sexual stamina, but this sign wants nothing more than to channel it into making you happy."

      "content": "They make plans for everything. Virgo is highly adept at creating and sticking to their own schedule, and they’ll want everything in life meticulously planned out. This applies to daily life—work, recreation, dates—and the future. Your Virgo will have lofty goals in life and a plan for how to fulfill them all. You’ll know Virgo is committed when they start including you in those plans. Virgo typically only enters a relationship they feel has long-term potential. They’ll probably ask you lots of personal questions initially, but it’s because they want a partner who can be a part of their future plans! Your Virgo will remember every birthday and anniversary—and put their all into making every occasion feel special. Discuss the future with your Virgo. Make plans a few weeks, and eventually months, in advance. They’ll feel more secure in the relationship when they see you’re just as dedicated as they are."

      "content": "Your Virgo is chatty and loves intelligent conversation. The more you appeal to their mind, the more attractive Virgo will find you.

      "title": "Virgos want to fix everything.",
      "content": "Virgos want to fix everything. This sign is a problem-solver, a helpful trait when troubles in your daily life need fixing. However, a Virgo’s problem-solving tendencies can lead to them trying to “fix” you by offering advice and critiques that you didn’t ask for. If your Virgo tries to fix something you don’t see as a problem, this can be a problem and cause hurt feelings. Ask them to relax when it comes to nit-picking. Life is messy sometimes, people aren’t perfect, and that’s okay."

      "title": "This sign loves to be organized and tidy.",
      "content": "This sign loves to be organized and tidy. You’ll rarely find a mess in a Virgo’s space, as they prefer for everything to stay in its designated space. A Virgo doesn’t like clothes left on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, or a workspace with papers scattered around haphazardly. They don’t function well when surrounded by chaos and need partners who will make an effort at cleanliness. Virgo’s high standards mean that they’re also hardcore perfectionists, so it can sometimes be hard to satisfy their needs."

      "title": "Virgos are independent.",
      "content": "Virgos are independent. While they’re very social, they also need alone time to recharge their mental batteries. They like to do things alone, prefer having plenty of space, and cannot handle a clingy, needy relationship. If a Virgo feels smothered by their partner, they’ll pull away. Let them do their own thing and exercise your own independence; Virgo will love having freedom while in a relationship."

    {
      "title": "Help them see that they don’t need to “fix” you.",
      "content": "Help them see that they don’t need to “fix” you. Due to their perfectionism, your Virgo might try to fix something they don’t like about you. Show them that they’re over-extending their need to fix things and that you can decide for yourself what you need to do to change, if at all. It’s not Virgo’s job to solve other people’s problems, let alone yours. Remind your Virgo they don’t need to change everything you do and tell them nicely when you don’t need their help. Remind them that problem-solving is a team effort in relationships, and your input matters too. If you’re messy, make compromises. They shouldn’t expect you to follow all of their organizational rules, but you can still make an effort to be clean and hygienic around them."

      "title": "Reassure your Virgo when they feel insecure.",
      "content": "Reassure your Virgo when they feel insecure. This sign’s intense perfectionism causes them to be critical of themselves more than anyone else. Your Virgo will probably feel insecure about a lot underneath their reserved mask, so be there for them when perfectionism rears its head. Assure them that you’re there, you believe in them, and that they’re amazing exactly as they are. [2] X Research source Your Virgo may worry about the relationship and feel anxious or uncertain about where it’s heading. Try to be reassuring and let them know that you’re fully committed for the long haul. When Virgo gets caught up in their perfectionism, remind them that nobody is perfect. All they can do is their best."

      "title": "Encourage spontaneity to counteract Virgo’s controlling nature.",
      "content": "Encourage spontaneity to counteract Virgo’s controlling nature. When your Virgo gets a little too attached to their calendar, everything can feel too regimented, including the relationship. Show them that a bit of spontaneous behavior won’t upset their usual routine in bad ways. Bring them on an adventure and let Virgo see how nice it feels to take a well-deserved break from structured life! Make small but significant changes, like encouraging your Virgo to try new food, a unique clothing style, or shift the furniture. Whisk them away on a spontaneous trip to have some fun and dial up the romance. Try something new in bed. Take the lead and show Virgo what to do; they’ll adjust in no time. Remind your Virgo to reach out for help and not always assume they have to solve everything alone."

    {
      "title": "Explain any inconsistent behavior or deviations from routine to Virgo.",
      "content": "Explain any inconsistent behavior or deviations from routine to Virgo. The sign lives for order so if you act erratically they will become upset. Life happens, but you should have a valid explanation when you’re always late or forget to do a particular chore. Do your best to restore consistency in the relationship; discuss why things have changed and figure out how you can establish new routines that work for you both. Remember to say what you mean at all times around your Virgo, even if you’re negotiating boundaries or discussing a problem. Don’t play mind games with Virgo, as they prefer plain honesty and won’t appreciate it."

      "title": "Win Virgo back if you’re disloyal or behave poorly.",
      "content": "Win Virgo back if you’re disloyal or behave poorly. It’ll be hard to win back a Virgo if you’ve been disloyal or behaved dramatically over petty things because they value loyalty and stability. You’ll have to be patient and work hard to prove to Virgo that you can be trusted again. Show Virgo that you can change and that you have a plan to move forward—rather than repeating the same battles. Because of their intuition, Virgos can usually tell when you’re lying. Be honest and sincere, telling them the truth at all times—even when it’s uncomfortable. Trust and honesty are important for Virgo; if you lie to them, they’ll be less inclined to give you a second chance, even over something small."

    {
      "title": "Be aware of Virgo’s sensitivity to criticism.",
      "content": "Be aware of Virgo’s sensitivity to criticism. Virgo loves to dish out judgment, but they don’t take it nearly as well. Rather than openly critiquing your Virgo, be curious. When discussing an issue, use “I” statements to emphasize your own feelings rather than draw attention to whatever your Virgo may have done. Avoid harsh language, don’t label them, and refrain from calling names or insulting them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make it clear when Virgo’s criticism hurts your feelings.",
      "content": "Make it clear when Virgo’s criticism hurts your feelings. If any sign thinks they know best, it’s Virgo. Unfortunately, this sign also tends to judge anyone who doesn’t meet their standards—and because those are so high, they end up criticizing most people. If your Virgo feels that there’s a problem in the relationship, they may use logic instead of their heart to fix it and hurt your feelings in the process. If you feel hurt or unfairly criticized by your Virgo’s words, tell them. They may not even realize they’ve offended you, as Virgos often think that they’re just being helpful when they critique someone. Ask your Virgo to talk things through rather than make assumptions about your feelings; remind them that you’re a team, not a problem to be solved by them alone."

    {
      "title": "Use humor when Virgo is taking things a little too seriously.",
      "content": "Use humor when Virgo is taking things a little too seriously. Though this sign is down-to-earth and might come off as eternally serious when you meet them, they actually have a sharp sense of humor. Help them see the funnier side of things by injecting humor when appropriate. Watch comedies, do fun activities, and show Virgo that things won’t fall apart if you stop and laugh at them. Virgos are often workaholics! Plan activities to show them that downtime is essential. For example, go for walks in nature, or book a weekend away (with no technology allowed) to help your Virgo relax."
