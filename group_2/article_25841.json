      "title": "Talk to your probation officer.",
      "content": "Talk to your probation officer. You probably were assigned the SCRAM bracelet as part of your probation. You should talk to your probation officer about why you want to remove the bracelet. If you can get your officer to agree, then you will have a stronger argument."

      "title": "Identify why you want the device removed.",
      "content": "Identify why you want the device removed. Generally, judges are not anxious to remove the bracelet. In fact, they might have given you a choice: wear the SCRAM device or go to jail. Before asking a judge to remove the bracelet early, you need to identify solid reasons for doing so: The bracelet has issued “false positives.” This means the bracelet detects alcohol when you haven’t been drinking. You will need proof that you haven’t consumed alcohol, such as a hair test or a polygraph exam. You will have to pay for both. If you pass them, then they are solid proof that the device is inaccurate. [1] X Research source The device is unnecessary. If you have gone several months without a drink, then you could argue that the device is no longer needed. You would prefer to take in-person tests. The judge might have given you an option to wear the device or take tests in person. [2] X Research source You might have initially chosen the SCRAM device but have now changed your mind."

      "content": "Format your motion. Anytime you want the judge to do something, you need to file a “motion” with the court. You can begin drafting your motion by opening a blank word processing document. Set the font to 14 point Arial or Times New Roman. Also double-space the document. Your court may have printed forms you can use. You should look on the court’s website or stop in and ask the court clerk."

      "title": "Insert the caption.",
      "content": "Insert the caption. The caption information appears at the top of the first page of every motion filed with the court. It stays the same throughout the prosecution, so if you’ve never drafted a motion before, then you can look at any document filed in your case to find the caption. The caption includes: The name of the court. The names of the parties. Typically, the state is the “prosecutor” and you are the defendant. The case number."

You can title your motion “Defendant’s Motion To Modify Probation.” If you want to terminate probation, then you could title it “Defendant’s Motion To Terminate Probation.” [3] X Research source You should insert the title underneath the caption.

In support of the motion, Defendant states the following….” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Explain why the judge should remove the bracelet. You also have to give the judge a reason to remove the bracelet early. Decide whether you are seeking to only have the bracelet removed or if you want your probation to end early. You could argue: The bracelet is unreliable. There is some proof that SCRAM bracelets are not as effective at detecting alcohol use as some judges might believe. You could argue that the bracelet is faulty and that it has registered false positives. Point to hair tests and polygraphs which show you didn’t drink. You could also mention an article by Judge Dennis N. Powers called “The SCRAM Tether as Seen Through the Eyes of Davis-Frye and Daubert.” In this article, a Michigan judge argues that the SCRAM device is not sufficiently reliable to qualify as expert evidence. There are alternatives that are less burdensome. You would have a stronger argument if you give the judge some alternatives for monitoring your alcohol consumption. For example, you could take tests in person. You have satisfied all other conditions of your probation. For example, if you have been ordered to pay a fine and do community service, make sure you are diligently working toward completing those requirements. Whether your probation officer agrees. If so, be sure to mention that fact."

[11] X Research source Men can wear business casual: dress pants and a dress shirt with a collar. If you have a conservative tie, then wear that as well. For footwear, men should wear dress shoes with dark socks. Women can also wear business casual: dress slacks or a skirt paired with a blouse or nice sweater. Women can also wear conservative dresses, but they must not be too tight or revealing. Men and women should both avoid wearing blue jeans, unless they have no other long pants.
