      "content": "Draw an equilateral triangle on the square of cardboard, and cut it out. It’s important that the arms of your boomerang are all the exact same size, so making it from an equilateral triangle will help. Make sure you measure accurately before cutting. [2] X Research source Measure one side of the square and make a mark at the halfway mark. Make another halfway mark on the opposite side as well, and use the ruler to draw a straight line between them. This should make a line running down the center of the square. Position the square in front of you so that the line is running up to down. Use your ruler to draw a line from the top of the first line to the bottom right corner of the square. This line should be the same size as the sides of your square. Repeat this to make a line from the top of the first line to the bottom left corner as well. You should now have a triangle shape on your square. Use scissors to cut the triangle out."

      "content": "Mark the center of each side of the triangle, and draw lines from these points. One side of the triangle should already have a line drawn from the center up to the top corner, but you need to mark the center of the other two sides. Use your ruler to measure the sides and make a mark at the halfway point. [3] X Research source Use the ruler to draw straight lines from the marks you made to the corner opposite the side the mark is on. You should now have a line going directly through the center or each corner of the triangle."

Make a straight line going through these marks from the edge to the center of the triangle You should end up with two lines running parallel to and two inches away from the line going through each corner of your triangle. This will make 3 lines coming from each corner and going to the center of the triangle. These 3 lines make up the arms of the boomerang."

Draw over the outer two lines in each corner starting from the edge of the triangle and stopping where it intersects another line coming from the next corner. It should look like you’re cutting 3 smaller triangles out of the edges of the triangle leaving 3 arms in a “Y” shape. Cut the cardboard where you have drawn with marker. You will be cutting 3 small triangles out of the edges of the larger triangle."

Place the water bottle on the end of the boomerang arm and trace the bottom of it onto the arm. This should create an arc going from one edge of the arm to the other edge. Do this with each arm of the boomerang. Cut the end of the arm around the arc you have drawn."

Use a ruler to draw the lines creating the shape of the boomerang on the cardboard. Use the ruler to draw an 10 inch line on your cardboard. Draw another 10 inch line perpendicular the first line, making sure the center of the line matches up with the center of the first line. The two lines should make a cross or “x” shape. Draw 2 lines that are 2 inches away from the first line on either side of it. These lines should be running parallel to the first line. Repeat this with the second line that was drawn. You should have 3 lines running one direction and 3 lines running perpendicular to create a cross or “x” shape. Draw a small arc to connect the ends of each group of 3 lines."
