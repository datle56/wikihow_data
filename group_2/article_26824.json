    {
      "title": "Choose a lean cut of meat.",
      "content": "Choose a lean cut of meat. When making beef jerky, use nearly any cut of lean meat. Fat spoils and limits the shelf life of beef jerky, so go with the leanest option you can find. [1] X Research source For example, select flank steak, bottom round, sirloin tip, top round, or eye of the round. Ground beef is an option, though it may have a much different texture than jerky made from steak."

    {
      "title": "Cut off any noticeable pieces of fat.",
      "content": "Cut off any noticeable pieces of fat. To help your jerky preserve, use a sharp steak knife to strip off any remaining fat chunks. Aim to only remove the fat, rather than cutting off part of the steak as well. [2] X Research source This way, the jerky is healthier and stays fresh longer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze your meat for 1-2 hours if you want it to make it easier to cut.",
      "content": "Freeze your meat for 1-2 hours if you want it to make it easier to cut. After you cut off the fat, place the meat on a baking tray, and put it in your freezer for about an hour or 2. You want the meat to be hard to the touch but not completely frozen. [3] X Research source While this is optional, flash-freezing the meat can make it easier to cut very thin, uniform strips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice your meat into 1⁄8–1⁄4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) strips.",
      "content": "Slice your meat into 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) strips. Use a sharp steak knife to cut your meat into smaller pieces. If you like more chewy jerky, make your cuts with the grain. For less chewy jerky, cut against the grain. [4] X Research source If you have the option, use a jerky slicer to ensure your pieces are completely uniform. This is a great idea if you are making a lot of jerky at one time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Marinate",
      "content": "Marinate the meat if you want to enhance the taste of the beef. When making beef jerky, use a marinade to give the meat a cajun, teriyaki, or smokehouse flavor, for instance. Put the pieces of meat into a large, sealable plastic bag, and pour 1-1 1/2 cup (237-355 mL) of a marinade of your choice into the bag. [5] X Research source For a cajun marinade, use 1/2 cup (118 mL) of olive oil, 1/4 cup (59 mL) of vinegar, and 1/3 cup (79 mL) of Worcestershire sauce. For teriyaki jerky, use 1 cup (237 mL) of soy sauce, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of honey, and 2 tbsp (30 mL) of rice vinegar. For a simple, delicious marinade, use about 1/2 cup (118 mL) of Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup (118 mL) of olive oil."

      "title": "Add seasoning to the marinade to give the meat more flavor.",
      "content": "Add seasoning to the marinade to give the meat more flavor. Sprinkle seasoning of your choice into the bag. In total, you want to use about 1-4 tbsps (15-60 g), based on the seasonings you prefer. Some great options include 1 tbsp (15 g) of garlic powder, 1 tbsp (15 g) of pepper, and 1 tsp (5 g) of fresh ginger. [6] X Research source You can try dusting the meat with a little bit of salt, pepper, cinnamon, and chipotle pepper. Other yummy seasoning includes a little coriander, cumin, clove, and nutmeg. Honey, red pepper flakes, and black pepper also work well for a mild and slightly sweet jerky. Try using some crushed oregano, chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika."

      "content": "Refrigerate your meat for 6-24 hours so it can absorb the flavors. After you add your marinade and seasoning, stir up the meat so it's completely covered. Close up the bag, and place it in the fridge for at least 6 hours. To maximize the flavor, let the bag sit for 24 hours. [7] X Research source The longer the meat sits, the more flavorful the jerky is."

      "title": "Pat the strips of meat with a paper towel to remove excess marinade.",
      "content": "Pat the strips of meat with a paper towel to remove excess marinade. After your meat marinates for a while, remove it from the fridge and dab each piece gently with a clean paper towel. Getting rid of extra marinade helps speed up the drying process. [8] X Research source As you do this, you can place the strips onto a cookie sheet or plate."

      "title": "Use a dehydrator for an easy and efficient option.",
      "content": "Use a dehydrator for an easy and efficient option. A dehydrator is a device that cooks food at a low temperature over an extended period of time. It removes the water from the food while keeping the raw enzymes intact. If using a dehydrator, cook your jerky at 160 °F (71 °C). [9] X Research source When making beef jerky, this is a straightforward and easy-to-use option. Read over your instruction manual so you can follow your device's specific instructions."

      "content": "Dry beef jerky in your oven if you don't have a dehydrator. If you don't have access to a food dehydrator, that's okay. You can still easily make beef jerky in your oven. Preheat your oven to 175 °F (79 °C). [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the pieces of meat so there's room in between each strip.",
      "content": "Place the pieces of meat so there's room in between each strip. If using a dehydrator, put the strips of meat onto the rack directly. If using an oven, line a baking sheet or pan with aluminum foil, and place a metal drying rack in the middle. Ensure there is at least 1 ⁄ 16 in (0.16 cm) in between each piece so they can all dry evenly. [11] X Research source If the pieces of beef overlap, each slice may not dry consistently."

    {
      "title": "Let the meat dry for 3-8 hours.",
      "content": "Let the meat dry for 3-8 hours. On average, it takes about 4-6 hours to make beef jerky, but you may need more or less time. Your drying time depends on your particular dehydrator, oven, marinade, and cut of meat. Check the meat every 1.5-2 hours or so to avoid over-drying the jerky. To test the jerky, remove a piece, let it cool, and take a bite. If your jerky cooked to your desired texture, take it out of the oven. If it's too soft or meaty, let it cook for another 1-2 hours. [12] X Research source If you overdry the jerky, it may be too hard to eat."

    {
      "title": "Remove the jerky from the dehydrator or oven and let it cool.",
      "content": "Remove the jerky from the dehydrator or oven and let it cool. Before you eat or store the jerky, let it come to room temperature. If you used a dehydrator, use a fork to lift up each piece and put it onto a plate. If using an oven, use a pot holder to remove the pan, and place the pan on top of your stove. Your jerky should cool down in about 1-3 hours"

      "title": "Try some fresh jerky.",
      "content": "Try some fresh jerky. Once your beef jerky cools down a bit, you can dig in. Eat the jerky 1 piece at a time whenever you want a yummy, healthy treat. You can eat it by itself or use it to spruce up tasty dishes. [13] X Research source Try grating your beef jerky over a fresh salad for a tasty topping. [14] X Research source Add pieces of beef jerky to steamed Brussels sprouts for extra flavor. Use chopped beef jerky to enhance a basic egg and cheese omelette."

      "title": "Put your jerky in a paper bag for 1-2 days if it is not dry enough.",
      "content": "Put your jerky in a paper bag for 1-2 days if it is not dry enough. If your jerky is still slightly too wet after it cools down, try placing the strips in a paper bag and leaving them in there for several days. Check on the jerky daily to test its moisture level, and transfer it to an airtight container after it seems dry enough. [15] X Research source The paper bag removes the excess moisture from the jerky."

      "title": "Store your jerky in a resealable bag or glass jar for a short-term solution.",
      "content": "Store your jerky in a resealable bag or glass jar for a short-term solution. The jerky stays fresh indefinitely since it is dry, but the quality will decrease after a few months. For the best quality of jerky, store your meat at room temperature for 2 weeks, in the fridge for 3-6 months, or in the freezer for 1 year. Ensure the jerky is in a cool, dry place. [16] X Research source Whenever you want a bite, simply open the bag or jar and chow down. Over time, exposure to air makes the jerky less fresh."

    {
      "title": "Use a vacuum sealer for a long-term storage option.",
      "content": "Use a vacuum sealer for a long-term storage option. Vacuum sealers work great for storing beef jerky because you can remove all of the air from the packaging. Air decreases the quality and freshness of the jerky over time. To use the vacuum sealer, fill the vacuum bag with your jerky, fold the edge over, and place the edge inside the sealer. Press the \"Vacuum sealer\" button to extract the air. Once your jerky is vacuum sealed, it can stay fresh for over 1 year in the freezer. Turn off the machine once no air remains in your package."
