      "content": "Text and DM him less. Maybe you're still seeing this guy, but he's been pulling away. Sometimes, to reignite a guy’s attention, it pays to give him a little cyber-space. Why not spend a little more time waiting before sending your next message ? Take some extra time, and you’ll also be able to craft the perfect response. This tip works best with new relationships, and probably won’t be effective if you’re already in a committed relationship. [1] X Research source Imply that you’ve been doing something fun: “Sorry for the radio silence! I was out with a friend today.” Send shorter messages to leave him wanting more: “Nice! Anyway, what’ve you been up to?” Reader Poll: We asked 1593 wikiHow readers how they’d handle a partner pulling away, and 53% agreed that they’d give them space to come to a decision on their own . [Take Poll] By reaching out to your guy less, you may be giving him the space he needs to come back to you."

      "content": "Carve out less time in your schedule for him each week. You’ve got an exciting, busy schedule to manage. Prioritizing your crush or partner takes work, and he should appreciate that. Focus more on things that make you happy—like your passions, friendships, and hobbies. Not only will you be enjoying yourself, but you’ll also help him realize that your time (and attention) is valuable. [2] X Research source Try to spend a little less time with him in the next couple weeks. If you usually leave a few afternoons for him each week, go for just one instead. Throw yourself into a new project to keep yourself busy in a positive way. Have a skill you’ve always wanted to become great at? Go learn it!"

      "content": "Explore new relationships if you’re not exclusive. Again, if you’re in a committed relationship, this tip isn’t a good idea. But if you’re both still dating around, play the field a little. Not only can this be a fun way to explore new connections, but it might also make you feel less singularly focused on this relationship, which might help you act more chill (and in turn, leave him wanting more). [3] X Research source Try to see a couple new people on dating apps. Focus on having fun and enjoying your time with someone new. On the other hand, do pay attention to how you feel. Dating someone just to make someone else jealous (especially if it makes you feel bad) is never a good idea."

      "title": "Change your perspective on the relationship.",
      "content": "Change your perspective on the relationship. When you like someone, it makes sense that you’d want things to keep getting more serious—and one of the best ways to do that is to ask more of your partner or potential partner. If you sense that your guy is getting distant though, it might be best to cool off. For a few weeks, ask less of him. Try your best to change your perspective on the relationship, and see if he’s willing to lean in on his own. [4] X Research source Hold off on asking him to text you or ask you out more often; instead, just try to enjoy the time you do spend together. At the end of the day, nobody wants a relationship where they have to ask the other person to treat them with respect and care. So this tactic is a win-win; either he puts in more effort when you pull away, or if he doesn't, then you can take that in stride and move on to someone who does."

      "content": "Reopen communication with a subtle comment or quick message. If you're dealing with someone who used to like you (but who you don't see anymore), try saying something casual to put yourself back on his radar. Try to be friendly, fun, and super chill. You might offer him a simple compliment in passing, or message him about something he's interested in. Now, he'll be thinking of you all over again. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source Say you see him passing by at school or at work. You might say something like, \"Wow, Greg, I like that shirt.\" Or, send him a quick, kind text, “Congrats on Carolina winning the National Championship. I know you’re probably so excited!”"

This guy has had interest in you in the past, so if you manage to pop up on his radar again, those feelings might come flooding back. Show up somewhere you know he visits regularly, acting casual when you see him. [6] X Research source Does he love the gym? Is he a regular at church? Swing by with a friend. Pro tip: avoid doing this super regularly so that you don't freak him out. And make sure you have an excuse (\"I'm getting back into fitness!\") when you do, too."

      "content": "Use open, friendly body language when you two talk. When you run into him, greet him with a smile. As you’re talking, mimic his body language to show that you’re engaged in the conversation. This can be something as simple as putting your hand on your chin or tilting your head to one side, as long as he's doing it too. This can help send a subtle signal that you're happy to talk to him—which in turn, might make him happier to be talking with you, too. [7] X Research source Though, as mentioned in the first method, acting distant is a great way to reel him back in when you're already dating, acting friendly, fun, and open works well with a guy who you're not seeing any more (or were never seeing)."

Why not remind him of those times? The more he reflects on that great trip to the beach or that amazing day at the museum, the more likely those old feelings are to come flooding back. Maybe you two saw the first Spiderman movie together: \"Did you see the next Spiderman is coming out? Remember seeing the original way back when?\" You could even clarify that for you, those were great memories: \"Weather like this reminds me of our amazing weekend by the lake. I had so much fun.\""

If you two got close in the past, you may know exactly what he likes to see on you. So wear it when you see him! In general, just make sure that you look and feel amazing whenever you two are bound to run into each other. [8] X Research source When all else fails, wear red. Even if you're not sure about his specific preferences, red is scientifically proven to be attractive to guys. Or, just wear something that makes you feel amazing .

One of the easiest ways to remind him of how amazing you are is to literally pop up on his feed. So go take an amazing photo, and post it somewhere where he'll definitely see it. If you want to seem super casual, post something flattering but low-key on your story. Maybe you want him to think you've been living a super exciting life lately. Post about a trip or new activity, and use a mysterious caption: \"Onto new things...\""
