      "content": "Light beings are spiritually enlightened entities made up of light and energy. According to some spiritual believers, light beings are entities (e.g., angels, masters, goddesses) that come from different dimensions and are composed of pure light. They are said to have made a contract with your soul before you even incarnated on earth—in other words, they made an agreement to look after you before you were born and make sure that your karmic lessons are learned, your awakening process begins, and your vibrations are raised. The concept of light beings dates back to ancient civilizations. The notion of divine light has been explored across philosophy, religion, and alchemy throughout history. [1] X Research source While the the term “light being” has no specific origin, culture, or history, many societies throughout time have used light as metaphor for the divine. Different cultures have different names for light beings. For example, the Chinese Goddess Quan Yin is considered to be a light being because she is thought of as an ascended being. Other examples include Archangel Michael, St. Germaine, and Ganesha. [2] X Research source Light beings are non-denominational and do not belong to one particular religion. Most religions have their own variations on angels and spirit guides, so light beings are connected to every spiritual practice. It’s thought that you can connect with your light being through meditation when you need help. A light being may try to leave you signs and signals that they are with you."

      "content": "Light beings may take on forms you’re familiar with, like a beloved pet. The last thing light beings want to do is scare us! So, if a light being does connect with you, it’s likely that they will appear as something you can easily recognize or are familiar with. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Light beings may appear as geometric shapes of light.",
      "content": "Light beings may appear as geometric shapes of light. Because light beings are said to be of a higher dimension, their physical form is often described as a shapeless blob of pure, white light. These shapes may be very complex or quite simple. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Some have seen light beings appear as tall figures.",
      "content": "Some have seen light beings appear as tall figures. Many people have claimed to come in contact with a tall being (or multiple beings) with a form completely made of light—either translucent or solid white. Some of these encounters are described as extraterrestrial, as these beings are believed to be light beings as well. [5] X Research source Since light beings are thought to exist in higher dimensions and higher universes, they do not typically show up in physical form for no reason. Rather, light beings are more likely to present themselves when they need to communicate something important. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Light beings may send signs using animals or numbers.",
      "content": "Light beings may send signs using animals or numbers. Have you ever noticed certain numbers showing up everywhere in your life? Caught glimpses of a certain animal every time you leave the house? Saw a rainbow when it wasn’t raining? These experiences could all be signs that light beings are trying to communicate with you. [7] X Research source Whenever you notice signs popping up out of nowhere, stop to recognize where you are in that moment, reflect on how you’re feeling, and consider that a light being may be trying to get your attention. Keep an open mind and an open heart and allow whatever messages you may need to receive to flow through you. Remember that light beings are always with you and always want to connect with you! Start looking for signs from them and keep an eye out for any small messages they may be sending you. The more you notice them, the easier you’ll be able to recognize them. If you are dealing with a difficult situation or going through a hard time, your light beings are far more likely to reach out, so always keep watch for their signs during these periods. Sometimes, a light being may not be trying to get your attention for any specific reason other than to let you know they are with you. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Light beings are thought to communicate telepathically.",
      "content": "Light beings are thought to communicate telepathically. Through telepathic communication, light beings strive to open our minds to the spiritual realm, expanding our beliefs beyond the physical world. Their aim is to increase our consciousness as a whole and empower us to reach a higher dimension by enhancing our genetic codes. Receiving their form of telepathic communication may be achieved through meditation, dreams, and astral projection. [9] X Research source Light beings are generally believed to exist in etheric form rather than physical form, so they use higher levels of consciousness (which are said to exist in the 5th dimension and beyond) to convey messages. For this reason, they often communicate by sending us earthly signs and signals we can comprehend. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Begin by meditating.",
      "content": "Begin by meditating. Never hesitate to contact a light being when you are in need of their guidance, whether that’s when you’re going through a hard time, feeling lost, or needing questions answered. The process of contact a light being can be initiated by first engaging in mindful meditation . Spirituality is a big part of connecting with light beings, so keep an open mind before going in. If your thoughts are blocked or you don’t believe in the light beings you’re about to contact, chances are you won’t be able to connect with them. Notice how you’re feeling before starting to meditate. What are you wishing to gain out of connecting to your light beings? What emotions are you feeling? Pay attention to your mind, body, and spirit, as light beings may connect through emotion and energy."

      "title": "Cleanse your energy with white light.",
      "content": "Cleanse your energy with white light. To work with light beings, your energy must be cleansed and prepared, which can be done by washing yourself with white light. To begin this cleanse, close your eyes and visualize a bright, white light cascading over you. Picture the light beginning at the top of your head and traveling down your body, removing any bad energy or low vibrations you may be carrying. [11] X Research source Because working with light beings is all about connecting with entities in a higher dimension, your energy must be at a level high enough to communicate with them. Light cleansing gives your vibration the boost needed to lift your energy. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Invoke a particular light being depending on your goal. Research various archangels, deities, ascended masters, animal guides, and healers. Figure out which of the divine light beings you feel an innate connection to and call upon the ones you’re drawn to. Different spiritual beings have different purposes, so reach out to one who may be able to offer guidance on your specific concern. For instance, Archangel Michael is thought to raise energy and cut the cords in any unhealthy relationships. Call upon him when you need a fresh start or would like to remove yourself from a toxic friendship or relationship. [13] X Research source Don’t be afraid to connect too much or too often! Light beings enjoy helping us and want us to prosper and succeed."

You might be skeptical about the existence of light beings, but accepting their place in the universe is the only way to truly connect with them."
