To spin the Wheel of Fortune, you have to land on a “spin” picture (old style), or 3 spins on a payline (new style). Keep gambling until you either lose all your money or come out ahead. Trust your instincts. If you're not feeling lucky, either switch to another machine or take a break from gambling. Never gamble with money that you can't afford to lose. Never bet with rent money, mortgage, utilities, car payment, or other funds you need to live. Do not use credit cards for cash advance; there are fees and the interest rate can approach 50%."

Whatever dollar amount the wheel stops on is yours to keep. The wheel sections may be stated in dollars or credits; multiply credits x the machine denomination to determine your winnings.

If you win the progressive jackpot, you can choose to accept your money in payments over time or as a lump sum. If you accept the money in payments, you will lose less to taxes. However, most experts say to choose a lump sum. Even though you will lose a larger amount to taxes, you can invest a larger sum of money at once and make it all back"

Furthermore, no matter how high the jackpot gets, slot machines aren't required to pay out. A larger jackpot doesn't give you a better chance of winning. Because the machines use random number generators to decide outcomes, your odds won't ever change no matter what time of day you play."

      "content": "Do not try to muscle a slot machine! Slot machines are built to take daily use. They are armor-plated, have tempered glass, and are equipped with sensors that detect tampering and abuse. They are tested against various types of behavior before leaving the factory, including zapping it with a Tazer. You cannot affect the outcome by slamming it, banging it, nudging it, lifting it off its foundation, or other forms of physicality. What will happen is much like the pinball machines of old: the machine will detect the abuse and shut itself down, which also voids any credits you have left. You will then find yourself surrounded by security or police, who may arrest you but will more likely escort you off the premises. Remember, cameras are everywhere, so whatever bad behavior you exhibit is recorded and can be used against you in court. Those of us who play regularly have had our bad days and our good days; if you arent having a good day, there is always tomorrow. Walk away, go have a meal, or a massage, or a swim, or go shopping."
