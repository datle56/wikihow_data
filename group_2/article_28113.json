      "content": "Choose your sticker design in Cricut Design Space. On the homepage, click on “New Project” in the “My Projects” section to pull up a new canvas. Hit the “Images” button on the left-hand side of the screen to bring up the image search page, and type in the sticker design that you’re looking for. Click on however many sticker designs you’d like and hit “Add to Canvas” to upload them to your workspace. [1] X Research source Check off the “Print then Cut” square on the “Operation Type” menu to narrow down your search results with compatible options. Some sticker designs are only available if you have a Cricut Access subscription . If you’d rather make stickers with your own designs, click “Upload” instead of “Images” on the left-hand side of your screen. Cricut Design Space accepts .jpg, .png, .bmp, and .gif image files, as well as .svg and .dxf vector files.

      "content": "Add an offset to your sticker if you’d like it to have an outline. Select a sticker on your canvas and click the “Offset” option from the top horizontal menu. Adjust the thickness and curve of your offset and then hit “Apply” to confirm your settings. Beneath the “Operation” section on the top menu, check that the “Basic Cut” option is selected. [3] X Research source Cricut Design Space automatically makes your offset black. If you’d like to change the color, click on the colored square in the “Operation” section of the top menu to make adjustments. More intricate designs might have tiny gaps and shapes in the center of the design, which your Cricut machine will cut out automatically. Use the “Contour” feature in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to delete these gaps from the design. An offset is just a colorful outline that borders your sticker. Some professional artists and graphic designers like creating a white offset for their stickers to give them a professional touch."

Then, click the “Flatten” button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to condense the sticker into a single layer. This way, your Cricut machine only has 1 shape it has to cut around. [4] X Research source The “Flatten” option can be found between the “Attach” and “Contour” buttons."

Then, go the “Size” section along the top menu bar and type in 6.75 in (17.1 cm) for the width and 9.25 in (23.5 cm) for the height. Right-click the shape and select “Send to Back” so it goes behind your stickers—that way, you can use it as a template to help you accurately lay out your stickers. [5] X Research source A 6.75 by 9.25 in (17.1 by 23.5 cm) area is the largest amount of space that a Cricut Explore or Maker machine can cut on at once. Make multiple sticker sheets if you have a lot of stickers to create at one time. You’re welcome to make this rectangle smaller than 6.75 by 9.25 in (17.1 by 23.5 cm) if you don’t plan on making a lot of stickers. Cricut Design Space automatically makes new shapes a dark gray color. To change this, click on the colored square in the “Operation” section of the top menu to get different color options."

[23] X Research source Some Cricut machines have trouble reading the black lines on really glossy paper, which can lead to errors. Cricut officially suggests blocking off any light sources that directly shine on your machine, which helps reduce the glare. [24] X Research source You can also try covering up the lines with clear matte tape —according to some crafting experts, this makes it easier for your Cricut machine to properly read the lines."
