      "title": "Use \"as-salaam 'alaykum\" as a default greeting.",
      "content": "Use \"as-salaam 'alaykum\" as a default greeting. The greeting \"as-salaam 'alaykum\" literally means \"peace be upon you,\" and is a traditional greeting among Muslims. Because the majority of Arabs are Muslims, it is also the most common Arabic greeting. [2] X Research source The response to this greeting is \"wa 'alaykum as-salaam,\" which essentially means \"And peace be upon you too\" If you are in an Arabic country, this is a good default greeting whether you know the religious beliefs of the person you're greeting or not. Outside Arabic countries, however, you may want to use a different greeting if you know the person you're greeting is not Muslim."

      "title": "Switch to \"ahlan\" if you aren't comfortable with religious greetings.",
      "content": "Switch to \"ahlan\" if you aren't comfortable with religious greetings. \"Ahlan\" is the basic way to say \"hello\" in Arabic, and is suitable for all occasions. If you're not Muslim or don't feel comfortable giving a Muslim greeting, you can use this instead. [3] X Research source \"Ahlan wa sahlan\" is the more formal version of \"ahlan.\" Use this with people older than you or in a position of authority. The response to \"ahlan\" is \"ahlan bik\" (if you are male) or \"ahlan biki\" (if you are female). If someone says \"ahlan\" to you first, remember to adjust your response depending on whether they are male or female."

      "title": "Try \"marhaba\" to welcome someone.",
      "content": "Try \"marhaba\" to welcome someone. This word literally means \"welcome,\" and is typically used when you're welcoming someone into your home or the place you happen to be staying. You can also use it to invite someone to come and sit with you. It's also used simply to mean \"hi\" or \"hello\" more casually. [4] X Research source For example, if you're sitting at a caf√© and a friend passes and says \"ahlan,\" you might reply \"marhaba,\" to indicate that they can come and sit with you for a chat."

      "title": "Alter your greeting based on the time of day.",
      "content": "Alter your greeting based on the time of day. There are also time-specific greetings in Arabic that you can use in the morning, afternoon, or evening. While these aren't as common, you can use them if you feel like it. They're considered relatively formal, so they're appropriate regardless of who you're greeting. [5] X Research source In the morning, say \"sabaahul khayr\" (good morning). In the afternoon, say \"masaa al-khayr\" (good afternoon). In the evening, say \"masaa al-khayr\" (good evening)."

      "title": "Ask how the person is doing.",
      "content": "Ask how the person is doing. As in other languages, it's common to ask after someone's welfare immediately after greeting them. In Arabic, the basic question differs depending on whether you're speaking to a man or a woman. [6] X Research source If you're speaking to a man, ask \"kayfa haalak?\" He will likely respond \"ana bekhair, shukran!\" (which essentially means \"I'm fine, thanks!\" If you're speaking to a woman, ask \"kayfa haalik?\" The response is typically the same as it would be for a man. If the other person asks you how you're doing first, respond \"ana bekhair, shukran!\" and then follow up with \"wa ant?\" (if the person is a man) or \"wa anti?\" (if the person is a woman. These phrases essentially mean \"and you?\" A common response to these questions, particularly among Muslims in Arabic-speaking countries, is \"Alhamdulillah,\" which means \"praise be to God.\" You'll likely hear 'Alhamdulillah' a lot as a response. It's a common and polite way for Arabs to say 'thank God, I'm fine' when asked how they are."

      "content": "Continue the conversation if you feel comfortable. If you know very little Arabic, at this point, you may want to say: \"Hal tatahadath lughat 'ukhraa bijanib alearabia?\" (\"Do you speak a language other than Arabic?\") However, if you've been studying and feel you can hold your own in a basic conversation, you might continue by asking the person their name or where they're from. [7] X Research source If you and the person you've greeted don't have any other languages in common and you want to attempt to continue speaking in Arabic, you might let them know that you only know a little Arabic. Say \"na'am, qaliilan,\" to indicate that you only speak a little Arabic. If you don't understand what the person is saying, you might say \"laa afham\" (I don't understand)."

      "content": "Use polite words and phrases to show respect. In any language, minding your manners shows respect. Using polite words and phrases in Arabic, even if you don't know any other words in the language, communicates that you respect Arab culture. Some words to learn include: [8] X Research source \"Al-ma'dirah\": Excuse me (if you're asking someone to move) \"Aasif\": Sorry \"Miin faadliikaa\": Please \"Shukran\": Thank you \"Al'afw\": Reply to \"thank you\""

      "title": "Avoid touching when greeting someone of a different gender.",
      "content": "Avoid touching when greeting someone of a different gender. Traditionally, men and women do not touch each other at all when greeting, unless they are close family members. Some women are willing to shake hands with men, particularly in more formal contexts. However, if you are a man, you should let the woman take the lead. [9] X Research source Stand away from the woman as you greet her. If she is willing to shake your hand, she will extend her hand to you. Don't automatically extend your hand first. If she clasps her hands together or places her right hand over her heart, that is an indication that she isn't willing to shake hands but is nonetheless pleased to meet you."

      "content": "Shake hands when greeting someone of the same gender formally. When greeting someone of the same gender as you in a formal context, such as in a professional environment or for school, shaking hands is common. It's still a good idea to let the other person take the lead and offer their hand first. [10] X Research source Always shake with your right hand, never your left. In Arab culture, It's considered more polite to use your right hand when shaking hands or accepting something."

      "content": "Place your right hand on your heart to greet someone warmly. Placing your right hand over your heart indicates that even though you're not going to touch the person, you're still quite pleased to meet them. If you have Arabic friends of a different gender, this is an appropriate way to greet them. Because men and women who aren't related to each other typically don't touch each other when greeting, this gesture is a way to signify your attachment to the person you're greeting without hugging or kissing them.

      "content": "Touch noses or kiss cheeks with people you know well. In some Gulf countries, like the UAE and Oman, touching noses is a traditional greeting, often practiced among close friends and family. Another gesture popular in some areas is to place 3 kisses on the other person's right cheek. [12] X Research source Pay attention to how others greet each other and feel free to follow their lead. These gestures are typically never appropriate with someone of a different gender unless you are related to them and have a very close relationship. Even between close relatives of the opposite gender, these greetings might not be appropriate in public."

      "content": "Greet an elder with a kiss on the forehead. Elders are greatly respected in Arabic culture. A kiss on the forehead honors them and shows them respect. Reserve this gesture for elders you know well, or who are related to someone you know well. [13] X Research source For example, if your Qatari friend introduces you to his grandmother, you might kiss her on the forehead when greeting her."
