      "content": "Cut 9 strands of paracord twice the length you want your reins to be. Measure and cut one cord first, then use it as a guide for cutting the others. You can use however many colors you want, but keep the color combination in mind. [1] X Research source If you want a thinner set of reins, cut 6 strands instead. Most packs of paracord will be close to the right length. If they are too long by 12 or 24 inches (30.48 or 60.96 centimeters), you don't have to cut them."

Keep the cords flat as you seal them; do not bundle or clamp them together. [3] X Research source If you are making a 6-cord braid, seal the cords in groups of 2 first. A stick lighter will work better than a regular lighter. You can also use a heating tool, such as a hot knife."
