      "content": "Try a strap clip to pull your straps together if it works with your clothing. If your bra fits properly but your strap keeps slipping, you may have narrow shoulders. If this is the case, you can recreate the look of a racerback bra by using a special bra clip to pull your straps together in the back. Just slide the clip onto one strap, then attach it to the other strap. [1] X Research source You can find bra clips where intimate apparel is sold, and a pack usually ranges from $5-$10. If you don't have a strap clip, try using a paperclip instead. Just slide the paperclip onto the straps about midway between your shoulder blades."

      "content": "Use a bra strap cushion to keep straps in place. If your bra straps dig into your skin, a cushion will provide relief and keep them in place. The cushions sit between your bra straps and your shoulders, and they may attach to the straps with hook-and-loop fastener. You can find these at most department stores or places that sell intimate apparel, and they usually cost around $10-$15."

      "content": "Use a safety pin to attach your straps to your shirt for a quick fix. Straps can't slip if they're pinned in place. If you need a quick fix, use small safety pins to attach your bra straps to the shoulder seams of your shirt. The seams should help hide the pins. If the pin is big enough, loop the safety pin around your bra strap instead of trying to pierce through the strap."

      "content": "Use fashion tape to temporarily stick bra straps to your skin. Fashion tape is a clear adhesive supplement to your bra straps that will attach to your skin. Stick the double-sided tape to the underside of your bra strap, and then attach the other side of the tape to your skin to hold it in place. [2] X Research source You can find fashion tape in lingerie and department stores, near the bras and bra accessories, or you can buy it online. A roll of fashion tape usually sells for between $8 and $12."

      "content": "Latch your bra on the loosest hook to keep it from stretching. When you hook your bra, it's natural to tighten it as much as you comfortably can, but this can lead to the band stretching. A loose band will cause your straps to slip more, so choose a bra that fits well on the last hook. [3] X Research source Over time, your bra will stretch naturally. When your bra starts to feel loose beneath your bust, move to the next hook."

      "title": "Tighten your bra straps so you can fit one finger beneath them.",
      "content": "Tighten your bra straps so you can fit one finger beneath them. To provide the proper support, your straps should be tight enough to stay in place, but not so tight that they pull your bra band out of place. [4] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 27 May 2021. If your straps leave marks on your skin after you take off your bra, the straps are too tight. To tighten your bra straps, grasp the plastic slide and move it so that the strap becomes shorter. You should be able to comfortably slide one finger beneath the strap when you're wearing your bra."

      "title": "Keep the back of your bra even with the front.",
      "content": "Keep the back of your bra even with the front. Reach to the back of your bra and pull it down below your shoulder blades, so it is even with the front of your bra. When your bra back is too high, it causes discomfort for you and makes the straps fall."

      "title": "Make sure you're wearing the right size bra to prevent straps from slipping.",
      "content": "Make sure you're wearing the right size bra to prevent straps from slipping. Once you know your correct bra size, it will be easier to find a bra that fits properly. Even if you know your size, you should still try on bras to make sure they are the right size, since there may be size differences between styles or manufacturers. Too much room in the cups or the band will mean the straps aren't pulled tight enough and they will be prone to slipping."

      "content": "Put on a non-padded bra if you have one. When you're taking bust measurements, a bra will help lift your breasts, but make sure there's no extra padding to alter the size. [5] X Research source If you don't have a non-padded bra, it's fine to take your measurement without a bra."

      "title": "Measure under your bust and calculate your band size.",
      "content": "Measure under your bust and calculate your band size. Use a measuring tape to measure just beneath your bust. Keep the measuring tape level and pull it taut, but not tight enough to dig into your skin. If you get a fraction, round the measurement up to the next whole number. Add 4 to the measurement if it's an even number or 5 if it's an odd number. The resulting number is your band size. [6] X Research source For instance, if your under bust measurement is 31 inches, your band size will be 36."

      "content": "Measure around your bust at the fullest point. The fullest part of your breasts is usually around the nipple line. Make sure the tape measure is even and pull it so it is just tight enough to rest against you all the way around. [7] X Research source Round the bust measurement up to the nearest whole number. For instance, if your bust measures 33.5 inches, round up to 34."

      "title": "Subtract your under bust measurement from your bust size.",
      "content": "Subtract your under bust measurement from your bust size. The difference in your bust measurement and your under cup measurement will give you your cup size. Use the original under bust measurement, not your calculated band size. The difference between cup sizes is about an inch. If the difference between measurements is a 1, your cup size is A, if 2, it would be B and so on. [8] X Research source In the case of the previous examples, you would subtract 31 from 34 to get 3, which would make your measurement a 36C."

      "content": "Choose bras with supportive straps. Lacy straps might look pretty, but they offer little support. Look for straps made from sturdy material with secure seams. Padded straps may offer additional non-slip support."

      "content": "Try a racerback bra for added security. Racerback bras close in front instead of in back, keeping the straps in place more securely. The straps on a racerback bra may show above the back of some shirts, so either choose one with a decorative design that you want to show off or wear a high-necked shirt."

      "content": "Avoid contoured push-up bras if you have problems with slipping straps. Contoured bras keep their shape even when you're not wearing them. They're pretty and popular, but they might not be the best option if you have a problem with your straps slipping. As you wear a contoured bra, your breasts settle into the bottom of the cup. This leaves a gap in the top of the cup, which can loosen the support on your straps. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a sports bra if you're going to be physically active. If you play sports or you like to exercise, a supportive sports bra can make you feel more comfortable. In addition, heavy-duty sports bras are designed to stay in place, so you won't have to worry about straps slipping down your arms while you're in spin class."
