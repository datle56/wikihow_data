      "content": "Make your way to Puerto Iguazu, Argentina. Fly into the Cataratas del Iguazu International Airport (IGR) if you're not already in the country. Make sure you have the appropriate visa, if applicable. Then, take a bus or taxi or drive yourself the 16 mi (26 km) to the town of Puerto Iguazu. If you're already in Argentina, you can fly (into the IGR airport), take a bus, or drive to Puerto Iguazu. The trip is long and the bus is the most popular option. [1] X Research source If you're coming from Buenos Aires, depart from the bus terminal in the Retiro district. Purchase a bus ticket at the terminal or online through Omnilineas ( https://www.omnilineas.com/ ) or Plataforma10 ( https://www.plataforma10.com.ar/ ). The bus ride from Buenos Aires lasts about 18 hours and is generally an overnight trip. Buses in Argentina have 2 classes of seats: semi-cama, a semi-reclining bed seat, and cama, a fully-reclining bed seat. The price of the bus ticket for semi-cama seating is cheaper than for cama seating."
