      "content": "Keep calm and take a deep breath to steady yourself. While you may want to run and hide when you see your ex unexpectedly, it’s important to be cool and calm. Don’t get up in your head about it. Take a deep breath, accept that this might be a little weird (and that’s okay!), and settle your nerves. [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Avoid trying to hide or pretend that your ex doesn't see you. If you both made eye contact, then your ex has seen you. If your ex hasn't spotted you yet, it's okay to duck out of sight to collect yourself. Consider acknowledging the awkwardness of the situation to lighten the mood. It's okay to say, \"Well, this is awkward,\" or, \"Fancy meeting you here.\""

      "content": "Decide whether to say something, or smile and move on. If you see your ex from across the room or a few aisles over at a store, you may just want to avoid conversation—especially if things didn’t end great. Decide if just a smile and nod might be best. [2] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. If you're feeling very anxious and flustered, and your ex hasn't made their way over to you, it’s okay to just head the other way and avoid the encounter."

      "title": "Be friendly, but not too friendly.",
      "content": "Be friendly, but not too friendly. Don't force physical affection, such as hugging or kissing on the cheek. Also, a formal handshake may be too business-like. If your ex wants to hug briefly, then do so if you feel comfortable. If they don't, then give a polite nod or wave to say hello instead. Keep your body language relaxed. [3] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. Don't send mixed signals by being overly friendly. This is not a time to flirt with your ex if the meeting is out of nowhere and unexpected. Smile and be polite. Act like you are open to conversation. But if the conversation drags on and becomes too awkward, then consider ways to end the conversation. Consider saying, \"It was good to run into you. Nice to chat with you. I'm sorry but I need to get going. I hope you have a good rest of the day.\""

You’ll feel better about yourself and you’ll prove that you’re comfortable and adult enough to talk to your ex. [4] X Research source After a break-up, try to view your ex as a friend from your past that you've grown apart from. You wouldn’t be nervous or shy in front of an old friend, right? If you still have feelings for your ex, that’s okay! This is a great opportunity to prove that you’re mature, confident, and easy to be around."

      "content": "Stay humble and don’t brag in an effort to seem super cool. Whether you're doing well or not, a run-in with your ex shouldn't turn into a competition over who is doing better. It is simply an encounter with someone you know. Avoid getting flustered and talking about yourself too much or exaggerating about what you’ve been up to.

The trick here is to act like absolutely nothing strange is going on. Remain calm, friendly, and natural. [6] X Research source Take the high road and be polite. As tempting as it may be to go for that new partner’s throat, you’ll land a much better impression if you keep it cool as a cucumber. Be willing to say hello and shake the hand of your ex's new partner. Consider saying, \"It's nice to meet you.\" You don't need to say much more."

      "content": "Let go of the urge to make your ex jealous. Trying to get a rise out of your ex is going to extend this interaction much longer than it needs to—and not in a particularly productive direction. If you're running into your ex and you're with your new partner or on a date, avoid trying to show how much you've “moved on” from the relationship by kissing or showing large displays of affection. Act as you would normally when in public. [9] X Research source For example, let's say you're at a friend's party, and your ex shows up unexpectedly. Avoid trying to act differently just because your ex is there. Try to talk with your ex and show that you accept them there. Don't focus on making yourself more attractive for your ex after you run into them. Be your normal and honest self in that moment."

It's okay to say you aren’t comfortable, and you should do as much. You don't have to talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable. Don’t let your ex push you into exploring something, either. If they keep pestering you, firmly say, “I’m not talking about this” and leave. [11] X Research source For instance, if your ex asks whether you're seeing someone new or how things are going with your partner, you can say, \"Oh, that’s nice of you to ask, but I'm not comfortable talking about my current relationship.\""
