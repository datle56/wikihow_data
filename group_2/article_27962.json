Whichever size grater you choose, grated pieces of soap and wax will melt more quickly and evenly than bars. [2] X Research source You can use scented or unscented bar soap in any color. Beeswax or paraffin wax will help seal your leather, making it more resistant to water. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the pot from heat and add 0.25 cups (59 mL) of neatsfoot oil. Take the pot off your stove and place it onto a heat-safe surface. Stir in the 0.25 cups (59 mL) of neatsfoot oil. Keep mixing until the oil has combined with the rest of the mixture. [4] X Research source An animal-based oil like neatsfoot oil will soak into your leather and soften it. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Stir the mixture until it begins to thicken. Stir your soap mixture continually, mixing in any soap buildup along the sides of your pot. When the soap mix begins to cool after a few minutes, it will start thickening. As soon as it starts thickening but remains easy to pour, it is ready to store. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the saddle soap mix into a jar or sealable container.",
      "content": "Pour the saddle soap mix into a jar or sealable container. A wide mouth glass jar or container works for easy pouring and storage. Make sure it has cooled for an hour or two before sealing it with a lid or adding labels. Your saddle soap is set and ready to use when it is hard to the touch. Store your saddle soap in a cool, dry place to make it last longer. This saddle soap can be applied with a damp cloth to the leather surface, then buffed dry with a clean cloth. Saddle soap can clean leather boots along with leather tack when used properly."

Once you have the 1 lb (0.45 kg) block of glycerin you need for this recipe, you can save the other half for another saddle soap mixture in the future. [7] X Research source If you're storing extra glycerin for future use, you can wrap it in plastic wrap or wax paper, and store it in a cool, dry area."

Heat the glycerin on medium power for 30 seconds in your microwave, then remove and stir. Keep microwaving in 30 second intervals until the glycerin has melted. [9] X Research source A 1 lb (0.45 kg) piece of glycerin will make approximately 2 cups (470 mL) of liquid when melted. [10] X Research source"

To make a scented version of saddle soap, replace the milk or cream with 0.25 cups (59 mL) leather cleaner (not leather conditioner). Stir in a few drops of scented essential oils. Cream-based saddle soap made with animal fats and protein, like milk, condition leather well. [11] X Research source"

When it is hard to the touch, it has set and is ready to use. The glycerin will prevent the milk or cream in your soap from going rancid. Make your saddle soap last longer by storing it away from water in a cool, dry place."
