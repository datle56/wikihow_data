      "title": "Go for gold-toned eye makeup.",
      "content": "Go for gold-toned eye makeup. Kim's signature look is her smoky eyes. For this look, you need eyeshadow in a mixture of gold and nude tones. Find an eyeshadow combination that goes from light nude brown to gold to darker brown. Start by applying the bright highlight color in the inner corner of the eye. Spread it from the tear duct to the middle of your eye. Go no higher than your natural crease. Next use the gold shadow. Brush the gold color over the eyelid from the crease down. Start at the outer corner of the eye and blend with the highlight color as you go inward. Because of the white highlight color, the inside of the eyelid will be brighter than the edge. Use a small brush to line the crease with a darker brown shade. Then, use a blending brush to blend the crease color with the rest of the lid. Keep adding the darker brown to that crease and then blending to get the almond-shaped contours. This helps you achieve Kim's smoky signature look. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Line your eye with black liner. No Kim-inspired make up look is complete without the black eyeliner. Apply a thin line at the base of your eyelid, just above where your eyelashes start. You don't have to be precise. Just keep it thin. Use a thin blender brush to smudge out the liner for a smoky look. After applying the first line and smudging it, use a black gel liner with an angled brush to apply a thicker line along your lash line. Line the bottom lid with black liner. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Style your hair with large, soft curls.",
      "content": "Style your hair with large, soft curls. Kim's dark brunette locks are curly most of the time. To get these Kim curls, you need some setting hair pins and a 1.5–2 inch (3.8–5.1 cm) curling iron. When your hair is dry, spray some heat protectant on it. If your hair is hard to curl, add some curl mouse, lotion, or gel. Section your hair into small 1-inch sections. Using your curling iron, curl each section. Make sure you curl the hair away from the face. When you release the curl, roll it into the curl and pin it with a hair clip. Do this for each curl so that the curls set. After you have curled your hair, let the curls set for 5-10 minutes as they cool. Then release your curls. Turn your head over and fluff out the curls.
