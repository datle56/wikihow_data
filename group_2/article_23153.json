According to embodied leadership and relationship expert Zach Pontrello, sending an “I miss you” message is “a very powerful way to say that [someone] is important to you.” So, text your husband a thoughtful quote to keep a long-distance relationship alive and let him know you’re counting down the days until you see him in person. “The world is very quiet without you around.” —Lemony Snicket “You happened, and absence never felt so real.” —Perry Poetry “I miss you in waves and tonight I’m drowning.” —Denice Envall “I exist in two places, here and where you are.” —Margaret Atwood “Distance unites missing beats of two hearts in love.” —Munia Khan “Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it.” —Thomas Fuller “I miss you deeply, unfathomably, senselessly, terribly.” —Franz Kafka “I love you past the moon and miss you beyond the stars.” —J.M. Storm “I miss you in ways that not even words can understand.” —Gemma Troy “Distance means so little when someone means so much.” —Tom McNeal “What is the opposite of two? A lonely me, a lonely you.” —Richard Wilbur “Half of me is missing…and the other half is missing you.” —Ranata Suzuki “If you think missing me is hard, then you should try missing you.” —Theofilos “Trees quiet without the birds, my heart quiets without you.” —Terri Guillemets “In case you ever foolishly forget: I am never not thinking of you.” —Virginia Woolf “The pain of missing you is a beautiful reminder of the joy of loving you.” —Dean Jackson “Sometimes, when one person is missing, the whole world seems depopulated.” —Lamartine “Listen to the sunset; see its pretty hue. When you see it, think of me, and I’ll think of you.” —Oksana Rus “When you are not at hand to kiss away my fears, I cannot choose but be wretched.” —Byron Caldwell Smith “I think we dream so we don’t have to be apart so long. If we’re in each other’s dreams, we can play together all night.” —Bill Watterson “When you miss me, just look up to the night sky and remember, I’m like a star; sometimes, you can’t see me, but I’m always there.” —Jayde Nicole"
