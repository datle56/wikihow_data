      "content": "Gather ashes from incense or a previous ritual. If you don’t have any ashes, grab a fireproof container, like a mini cauldron or incense burner . Then, light some incense and burn it down to ash. While it’s burning, add protective herbs like rosemary, sage, pennyroyal, lavender, lemongrass, or hyssop to make your ashes more potent. [1] X Research source You can use any ashes, but ashes created during spell work are usually the most potent. [2] X Research source Some people like to add a slip of paper with their intention on it while the ashes are burning. You might write, “protection,” or “banish negativity.”"

      "title": "Pour the ashes into a bowl.",
      "content": "Pour the ashes into a bowl. With a clean spoon, scrape all of the ashes into your mixing container. Then, grind them down into a fine dust.

      "content": "Add 2 parts sea salt to 1 part ashes. Just eyeball the mixture because the measurements don’t need to be perfect. Then, stir the salt into the ash until it’s thoroughly mixed. At this point, the salt mixture will be grey. [4] X Research source Sea salt is ideal for black salt because it’s purer and more natural. You can also use kosher salt if that’s all you have. In folk magic, salt is well-known for its protective and purification properties."

Flushing your salt down the toilet counts as putting it in moving water."
