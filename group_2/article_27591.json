      "title": "Preheat the oven",
      "content": "Preheat the oven to 240 °F (116 °C) in order to decarb the cannabis. Decarboxylating the cannabis is necessary to activate its psychoactive components. If you make edibles with just raw marijuana, your edibles may be pretty lackluster. Toasting the cannabis in the oven will ensure that the THC in the cannabis is active and ready for you to make some tasty (and potent) edibles. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Break up the cannabis buds and scatter them in a single layer on a cookie sheet. To do this, roll the buds between your hands over the cookie sheet. This breaks them apart into smaller pieces so that the cannabis is toasted evenly. [2] X Research source Try breaking down each bud into 2-3 separate pieces."

      "content": "Toast the cannabis for 40 minutes and then let it cool. Once your oven has reached 240 °F (116 °C), put the cookie sheet in the oven and let it sit for 40 minutes. Check on the cannabis periodically to see how it's toasting. Take it out of the oven after 40 minutes or when the cannabis has turned from green to golden brown. After, let the cannabis cool before proceeding to the next step. [3] X Research source Check on your cannabis after about 20 minutes."

      "content": "Grind your cannabis with a cannabis grinder. Measure out 1 ⁄ 4 ounce (7.1 g) of cannabis flower and put it in the grinder. Next, grind it until it has the consistency of dried oregano. [4] X Research source Avoid grinding it too fine, as this can bring out the herbal flavor of the flower in your butter. If you don't have a grinder , try ripping up the flower with your fingers."

      "content": "Add the butter and water to the slow cooker. Combine 2 cups (470 mL) of water with 16 ounces (450 g) of unsalted butter (about 4 sticks) in the slow cooker. The water will prevent the butter and the cannabis from scalding during the cooking process, which can lower the potency of the cannabis."

If you're a cannabis beginner or just want lower potency cannabutter, cook the cannabutter for 2-3 hours. After cooking for 2-3 hours, check to see that the top layer of your cannabutter has turned from liquid to thick and solid. That's when you know it's ready."

Next, line the bowl with a cheesecloth. Pour the contents of the slow cooker into the strainer. Strain the cannabutter for 5 minutes, leaving the strainer sitting over the bowl.

Cool it down in the oven so that it hardens and solidifies together. Before you do that, use tinfoil or plastic wrap to cover the bowl. Then, place it in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours. You might try cooling it overnight to ensure the perfect texture."
