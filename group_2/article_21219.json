      "content": "Choose a planting area that gets 6 hours of sun each day. Bottle gourds thrive in warm and bright spots since it helps them develop large leaves and vines. Find a place in your yard that gets sunlight for most of the day to keep your gourds healthy. [1] X Research source Shady areas prevent water from evaporating, which could cool down the soil or cause your gourds to rot."

      "title": "Check the spot for well-draining soil.",
      "content": "Check the spot for well-draining soil. Since gourds can easily get waterlogged in dense soil, check if it drains well too. Dig a hole that’s 1 ft (30 cm) deep and 1 ft (30 cm) wide and fill it with water. After it drains, fill it again and wait 1 hour. If the level goes down between 1–6 inches (2.5–15.2 cm), then the soil is perfect for gourds. Adding compost helps improve drainage on clayey or dense soils. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Test the soil for a pH between 6.5–7.5.",
      "content": "Test the soil for a pH between 6.5–7.5. Bottle gourds prefer a relatively neutral soil, so run a soil test to see if it’s within a good range. [3] X Research source If the pH is too high, add peat moss or aluminum sulfate. To raise the pH, add some limestone into the soil."

      "content": "Turn compost or manure into the soil to depth of 12 in (30 cm). You can buy compost or manure from your local garden center. Spread a 2 in (5.1 cm) layer of the compost over your soil and use a rake or hoe to mix it in.

      "content": "Form mounds of soil that are 6 in (15 cm) tall. Use your hoe to build up the soil in your planting area. Make sure the mound is at least 6 inches (15 cm) above the rest of the soil and about 12 inches (30 cm) wide to help the roots establish better. [5] X Research source If you’re planting multiple gourds, space your mounds about 9 feet (2.7 m) apart so the vines have room to spread out."

      "title": "Install a trellis",
      "content": "Install a trellis near the mounds if you want to train the vines to climb. Trellises help keep your vines under control and they help your bottle gourd dry out at the end of the growing season. Use a wooden or PVC trellis with your bottle gourds since it needs to support the weight of the fruits when they reach full size. Make sure one of the posts is next to the mound so you can easily tie the vines to it. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source You don’t need to use a trellis if you don’t want to. Just spread a 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) layer of mulch around the base of the mound to protect the gourds since they’ll be on the ground. Trellises also free up some space around your gourds since the ground isn’t covered with the vines."

Check the last expected frost date in your area so you can get an estimate of how long you need to wait. You can always start your gourd seeds in peat pots or seed trays up to 4 weeks before the last frost in spring. Just be sure to keep them in an area that’s at least 60 °F (16 °C) and has consistent sunlight throughout the day. [7] X Research source"

Plant 4 seeds per mound with about 3 inches (7.6 cm) between them so you’re more likely to have a healthy plant come in. Use your finger to push the pointed ends of each seed down into the soil.

Stick your finger into the soil and see if it feels wet about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down. If it’s still dry, add a little bit more water before checking again. Be sure to water your seeds again with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water each week. [11] X Research source Set up a rain meter by your gourds so you can easily see how much water they’ve gotten. Install a drip irrigation system if you don’t want to worry about watering since it will keep the soil moist without using too much water."

As soon as you see 2 sets of large leaves growing on 2 of the stems, cut back the weaker growths so your plants get enough water and nutrients from the soil.

You can either use a liquid or granular fertilizer for your gourds. Follow the directions on the packaging and dress the sides of the mounds with the fertilizer. Immediately water the soil so the fertilizer soaks in and gets absorbed by the roots.

Use a pair of pruning shears to take 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) off of the end of the vine to keep it from growing further. This helps the vines lower on the stem grow and form flowers.

Wait until the early evening when the flowers open. Look for the white male flowers on long stalks and pluck one or two off the vine. Turn the flower inside-out to expose the pollen and use a small paintbrush to transfer the pollen inside the female flowers on the shorter vines.
