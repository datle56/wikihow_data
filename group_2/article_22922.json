Every dog is different and there are a lot of variables that go into whether a dog can safely stay outside or not, but as a very general rule of thumb, most dogs will be comfortable outside for a few hours when it is 40–45 °F (4–7 °C). [1] X Research source What temperature is too cold for dogs to sleep outside? Dogs cannot sleep outside if it’s below 45 °F (7 °C), but 60 °F (16 °C) is the ideal temperature for snoozes outside. [2] X Research source What temperature is ideal for dogs to be comfortable indoors? Basically all dogs are most comfortable when it’s 60–80 °F (16–27 °C), which is great since this is most people’s preferred temperature to begin with.

      "content": "Every dog is unique, but breed is the biggest factor. Like people, dogs are all unique personalities with their own special quirks and preferences. The same way some people really hate it when it’s over 80 °F (27 °C) and others start freezing their butts off at 45 °F (7 °C), every dog is unique. However, dogs have been domesticated and bred to perform all kinds of different jobs in all sorts of different environments, so breed is the single biggest factor here. Here are some more general guidelines: [4] X Research source Small breeds: Smaller dog breeds, like pomeranians, Shih Tzus, Yorkshire terriers, and Jack Russell terriers, do not have the thick bones and coats needed to sustain themselves in the cold. They should not be outside in 32–45 °F (0–7 °C) weather for more than 15-30 minutes.

Go to source Medium-to-large breeds: Breeds like dalmatians, rottweilers, great danes, golden retrievers, and English bulldogs can be in 40–45 °F (4–7 °C) weather for a few hours so long as they’re not uncomfortable. They can handle freezing temperatures for up to 30 minutes if they’re exercising. [6] X Research source Arctic breeds: Dogs bred for the cold, like Norwegian elkhounds, Tibetan mastiffs, Huskies, and akitas are happy in the cold. These breeds can handle freezing temperatures for up to an hour, but will can stay outside indefinitely if it’s just chilly.

      "content": "If it’s below 20 °F (−7 °C), it’s too cold for a dog walk. Unless you have an Arctic breed of dog wearing protective booties, walks that last more than 2-3 minutes become dangerous for most dogs when it’s under 20 °F (−7 °C) or so. It’s dangerous to their paws, which can get frostbite, and dogs are prone to hypothermia at these levels. [8] X Research source You can (and should) still let your dog out to use the bathroom, but you shouldn’t spend any extended time outside if you don’t have to. Dogs still need to go out when it’s freezing outside. If they don’t get the exercise they need on a walk, spend more time playing with them indoors."

Huskies, Malamutes, Samoyeds, and other arctic dogs with whiter coats evolved their color to help camouflage them in the snow and ice.
