If your parents buy a lot of take-out, ask them if you can all start taking turns making dinner several nights a week. Your parents are going to worry if they think you're starving yourself. They're less likely to worry if they can see that you are eating well and getting interested in food preparation."

You can calculate your BMI, which is how you find out if your weight is correct for your height, but the BMI fails to factor in things like your genes and your growth. [8] X Research source You can talk to your doctor during an ordinary doctor's appointment. Talk to your pediatrician, who has a record of your weight over your whole childhood, and ask if you are an ordinary weight for your age. You might also ask: \"I'd like to lose weight.

If you have a friend who enjoys exercise, ask if they'll go on hikes with you, or join a dance class and learn ballroom dancing or contra dance. You can lift weights, but wait till you're fully grown. You can't build muscle if you haven't gone through puberty.

Avoid compulsive exercise. This is when you feel like you can't control your own urge to exercise—you must exercise, or you can't relax.

To get enough sleep, get into a good sleep routine.
