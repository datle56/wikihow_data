If you're determined to lighten or color your hair, use a natural method that doesn't cause damage. Try lightening your hair with honey or dyeing it with henna. Learn to love your natural look. If your hair is curly or kinky, there's no natural method that will make it look perfectly straight. Fast-growing, free-flowing hair is beautiful."
