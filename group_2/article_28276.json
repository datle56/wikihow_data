Go to source When you've settled down and made your love nest together, here are some ways to keep the woman in your life melting: Make her breakfast in bed on the weekend. You can also cook breakfast or dinner for the whole family. If you're not already cooking for the family regularly, start making this a regular routine. Also, know what her favorite foods are. When you go grocery shopping together, add them to the cart as an automatic reflex. You'll send shivers of delight down her spine! Do things without having to be asked. Take care of the vacuuming, the pets or the pile of dishes in the sink. Repair broken items around the house. Take care of the kids for a day. Take them out and wear them out so they come home exhausted and don't want to hassle her! Or give her the special delight of arranging an entire day of playing with them and feeding them at home, allowing her to just sit back and enjoy the sound of her children laughing and enjoying themselves all day. This combination that will definitely make her heart melt: you caring for the kids while they are laughing with joy. Take care of her when she's sick. Make special meals, fetch her mail, fluff up her pillows, rub her back, get the temperature \"just right,\" rent her favorite movies, and if you have kids, tell her not to worry because you're taking care of everything. When she's tired, run her a warm bath with something scented in the water, or give her a relaxing massage. Carry her to bed if she falls asleep anywhere else."

[2] X Research source Give traditional gifts in the beginning of the relationship, such as stuffed animals, your sweater or sweatshirt or a piece of jewelry. After you've been together for a while, start coming up with something a little more personalized so that she'll know you're into her. Have the gift customized. For example, you can inscribe a special message on a mug, T-shirt or bracelet. Then, give her a note card that says, \"I want you to know that I appreciate everything you do. I probably should tell you more. I think you're the complete package. So I'm giving you this bracelet to show how much I appreciate you,\" she'll melt. Don't just buy the first bundle of flowers that the florist has to offer. Go out of your way to either select flowers that you know she loves or to find less common ones, such as violets or freesias. You can also pick wildflowers and give them to her yourself--she'll definitely melt. Choose handmade chocolates from a hard-to-find artisan chocolate shop. Or if you're good at it, go all out and make them yourself! [3] X Research source Remember your anniversaries and arrange unique ways to celebrate them.

While you won't find a 1-size-fits-all formula, have a toolbox full of general sweet somethings that you can use until you know her a little better. Here are some of you might like to try: [4] X Research source Acknowledge her sense of humor . Tell her that she makes you laugh. Ask her, \"How was your day?\" It's surprising how many times people forget this simple nicety. Yet, it means a lot because it gives her an open invitation to talk about herself. Ask specific questions about her job or about her day raising your children. If you've been apart a few days, tell her you miss her. Something like: \"Can't wait to see you; feels like it's been an eternity since we've been together.\" If things have been flagging a little lately in the romance department, tell her: \"Honey, I want to increase the romance in our lives.\" Tell her there's no one else like her. She's unique, and nobody else in the world is as right for you as she is. Everyone likes being told how special they are. Doing this serves as an especially powerful tonic if she's feeling insecure. When you're getting ready to propose, tell her: \"I cannot wait to spend every moment of my entire life with you.\""

Some of the cute names women like may include kitten, love, sweetheart, sweetie, babe, gorgeous, darling/darlin', princess or a sweet nickname that you came up with on your own. Tell her that you love her regularly. Few of us tell one another often enough that we love each other.

      "content": "Compliment her often. One important way of letting her know that you appreciate her is to compliment her. Compliments serve as instant mood-boosters and are an important means for reminding her how much you care about her. Don't compliment her so much that she begins to question your sincerity, but at the same time, don't get into a routine that causes you to forget how much she needs to know that you notice her. [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Be specific in your compliments. Instead of making a general remark about how beautiful she is, pinpoint specific aspects of her that amaze you, such as her eyes, her hair or the way she smiles. Singling out a particular reason for why you like or love a person is far more effective than a generalized reason. Ask questions that are a compliment. For example: \"I love your earrings , they are perfect with your outfit. Where did you find them?\" A question like this shows that you notice, that you think she looks great and that she has good taste. Be sincere . If your compliments or comments are not meant sincerely, they won't carry a genuine feeling and she'll pick up on this lack of sincerity. Dale Carnegie once said: \"\"Flattery is from the teeth out. Sincere appreciation is from the heart out.\" Therefore, only say things you feel in your heart and believe with all your might.

Even if you don't agree, strive to understand what she's saying so that you can reach a compromise. Ask questions that provoke her to say more instead of just asking \"yes\" or \"no\" questions.

If it's windy, brush the hair out of her eyes and off her face. Stand behind her, wrap your arms around her and hug her. You can kiss her neck, whisper in her ear or nibble her ears as well. Hold her hips with your hands. When she rolls over to go to sleep, kiss her in between her shoulder blades. It's an erogenous zone. Squeeze her hand three times for \"I - love - you.\" Kiss her eyelids, or give butterfly kisses (using your eyelashes) on her cheeks. When introducing her to your friends and family, put your arm around her. If you're talking to a female friend, pull your woman closer to you. Kiss her hand around your best buddies to show her she's worth it. Hug her. Hugs are great for cheering her up, for saying hello and for reassuring her if she feels jealous. Give her random kisses."
