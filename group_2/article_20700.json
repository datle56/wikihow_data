      "content": "Embrace your interests and hobbies to show that you have a great personality. It’s totally okay to have your own opinions and to like whatever things you are passionate about, even if you feel like those things aren’t “cool.” Don’t pretend to like things you don’t just to try to impress someone.

[7] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “I thought you did a great job giving your presentation in class today.” To compliment his looks, say something like, “Your new haircut looks really good,” or “That sweater really brings out the color of your eyes.” To be a little more flirty, you could say something like, “You always make me laugh!”"

      "content": "Break the touch barrier to see how he responds. Making appropriate physical contact, like touching his arm or shoulder, is a great way to gauge how he feels about you. If he smiles and doesn’t draw away from you, that shows he is okay with your affection. If he does pull back, that means he isn’t interested in being that close to you. [8] X Research source Small moments of physical contact can help build up more of a bond between the two of you, even if it’s just a friendly one."

Send him a text or catch him after class to ask him to get together. Try to be casual and breezy about it, even if you feel really nervous. [11] X Research source Try saying something like, “Hey Bryan, want to get together this Wednesday to get ready for the History test?” If he says yes, that’s great! Just set a time and place to meet. If he says no, try not to take it personally. Maybe he already has a busy schedule or doesn’t plan to study at all. This can work well for things other than class, too. Any shared activity, like band, drama, sports, or student council can be used as an excuse to get together to practice or plan."

This is a great way to test the waters after you’ve seen the guy you like, whether you were studying together or simply at the same event. Don’t text him right after you saw him—instead, wait about 24 hours so that you don’t seem too intense. [13] X Research source Send a text that says something like, “It was cool to see you out the other night.
