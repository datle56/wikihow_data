      "content": "Shiny, black fur This breed is a mix between a black American Shorthair (\"Domestic Shorthair\" in the UK) and a sable Burmese. The result is a glossy, short coat with fur that's black all the way to the roots—just like the Indian black leopards they were bred to resemble. Known as the blackest of all black cats, Bombay kitties even have black paw pads (toe beans) and black noses. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Gold or copper eyes A Bombay's eyes are usually larger and rounder than the average cat's, and they're always a gold or copper color. It's this feature combined with their black fur that gives them the nickname \"the patent-leather kid with the new penny eyes.\""

      "title": "Rounded features",
      "content": "Rounded features Like the panther they're bred to resemble, Bombays have rounded ears and a rounded face with a short, rounded muzzle. Their feet are also rounder than most cats—even the tip of their tail is rounded, not pointy. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cat Fancier's Association World's largest registry of pedigreed cats and organization devoted to the well-being of all cats Go to source Some people claim Bombays have special fangs or different teeth than other cats, but this isn't true. Bombays have the same teeth as other cats, and there's nothing about their teeth listed in the breed standard."

      "title": "Muscular build",
      "content": "Muscular build While Bombays are medium-sized cats, they're all muscle—this means they're typically heavier than you think they'll be when you pick one up. Adult males range from 8 to 10 pounds (3.6 to 4.5 kg), while females reach 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kg). If you're comparing a Bombay cat to a regular black cat, the black cat will typically look leaner and longer than the Bombay."

      "title": "Swaying walk",
      "content": "Swaying walk These rare breed cats don't just look like panthers—they walk like them too! A regular black cat is going to walk like any other cat, but a Bombay takes on the gait of their wild cousins, walking with a swish and a sway on their rounded paws so they always look like they're on the prowl."

      "title": "Vocal",
      "content": "Vocal If you like to have conversations with your cat, you'd love a Bombay because they always have something to say. They love attention and will happily meow all day to anyone who responds. While they're not as loud as Siamese cats, they're more social—meaning they talk just as much, if not more.

    {
      "title": "Smart and inquisitive",
      "content": "Smart and inquisitive Bombay cats enjoy puzzle toys and games that test their smarts. They love to play fetch and learn new tricks. Don't be surprised if you have to add child locks to your kitchen cabinets to keep your Bombay from helping themselves to a treat! A Bombay always wants to be where the action is so they can see what's going on. This is why your Bombay will often follow you around from room to room—they just want to know what you're doing."

      "title": "Active and playful",
      "content": "Active and playful These muscular kitties need lots of exercise, especially when they're younger. A cat tree or other places to climb, jump, and run will give your Bombay plenty of exercise. You might also try getting them a harness so you can take them out for walks (yes, just like a dog). [5] X Research source If you have kids, your Bombay will love playing with them and chasing them around the house. A lot of Bombay owners claim their cat acts more like a dog than a cat. If you have other pets, don't be surprised if your Bombay takes over and becomes the dominant pet of the household. If your pets get into mischief, it's likely the Bombay was the ringleader."

      "content": "Easy-going and sociable Bombays are great with kids and other pets (even dogs) and love their people. Unlike many cats, your Bombay is likely to greet you at the door with a warm \"meow\" when you come home. [6] X Research source Bombays tend to be lap cats, too. They want to be all over you, wherever you are, all the time. Their sociability comes at a price: these extroverted felines do not like to be left alone for extended periods of time. If you don't have any other animals and know you'll have to leave them alone most of the day, this might not be the breed for you."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Cat Fancier's Association World's largest registry of pedigreed cats and organization devoted to the well-being of all cats Go to source It's also worth noting that, given the rarity of this breed, you likely spent a pretty penny for your precious Bombay. Letting them run around outside provides ample opportunity for your valuable pet to get lost or stolen. If you want to take your Bombay outside, try leash-training ! Then you can take them out exploring without worrying they'll get into trouble. [8] X Research source"

As with any cat, it's also a good idea to brush your Bombay's teeth once a week to help prevent gum disease.

In addition to wet food, keep dry food available at all times. [12] X Research source Bombays are very eager eaters that can be prone to overeating. Puzzle feeders will help them eat more slowly.

      "content": "Take your Bombay to the vet for a checkup at least once a year. Many purebred pets are at greater risk for various genetic diseases and disorders. This isn't true for Bombays, being a relatively recent breed and still very rare. At the same time, though, you want to make sure your precious parlor panther is as healthy as they can be with yearly checkups. [13] X Research source As with all cats, Bombays are at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is the most common heart disease among cats and can result in heart failure. Although it's genetic, it won't show up for the first few years of your cat's life, so screening your adult cat is crucial. Knowledgeable breeders test their breeding cats for other genetic diseases. If you're looking to add a Bombay cat to your home, only adopt from a respected breeder with a good reputation."
