      "title": "Get a sheet of printer paper.",
      "content": "Get a sheet of printer paper. Something that is around 8½ by 11 inches (21.59 by 27.94 centimeters) would be ideal, but you can use any sort of rectangular paper. For a more interesting blowgun, use a bright, fun color. If you want to be stealthy, use a neutral color, such as white, black, grey, tan, or army green."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the paper, lengthwise, into a thin tube.",
      "content": "Roll the paper, lengthwise, into a thin tube. The tube should be about the width of your finger. You can also roll the paper around a pen, pencil, or dowel. If you do this, be sure to slide it out when you are done. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap a piece of tape around the middle and both ends of the paper tube.",
      "content": "Wrap a piece of tape around the middle and both ends of the paper tube. Plain scotch tape will do for this, but you can also use colored washi tape to make your blow gun look more interesting. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add more tape between those first three pieces of tape.",
      "content": "Add more tape between those first three pieces of tape. You don't have to wrap the tape around the tube this time. Just place short strips of tape between the middle and end pieces of tape. This will hold the flaps down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap extra tape around the end that you will be putting your mouth on.",
      "content": "Wrap extra tape around the end that you will be putting your mouth on. This will protect the paper and keep it from getting ruined. Wrap a piece of tape around the end of the tube so that the tape is sticking out slightly. Tuck the tape back into the tube, and press it against the walls. If your tube is very small, you may have to use a pen or pencil to do this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut several rectangles out of plain paper.",
      "content": "Cut several rectangles out of plain paper. The rectangles need to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long. [3] X Research source Each piece of paper will make one dart. You can make as many darts as you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the rectangle into a tight cone, starting from the upper left-hand side.",
      "content": "Wrap the rectangle into a tight cone, starting from the upper left-hand side. You can use a sharpened pencil to help curve the paper as you go. Don't worry if the dart looks like it will be too wide at the end. You will fix that in a moment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap a piece of tape around the cone to hold it together.",
      "content": "Wrap a piece of tape around the cone to hold it together. Use clear tape for this, so that you can see the paper. This is your dart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the tip of the dart into the end of the blowgun.",
      "content": "Place the tip of the dart into the end of the blowgun. Do not force the dart into the dart. If it falls through the blowgun easily, you are ready to go. If it won't fit all the way into the blowgun, make a mark on the dart where the blowgun touches it. You can use a pen or pencil to do this. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the dart out of the blowgun and trim it down, if needed.",
      "content": "Pull the dart out of the blowgun and trim it down, if needed. If the dart fell through the blowgun, then you can skip this step. If the dart was too big and you had to make a mark, simply cut the dart in half using the mark as a guide. Your dart may start to come undone after you cut it. If that happens, simply wrap more tape around it."

    {
      "title": "Add a toothpick, but only if you plan on being responsible.",
      "content": "Add a toothpick, but only if you plan on being responsible. Paper darts can hurt if you fire them at someone. Toothpick darts will hurt even more. Never fire toothpick darts at another person or animal. You can fire them at balloons and other targets, however. Here is what you need to do: Trim the tip of the dart until you get a hole big enough for you to slide a toothpick into. [5] X Research source Push a toothpick into the hole until about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) is sticking out. Wrap some tape around the tip of the dart to hold the toothpick in place. Cut or break off any extra toothpick that is sticking out of the open/wider end of the dart."

    {
      "title": "Use the blowgun.",
      "content": "Use the blowgun. Push the dart into the mouth part of the blowgun, pointy part first. Hold the blowgun up to your lips, and point it at your target. Give the blowgun a sharp, quick blow."
