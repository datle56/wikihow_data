      "content": "Prevent the ants from climbing the plant's stem using a homemade ant trap. If keeping the ants off the peonies at all times is your goal, you can make a simple ant trap using paper and petroleum jelly. Cut a circle with about 6 inches (15 cm) wide out of a piece of paper. Make a straight cut from the outer edge to the center of the circle, and then cut out a small circle at the center of the paper circle. Smear one side of the paper circle with petroleum jelly. Then, place the circle around the stem of your peony plant, with the plant's stem at the center of the circle. [5] X Research source If the petroleum jelly side is facing up, any ants trying to climb the plant will get stuck in it. You can also buy commercial ant bait traps to kill the entire ant colony.

      "content": "Cut and rinse the peonies when the buds are at the “marshmallow stage.” Peony buds that are showing some of the petals and soft when you squeeze them gently, like a marshmallow, are ready to cut. Before you bring the buds inside, rinse them in cold water to get rid of any ants. Put the stems in a vase so that the flowers will bloom. For even more effective removal of the ants, you can add a few drops of dish soap to the water. A mild soapy solution will not harm the flowers. [7] X Research source"
