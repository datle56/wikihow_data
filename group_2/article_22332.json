This can sometimes be done in the doctor's office and doesn't require anesthesia, though it might take several patches to fully repair the damage. If surgery is required, it will be performed while you're under anesthesia. Most people can leave the hospital the same day.

[27] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Over-the-ear headphones are technically safe. However, exposing your ears to loud noise can cause pain and permanent hearing damage. Skip the headphones where possible, and if they're truly necessary, keep the volume low.
