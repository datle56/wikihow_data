      "content": "Wash and measure the rosemary. Wash a few sprigs of fresh rosemary under cold, running water to remove any dirt and debris. Next, remove the leaves from the stem and measure out about a cup of leaves. [1] X Research source Leftover rosemary leaves can be discarded or set aside for other recipes."

      "title": "Fill a small saucepan with oil.",
      "content": "Fill a small saucepan with oil. Measure out two cups of oil and pour them into a small saucepan. Most people prefer to use olive oil for its flavor, cooking uses, and cosmetic applications. However, if you’re planning on exclusively using your oil for beauty purposes, you can use jojoba oil or sweet almond oil. [2] X Expert Source Lorena Barcal Clinical Herbalist & Clean Beauty Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2020. [3] X Research source Jojoba oil and sweet almond oil should not be eaten or used in cooking."

      "title": "Heat the rosemary in the oil.",
      "content": "Heat the rosemary in the oil. Add the rosemary sprigs to the saucepan. Place the pan over low heat on your stove. Heat the rosemary for five to ten minutes, stirring constantly. [4] X Research source As the oil warms up, it will begin to smell like rosemary. If the oil begins bubbling around the rosemary, the oil is too hot. Reduce the heat and stir."

      "title": "Strain and cool the oil.",
      "content": "Strain and cool the oil. Place a metal colander in a large metal bowl. Pour the oil mixture into the colander to strain out the rosemary pieces. Discard the leftover pieces of rosemary and let the oil cool in the bowl. [5] X Research source Metal strainers and cheesecloths can also be used to strain the oil. Make sure the oil has cooled before using these tools."

      "title": "Bottle the oil.",
      "content": "Bottle the oil. Once the oil has cooled to room temperature, it can be poured into a clean bottle. Label the bottle with the bottling date and the ingredients used. However, resist the urge to add a sprig of rosemary to the bottle. It looks pretty, but it can cause harmful bacteria to grow in the oil. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Refrigerate the oil.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the oil. Oils infused with fresh herbs should be refrigerated and used within the week. [7] X Research source This will prevent the growth of any harmful bacteria that could cause the oil to become rancid. If the oil is a gift, be sure to include a “use by” date on the label."

      "title": "Sanitize a canning jar.",
      "content": "Sanitize a canning jar. Fill a large, deep pot with water and place it over medium-high heat. Once the water comes to a boil, use tongs to place the canning jar in the water. Let the jar boil for ten minutes to kill any harmful bacteria that may ruin your rosemary oil. You don’t need to boil the lid. Instead, wash the lid with soap and water and let it air dry. [8] X Research source You can also use a boiling-water canner to sterilize the canning jar. If so, follow the manufacturer instructions."

      "title": "Put dried rosemary in the jar.",
      "content": "Put dried rosemary in the jar. If you dried your own rosemary, place three to four sprigs in the jar. If you’re using prepackaged dried rosemary, add a large tablespoon to the canning jar. [9] X Research source Do not use fresh, undried rosemary. If you do, your oil will become rancid and might grow harmful Botulism bacteria.

Make sure all of the rosemary is completely submerged in the oil. [11] X Research source If necessary, use a clean spoon to push dried rosemary into the oil.

      "title": "Strain the oil.",
      "content": "Strain the oil. Place a cheesecloth in a large metal bowl. The edges of the cheesecloth should hang over the sides of the bowl. Next, pour the contents of the canning jar into the cheesecloth. Gather the cheesecloth into a bundle and squeeze it over the bowl to separate the oil from the small dried rosemary pieces. [13] X Research source Use clean hands to squeeze the cheesecloth. Discard the leftover pieces of rosemary."
