Repeat this for the other corner, then peel off the backing from the exposed side of each strip. Press the item against the wall and hold it firmly against the wall for 30 seconds. [1] X Research source Handyman Jason Phillip says to read the front of the Command Strip packaging to ensure it can support the weight of the item you want to hang. [2] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. The strips come in different sizes with different weight capacities up to 20 lb (9.1 kg). You can use Command Strips on pretty much any smooth wall surface without damaging the wall. Phillip does not recommend using Command Strips on stucco or cement or rooms that get humid, as the humidity can weaken the adhesive.

      "content": "Hook-and-loop tape is super easy to take down. Cut the hook-and-loop tape to fit in the top back corners or along the top and bottom edges of an item you want to hang.

[4] X Research source You can hang items up to about 10 lb (4.5 kg) using this method. This is also a great option if you want to hang something flexible, such as a tapestry. You can even hang such items on a curved wall this way. When you want to remove the tape from your wall, carefully slide a sharp utility knife or razor blade between the adhesive and the wall to take it down without damaging the paint."

      "content": "Decorate your walls with peel-and-stick decals . Wall decals work similarly to stickers, except they’re made from sticky vinyl that attaches to your wall without leaving behind residue or damage when you peel it off. To apply a decal , wipe down the wall with a damp sponge to remove dirt and dust. Then, remove the paper backing and smooth the decal onto the wall. [8] X Research source For instance, decorate your walls with polka dot decals , abstract shape decals , floral decals , or cartoon character decals . As another idea, cover your entire wall with peel-and-stick wallpaper . Wall decals stick best to smooth surfaces. Most wall decals are single-use, as they tend to lose their stickiness once they’re peeled off the wall. However, there are some reusable decals."

Then, wrap the other end of the wire around 1 side of a metal S-hook. Hook the other side of the S-hook over a strip of built-in wall molding. [9] X Research source A screw eye is a small screw with a metal loop at 1 end. You typically use it to attach wire across the back of a picture frame. An S-hook is a metal hook in the shape of an S. They come in different sizes, so choose a hook that is appropriately-sized for the molding you plan to hang it on.

[10] X Research source Use colorful paper clips or binder clips as an alternative to clothespins. If you don't want to drill into your walls at all, try using Command Hooks to hold each end of the yarn instead."

      "content": "Paint your walls with magnetic paint to hang light items with magnets . Magnetic paint contains small iron particles that make the wall you apply it on magnetic. Simply choose a paint color you like and clean the wall. Then, use a foam paint roller to apply 2 to 4 thin coats—this ensures the paint has a strong magnetic pull. Simply hang up unframed artwork, photos, and posters with strong, rare earth magnets. [16] X Research source Magnetic paint is not as strong as a regular magnetic surface. So, most magnets can only hold up 1 item. Follow the painting instructions on your can of magnetic paint for information on how many coats you may need and how long each coat needs to dry. Magnetic paint works best on drywall, as opposed to other surfaces."
