      "title": "Go to the Vanilla Unicorn strip club.",
      "content": "Go to the Vanilla Unicorn strip club. Unlike in GTA IV, the only way to have a \"girlfriend\" in GTA V is by interacting with one of the stripper non-playable characters (NPCs) in the Vanilla Unicorn. You can find the Vanilla Unicorn next to the Olympic Freeway in Strawberry, Los Santos. [1] X Research source The Vanilla Unicorn is marked by a high-heel shoe on your minimap."

      "content": "Accept the dance. When prompted, press the key or button that appears on-screen to accept a private dance from the woman. Private dances cost $40 in-game . If you have less than $40, you won't be prompted to accept the dance."

      "content": "Use the \"Touch\" and \"Flirt\" options. When the bouncer isn't watching you, hold the \"Touch\" key or button to begin filling up the \"Like\" bar. If the bouncer is watching you, you can repeatedly press the \"Flirt\" button or key to increase the \"Like\" bar's progress in small increments. Use the \"Touch\" option whenever the bouncer isn't looking at you."

      "content": "Avoid the bouncer. The bouncer will periodically walk by, stop, turn, and look into the private room for a few seconds before leaving again. Make sure that you don't touch the woman while he's looking at you. [3] X Research source If the bouncer sees you use the \"Touch\" option three times, you will be thrown out of the club, at which point you will have to re-enter the club and try again."

      "content": "Fill up the \"Like\" bar before the dance ends. If you're able to fill up the bar before the end of the dance, the woman will mention that she wants you to join her at her house. If you don't manage to fill up the \"Like\" bar, you can request another dance and try again. Around 50 percent of the NPCs in the strip club will make this offer. If you don't hear it, try the dance again, or try another NPC."

[5] X Research source Once in your phone, the woman's number can't be removed or lost. You can't technically do anything with your girlfriend (e.g., go on dates) except meet up for a conjugal visit again."
