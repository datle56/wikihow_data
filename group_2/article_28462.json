Carrier oil options include: [1] X Research source Grapeseed oil, which has almost no smell and absorbs into the skin well. Jojoba oil, which is a liquid wax that is great for sensitive skin since it isn’t a nut oil. Avocado oil, which penetrates deeply and is great for rejuvenating dry, sensitive skin. Almond oil, which is rich in vitamin A and E and is subtle enough for sensitive skin. Hazelnut oil, which has almost no scent so it won’t overpower other oils. It is a nut oil, so be sure not to use it on anyone with a nut allergy. [3] X Research source [v161216_b01]. 10 December 2019.
