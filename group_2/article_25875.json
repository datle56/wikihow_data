If you're seeking to let someone down in an empathetic matter, take some time to consider the proper location and timeframe to talk to them. Face-to-face is ideal for difficult conversations . Humans evolved to pick up on non-verbal cues and signals that are reassuring during difficult conversations. An impromptu pat on the shoulder, for example, can reassure someone they are essentially lovable even if this one relationship did not work out. A look of sadness on your face can help your partner see you truly care about their feelings, despite the fact you feel the relationship should end. [1] X Research source If possible, choose to have the talk at a place where your significant other feels comfortable. Choose to stop by their apartment to talk, for example. It may feel uncomfortable for you but giving someone a slight sense of power during a difficult conversation can help them digest bad news. If you anticipate a long conversation, try to choose a time where the conversation will not be cut short by external factors. Do not, for example, break up with your longterm boyfriend an hour before he has to leave for work. Instead, choose to stop by his place shortly after dinner on a weeknight. This will allow any lingering loose threads to be addressed."

Oftentimes, people feel it will be easier if their partner initiates the breakup. However, you are the one whose feelings have changed. It's your responsibility to start the breakup conversation . Trying to lead your partner to the conclusion that you want to break up through subtle cues is not only dishonest, it can be confusing. Your partner may not get the message and begin to question themself as you subtly pull away.

      "content": "Be open and direct about your feelings. It's best to be honest when letting someone down. While you do not have to go over every single reason you want out, it's important to be direct about your expectations. Make it clear you want to end the relationship and give your partner a brief explanation as to why. The essential message that most breakups boil down to is, \"You're not what I'm looking for.\" It's perfectly okay to express this. This will allow the recipient to have a sense of closure as they will understand your reasoning. It's okay to gently say something like, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not in love with you anymore. I need something different right now and I think we should go our separate ways.\" If it's a less serious relationship, you can keep the statement briefer. Something like, \"Sorry, but I'm not feeling a significant spark between us. I think we would be better off friends.\" [3] X Research source Honesty is important, but it does not have to be brutal. It's not a good idea to go over your partner's past mistakes or current pitfalls. If you're leaving because you're no longer attracted to your partner, for example, this might be best unsaid. If you want to let someone down easily, keep your statements for ending the relationship general and don't hesitate to praise your partner's good qualities instead of talking about what didn't work. This helps convey the message that you simply don't want to be with them anymore instead of insulting them as a person. [4] X Research source Being honest can seem hard, but it's kinder than just ghosting someone, which can be emotionally painful for the other person in the long run.

      "content": "Keep it short. Once again, while it's great to be honest you should also be direct. You are not doing your partner any good by beating around the bush and avoiding the subject at hand. Start the conversation off with a direct declaration of what you want, something like, \"I wanted to talk to you because I don't feel this relationship is working out.\" From there, try to keep the conversation brief. Try to speak from the heart rather than going over a prepared speech. Letting someone down can be difficult but remaining calm and collected is important. This way, you'll be able to get your words out in a concise manner. Becoming overly emotional can result in confusing rambling, obscuring the message at hand. Try to spend some time emotionally preparing for the conversation by running over a script in your head. [6] X Research source You could write down some of what you plan to say. While memorizing a speech may not be the best route, this can make you come off as cold, having some idea of what you can say can help you focus. Practice your words a few times before the confrontation. [7] X Research source"

However, if you want to let your ex down easy playing the blame game is not a good idea. Avoiding negativity of any kind is one of the best ways to spare someone's feelings. Going over past mistakes or resentments can spur an argument, resulting in an unclean and unpleasant breakup. [10] X Research source If you suspect your partner may not take the breakup well, keep in mind they may try to blame you. Avoid being sucked into a negative conversation.

While many find social media cathartic when coping with a breakup, keep in mind your ex's feelings may be hurt by what you choose to post. It may also be a good idea to stop following your ex on any social media platforms. During a breakup, you'll need time to cultivate some space between you and your partner to help you move on. Severing the social media tie a bit can help. In general, it's best to not get others involved. Instead, try to keep things between you and your ex.

If you're being gentle because you are worried about your safety, just end things quickly. Don't worry about being gentle. If you're worried about their reaction, bring a trusted friend along.

If you're trying to let her down because you've hit a rough patch, ask yourself if you really dislike her or just dislike your current state. Don't rush into this decision. Wait 2-3 weeks to see if your feelings change. Try writing a list of pros and cons to help clarify your decision. Use this to see if there are things you can adjust rather than simply ending the relationship. Many people like the \"gentle let down\" because it lets you change your mind later on. If you do keep changing your mind, however, you are likely in a short lull, not some relationship crisis.
