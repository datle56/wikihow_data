However, the Horstachio romance challenge is very challenging, so some practice is required. In Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise , if you have six or more Horstachios in your garden and you're breeding another one, if you are able to complete the challenge and collect ALL the hearts in the level without getting hit by a Loather bomb, then you may be rewarded with a \"Wildcard\" piñata or twin Wildcard piñatas. Wildcard piñatas are 10 times as valuable and allows you to sell it for lots of chocolate coins. However this is very challenging so if it is too hard for you, then sell off all but two of the Horstachios to reset the challenge to have five lives."
