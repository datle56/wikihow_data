    {
      "title": "Keep it simple.",
      "content": "Keep it simple. Taylor wears a fair amount of make-up, but she never overdoes it. She keeps it simple and natural , and everyone knows that Taylor has the most beautiful eyes. Other than her cat eyes and red lipstick, the rest of her look is au naturel. She prefers nude, and light pink colors around her eyes and skin, so there's no need for overly-dramatic makeup. That said, there's always a bit of a difference between day makeup and night makeup. Your daytime Taylor look can be a bit more subtle, and your night Taylor look can include darker, more dramatic shadows, a bit more blush, and more vibrant lipstick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear the right eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Wear the right eyeshadow. Taylor's trick is thick eyelashes, pretty shadows, and smart eyeliners. For shadows, go with sweet colors, like pastel pinks and purples, or go with bright colors; another look Taylor very often wears is a plum, brown, or black smokey eye. Use a brush to gently blend the shadow into your eyelids, using the darker colors on the outside and inner corner of the lids."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear mascara.",
      "content": "Wear mascara. Taylor typically wears black mascara, which goes great with her fair skin and makes her eyes pop. If you still don't have that full thick look that Taylor has, put on some fake eyelashes , then apply mascara. Just be careful with fake eyelashes — you don't want them to look so fake that they're distracting. You can experiment and use dark brown or even plum-colored mascara as well. If you really struggle with lashes, try cutting your lash strips in half or in thirds and gluing them from the outer corner inwards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get smooth skin like Taylor's.",
      "content": "Get smooth skin like Taylor's. This doesn't mean that you should wear loads of makeup, but that you should take care of your face. You should wash your face at least twice a day to prevent breakouts or even try acne cream or a cleanser if you need it. Though her skin is pretty light, you can aim to get a bit of a tan so you don't look too pale. Having tanner skin can help it look more smooth, too. You don't need to get a spray-on tan; just spend a bit more time in the sunshine! Try applying some skin cream on every day to get the ultra-smooth skin. It's also nice to spritz on some nice-smelling perfume or lotion, but remember not to put on too much!"
    },
    {
      "title": "It shouldn't matter if your eyes aren't blue.",
      "content": "It shouldn't matter if your eyes aren't blue. Just use a little bit of mascara and some eyeliner (black is the better color). If you like eyeshadow, put on a little bit of a peachy color. This has always been Taylor's known eye makeup method."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get cat eyes like Taylor's.",
      "content": "Get cat eyes like Taylor's. Do some wingtip black eyeliner and set it with a dark shadow, making an oval shape on the outer corner. Use a black liquid liner, or a thin brush and some cream liner, and try to make the line thin, at first, so you don't overdo it and create a look that is too dramatic. The cat eyes are the most signature part of Taylor's look, so it can be important to practice to get it down. Just know that it can be a little challenging to get that “cat eyes” look on your first try — it'll take a bit of practice, so try it at home a few times when you don't have anywhere to go before you debut this new look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rock the red lipstick.",
      "content": "Rock the red lipstick. Taylor Swift is famous for her bright red lipstick and can be seen wearing it on the red carpet, or on casual hangouts with friends. Though bright red lipstick isn't flattering for everyone — it can look best on very light or darker skin, but a bit off on tanner skin — you can still try it to see if it suits you. Taylor has nice, full lips, so you can line your lips a bit to get that pouty bottom lip that contributes to her beauty. If red lipstick is too much for you, then you can try a lighter color, like a subtle pink, or even run a clear gloss over your lips. Taylor has been seen wearing very light lipstick, too. You can also try applying a tinted lip balm if you'd like to go for something more natural."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put a bit of blush on your cheeks.",
      "content": "Put a bit of blush on your cheeks. Taylor doesn't wear dramatic blush, but she does put a little bit of color on the apples of her cheeks. After you apply foundation, take a blush brush to the hollows of your cheeks and make sure to gently blend in the blush so it looks natural. Use just a little bit of blush at first and add a bit more if you think it would improve your look. You can skip out on the blush during the day and use it for more formal, nighttime events, too. If you have fair skin like Taylor, then blush can really help add some rose to your look."

    {
      "title": "Consider going blonde.",
      "content": "Consider going blonde. If you want to look like Taylor, you definitely don't have to change the color of your locks. However, her hair has been pretty consistently light blonde since the beginning of her career, so you can give it a try if you've been getting bored with your brown or red locks. You can give it a go and dye your hair blonde, or just get some blond highlights in your darker tresses if you're really committed to owning the Taylor look. If you have any other hair color than blonde it might not matter. Since you are yourself, we don't want your look to be too exact unless it's Halloween. So all you should do is curl it with big, buoyant locks. That said, you can totally pick and choose which aspects of Taylor's looks you'd like to emulate. If dying your hair isn't for you, skip it. Taylor would tell you to be yourself and to do what feels right."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curl your hair.",
      "content": "Curl your hair. Though Taylor's hair has most recently been feathery and straight, if you want a more classic Taylor look, then you can use a curling iron or even rollers to get the extra-curly Taylor look. Her hair has varied in degrees of curliness, and you can try for the extra-curled ringlets first and then see if you'd like a looser, more flowing look. Here's how you can try to get those curls: A good way to get Taylor Swift hair: after washing your hair, separate it into parts and put it up in large rollers. Let your hair dry, and once it is, take out the rollers, and you'll see what a great result you will get. If you do not want super defined curls, then just wash your hair and add a bit of mousse. Then place your head down and flip your hair over and dry your hair slowly while scrunching it. If your hair is really straight, then you will have to use mousse and a curling iron . Be careful not to burn your hair by making sure that your hair is 100% dry before beginning to curl. After, use a bit of hairspray to keep the look and hold the curl."

    {
      "title": "Wear your hair down like Taylor.",
      "content": "Wear your hair down like Taylor. If you want to rock the curls, then let those ringlets flow! Taylor sometimes wears hair extensions to get that extra-long, curly look, and you can try doing that, or just growing your hair out past your shoulders. Just a bit of mousse and spray to hold those curls in place, and you should be fine with letting those curls flow down over your face, nice and loose. [1] X Research source She doesn't wear her hair half up too often or use a lot of hair accessories or bobby pins normally; so, like Taylor, just show off your pretty curls the natural way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear your hair up like Taylor.",
      "content": "Wear your hair up like Taylor. Sometimes Taylor puts her hair up instead of letting it flow down. She often straightens it to do this. She has sometimes put it up in a higher ponytail and rocked the straight bangs, letting a wisp of hair fall on either side of her face. This can give you a break from maintaining those beautiful curls and can add a new dimension to your Taylor-inspired look. You don't have to straighten it to wear it up, either. You can rock an updo with Taylor's curls as well."

    {
      "title": "Rock straight hair like Taylor's.",
      "content": "Rock straight hair like Taylor's. Though Taylor is associated with her curly hair, a lot of time has passed since she sang “Teardrops on My Guitar.” While she still loves the curly-haired look, she also likes to mix it up now and again and goes for the super straight hair. You can have straight hair with or without bangs, wear it straight down, hide it under a beanie or a top hat, place it in a side-braid, or even let it fall to the left side of your face. Taylor has done all of these things and has looked fabulous every time. She has occasionally worn her straight hair half up, half down, but she mostly goes for one or the other."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rock the bangs.",
      "content": "Rock the bangs. Taylor has also worn bangs, adding a cute new dimension to her straight-haired look. If you want to try the straight hair version of Taylor, then consider getting some bangs to match. You can get regular bangs that fall just above your eyebrows, shorter, thinner bangs that are even less prominent, falling an inch above your brows, or dramatic, fuller bangs that fall just above your eyes — Taylor has rocked all three. You can show those bangs off by wearing your hair down straight or putting it in a braid or ponytail. When you grow them out, you can also let them fall around one side of your face, just like Taylor does it."

      "title": "Wear dresses.",
      "content": "Wear dresses. Taylor has said herself that she absolutely loves dresses, and you can almost always see her wearing one. Some memorable ones include her blue dress in the video for \"Our Song\", and the long, bluish-green, off-the-shoulder dress she wears in the video for \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", and yet another stunning dress in \"Mean\". Though Taylor has an edge to her, she's definitely not apologetic about being a girly girl. Taylor even has her own sundress line for L.E.I. at Walmart; this is a good place to buy Taylor-inspired dresses for reasonable prices. When you need a more formal look, try a semi-formal dress accented with a bold accessory such as a wide belt or large handbag. She wears a lot of dresses that are peach-colored or white. When she's not wearing solid-colored dresses, she can be seen in more casual polka dot or striped dresses, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rock the jeans.",
      "content": "Rock the jeans. Taylor wears jeans a lot, too. Light wash boot cut jeans and dark wash straight legs are what she wears. Again, you can buy the from L.E.I. or you can go to JC Penny for a less expensive pair of jeans than the top designers. Most clothing stores at the mall are most likely going to be less expensive than outlet centers. With the jeans, she wears light tees. Like the color white, but sometimes black and brown. She wears tanks, baby doll tees, and tanks with jackets. On chilly days, she wears long trench coats with leggings and boots."

    {
      "title": "Wear casual sweaters and long-sleeved shirts.",
      "content": "Wear casual sweaters and long-sleeved shirts. When Taylor's not on the red carpet, she also wears pull-overs, preppy sweaters, long-sleeved shirts in solid colors, or just cute thin sweaters with large polka dots, pandas, stars, or hearts all over them. She likes to go for a more playful look when she's not at an awards show."

      "title": "Go for the thick glasses every once in a while.",
      "content": "Go for the thick glasses every once in a while. Taylor has been seen sporting black thick-framed glasses as well as red thick-framed glasses. You can go for a more casual look and try wearing a pair of these glasses, along with putting your hair in a braid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider painting your nails blue.",
      "content": "Consider painting your nails blue. Taylor has been seen with dark blue shiny nails. Try \"midnight cami\" by Essie. She also wears clear nails, pink nails, or nails with more subtle colors as well. She has often been seen with bright red nails, which match the color of her lipstick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a 13 on your hand.",
      "content": "Draw a 13 on your hand. Taylor always draws a 13 on her hand. Outline a 13 with a black marker, go and color it in with a turquoise/light blue marker and paint over it with clear glittery nail polish. She draws this number on the outside of her right hand because she believes the number 13 brings her good luck; she was born on the 13th of December, her first album went gold in 13 weeks, and her first #1 song had a 13-second intro. Every time she has won an award she's been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear the right shoes.",
      "content": "Wear the right shoes. Taylor usually wears cowgirl boots, flats, and high heels . Her current favorites are Keds in every style and pattern, and Oxfords are another love of Tay's. Keds and Oxfords are affordable, and you can find cowgirl boots at a reasonable price at Target or on sale at BP, so Taylor's look won't be out of your price range. The important is that you wear the shoes with confidence, not that you wear the most expensive boots out there. Though Taylor can be a bit of tomboy, she likes to dress up, too. She has been seen in shiny black flats, high heels with thicker heels, and peek-a-boo heels, too. She likes heels that are silver, brown, or black."

      "title": "Be a country girl at heart.",
      "content": "Be a country girl at heart. Think \"country girl\", but this doesn't mean you have to wear plaid shirts or t-shirts and jeans every day. Taylor Swift has a balance of tomboy and girly, and her style is very romantic. A cute skirt and shirt or sundresses make a great start — and don't forget the boots! Taylor loves wearing sundresses, and you can or should try putting an old denim jacket over that. The important thing is that you don't let society tell you to stop looking so “country” if you want to look mainstream. And remember that “country” isn't just a way to dress — it's a way of life."

    {
      "title": "Smile often.",
      "content": "Smile often. Taylor is known for her friendliness and her super sweet smile. Make sure that your teeth are in good shape. Buy mouthwash, floss, toothpaste and if your teeth are still not healthy, whitening toothpaste. Remember to combine whitening toothpaste with regular toothpaste when you use it because whitening toothpaste does not prevent cavities. Remember that Taylor is never too cool to smile at anybody, and you shouldn't be, either."
