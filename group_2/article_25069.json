      "title": "Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around problem areas.",
      "content": "Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around problem areas. Apply a fine layer of diatomaceous earth anywhere you notice ants gathering in. Common indoor areas are behind appliances, in cabinets, along the edges of carpets, and beneath rugs. Outdoor areas such as entrance ways, patios, window frames, and garden beds are also common. [1] X Research source Only use food-grade diatomaceous earth. Some diatomaceous earth is used for cleaning swimming pools, but this variety usually contains pesticides and other chemicals that can be toxic to pets and small children if ingested. On the other hand, food-grade diatomaceous earth is non-toxic, and is safe to use throughout your home. Diatomaceous earth is a natural compound made from ground, fossilized shells of diatoms, a type of small marine organism. The powder is very abrasive and absorbent. Once an ant crosses over it, diatomaceous earth damages the waxy, protective coating on the ant's exterior, which means that the ant can't hold water. The ant does not die instantaneously, but it does eventually die from dehydration. The ants need to physically come into contact with diatomaceous earth for it to be effective."

      "title": "Spray the ants and entry points with white vinegar and water.",
      "content": "Spray the ants and entry points with white vinegar and water. Make a solution that is equal parts white vinegar and water. Put it into a spray bottle, and spray all of the entry points to your home, such as windows, doors, and baseboard. You can spray the ants directly too. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source This will take a few hours to kill any ants that cross over these areas. Repeat this every day for 1 week for the best results. You can wipe up any dead ants with a damp paper towel."

      "title": "Use a dish soap and water mixture to kill visible ants.",
      "content": "Use a dish soap and water mixture to kill visible ants. Combine equal parts water and dish soap in a large spray bottle. Shake to combine, and spray any visible ants with the solution. [3] X Research source The solution will stick to the ants and the dish soap suffocates the ants to death. This tactic only kills the ants that have been sprayed, so it’s good to use in conjunction with a method where the colony and queen is targeted too. If you have a problem with ants on a plant, you can spray the plant with dish soap and water to help get rid of the ants. The spray won't harm the plant, but will be effective against the ants."

      "title": "Sprinkle talcum powder around entry points to your home.",
      "content": "Sprinkle talcum powder around entry points to your home. Use a baby powder or body powder that contains talc, and sprinkle it liberally around foundations, windows, and doors. This causes ants to scatter and turn the other way when they reach the talcum powder. Ants are unable to cross through the powder, but will be kept from getting into your home. You will need to kill any ants that remain behind inside your house."

      "content": "Make a paste of sugar and borax to attract ants from the nest. Combine 1 part borax to 3 parts white sugar. Slowly mix in a little water until the solution forms a paste. Apply the paste to the inside of jar lids, and place the traps near points of entry, food sources, and other spots frequented by the ants. [4] X Research source Borax, or sodium borate, is a salt of boric acid. This compound is often used for cleaning purposes and is usually sold in the detergent aisle of a supermarket. Borax can be toxic if consumed, you should keep these traps away from small children and pets. Ants are attracted to the sweetness of the paste and take it back to the nest, where the queen consumes it. Eventually, the borax poisons all of the ants that ingested it."

      "title": "Make a trap using boric acid and corn syrup.",
      "content": "Make a trap using boric acid and corn syrup. Mix together 1 tsp (4.1 g) of boric acid with ¼ cup (2.6 oz) of corn syrup. Place a few drops on a piece of waxed paper, and place the paper in an area that you see ants passing by. [5] X Research source Boric acid is available from pharmacies. The ants will carry the solution back to the nest, where it will be effective in wiping out the colony. Replace the drops daily until there are no more ants. You can store the mixture for up to 2 weeks in a sealed container at room temperature."

      "title": "Use insect sticky traps to monitor an area for ants.",
      "content": "Use insect sticky traps to monitor an area for ants. Place sticky traps along the edges of walls, and any other places where you think the ants could be travelling. Traps that are placed 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) apart in places where the ants are likely to travel are the most effective. [6] X Research source Sticky traps are also effective for other non-flying pests such as cockroaches, spiders, and mites."

      "title": "Place ant bait stations around your home.",
      "content": "Place ant bait stations around your home. Purchase ant bait and place a station in every room that has an ant problem, focusing on areas where ants gather most often. Continue to refresh the bait until the ants stop showing up. [7] X Research source You can purchase ant bait stations from many supermarkets, department stores, and garden centers. Check the instructions of the ant bait stations for information about whether the product is safe to use with pets and children. Many products will specify placing the stations out of reach from children and pets. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source The ant bait will kill the ant that has consumed it, and the other ants will eat the body and will receive the poison too."

      "title": "Spray visible ants with ant spray.",
      "content": "Spray visible ants with ant spray. Purchase a consumer spray pesticide specifically labeled to work against ants. Follow the instructions, spraying visible ants and perimeters in the manner described on the label. [9] X Research source Ant spray can be purchased from most grocery stores, garden centers, and department stores. It is absolutely crucial that you follow the instructions on the label. Not doing so can prevent the product from working and may even pose a health risk to you and your family. Make sure to use a pesticide labeled for use with ant problems. Some pesticide and insecticide chemicals are more useful against some insects than they are with others, so an insecticide meant to work on bees, for instance, may not work against ants. Some sprays kill ants instantaneously. Others coat the ants with a toxic chemical, killing them gradually so that the poison has a chance to get back to the nest first."

      "title": "Call an exterminator if you get repeat infestations.",
      "content": "Call an exterminator if you get repeat infestations. Many ant problems can be solved at home with consumer products or natural solutions, but some severe infestations may require the help of a professional exterminator. Exterminators can quickly locate and kill the colony. [10] X Research source The exterminator will be able to assess the situation and determine which chemical will prove most effective against the ants. Chemicals used by professional exterminators are often more powerful than those available to consumers. Different species of ants require different treatments. A professional exterminator will be able to determine what species of ant you're dealing with and recommend the best solution. [11] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. If you have small children, pets, or other sources of concern, make sure to let the exterminator know so that he or she can take any necessary precautions before spraying your house for ants.
