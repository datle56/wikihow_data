      "title": "Decide on the overall color.",
      "content": "Decide on the overall color. White or cream flowers are traditional, but it's best to choose colors that complement the bridal dress. An elaborate gown should be the centerpiece, so restrain the bouquet to a single color or a small range of colors. A dress with a simple cut appreciates a more elaborate bouquet, with a variety of color and ornamentation. For a more subtle bouquet, choose colors similar to your wedding gown's. Avoid identical shades and consider including accent colors. Too much similarity can make the scene flat and hard to photograph. A bouquet of similar colors and shades is the easiest to put together. A classic bouquet uses white, cream, peach, and light pink flowers. Complementary colors make a pleasing bouquet. Try yellow and violet, blue and orange, or red and green. If you don't want a bold bouquet, use soft tones and light shades."

      "title": "Choose a strong primary flower.",
      "content": "Choose a strong primary flower. These flowers need long, strong stems to support the bouquet without breaking. If possible, choose flowers that will be in-season during your wedding. Out-of-season flowers are much more expensive, may require advance ordering, and are difficult to replace in an emergency. Choose one to three of your favorite flowers that fit the bill, or browse through these options: Single roses (not spray roses [1] X Research source ) Peonies (ask a florist to recommend a variety, as many double-flower peonies have weak stems [2] X Research source ) Hydrangeas Magnolia Double dahlias (single dahlias tend to drop petals Lisianthus Cymbidium orchids Calla lilies (or colorful mini callas) Stargazer lilies"

      "content": "Select secondary flowers (optional). A single-variety bouquet can look wonderful, and puts less stress on the novice flower arranger. But to engage your artistic side, pick any number of smaller flowers to add variety. You can use practically any flowers for these. If you're not sure what to pick, browse florist shops or online bouquet arrangements. Popular secondary flowers include small single roses, spray roses, and freesia. \"Filler flowers\" are sprays of tiny flowers, buds, or berries. Try waxflower, baby's breath, or seeded eucalyptus."

      "title": "Decide on a size.",
      "content": "Decide on a size. The bouquet size should match your own size and the grandeur of the venue. Large bouquets suit large church weddings and beaches, while smaller ones fit well into intimate spaces. As a good rule of thumb, the bouquet should be no wider than the bride's waist. Keep comfort in mind as well: large bouquets can be tiring to hold. Most bridal bouquet diameters range from 8 inch (20cm) to 13 inches (33cm). Get more flowers than you need. The number of flowers depends on the variety. Fifteen to thirty flowers is typical, but order spares as well. You may change your mind or come up with a new idea as you are building the bouquet."

      "title": "Trim the stems underwater.",
      "content": "Trim the stems underwater. Lower the stems into a bucket or sink full of water. Trim off the ends at a 45º angle, about 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) from the end. This allows them to pull up water without air bubbles forming in the stem. Keep the flowers in a container of cool water until you are ready to build the bouquet. Leave the stems long so they are easier to work with. You can trim them again once the bouquet is finished."

Consider removing any guard petals (the outer petals) or additional tattered or wilted material from the stem. If you'd like green in your bouquet, keep the top leaves of each flower. Remove stamens from lilies, as they turn brown and can stain the Bride’s dress. Trim the foliage so everything below your grip on the stem in clean."

Place them around the edge of the dome as well, building it outward. Space these out so no two secondary flowers of the same type are touching each other. When finished, you should have a tight dome, with the largest flowers in the exact center. Alternatively, build a Biedermeier bouquet. These have concentric circles of flowers with bold color differences."

It only takes three or four pins to have a noticeable effect, but feel free to use more. You may insert filler flowers throughout your bouquet. To make a spray at the edge, insert them between the outermost flowers only."

Wrap the floral tape several times around the stems, then spiral it down another 3–4 inches (7.5–10cm). [4] X Research source You can use large, strong rubber bands instead, unless using delicate-stemmed flowers such as tulips and hyacinths. [5] X Research source Place the band around two stems at one side of the bundle and twist to secure. Wrap the closed rubber band around the whole bundle several times, without inserting any stems inside it. Once tight, open the rubber band again and insert two stems on the opposite side. Place one band near the top of the stems, and a second one about 4 inches (10cm) beneath it."

Cut a piece about three times the length of the stems. For the spiral approach, weave the ribbon down the whole length of the stem, tucking it into the floral tape at the top and bottom. Secure with pins pushed into the flower stems. [6] X Research source For the bow approach, cut a piece of ribbon and tie a bow around the bouquet. Be sure to cut off any visible floral tape, natural raffia palm, or rubber band that was used to secure the bouquet. For an added touch of glamour, use pearl tipped straight pins."

A florist can sell you a flower preservative that will prolong the flowers' life. Transport the bouquet in water whenever possible. If you do not have a cool room, keep the flowers in a fridge set above 35ºF (1.7ºC). Remove all fruit from the fridge; most fruit produce gases which speed up flower aging. A light spray of hairspray may preserve your bouquet as well. Hang the bouquet upside down for a few minutes so the hairspray dries on the blooms, before returning it to the vase."

Soak the \"wick\" of the bouquet holder before you place your flowers inside, and the stems will drink throughout your wedding. The term \"nosegay\" refers to a small, round bouquet inside a bouquet holder or a decorative \"tussy mussy.\" It can also refer to a small, looser bouquet that includes greenery or herbs."

Start with a special bouquet holder with a slanted opening. Arrange the flowers so they spill out of the holder. Longer sprays trail out the front, and larger blossoms fill the mouth of the holder."
