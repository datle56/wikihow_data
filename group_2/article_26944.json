      "content": "Heat your shells or other cement items (see step 1) for 4-7 hours, or until they start to become brittle and start to crumble in to sand like dust. To help make your shells or other cement into a more consistent sand, stir it every 30 minutes by mixing the shells (just like cooking). Important: If some of your shells or other raw materials do not break down to the size of sand or smaller, remove them before sealing the cement inside an airtight container. You can reheat them in the next batch."
