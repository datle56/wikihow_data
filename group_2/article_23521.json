Make an effort to smile and nod your head if you agree with or are pleased with what she’s saying, since it can be discouraging to to speak with someone with a blank expression. To show her that you’ve been attentive to her remarks, try paraphrasing: Mom says: “We have dinner with the neighbors across the street a few times a year, and their cooking is outstanding.” You respond: “Good neighbors and good food, how fortunate!” If something she says doesn’t make sense to you or is inaudible, instead of bluntly saying, “What do you mean?” or “What did you say?”, try asking for clarification: “Pardon my asking—I’m not sure I heard you correctly—could you say again why you chose to study biology?”"
