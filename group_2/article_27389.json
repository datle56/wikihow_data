[2] X Research source Peppermint, ginger , calendula, and catnip are great options for your tea blend if you are seeking relief from indigestion or gas. You can also create a mint tea with fresh leaves plucked directly from the stem. Just keep in mind that you will need a larger quantity of mint when using fresh leaves rather than dried ones. You will need roughly 3 to 4 cups (600 to 700 grams) of fresh mint leaves to make 1 US quart (0.95 L) of tea. You can use freshly grated or dried ginger in your tea."

      "title": "Bring a pot or kettle of water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring a pot or kettle of water to a boil. Fill a pot or kettle full of water and place it on the stove. Turn the heat on high to encourage quicker boiling. It is best not to worry about the exact quantity of the water at this stage, as you will lose water to evaporation as it boils. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, turn off the heat and allow it to sit for 30 seconds before measuring the exact quantity you will need with a liquid measuring cup. [4] X Research source Use an electric kettle if you do not have a stove or heat source handy. Keep in mind that you can also cold-brew herbal tea by placing the herbs in water and allowing them to infuse overnight in the refrigerator."

      "content": "Warm your teapot and teacups before adding the boiling water. Place your teacups and teapot under hot running water from your sink. Make sure to turn the water on the hottest setting possible. Warming your teacups before adding the boiling water will help prevent breakage due to rapid temperature fluctuation. Place a lid over the teacup or pot so that it will retain the heat as you continue preparing the tea. Pre-warming your cups will also help your tea stay warmer for longer."

If you are using teabags, refer to the instructions on the side of the box. Generally, though, you should use one teabag per 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water. [5] X Research source You can also purchase a small reusable metal tea ball to hold your loose-leaf tea while it steeps. It can be easily removed and emptied into the trash so that you don't need to strain the tea as you pour the pot into your cup."

If you don't know how much water your teapot or teacup holds, you can first pour the boiling water into a liquid measuring cup before adding it to your tea. Carefully add the hot water to your tea. Cover your cup or pot and allow it to steep for 5 to 8 minutes for the flavor to reach the desired strength. [6] X Research source For a stronger flavored tea, allow the tea to steep longer and add additional tea leaves."

Otherwise, remove the teabag or teabags from your cup and place them on a plate or directly into the trash. Once they have cooled slightly, you can squeeze any remaining water into your cup. [7] X Research source Check your teapot to see whether it has a mesh strainer built into the spout. Some teapots have this feature and, if yours does, you won't need to pour the tea through a strainer into your cup."
