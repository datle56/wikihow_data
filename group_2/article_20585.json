      "content": "Mix dish soap, laundry detergent, and warm water in a bowl. Stir the mix slowly to prevent excess bubbles. If the stain is on your face, use unscented dish soap without the laundry detergent added. [1] X Research source The ratio of laundry detergent, dish soap, and water depends on how sensitive your skin is and how difficult the stain is to remove. Use a larger amount of laundry detergent if you do not have sensitive skin, or if the stain is particularly difficult to remove. If you have sensitive skin, you should probably only use dish soap. You might want to water down your mixture significantly."

      "content": "Use a towel or brush to scrub the stain with the soap mixture. Cover your brush or towel in the mixture and rub it against the stain on your skin. Reapply your mixture to the brush or towel regularly. Soap mixtures will likely only remove wood stain that has very recently gotten on your skin. Act quickly to avoid having to use products that are harsher on the skin. If you towel is absorbing the stain, switch to an unstained section of the towel before you continue scrubbing."

      "content": "Find out if your wood stain is oil-based. The original wood stain container should tell you if the product is oil-based. You can test if a wood stain is oil based by putting a few drops of water on stained wood. If the water beads, it is an oil-based wood stain. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour mineral spirits into a small metal bowl. Mineral spirits are widely available in hardware stores. Many mineral spirits are generically labeled as paint thinner, although not all types of paint thinner are mineral spirits. Make sure that the container you pour the mineral spirits in is not painted or coated in varnish. Use caution when working with mineral spirits. They are highly flammable and their fumes are toxic."

      "content": "Dip a white cloth into the bowl of mineral spirits. It will be easier to tell if the stain is being removed if you use a white, clean piece of cloth. If the section of the cloth you are using starts to stain, switch to a clean section or use a new cloth. [3] X Research source"

Start from the outside and work toward the middle of the stain. Continue this process until the stain has been removed from your skin. If your cloth becomes stained, that means it is working. Switch to a clean part of your cloth so that it will continue to soak up the wood stain."

If your skin is not sensitive and does not appear to be irritated, you could also use normal soap to clean the area. If you use soap, rinse it off when you are finished. [5] X Research source Using a moisturizing cream or lotion can help prevent skin irritation and damage. Apply it after you have washed and rinsed your skin."

Rubbing alcohol is less damaging, but will not remove stains as quickly or as efficiently as acetone. [7] X Research source Acetone is commonly used in many nail polish removers. Buying acetone-based nail polish remover is usually the easiest and cheapest way to get acetone for stain removal. [8] X Research source"

After your skin is clean, rinse the soap off with warm water. If the alcohol or acetone has irritated your skin, you should rinse it thoroughly with lukewarm water, but you might want to avoid using soap on it until the skin has had a chance to rest and repair. You can also use some moisturizing cream or lotion to help soothe and repair your skin after you have cleaned it. This can help prevent skin irritation and damage."
