      "title": "Sterilize your jar.",
      "content": "Sterilize your jar. Mason jars are ideal for sprouting, but you can use any wide-mouthed glass or plastic jar. Wash the jar well in hot, soapy water to remove dirt, dust, and any pathogens or particles that might be hiding in the container. Dry the jar with a clean towel and set it aside. Growing sprouts can also lead to the growth of unwanted bacteria and fungi, which is why it's important to use sterilized equipment. Always wash your hands before handling beans that you want to sprout. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the beans.",
      "content": "Rinse the beans. Measure about ½ to ⅔ cup (100 to 133 g) of beans and transfer them to a clean bowl. Cover the beans with fresh water, and use your hands to swish the beans around. Transfer the beans to a colander to drain the water, and rinse them until the water runs clear. You can use just about any whole and dried bean, legume, or seed for sprouting, including Chickpeas Alfalfa Adzuki beans Mung beans Lentils Sunflower seeds Quinoa"

      "title": "Cover the beans with fresh water.",
      "content": "Cover the beans with fresh water. Transfer the beans to the sanitized jar. Fill the jar the rest of the way with clean room temperature water. Place cheesecloth or a clean towel over the mouth of the jar, and secure it in place with an elastic. This will allow airflow and prevent dirt and particles from floating into the jar. For beans or legumes, fill the jar a quarter of the way with the bean of your choice. For seeds like alfalfa, use about 2 tablespoons (4 g) of seeds per mason jar. This will give the sprouts plenty of space to grow and allow air to circulate between the sprouts. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave the beans to soak overnight.",
      "content": "Leave the beans to soak overnight. Set the jar aside on the counter and let the beans soak for several hours. Very small grains like quinoa only need to be soaked for about three hours. Medium legumes like lentils only need to soak for about eight hours. Larger beans like kidney beans and chickpeas should soak for 12 hours. [3] X Research source As the bean soak, they'll absorb water and grow in size, and this will kick start the germination process. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Drain and rinse the beans.",
      "content": "Drain and rinse the beans. When the beans have had enough time to soak and double in size, remove the cheesecloth and drain out the water. Cover the beans with fresh water and swirl them around gently to wash them. Drain the water and put the cheesecloth back over the mouth of the jar. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tip the mason jar.",
      "content": "Tip the mason jar. As the sprouts grow, you want to keep the jar at a 45-degree angle with the mouth of the jar facing down. This will allow excess moisture to drain out and air to circulate. You may have to prop the jar up against something to keep it at the right angle, or store it on a wire cooling or dish rack. While the beans have to remain moist to germinate, you don't want any excess water in the jar, because this could lead to mold and bacterial growth."

      "content": "Store the jar in a shaded location. Place the jar full of beans somewhere that's room temperature and away from direct sunlight. You don't have to store the beans in the dark, but keep them out of the sun, otherwise they may start to cook."

      "content": "Rinse the sprouts at least twice daily. As the sprouts grow, it's important to rinse them regularly to keep pathogens at bay and to keep the sprouts moist. Remove the cheesecloth, cover the sprouts with clean water, drain the sprouts, and cover the mouth with the cheesecloth again. Tilt the jar and return the sprouts to their growing location. You can rinse the sprouts as often as you like, but make sure to do it every eight to 12 hours at least, or as the beans dry out. [6] X Research source"

Different beans and legumes will require different sprouting times, but the sprouts will be ready in two to six days. You can eat the sprouts as soon as they reach the same length as the original bean. You can also continue letting the sprouts grow for up to five or six days, until they reach a few inches (several centimeters) in length. [7] X Research source"
