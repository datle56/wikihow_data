      "title": "Pour hot water into a small bowl.",
      "content": "Pour hot water into a small bowl. Run the tap until the water is hot but still comfortable to touch. Half fill a small bowl of water and then place it onto the bench. [1] X Research source Don’t use very hot or boiling water as this can cause burns . Always ask an adult to help you when you are using hot water. Use a bowl that is large enough to fit the slime in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dunk the slime into the bowl of water.",
      "content": "Dunk the slime into the bowl of water. Place your ball of slime into the water for about 10 seconds. This gives the slime a chance to soak in a little bit of the liquid. After 10 seconds take the slime out of the water and place it on a clean surface, such as a bench or table. [2] X Research source If the slime isn’t in a ball to start with, use your hands to squish it into a ball. This will make it easier to handle in the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the water into the slime.",
      "content": "Knead the water into the slime. Use the base of your hands to flatten the slime and then fold it in half. Continue to flatten and fold the slime until all of the excess water has been absorbed into the slime. [3] X Research source Don’t worry if initially, the texture of the slime is a bit strange because the more that you knead it; the softer it will become."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix more water into the slime, if necessary.",
      "content": "Mix more water into the slime, if necessary. If the slime is still hard to stretch and breaks easily, dunk it into warm water and knead it again. Continue to repeat this process until the slime reaches your preferred level of stretchiness. [4] X Research source If the water in the bowl gets cold, refill it with hot water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a squirt of lotion onto the top of the slime.",
      "content": "Add a squirt of lotion onto the top of the slime. Place the lotion onto a clean dry surface, such as a table or bench top. Push the slime down so that it lies flat and then pump 1 squirt of lotion into the middle of the slime. Make sure that there are no clumps of dried out lotion. [5] X Research source Any hand or body lotion will work for this method. However, avoid using a body butter or ointment as these tend to be thicker. This method will help to make the slime stretchier, softer, and stickier, and can be used on new or old slime."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the lotion into the slime with your hands.",
      "content": "Knead the lotion into the slime with your hands. Fold the slime in half so that the lotion is trapped in the middle, and then push down on the slime. Continue to fold and push down on the slime until all the lotion is mixed into the slime. [6] X Research source Take off any rings or bracelets before kneading the slime as it can be a slightly messy process. If you have a large ball of slime this could take up to 5 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test out the slime.",
      "content": "Test out the slime. Stretch and squish the slime to determine if it has reached its optimal level of stretchiness. If the slime is difficult to pull or snaps when it is stretched, this shows that it is still lacking moisture. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead extra lotion into the slime, if necessary.",
      "content": "Knead extra lotion into the slime, if necessary. If the slime still isn’t stretchy enough, flatten the slime again and add another squirt of lotion into the centre. Knead the lotion into the slime to make it extra soft and stretchy. [8] X Research source Continue to mix lotion into the slime until it reaches your desired consistency. Make sure to wipe the surface that you kneaded the slime on with a surface cleaner and a cloth. This will get rid of any stickiness and leave it nice and hygienic."
