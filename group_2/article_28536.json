Think about what hairstyles and colors might best suit you. Ask yourself, what do you want your hair to say about you? Are you outgoing and love taking risks? Maybe you’ll want short, colorful hair. Are you more down to earth and a bit of a hippie? Natural tones and long, layered hair might be the way to go. Do an online search or look through some hairstyle magazines to see which hairstyles stand out to you. (You can purchase hairstyle magazines at most drugstores and bookshops.)"

      "content": "Determine your face shape . An important thing to consider when changing your hairstyle is your face shape. There are several types of face shape. One way to figure out yours is to look in the mirror and outline your face with lipstick or an eye pencil.< [1] X Trustworthy Source University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment Program in the University of Kentucky devoted to scientific research and public education Go to source Oval faces are balanced, and shaped like ovals (a little wider in the middle). Square faces are equally wide at the brows, cheekbones, and jaw. Triangular faces have more width at the bottom of the face, with a strong jawline. Heart-shaped faces (aka inverted triangle faces) feature delicate chins and wider cheekbones. Circle faces are shaped like circles, meaning that they are fairly round. Diamond faces are angular and have cheekbones that are wider than the brows and jaws. Oblong faces are consistently wide from the forehead to the jaw, which makes them look longer."

      "content": "Decide which hairstyles best suit your face shape . To make your hair look as good as possible, choose a style based on your face shape. Oval faces go well with most haircuts, although styes that accentuate length could make an oval face look long. Square faces are best with hair that is longer than the jawline. In particular, avoid haircuts that stop right at the jawline, as these can make a square face look even more square. Also avoid cuts with strong, angular lines such as blunt bangs or bobs. Side-swept bangs, waves, and layers that frame the face are good choices. Triangular faces do well with short hairstyles that balance the larger jawline by adding width to the top of the head. If you do go for long hair, ensure that it’s longer than your jawline otherwise your face may look too full at the bottom. Heart-shaped faces look great with chin-length layers (bobs are good!). Avoid short haircuts and thick bangs as these can make your face look top heavy. Tight ponytails and otherwise slicked-back hair can emphasis your small chin, so avoid these too. Circular faces go nicely with asymmetrical cuts and layered cuts, which help balance the face’s width. Chin-length cuts and blunt bangs can make the face look wider, and so can parting your hair in the middle. Side parts and side-swept bangs will look nice though! Diamond faces go nicely with hair that is full at the sides but not at the top. In other words, avoid high hair! Bangs and layers that frame the face will look nice. Avoid middle parts though. Oblong faces can look long, so it’s all about breaking up the length of the face. Avoid overly long hairstyles. Bobs, layers, and blunt bangs will go well with this face shape."

      "title": "Consider coloring your hair.",
      "content": "Consider coloring your hair . Dyeing your hair is a great way to add some drama to your appearance. Before dyeing your hair, consider which colors will look best with your skin tone and eye color. Your skin tone and eye color may go with most colors of hair, but they may not go with every shade of that color. For example, warm skin tones go well with warm red shades like strawberry, but pink or blue skin tones go better with cooler, brighter reds. Choosing a hair color close to your skin tone and eye color will give you a more natural look. As an example, think of how a “beach bum” looks with sandy hair, tanned skin, and pale blue eyes. The stronger your skin tone and eye color contrast with your hair, the more dramatic you’ll look. For example, pale skin and green eyes with rich, vibrant auburn hair will be quite a striking combination. If you’re unsure of what your skin tone is, take a few online quizzes to see what hair color suggestions they come up with."

This may be every other day to once a week depending on the quality of your hair. The drier it is, the less it needs to be washed. If your hair is dry and damaged, do a weekly deep conditioning treatment on it. An easy at-home treatment is to blend together olive oil with two egg yolks, an avocado, mayonnaise, and hair conditioner, and leave it on your hair for up to several hours (even overnight is okay).

For example, if you’re more outgoing and like punk music, you might take your inspiration from retro punk photos, whereas if you’re more natural and a bit of a hippie, you might look at old photos of people from the ‘60s and ‘70s for inspiration.

Here’s one way to determine your body shape through measurements: [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Use a measuring tape to measure your shoulders, bust, waist, and hips. You may need to get someone to help you do this. Inverted triangle: If your shoulders or bust are larger than your hips, this is your body type.

Your shoulders, bust, and hips should be within 5% of each other, and your waist should be less than 25% smaller than your shoulders or bust.

Now that you know your body type, you can choose the clothes that will make it look its best: [7] X Research source Inverted triangle: Keep your top half relatively clean and simple, and free of any detailing that might add bulk to it. Leave the bulky stuff to your lower half to give it more volume and help balance it with your top half. An example might be a clean v-neck top with a wide belt and a pair of wide-legged, high-waisted trousers. Rectangle: The goal with this body type is to define your waist so that you have more of an hourglass shape. To do this, wear bottoms with embellishments that create gentle curves, and fitted tops that give shape to the waist. Avoid boxy clothes, or clothes with noticeable waistbands. Triangle (aka pear): The goal is to balance your wider lower half (hips and legs) by wearing clothes and accessories that add volume to your upper half and make your shoulders look broader. Avoid adding any bulk to your lower half by wearing bottoms with simple, clean lines and no embellishments. Hourglass: Wear clothes that follow your body line. Fitted clothes are generally a good choice as these are sure to accentuate your naturally curvy figure. Avoid wearing baggy clothes that hide your small waist, otherwise you may look more bulky."

You can still wear foundation, blush or bronzer, mascara, eyeshadow, and lip color even with a natural look. You can use makeup to give yourself smoother, more even-looking skin (foundation and concealer); longer lashes (mascara); higher cheekbones (blush, bronzer or contouring kits); and fuller lips (lip liner and lipstick). As an example, it can take a lot of makeup to give your face that dewy look that’s so popular. If you’re uncomfortable wearing makeup but would like to improve the appearance of your skin, try using a tinted moisturizer or a sheer powder. These can help improve the overall appearance of your skin without feeling too heavy or oily."

You can use different colors of eyeliner and eyeshadow to make your eyes really stand out: [10] X Research source If you have blue eyes, aim for light natural tones like coral and champagne. The dark, smokey look may overpower your eyes, so experiment with it at home before wearing it out. Grey or blue-grey eyes look nice with sooty and smokey shades of grey, blue, and silver. Green eyes look great with muted purples and shimmery browns. Hazel or brownish-green eyes look nice with metallics and pastels that bring out the flecks of color in the eyes. Dusty pink, soft copper, and gold shadows would look wonderful with hazel eyes. Brown eyes go well with most colors and styles of eye makeup. Neutral shades of salmon and bronzy gold work well. For a smokey eye you might even add a bit of black shadow in your eye crease. A popular style of eyeshadow is to do a smokey eye , which involves mixing two or three shades on your eyelids to give them a graded look, often from dark to light as the colors move up the eyelid towards the eyebrows."

If you wear a smokey eye, for example, go with a more natural lip. If you wear red lipstick, keep the rest of your makeup relatively subtle. A classic look is to wear a cat’s eye with red lipstick. Similar rules apply to balancing hair colors and makeup. For example, having fire-engine-red hair can limit which colors you wear on your lips."

It will say the words “won’t clog pores” or “non-comedogenic” on the packaging. Even with this type of makeup, you might still experience breakouts. If you’re wearing heavy eye makeup you may want to use eye makeup remover or coconut oil to ensure that you get it completely off your eyes each night."
