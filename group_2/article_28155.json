      "content": "Select fresh, ripened tabasco chili peppers without blemishes. Choose peppers that are bright red and evenly colored. Avoid gnarled and blemished peppers. If your local market doesn't sell tabasco chili peppers, or if you grow other kinds of hot peppers yourself, you can experiment with any of those. If you're experimenting with different peppers, choose spicy varieties. Ideally, they should be red, but you can experiment with color, too. Good alternative hot peppers candidates are serrano, habanero, and cayenne varieties."
