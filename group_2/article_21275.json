      "title": "Speak with a doctor about implants or drugs to stimulate hair growth.",
      "content": "Speak with a doctor about implants or drugs to stimulate hair growth. Beard implants take a graph of hair from elsewhere on your body and use it to increase thickness in your beard. According to Barber Woody Lovell, \"A graph is basically a small piece of clear tape with about [...] 10 hair follicles [on it].\" Hundreds to thousands of graphs are \"manually [put] on the face wherever you have spots to fill it in.\" Alternatively, you can try specific drugs to increase hair growth. For example, Finasteride, also known as Proscar or Propecia, is a drug commonly used to solve baldness. Although it isn’t designed to improve facial hair growth, some people find it effective, especially when it is paired with a drug like minoxidil. If your doctor approves you for treatment, you take the drug by swallowing a small tablet once a day. If that doesn’t work, you may be able to see results with alternative drug. [1] X Research source Drugs like finasteride work by limiting a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that stops hair growth. Stopping DHT usually increases testosterone, which is responsible for speeding up hair growth. For example, Latisse is a beauty product brushed on eyelashes to grow them out, but some people have found it effective for beards and mustaches. [2] X Research source Since Latisse is expensive, look for beauty products containing bimatoprost or prostaglandin like Latisse does. Use the included applicator to rub it on your face."

      "title": "Sign up for testosterone therapy if your hormones are an issue.",
      "content": "Sign up for testosterone therapy if your hormones are an issue. Doctors detect hormone deficiencies through a simple blood test. If your body isn’t making enough testosterone, then your facial hair will come in slowly or look patchy. Age, injury, and genetics are some of the many reasons behind a hormone problem. To treat this common issue, the doctor will either give you manual injections or give you an alternative option to take at home. [3] X Research source For instance, you may be asked to wear a patch, take a pill, or rub a gel on your skin every day. Some symptoms of low testosterone include fatigue, muscle weakness, and loss of muscle mass. Therapy takes as much as a full year to be effective, but then it often causes facial hair to grow in much more rapidly."

      "content": "Rub diluted essential oils on your face for a natural treatment. Eucalyptus is a common choice for stimulating hair follicles, but other types of oil also help. Try peppermint, coconut, or almond, for example. Pour a few drops of oil into a bowl of water or a carrier oil like coconut oil before massaging it into your skin. Use it even after your hair begins growing to keep it healthy. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source After applying an essential oil, let it sit on your skin for up to 20 minutes. Wash it off when you’re done. Be sure to dilute the oil before you put it on your skin. For example, combine 4 parts water with 1 part oil. You could also get cleansers and moisturizers made with essential oils."

Try mixing about 1 cup, or 60 mL, of oil with about 3 tablespoons, or 45 mL, of mustard leaves. Stir it into a paste, then massage it into your skin like you would with an essential oil. Rinse it off after 20 minutes. [6] X Research source Save leftover paste in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. Store it in a sealed container.

      "title": "Eat a healthy diet in order to get the nutrients your hair needs.",
      "content": "Eat a healthy diet in order to get the nutrients your hair needs. Proper nutrition speeds up hair growth and prevents it from looking patchy. Instead of eating processed food, consume fish, eggs, lean meat, and other sources of protein. Combine that with a helping of fruits and vegetables at every meal. Focus on fruits and vegetables that contain the vitamins responsible for hair growth. For instance, Barber Woody Lovell confirms that, \"Vitamin B and C are particular vitamins [that enhance hair growth].\" Vitamins A and E are also essential. [8] X Research source Sources of protein, including meat and eggs, have zinc, oil, and fat hair needs to grow. The rest of your body needs these things too, so if you aren’t getting enough, your hair won’t have as much opportunity to grow."

      "content": "Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated throughout the day. Your body, including your growing hair, needs water to function. Drink about 2 L (68 fl oz) of water per day. Even a mild case of dehydration stops hair growth and even leads to hair loss. Proper hydration can speed up hair growth. [9] X Research source Replace your normal drinks with fresh water. Try carrying around a water bottle to ensure you get enough to drink. Sugary fruit juices and sodas aren’t great for your health, so they could potentially slow down hair growth."

      "content": "Exercise regularly to stimulate blood flow to your hair follicles. Exercising comes with many benefits, but the main one is circulation. As Barber Woody Lovell puts it, \"you can make [your hair] thicker by [increasing] blood flow. [...] Exercising and eating right, I always tell people, [is] the number one way of growing and keeping the hair that you have\" Aim on working out 3 or 4 times a week, focusing on aerobic exercises that get your blood pumping. Fresh blood brings more nutrients to your hair follicles, increasing their growth rate. You could take a walk, hop on a treadmill, play a sport, or do any number of other exercises. [10] X Research source Even mild to moderate exercise, such as a brisk 30-minute walk, helps with hair growth. Exercise is also a good way to relieve stress. However, don’t overdo it. If you wear yourself out, you may end up with more stress and even injuries your body needs to heal."

Set aside a couple of minutes each day. Start at your jaw and work your way up. Apply light pressure while circling your fingertips around your skin. Regular massages can force your already growing hair follicles to speed up. [12] X Research source For the best results, massage the growing areas for 10 to 15 minutes up to 2 times a day. You could also seek out a massage therapist for a more in-depth experience. Massaging your skin draws blood circulation there, encouraging thicker and fuller hair growth. Massages are also good for relaxation."

      "content": "Get between 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. Along with exercise, proper rest is a requirement for your body to operate efficiently. If you have a hard time getting enough sleep, set up a sleep schedule. Create a healthy sleeping environment that allows you to wind down at the end of the night. This will help ensure your hair grows as fast as it is able to. [13] X Research source While you’re sleeping, your body regenerates cells and replenishes your hair follicles with nutrients. It also gives your body a chance to produce more growth hormones like testosterone. Poor quality sleep is a cause of patchy facial hair. It can also cause your hair to fall out."

As a result, the nutrients needed for hair growth cannot reach your hair follicles, limiting how quickly your hair grows.

The fastest way to grow a beard or mustache is to leave it alone. Shaving means you’re starting with nothing again. Let your hair grow on its own for at least 4 weeks. [15] X Research source Keep in mind that everyone’s hair grows at a different rate. After the initial growth, you will probably end up feeling like it comes in much quicker after that. New growth feels itchy at first, but don’t trim your hair yet. Instead, care for it by washing it, combing it, and using a conditioner made from jojoba or argan oil."
