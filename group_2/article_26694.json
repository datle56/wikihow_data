      "content": "Floss at least once a day. Your dentist is not lying when they say this is one of the most overlooked hygiene regimens in the United States. Regular flossing cleans the parts of your teeth a brush can't reach and stimulates healthy gum growth. Brush from the gum onto the tooth in a stroke that's down and maybe just a slight bit of rolling your hand around but not across your teeth. Using a short piece of floss, get in between your teeth and along the gum line, using your fingers to add pressure. Talk to your orthodontist about ways to floss if you have braces, such as dental threads. Be sure to clean in between your back teeth too, using the floss around all sides of the molars. Mouthwash does not physically remove plaque and food and is not a substitute for flossing."
