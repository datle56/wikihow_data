      "content": "Remove any debris and mow the grass. First, clear out any large rocks, limbs, or other items that are in the area you want to level. Then, home improvement specialist Keith Souza recommends mowing the grass “as low as you can.” It will be a lot easier to see where the uneven areas are with the grass cut. [1] X Expert Source Keith Souza Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 20 Aug 2021. Dethatch your lawn if the thatch is more than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick. The thatch is the layer of live and dead grass right above your soil. If it’s more than about 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) thick, comb the area with a thatch rake to clear out that layer. For very large areas, you may need to rent a dethatching machine. To avoid accidentally hitting a water, sewer, or power line, landscaper Matt Daly advises, “Always call your local utility company before you start digging or leveling your yard.” [2] X Expert Source Matt Daly Landscape Designer Expert Interview. 13 Oct 2022."

      "content": "Use a string level to identify the areas you need to raise or lower. Landscaper Tony Hoang says, “Put stakes around the area you need to level, then place strings around the stakes and use a level to make sure the strings are level all the way.” If the strings aren’t level, these are the areas where you’ll need to add or remove dirt. [3] X Expert Source Tony Hoang Landscaping Manager Expert Interview. 1 Nov 2022. According to remodel and redesign expert Melissa Gabso, you can also lay a straight wooden plank across the ground to help you see any gaps that need to be filled in. [4] X Expert Source Melissa & Michael Gabso Remodel & Redesign Experts Expert Interview. 7 Oct 2020. If you’re leveling a specific area, like for a shed or a pool, mark the edges with stakes and string. Adjust the grade of your land to help combat drainage problems. Landscaper Benjamin Hansen recommends a grade of 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) for every 1 ft (0.30 m) of ground that you’re leveling, especially if you’re leveling the ground to build a structure like a shed."

      "title": "Excavate the area to create a level base.",
      "content": "Excavate the area to create a level base. Dig down beneath the grass with the tip of a shovel. Try to get about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) of the grass roots beneath the surface, especially if you’d like to re-use the grass instead of seeding the area. Continue removing dirt until you have a roughly uniform surface—it’s okay if it isn’t level yet. [5] X Research source If you’re filling in a small hole and don’t need to use much topdressing, you may not need to excavate the area or remove any grass. In that case, only use a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) layer of topdressing so the grass won’t die. If you leave the grass, the ground level may sink some as the grass dies and decomposes. If you’re building a structure like a shed, landscaper Grant Wallace recommends excavating down about 6–12 in (15–30 cm) and laying down a rock layer. That will create a sturdier base that won’t shift or erode. [6] X Expert Source Grant Wallace Landscaper Expert Interview. 3 Jan 2023."

      "content": "Move dirt from any high areas to low areas. If you’re only leveling a small area, you may be able to use a shovel or leveling rake to move dirt from any areas that are higher than the rest of the ground you’re leveling. Move this dirt to an area where more dirt is needed. [7] X Research source For slightly larger areas, it may be easier to run a wooden plank across the dirt to smooth it out in long, smooth passes. If you’re leveling a large area, you may need to rent a roller. You can also attach a leveling rake or weighed-down pallet to a riding mower and pull it across the area repeatedly until it’s level. If you don’t need the dirt to fill in any low areas, Wallace advises removing the excess dirt with a wheelbarrow. [8] X Expert Source Grant Wallace Landscaper Expert Interview. 3 Jan 2023."

      "title": "Fill in low areas with a topdressing of topsoil, compost, and/or sand.",
      "content": "Fill in low areas with a topdressing of topsoil, compost, and/or sand. The exact composition of your topsoil will depend on how much ground you have to cover and what will be going on the ground afterwards. For instance: If you want to grow grass in this area, the cover will need to be nutrient-rich, so mix compost or fertilizer into your soil. [9] X Research source You may also want to add a little sand to provide structure and help keep the ground from compounding. If you’re leveling for a pool , shed, or other structure you might prefer a gravel layer topped with sand. [10] X Research source Be sure to check the manufacturer’s recommendations if you’re leveling for a pool. If you’re only filling in a few small patches, Souza recommends using sand because “it’s easy to work with.”"

      "title": "Apply the topsoil and spread it evenly over low areas.",
      "content": "Apply the topsoil and spread it evenly over low areas. If you’re leveling a small area, use a garden rake to spread the material evenly. Use your level periodically so you’ll know when the ground is perfectly even. If you have a large area to cover, rent ground-moving equipment from your local hardware store. They will be able to advise you on what will work best for your property."

      "content": "Tamp the soil. If you are leveling a small area, tamp the soil using your foot and the bottom of your rake. If you are leveling a large area, or if it’s especially important to keep the ground level (such as if you are building a structure), get a tamper or plate compactor to compact the soil.

      "content": "Water the ground and add more soil as needed. Give the soil at least 48 hours to settle properly, if not several days or weeks. Mist the area with water if your area does not get rainfall during that time. [12] X Research source After a few days have passed, use a level to make sure the ground is still level. If it’s settled too much, add more soil as needed."

      "content": "Spread your grass seeds. If you are intending to reintroduce grass to that area, you will need to buy grass seed that is appropriate for your needs and the area in which you live. [13] X Research source To sow the seeds , use a seed spreader or lightly toss the grass seeds evenly across the ground. Don’t toss the seeds down in clumps—try to broadcast them uniformly across the whole area you’re re-seeding. You can also buy sod if you are impatient or want a particularly uniform appearance."

      "title": "Lightly cover the seeds with more soil and water.",
      "content": "Lightly cover the seeds with more soil and water. Lightly cover the seeds with a sprinkling of topsoil or gently rake the seeds into the soil. Don’t cover the seeds completely, just make sure they have good seed-to-soil contact while still being exposed to air. [14] X Research source Run your sprinklers to water the seeds—keep the area damp until the grass starts to grow. After the grass grows in, reseed any areas where the grass isn’t full or even enough for your satisfaction."

      "content": "After a heavy rain, look in your yard for any areas with standing water. These areas are probably lower than the rest of your yard, so leveling may be useful. You can also check the area with a straight plank—lay the plank across an area in your yard and either visually check for any gaps under the board or use a bubble level to determine if the area is flat. Common reasons that you may need to level your yard include: You’ve had trees, stumps, or roots removed You’ve had a sewer or drain installed Animals have damaged your yard You’re building a structure that needs to be level, like a pool or shed"

If the soil is naturally sandy in your area or you’re only filling in small areas, sand can be a good option for top dressing a lawn. However, opt for topsoil if your soil is not sand or you need to cover a large area. [15] X Research source"
