      "content": "Have mutual friends introduce you to new people. If you already know one or two people in your new city, see if they’ve got any friends they can introduce to you. \"Your friends and family might already know someone who shares your values,\" Fermin says. \"Attend social gatherings, parties, or events where they introduce you to their circle. You never know who you might resonate with.\" If you don’t know anyone in your new city, see if anyone you know back home has any buds in the area they can set you up with."

Try joining a club and meeting other like-minded folks. [1] X Research source Clubs might be advertised on social media or on flyers around town, especially in cafes or libraries. You may also be able to find out more about different clubs at relevant shops or businesses—for instance, bookstores often host book clubs, so check out your favorite bookstore for info on what book is coming up next."

      "content": "Chat with a stranger. Going in cold can be anxiety-inducing, but it can also be super effective! Next time you see someone reading your favorite book or wearing an outfit you love, strike up a conversation. If you’re worried about rejection, the best part about chatting with a stranger is, if it doesn’t go anywhere, you’ll likely never have to see them again."

      "title": "Use an app.",
      "content": "Use an app. Apps like Bumble for Friends , Wink , and Yubo can help you find like-minded people also looking to expand their social network. Whether you’re looking for a virtual friendship only or interested in IRL hangouts, these apps might be able to help you out. Fermin points out that the internet in general is a great tool for meeting new people: \"In our digital age, there are numerous platforms dedicated to various interests. Websites like Meetup, forums related to specific hobbies, or even Facebook groups can be a rich source of people with shared values and beliefs.\" Follow local businesses and newspapers on social media, and engage with other locals in the comments section. It might not be a BFF situation right off the bat, but this can slowly help you expand your network and feel more situated in your new town."

      "content": "Start volunteering. Passionate about ending hunger? Saving animals? Helping the unhoused? There’s likely a nonprofit or other organization dedicated to whatever cause you believe in. See if they’re taking volunteers, and donate a few hours of your time a week to the cause. [3] X Research source Fermin says, \"Being in an environment that reflects your values increases your chances of meeting like-minded people.\" You’re likely to find other people volunteering who share your values, so try chatting while you work—and eventually, maybe see if they’d like to hang out after a shift or something."

      "content": "Take a class. If you found it easy (or easier) to make friends in college, it might be because you had time to get to know each other naturally in your classes. Well, why not do the same thing in your new city? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! What have you always wanted to learn about but never had the chance? Maybe you were too busy in college focusing on your major, but now you have some spare time after work to take a kung fu lesson or learn how to oil paint. Consider taking a class where you get to work with others, like a drama class or self-defense class. Doing something you’re already interested in is a great way to make friends—it’s easier to bond over something you both enjoy, but even if you don’t make friends right away, you’re doing something you’re interested in and find valuable.

Your own company isn’t a substitute for the company of others, but your first days, weeks, and months in a new place constitute a special opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery. Take yourself out on dates around town and explore your new city on your own terms. Claim your territory. Find your spaces—your bookstores, your bars, your favorite tree in the park.

      "content": "Try not to make a snap decision about a new friend. In grade school and college, you probably made a few friends just by being “forced” to be around each other for a long time. In the real world, though, you have to be a little more intentional about meeting up with someone. This can make you feel like you need to decide on your first hangout whether they’re really friendship material—resist that urge! Sometimes you know right off the bat when someone’s not a good fit, but often, you don’t. Don’t be afraid to give someone multiple shots to be a good friend."

While you might not have a whole lot of choices when it comes to who you socialize with in childhood and in school, as an adult in the “real world,” you probably have to be more intentional about spending time with people. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Friendships are less likely to happen “naturally” when you’re out of school, so you’ll probably have to carve out dedicated time to hang out with people or keep in touch with them. This also goes for friends you may have left behind in your old city—if you want to keep in touch with them, it won’t happen without effort! Make a habit of catching up via phone once a week or month, for instance."

In many ways, making new friends is a lot like dating: you’re putting yourself out there, being vulnerable, and hoping you like the other person and that they like you back. If someone doesn’t seem interested in pursuing a friendship, try not to feel too bad about it —the other person just might not be a good fit, or maybe they’re not really available for friendship right now.

[12] X Research source Ask the person you want to engage a simple question to get the conversation started, like, “What are you getting for lunch?” or “I’ve never been to this cafe before—what do you recommend?” A question indicates that you’re interested in getting to know the person better, which may help them open up more."

For instance, instead of asking, “Are you having a good day?” try, “What have you been up to?” or “What’s been the best part of your day so far?” Instead of “Do you like your job?” try, “What do you like about your job?” or “How did you get into this field?” Small talk has its place, but as Fermin advises, \"Don’t shy away from meaningful conversations. Ask them about their life experiences, beliefs, and what they're passionate about. This will give you insight into their values and if they align with yours.\""

Where did you get it?” “Your presentation earlier today was really compelling. I’d love to hear more about your research process.”"

They’re my favorite band! What’s your favorite song?” “I see you’ve got sushi for lunch—where’d you get it? I’m a big sushi person but am pretty new to the area still, so I don’t know the best places to go.” “Are you reading Jane Eyre ? That’s like, my favorite book ever! Have you read it before or is this your first time?”"

If you’re not sure whether they want to keep chatting, or if you want to stop chatting, or if the vibes just feel…awkward, have a polite excuse in your back pocket. “It’s been great chatting, but I have to get back to work. I’ll see you around!” “Well, I’m going to order a coffee now, but it was good talking to you!” “I’ve really enjoyed this chat, but I’ve got to go make a phone call, so I’ll see you later.” If you’re interested in following up with them, clarify by asking for contact info or asking if they’d like to get coffee sometime. If they say no, try not to take it to heart. It’s probably not personal."

Her advice: “Be intentional, and don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. I’d go to events like poetry readings or gallery openings and promise myself I’d talk to one stranger there. Sometimes, the conversation never went anywhere, but other times, we’d connect on social media or see each other at future events, and a friendship would grow!”"
