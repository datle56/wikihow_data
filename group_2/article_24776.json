Here are some ways to cover your food: [4] X Research source Once you've cooked a meal, put away any extra cooking ingredients or extra servings before you start eating, or they will attract flies. When you're done eating, wash your dishes right away to keep any food particles from attracting the flies. If you're putting food away, make sure all of the containers are tightly sealed. Obviously, fruit flies love overripe fruit or produce. Don't leave your fruit out in the open -- cover it with a muslin cloth bag."
