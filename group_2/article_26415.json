Include both cardiovascular and strength exercises in your routine. Cardiovascular exercise gets your blood pumping and strength exercises can tone flabby skin associated with age. Improved circulation supplies more nutrients and oxygen to your skin. Exercise also increases your supply of collagen and fights against damaging free radicals in your body. Cardiovascular exercise can also lead to weight loss, and shedding a few extra pounds and some excess fat can drop your perceived age by several years."

Relaxing more often may not undo the damage already done, but it can prevent your skin from aging any faster than necessary from this point on. [2] X Expert Source Asmi Sanghvi, DO Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 16 August 2021. A simple trick to try is to laugh more throughout the day. Laugh decreases stress hormones in the body and forces the muscles in your face to relax. If you don't feel like you have anything to laugh about look up jokes on the internet, or watch a funny movie or a comedian. On a similar note, you should also get six to eight hours of sleep each night. Dark, puffy eyes can make you look older, but getting enough sleep can clear those bags away. Keep in mind severe allergies can also cause dark circles, so get your allergies under control by avoiding the things that cause them, or by taking allergy medication (doctor approved, of course). Moreover, sleep reduces the body's production of stress hormone, which is good, because stress hormone can make your skin appear less elastic and less healthy.

Use a moisturizing cream on your face that is labeled as a face lotion, don't use hand lotion on your face. The reason for this is the hand lotions might be too strong and could cause you to break out. Yes, even we can break out at our age if we use the wrong products! Use hand lotion on your hands that has sunblock in it to help prevent age spots. One trick is to pat your face dry after a shower, and to put the lotion on your face immediately while your skin is still hydrated from the shower. The reason you pat your face is that the more rubbing and pulling you do to your face makes the wrinkles and bags under your eyes happen faster as your skin becomes more fragile and less elastic with age.

Guava is packed with vitamin C and can help restore collagen levels. Sweet potatoes and carrots contain beta-carotene, which can fight against dry skin and improve your cell-turnover rate.

Fashion scarves offer a quick, stylish way to cover up that patch of skin and shave off a few years from your face. Choose a lightweight scarf with a simple design and avoid scarves with unnecessary frills or embellishments. The idea is to cover your neck up without drawing attention to that area of your body.

As a result, longer hair often has less body and looks more unhealthy than shorter hair once you reach your 50s. If your hair is naturally curly, work with it rather than working against it. Curls can actually look fresher and younger at this age. Moreover, the treatments needed to straighten curly hair may only damage it further. Consider adding bangs. Bangs can mask skin imperfections that come with age. Choose long, wispy bangs or sideswept bangs over heavy, straight-cut styles. Try getting your hair blown out at a salon. This process can straighten wiry gray hairs while giving the rest of your hair more youthful body. Consider getting a softer hairstyle. Harsh hairstyles, such as ramrod straight hair, or an angular cut doesn't usually look good on older women, while a soft hairstyle, with gentle waves softens the face and is generally more attractive. Look at hair magazines for ideas. Can cut out the hairstyles you are interested in to bring into your stylist. Not all hairstyles will look good on you, so take the advice of a hairstylist you trust on what will and won't work."

Opt for sheer lip glosses, lip pencils, and lip stains. Avoid lipsticks with heavy pigmentation. If you have wrinkles on your lips and your lipstick doesn't stay put you might need to use a lip pencil to outline your lips. If you do use a lip pencil be careful it matches your lipstick as close as you can, you don't want the lip pencil to be noticeable. Choose a blush that blends into your skin color and apply it higher on the cheekbone, away from the nose, to counteract the natural sagging of skin that comes with age. Use a powder blush, liquid blush is more difficult to apply evenly and doesn't look as natural. Avoid products with a shimmer, pearl or sparkle finish. Line the eye with eye shadow instead of traditional liner. If your eyelids droop over your eyes then the shadow might transfer, and might not work for you. In that case you might want to try a gel eyeliner that comes with a little brush. You line your eyes as close to the eyelashes as possible and with a thin line, not thick. Try charcoal or brown-black, straight black is just too dark. Your eye make-up needs to look softer and less severe overall."

Both options are not practical, however, since both are generally very noticeable. Moreover, in your desperation to hide your bald spot, you may actually make yourself look older to those looking at you. A better option is simply to get your hair cut short.

Additionally, facial hair has a certain ruggedness associated with it. Your body might be wearing down with age, but facial hair can give the opposite impression and make you look as sturdy and strong as ever. Sometimes the beard gets gray before your hair does, if it bothers you too much you can buy over the counter dye kits made specially to dye beards and mustaches where they sell women's hair dye in grocery stores so you can dye it yourself.
