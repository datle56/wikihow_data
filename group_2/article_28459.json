      "content": "Obtain the necessary materials. You will need: A cylindrical object. A cardboard tube may be the best option, but a thick wooden dowel would work as well. The circumference should be several inches in length; if the cylinder is too small it will not work as a roller. Tape. Nearly any type of tape will do. Masking tape is probably closest to the sticky paper used on most lint rollers. Wide rolls of tape are the easiest to use, but any can be made to work. Scissors (if the tape does not come with a cutting tool)."

      "title": "Pull some of the tape from the dispenser roll.",
      "content": "Pull some of the tape from the dispenser roll. Just pull 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) of tape loose at once. Do not cut it yet."

    {
      "title": "Clasp the tape onto the roller.",
      "content": "Clasp the tape onto the roller. Use a portion of the sticky side of the tape to attach it to the cylinder. After it is secure, gently wrap the tape around the cylinder in the opposite direction (glue side out). You may need to hold the tape in place with your finger for the first few moments after you change directions. Leave the ends of the cylinder exposed. You can hold onto it at these ends. If you are using narrow strips of tape, start by attaching the tape near one end of the cylinder, and then with each wrap move the tape further down toward the other end. After you approach the end of the side opposite to the one you started on, you can reverse the process. It will work best if you make sure there is a slight overlap as you wrap the tape around in order to stick the tape to itself."

    {
      "title": "Wrap as much tape as you want around the cylinder.",
      "content": "Wrap as much tape as you want around the cylinder. You may find it most efficient to wrap an entire roll of tape at one time, enabling you to use the roller for quite some time before you will have to repeat this process again."

      "title": "Use your new lint roller.",
      "content": "Use your new lint roller. Run the roller over the fabrics that need cleaning. As the exterior layers of tape become covered in lint, you can peel them off and expose the fresh layers below."

      "title": "Wrap your hand in adhesive tape.",
      "content": "Wrap your hand in adhesive tape. Keep the sticky side facing out. You will probably only want to wrap it around your hand between 1 1/2 to 2 times. You need just enough so that the tape makes solid contact with itself. This is obviously a method of convenience (how long would you really want a tape roll on your hand anyhow?), so there is no need to use too much at a time. Do not wrap the tape too tightly (you will see why in a moment)."

      "content": "Run your hand over the lint-covered clothes. The tape should stick to the fabric and roll around your hand as it goes (and this is why you shouldn't wrap it too tight)."

      "content": "Discard of the tape when it becomes covered in lint. You can repeat the process as many times as needed, and do so on very short notice."
