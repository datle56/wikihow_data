      "content": "Dilating pupils could mean a guy likes you and finds you attractive. There have been many studies done to observe the role arousal has on pupil dilation, and researchers have found that a person’s eyes dilate when they’re presented with images that they find arousing. One cause of pupil dilation is an increase of oxytocin, the hormone released during sexual arousal. So, if you notice a guy’s pupils getting bigger when you talk and hang out, it might be because he finds you attractive. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Studies have also shown that pupil dilation is controlled by a person’s sexual orientation. For example, the pupils of gay men dilated when they were presented with pictures of other men they found attractive. When women are ovulating, their pupils often more readily dilate when they’re talking with people they find attractive.
