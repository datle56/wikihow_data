    {
      "title": "Learn to breathe properly.",
      "content": "Learn to breathe properly. Breathing correctly is imperative to having a strong voice. The key is to breathe deeply: As you inhale and exhale, try to inflate your stomach and kidney (back) areas with your breath. To ensure that you’re breathing into these areas, place your hands around your waist, with your thumbs on your back, your fingers at your front, and your palms resting on your sides down towards your hips. You should feel your hands expand and contract with each breath. Over time, as you strengthen your breath, these expansions and contractions will get bigger and longer. If you have trouble breathing deeply, try lying on the floor on your back, with your hands on your stomach. When you inhale, your hands should rise; when you exhale, your hands should lower. [1] X Research source You can even place a book on your stomach and make it rise up as you inhale and lower when you exhale. Try hissing as you exhale to force the air out. [2] X Research source Note that your shoulders should not be moving up and down with your breath."
    },
    {
      "title": "Engage your abs.",
      "content": "Engage your abs. When you’re breathing correctly, when you inhale, the lower muscles (diaphragm) over your abdomen should move outward, making room for more air. As you sing (or talk or just exhale), use those muscles to push the air back out. Use the muscles over your lower back (around your kidneys) in exactly the same way to control your inhalations and exhalations. Avoid hunching over as you contract your abs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the correct posture.",
      "content": "Use the correct posture. Pay attention to the position of your feet, knees, hips, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms, and head: [3] X Research source Stand with your feet slightly apart and put one foot slightly in front of the other so that your weight is slightly forward. Relax your knees and keep them slightly bent. When aiming for good posture it can be tempting to lock your knees; be careful not to do this. Relax your hands and let them hang at your sides. Keep your abdomen relaxed but ready to be engaged. To get a sense of how an engaged abdomen feels, place your hands on your waist (with your thumbs on your back) and cough very lightly. Slide your shoulders back and down so that your back is straight, and your head is high. Do not hunch or pull your shoulders up towards your ears. Keep your chest slightly up and out— this will likely happen naturally when you pull your shoulders back and down. Make sure your chin is parallel with the floor — neither lifted or pointed downward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Relax.",
      "content": "Relax. Once you’ve moved into the correct posture, check in to make sure that you are not holding tension anywhere. It should not feel as though you’re forcing your chest out or your back to be straight. Be sure to relax your face and your neck. Singing or speaking while your body and face are tensed will only make it more difficult to produce a high-quality sound. If you are tense when standing with the correct posture, try laying on your back to let gravity do the work for you. Or, stand against a wall so the back of your head and shoulders touch the wall. This can help you feel how you should position your body, which you can them implement while standing away from the wall. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Have an open but relaxed mouth.",
      "content": "Have an open but relaxed mouth. Your mouth should be wide open when you sing, but avoid the temptation to open it so wide that your face and neck muscles tense up. Check in to make sure that your lips, jaw, and neck feel loose and relaxed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift your soft palate.",
      "content": "Lift your soft palate. A common piece of advice from professional singers is to create space in your mouth. Opening your mouth wide is part of how you can do this; another part of creating space involves dropping your jaw and tongue, and lifting your soft palate (the ridged flesh at the roof of your mouth). To do this, breathe in as you would before yawning, but try not to yawn. Pay attention to the space this creates in your mouth, including the open feeling at the back of your throat. You want to replicate this wide-mouthed, soft-jawed/lifted palate position when singing. [5] X Research source If you do yawn, simply maintain the open position of your mouth afterward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure your tongue is positioned correctly.",
      "content": "Ensure your tongue is positioned correctly. When creating space in your mouth, make sure that your tongue is out of the way. Let it rest softly at the bottom of your mouth, with its tip touching the back of your lower teeth. Try not to stick your tongue out or wave it around while you’re singing, as this will impair the quality of your voice, and could reduce the richness of your tone."

      "title": "Remember to swallow.",
      "content": "Remember to swallow. Too much saliva in your mouth might make it difficult to sing, so remember to swallow whenever you need to."

    {
      "title": "Warm up.",
      "content": "Warm up. Before singing or doing more demanding vocal exercises, you’ll benefit from doing some of the following simple exercises to warm up your voice: [6] X Research source Yawn. Yawning will help stretch and open your mouth and throat and can help release tension in your neck and diaphragm. To trigger a yawn, try opening your mouth wide and breathing in. [7] X Research source </ref> Sigh out the air at the end of the yawn in your singing voice in a descending line. You can even practice high notes this way. Cough very gently. Think of it as lightly pushing air out from the back of your throat in short bursts. This will help you engage your lower chest and abdominal muscles, which are the muscles you should use while singing (as opposed to your throat/upper chest). [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Do lip trills and hum.",
      "content": "Do lip trills and hum. Hold your lips lightly together and blow air out of them while humming, like you're making a raspberry. Focus on having a relaxed throat and an engaged core while you do this. Practice lip trills going from a low to a high note and vice versa. Once you’re used to the lip trills, practice doing scales with them. [9] X Research source To help your body learn to relax while you sing, tense up your body and then right after releasing the tension, do a lip roll from low to high; repeat, this time going high to low. [10] X Research source Humming is another gentle way to warm up your voice. Try humming along with music on your way to school or work or, if you’d prefer not to do that sort of thing in public, hum while you cook or while you’re in the shower. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Sing scales.",
      "content": "Sing scales. Starting as low as you can comfortably sing, gently move up the scale using a “me” sound until you reach the highest note at which you are comfortable. Then, move down the scale from high to low using an “e” sound. [12] X Research source You can also practice \"woo\" scales. Your mouth should look as though you’re sucking in a long string of spaghetti as you inhale. When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound buzzy, similar to the sound made by a kazoo. Keep the sound steady as you exhale; do this 2 to 3 times. Next, go up and down your scales using the “woo” sound. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice smooth projection with words and phrases.",
      "content": "Practice smooth projection with words and phrases. Say groups of single words or entire phrases without stopping between the words — treat them as a single word. Lengthen the vowels and exaggerate the vocalization of each word as you say and/or sing it. [14] X Research source As you speak/sing, imagine that you’re filling a room with your voice. Focus on smooth transitions: when switching between higher and lower, and louder and softer parts of a song, imagine moving up and down a ramp — not a staircase. Example words: moon moan mourn mane mean. [15] X Research source Example phrase: many men munch many melons. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Be prepared to feel silly. A lot of vocal exercises can sound and look pretty funny. Relax and have fun with it. Two fun and silly exercises that help open up your throat: Sing “meow” slowly, emphasizing its three sounds — mee, ahh, and ooo. Make weird faces by stretching out your tongue in all directions. You can do this while singing or even just making weird noises."

      "title": "Cool down.",
      "content": "Cool down. As with physical exercise, cooling down after doing vocal exercises is important. One way to cool down is to do the same simple vocal warm-ups you started with (for example, yawning, light coughing, rolling your lips, and humming). [17] X Research source Another way to cool down is simply to gently glide up and down, and down and up, on the sound “m”, so that you feel a tickling vibration in your lip/nose area.

You won’t see enormous overnight results, but you likely will feel some difference almost immediately after combining proper breathing and posture with some simple warmups. It’s okay to take it slow. Start with learning how to breathe more deeply and stand correctly. Once you’re comfortable with that, work on your mouth position and some simple warm-ups."
