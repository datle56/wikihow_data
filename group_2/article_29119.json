This is better used in design work, such as adding backgrounds or applying colors. Classic gradient – this adds a destructive gradient layer. You cannot change the settings of this layer, but you can add multiple adjustments. Use this when you're applying gradients to layer masks."

The first click where you start to drag the line will be the first color of the gradient. Where you let go is the second color of the gradient. You can edit the middle point (it looks like a diamond) to adjust the angle of the gradient as well as where the color points are. For example, if you want more of the first color, drag the diamond to the opposite side to drag that color over."

[1] X Research source Make sure you have Dither checked so there isn't banding in your gradient. Next to the selected gradient in the toolbar you'll see five squares containing patterns. These are for different gradient styles. Here they are, in order: Linear: The classic gradient, like an evening sky. Just a gradual transition between two colors along a straight line. Radial: One color starts in the middle, then blooms out in a sphere, gradually changing into the next color. Like looking into the sun. The first color is the \"sun\" and the second the \"sky.\" Angular: More specifically, this sweeps the colors in a counterclockwise arc around your starting point. Often leads to two solid colors with gradation around the edges. Reflected: Makes a mirror image of a normal linear gradient on both sides of the starting point. Basically, if you draw your \"line\" to the right, it will repeat the gradient to the left. Diamond: Like the radial gradient, only you have a diamond or square in the middle, not a circle. You can play around with these and see which one you like most. Once you've picked one, you have a gradient!"
