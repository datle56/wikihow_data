If so, you may be able to wipe them out now before they get established. Grab your vacuum and suck up all the ants you see. After that, use soapy water to scrub the trail the ants were following.

To help ensure that the ants in the vacuum cleaner bag don’t survive, sprinkle some cornstarch inside the bag before you start sucking them up. Getting dusted with cornstarch dehydrates and kills ants. Keep a close eye out for ants over the next few days. If you’re still seeing them, they’ve already gotten established in your home. In this case, move on to colony-killing measures like poison bait instead of trying to kill individual ants with bug spray. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray ants with soapy water instead of vacuuming them up. Fill an empty spray bottle with equal amounts of tap water and liquid dish soap. Whenever you see some ants, give the bottle a quick shake and spray the little pests. They should die within a minute or so, since the soapy water sticks to the ants and suffocates them. Dish soap also disrupts their pheromone trails. [3] X Research source Like with vacuuming them up—or, for that matter, smashing them with your thumb or using a commercial ant spray—this method kills the ants you see but most likely won’t solve your ant problem. If more ants keep reappearing over the coming days, try ant baits instead."

      "content": "Put out enclosed baits or gel bait to kill off the ant colony. Put out bait wherever you see ant activity—such as in corners and crevices, or up the wall alongside your kitchen cabinets—so the worker ants pick up the poison and take it back to the colony. Use enclosed bait stations anywhere that kids or pets can access, but opt for the more effective gel bait (it comes in a squeezable tube) if kids and pets aren’t a concern. Squeeze out lots of little dabs of the gel in the high-activity areas. [4] X Research source Resist the urge to kill individual ants once you’ve put out the bait. You need them to be alive so they can transport the poison back to their colony. You’ll have to be patient—it can take up to 2 weeks for the poison bait to wipe out the colony. But this method is way more effective than trying to kill thousands or even millions of ants a few at a time!"

      "content": "Try baking soda and powdered sugar as a DIY ant bait alternative. Commercial ant baits work great, but it’s also possible to make your own with items from your pantry. Simply mix equal parts of baking soda and powdered sugar and lightly dust the areas in which the ants are active. The sugar will attract them and they’ll bring their bounty back to the colony to share, but the baking soda will dehydrate the ants and—hopefully—kill off the colony within a few days. [5] X Research source Cornstarch also works if you’re short on baking soda, or you can use food-grade diatomaceous earth. DIY ant baits may not end up being as effective as commercial options."

Once you’ve killed off the ant colony that invaded your home, do what you can to keep other ants from making their way in! Use caulk to seal up cracks and crevices around doors, windows, electrical outlets, and other potential ant entry points. Of course, it’s impossible to seal off every possible entryway for tiny little ants, so also do the following to reduce their food supply in your home: [6] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source Frequently take out your trash and recycling, and regularly clean the inside of the cans or bins with soapy water or a household cleaner. Sweep or suck up crumbs and wipe up spills as soon as possible. Sweet spills like soda are the worst offenders! Keep your food in sealed containers, like zip-close bags and lidded jars, instead of in cardboard boxes or paper wrappers. Sugary foods are especially attractive to ants."

That said, roaches can sometimes survive being sucked into a vacuum cleaner. One option is to remove the vacuum bag, seal it in a plastic bag, and put it in the trash outside. The other option is to seal the vacuum bag in a plastic bag and put it in your freezer for 2-3 hours. [7] X Research source Unfortunately, killing individual bugs won’t solve your roach problem. If you see (and kill) one or even a few cockroaches, you can be sure that there are many others hiding in the shadows."

Set out traps in areas where you have seen roaches, as well as spots where cockroaches tend to hang out—such as in cabinets, corners, and crevices. Check the traps daily to figure out where you have the most roach activity so you can target your other elimination methods there. [8] X Research source While checking the traps, also check for cockroach droppings in the area. They look like black pepper flakes. A glue trap is essentially a piece of cardboard with a sticky adhesive surface that has a bug-attracting scent. You can buy them at any retailer that sells pest control items. Don’t use glue traps in areas that pets or small children can access."

      "content": "Make a soda bottle roach trap as a low-cost DIY option. Grab a clean, empty 2-liter soda bottle and cut off the top section (where the bottle starts to narrow). Wrap masking tape all around the outside of the bottom piece of the bottle, and rub petroleum jelly or cooking oil on the inside of the top piece of the bottle. Soak a piece of bread in beer (non-alcoholic beer is fine) and set it in the base of the bottle. Invert the top piece of the bottle and set it into the bottom piece so that it makes a funnel leading down towards the beer-soaked bread. Make multiple traps as needed and place them in high-activity areas. [9] X Research source Cockroaches will be attracted by the scent of the beer-soaked bread, then slip down the greased funnel and become trapped inside the bottle. Check the bottle each morning. The roaches inside may still be alive, so pour hot water into the funnel, then flush everything down the toilet. Re-set the trap with a new piece of beer-soaked bread. While you’ll likely kill lots of cockroaches this way, it may not eliminate all of them. Try poison baits or boric acid to increase your odds of complete success."

If you’re using enclosed bait stations, place several of them throughout areas where you’ve found cockroach activity. Do the same with gel-based bait, but squeeze out many small dabs of gel throughout the target areas. It may take around 2 weeks for the poison to kill off the entire infestation, but you don’t have to remove food and empty out your cabinets like you do if you’re using an insecticide like boric acid. [10] X Research source Bait stations can be placed right near stored foods, while gel bait should be kept away from food and food preparation surfaces. Avoid using gel in areas that are accessible to kids or pets. Choose poison baits that are specifically formulated for roaches."

For pest control purposes, boric acid is usually sold as a powder in a plastic container that serves as a bulb duster. Puff a light coating of the dust in areas with cockroach activity, paying special attention to corners, crevices, and sheltered areas (like beneath kitchen appliances). Cockroaches that crawl over boric acid die quickly, so your infestation may be solved within days. That said, boric acid must be kept away from food and food preparation surfaces, and it’s best to empty out any cabinets in which you’re applying boric acid. [11] X Research source If you puff boric acid in the crevice at the back of your kitchen countertop, for example, clean off the surface in that area with soap and water or a household cleaner. You can use diatomaceous earth in the same way, but experts typically view boric acid as more effective against cockroaches in particular. Also make sure it's food-grade diatomaceous earth, not the industrial version that can be toxic to people and pets. [12] X Research source"

Flick your wrist quickly to smack the fly—you don’t need to swing all that hard in order to kill a fly. [20] X Research source Flies have almost complete 360 degree vision, so your best bet to sneak up on them is to attack from directly behind them.

You’ve probably seen “bug zappers” in outdoor settings, with their blue light luring flying insects in for a (literally) shocking surprise. It turns out that you can buy indoor traps that utilize the same kind of blue light lure. Indoor versions use either a concealed sticky surface or lower-voltage zapper to kill more discreetly. Set the trap about 5 ft (1.5 m) off the ground in a high-activity area, but not right in front of a window. Putting the light trap near a window will lure in more flies from outdoors!

Add a tiny squirt of liquid dish soap and about 1 tbsp (15 g) of sugar and stir everything together. Add a few fruit scraps, like strawberry stems or apple peels, if desired. Set the trap near your trash can or other areas with lots of fly activity. [22] X Research source Flies love the sweet-and-sour scent of overripe fruit, so the mix of sugar and apple cider vinegar will draw them in. Adding dish soap breaks the surface tension of the water, though, so the flies will drown if they land on it. Empty and replace the trap every few days or once it’s full of flies.
