      "content": "Open-ended questions require a longer answer than just “yes” or “no.” Try to tweak your questions so he’s more motivated to write out something in-depth, which will get the conversation going. Pretend to ask yourself the question first—if you can answer the question within a word or 2, it probably won’t keep your conversation going for very long. For instance, “What are your plans for the weekend?” is a better question than “Do you have anything exciting planned over the weekend?” If you’re feeling adventurous, ask a fun question, like “What’s the weirdest corner of the internet you’ve stumbled across?” or “If you had a budget of 1 million dollars for a party, how would you spend it?”"

      "content": "Follow-up questions revert the conversation in his direction. These questions don’t have to be over-the-top. A simple “Then what?” or “How so?” can inspire him to keep talking. You can even turn your follow-up question into a compliment, saying something like “That’s so cool! Could you tell me more?” or “Please go on! This is so interesting.” [1] X Research source If you’re worried about sounding too aggressive, hedge your question with a friendly statement, like “If you don’t mind me asking” or “If you’re comfortable.” A great way to follow up is repeating his last statement like a question. If he said, “I’m heading upstate for the weekend,” you might say, “So, you’re going away for the weekend?” This might inspire him to keep talking about himself. Follow-up questions are a great way to stay engaged without turning the chat into an interrogation."

      "content": "It’s easier to navigate a conversation that’s in familiar territory. Look for ways to connect your conversation to something you’re really knowledgeable or familiar with. If the conversation starts to falter, lean on some of these topics for support. [2] X Research source You might say, “Speaking of video games, I found a really cool site that lets you sign up for alerts on your favorite games” or “That reminds of something funny I overheard in class today.”"

Depending on his answer, you might be able to compare notes on some of your favorite titles or jot down some recommendations for yourself. It can be a shot in the dark, but this conversation topic might lead to a pretty interesting chat. [3] X Research source This topic can sound pretty abrupt, and may not be the best way to start a conversation. However, it’s a great way to keep your chat going! You might ask, “Read any good books lately?” or “If you were stuck on a desert island, what 3 movies would you bring with you and why?”"

[8] X Research source If he’s not feeling super chatty, build off a word or detail from the last thing he said. Word association is a simple, clever way to switch topics without seeming too random. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If he asks “how are you,” you could talk about your weekend or a fun hobby that you enjoy.

It’s totally understandable if you want to keep things going, especially if your chat was off to a good start. Just remember—your time is just as valuable as his. If he doesn’t seem that interested in chatting with you, he probably isn’t worth your time and energy. [11] X Research source For example, if you’re texting him, refrain from sending more than 2 messages in a row. Is he not letting you get a word in edgewise?
