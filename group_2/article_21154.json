Then, brush the area above the eyes. [1] X Expert Source Marie Lin Licensed Pet Groomer Expert Interview. 31 March 2020. Finally, focus on the dog’s neck area and under its mouth. [2] X Research source When you see a matted area, gently lift the fur up, slide your brush into it, and at a slight angle pull the brush (and mat) away from the dog’s body. Your dog probably won’t be happy when you try to remove mats. To calm it, hold it and comfort it by saying “good dog.”"

      "content": "Create bangs above your dog’s eyes if you prefer. Use your scissors and trim the hair above your dog’s eyes. When you’re done, the dog should have bangs that are no more than 1-inch long (2.5 cm). Don't trim your dog's whiskers. Use safety scissors if you’re nervous about cutting around your dog’s eyes. If you want, you can cut the hair shorter, so that there are no noticeable bangs. However, many Goldendoodle owners prefer bangs."

      "content": "Blend the hair around the dog's eyes into the surrounding hair. Use scissors or a trimmer to trim the area around the dog’s eyes. Avoid cutting this hair too short.

      "content": "Trim the area around your dog’s mouth with scissors. Cut the hair so it’s not more than a quarter of an inch in length (.6 cm). If the hair around your dog’s mouth is too long, it'll clash with the overall teddy bear look of your dog's cut."

      "title": "Cut underneath your dog's mouth with a clipper.",
      "content": "Cut underneath your dog's mouth with a clipper. Gently tilt the dog's face upward. Then, using your clipper and a 1-inch (2.5 cm) attachment, shave the area under the dog’s mouth and above its neck. As you move down toward its neck, switch to 1.5-inch (3.75 cm) attachment. Create a seamless transition from the mouth to the neck. Depending on your dog's hair, you may need to use scissors to create a transition zone between the areas you trimmed with the different attachments."

      "content": "Trim the hair around your dog’s ears. Use scissors to trim the hair around your dog’s ears just a little bit. When doing this, cut along the curve of the ear itself. Ultimately, the hair around your dog’s ears should seem as if it hasn’t been cut at all. [4] X Research source Focus on patches of fur that are longer than the rest of your dog's ear hair."

      "title": "Avoid cutting your dog’s face hair too short.",
      "content": "Avoid cutting your dog’s face hair too short. A mature Goldendoodle should have a “beard” that looks like an upside-down V on its face. The wide part of the V should end on both sides of the dog’s mouth/nose area. Typically, this hair is about a quarter of an inch (.635 cm) long or even slightly longer. If you cut your dog's hair too short, it won't have the upside-down V."

When doing this, brush in the direction that the hair is already pointed. If your dog has hair mats, brush under the mat and then outward. Ultimately, by brushing your dog’s hair regularly, you’ll help maintain your grooming job. [5] X Research source"

Instead, fold the towel into a square and gently pat your dog on its head, face, and neck. If you’re planning on grooming your dog’s face the same day, spend a little more time patting it down. [11] X Research source After you pat your dog down, allow your dog to air dry for a couple of hours."
