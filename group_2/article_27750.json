      "content": "Combine equal parts of fresh chopped or dried oregano and oil in a jar. When making oregano oil, the only ingredients you need are oregano and a plant-based carrier oil. Measure out ½ cup (24 g) of oregano and ½ cup (120 mL) of oil. Mix the oil and oregano in a sealable, sterilized glass jar so the oil just covers the oregano. [1] X Research source Fresh or dried oregano are both acceptable to use. If you grow oregano in your garden, making oregano oil is a great way to use extra plants at the end of the season. Extra-virgin olive oil is the most common carrier for oregano oil, but any food-grade plant-based oil – like coconut oil or avocado oil – works just fine. When using fresh oregano, strip the leaves off the stem and rinse them. Then chop or crush them in a mortar and pestle to release the oils before using. [2] X Research source This process makes an oregano oil infusion which is a type of extract that is less concentrated and safer to use on skin than essential oil. [3] X Research source"

Place the pot of water on the stove on high heat and bring the water to a boil . Turn off the burner and place the jar in the hot water for 10-15 minutes. [4] X Research source Heating the mixture allows the oregano to release its natural oils into the carrier oil. After 10-15 minutes, remove the jar from the hot water."

      "content": "Shake the jar and place it in a sunny window for 2 weeks. This helps the oregano oil better infuse into the carrier oil, making your herbal remedy more potent. Shake the jar once a day to a few times a week. [5] X Research source Alternatively, skip heating the jar and place it directly in a sunny window to cold-process the oil. During the 2-week infusion period, the olive oil will turn a darker green. This is how you know the oregano oil is ready to use."
