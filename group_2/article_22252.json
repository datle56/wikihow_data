      "content": "Heat Being in a hot environment can cause a rash to break out under your arms as well as other areas of your body where the skin touches. This is especially likely if you're sweating a lot and wearing clothes that are tight or made of synthetic material that keep moisture close to your skin. [1] X Research source A heat rash usually doesn't itch—it's more likely that it feels prickly and uncomfortable."

      "title": "Chafing",
      "content": "Chafing If you're moving around a lot in such a way that your skin is rubbing together, your underarms can become chafed. Like with a heat rash, it's going to get even worse if you're wearing a shirt with tight sleeves that are made of a synthetic material that doesn't allow your skin to breathe. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Chafing happens as a result of the friction of your skin rubbing together. It's also more likely if your skin isn't properly moisturized."

      "title": "Allergy",
      "content": "Allergy A rash can develop if your underarms are exposed to some sort of chemical or ingredient that you're allergic to. This type of rash is usually red and can get very itchy. If you've recently started using a different deodorant or antiperspirant, or if you've changed your laundry detergent or fabric softener, that might be the source of your problem. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source You can develop an allergy at any point in your life, even if you've never had a problem with a particular product. That's something to keep in mind if you haven't switched brands recently. If you've recently started taking a new medication or supplement, the rash might be a side effect. Talk to your doctor about it—they can adjust your dosage or suggest an alternative. If you really want to find out for sure what you might be allergic to, talk to your doctor about doing allergy tests. These tests won't do anything for your rash, but at least you'll know for sure what you're allergic to so you can avoid it in the future."

      "content": "Eczema Eczema is so itchy that some people call it \"the itch that rashes.\" If you're not allergic to anything but you still have an itchy red rash in your armpits, you might have eczema. Typically, a doctor would make that diagnosis, but there are still at-home treatments you can do to manage the symptoms of this condition. [4] X Research source If you've had eczema before on another part of your body, or if someone in your family has had problems with eczema, it's more likely that this is the culprit."

      "content": "Yeast infection You probably associate yeast infections with another part of your body, but armpits are prone to them as well. Here, you're looking for a bright red rash that's usually intensely itchy. You might also feel a burning sensation. A doctor can give you an official diagnosis, but you can typically treat a mild infection at home on your own. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Candida, the bacteria that causes this infection, really loves warm, moist environments, so if you're out in the heat working up a sweat, you might have a yeast infection. The itch and burning sensation set this apart from a heat rash. This is more likely if you're wearing tight clothing made of synthetic fabrics that leave the sweat trapped in your armpits—that's creating the warm, moist environment candida craves."

This can cause a rash that might look similar to razor burn, or it could look a little like acne. Your skin might be tender as well, although it usually doesn't itch. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you wax or use a depilatory cream, you might also get a rash this way, although it's less likely.

[10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This treatment is most effective if you have a heat rash, as it rapidly cools your skin.
