This will be directly across from the first 12. These represent noon and midnight. Then start over with 1 again until you end up back at the original 12 at the very top. The numbers are now accurately marked onto the paper. The full 24 hours is represented for the most precise accuracy. When seasons change, so does the position of Earth. In summer, days are longer.

Make sure the diameter of the gnomon is slightly wider than the pipe itself. Improvise a conical tip. The length of the pipe and the gnomon tip should be no longer than three inches total.

To mount it correctly, the top of the post must be cut with a precise angle. [13] X Research source To get this angle, subtract your current latitude from 90 degrees.
