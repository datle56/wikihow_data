Some people choose to go simple with two different solid colors. The possibilities and combinations are endless! Depending on the size of your pillow, you will need about 1 yard (0.92 meters) of each type of fleece."

Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors, or rotary cutter, and a straight edge to cut through both pieces of fleece at the same time. This will ensure that both pieces are even and that they match up. If you are working with a large pillow, or if you'd like a longer fringe, cut the fleece so that it is 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) longer and 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) wider than your pillow."
