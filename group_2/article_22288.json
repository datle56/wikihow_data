      "content": "Be honest with your partner. Tell your partner what happened and why. You can tell your partner the intimate details of the sexual experience if he or she asks, but it could be too painful to reveal at first. Your partner may not want to know at all. This should be a choice your partner makes, and you should abide by your partner's wishes. Your partner is likely to lash back when presented with your painful admission. While your infidelity will form the core of your partner's hurt, you may find yourself confronted with a whole range of issues as your partner seeks to express his or her pain. If your partner has ever had an affair, news of that infidelity is likely to surface during this initial exchange. Responding with disclosure of this information may be the closest weapon your partner has at his or her disposal. Be prepared for such an admission, and remember that if you feel hurt by disclosure of such information, your hurt is paralleled by your partner's pain regarding your own infidelity. You'll both have significant healing to do."

A wide variety of reasons may have contributed to your affair, from low self-esteem, alcoholism, and sex addiction to the pressures of marital problems or perceived deficiencies in your committed relationship. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Conventional wisdom once argued that infidelity was always a sign of something missing in a relationship; it is important to recognize that professionals now believe this is only one among many reasons why people cheat. [4] X Research source Regardless of your reason for cheating, you should never blame your partner for your decision. Even if you feel something has been missing in your committed relationship, you made a choice to cheat rather than working out your problems with your partner."

      "content": "Strive for transparency. Your partner will likely have many, many questions. He or she may want to know what were the circumstances of meeting the other person, and whether it was a long term affair or a short, one night stand. He or she will spend time reflecting upon the past months or years of your life together and wonder about your past actions and motives. Total disclosure detailing all the sexual details or your relationship with the other person is not appropriate when you first tell your mate that you've cheated, but it's important to be forthcoming if your partner asks for details. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take your time as a couple to process the many questions your infidelity will bring to the surface. Respond fully and openly to your partner's questions as they come, but expect that new questions will emerge over time. Be mindful of your partner's readiness to hear details even as you fully answer his or her questions. Never cover up information, but if your partner is not yet asking one type of question -- about your motivation for cheating, for example -- exercise patience. He or she may have enough information to take on board. Wait until your partner asks, then carefully provide a transparent response.

If you see any hope for your future, commit to do the hard work that will be necessary to restore trust. [9] X Research source When considering your relationship's future, consider the feelings of all those who will be affected by your decision. If your relationship involves children, for example, the stakes may be higher than they would be for a couple. Couples married for decades may have relationship networks and shared experiences that bind them more tightly than those who have dated just a few months or even years. Recognize that even if your partner sees hope for forgiveness, the actual process of forgiveness could take considerable time. Avoid making rash decisions. Give yourself sufficient time to ensure you're making decisions based upon careful reflection and not simply reacting during the heat of an argument.

Communicate your plans and respond to your partner's requests for information and reassurance. Note, however, that your past history of cheating does not completely eliminate your right to privacy. Be mindful of your partner's need for information, but do not feel compelled to provide a full list of your cell phone and social media passwords or to account for your whereabouts at all times. Such practices perpetuate mistrust rather than allowing you to rebuild your shattered relationship. [11] X Research source"

Take a \"time out\" if you find that emotions are running high. Your partner may need some physical or emotional space to process his or her feelings. Politely leave the room, go for a walk, or give your partner the freedom to distance him or herself for a period of time. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Consider scheduling specific windows of time to process difficult feelings. You might set an egg timer for half an hour, for example, and use that limited span of time for discussion.

Forgiving yourself does not mean you're off the hook for the consequences of your behavior, nor does it exempt you from the hard work of taking steps to change your behavior. Rather, forgiving yourself frees up your mental and emotional energy to move forward. You can then work on healing your relationship and changing your habits. Each day is a new day. When you wake up each morning, remind yourself of your decision to move forward and focus on repairing your damaged relationship. If you find rituals helpful, consider taking a symbolic step such as (carefully) burning or shredding a paper labeled \"cheating.\" Remind yourself of this action when you're tempted to dwell upon your past behavior. You've burned your bridges, literally or metaphorically, and have committed to move forward. If you find yourself wallowing in regret, brainstorm a productive action you can undertake instead. You might consider sending your partner a loving text, performing a chore around the house, or working on a new hobby that helps you constructively redirect your behavior."

[17] X Research source Be mindful that while your relationship is a partnership, the wounded partner needs to set the parameters for this process. Fulfilling intimacy requires considerable trust. Ensure you've been tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Never risk your partner's physical health -- or the emotional devastation that would result from an STD diagnosis."
