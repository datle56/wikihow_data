In order to join MI6, you must be a British citizen and have lived in the UK for the majority of the 10 years prior to your application to join the agency. The easiest way to confirm your nationality is to have a UK passport that describes you as a British citizen.

      "content": "Observe the agency’s no drug policy. To reflect the negative effects of illegal drug use on behavior, judgment, and physical and mental health, MI6 has a strict drug policy. Drug abuse can prevent you from getting a security clearance that would allow you to be an agent. If you want to join MI6, you should refrain from using any illegal drugs from the point of your application onwards. [2] X Research source The point of your application refers to the date you submit your application. Even if a drug is legal in a different country, if it’s illegal in the UK, you can’t use it if you want to be an agent. Previous drug use will not necessarily prevent you from joining, but you need to be honest and open and mention your previous use if you are asked about it during the recruitment process."
