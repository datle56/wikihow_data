      "content": "Determine installation hardware to be used, based on support material. A typical hook will have a threaded hole, and will be packaged with inserts that thread into this hole. One insert will be threaded with fine threads on one end, and wider threads and a point at the other end. This insert is designed to be used when screwed directly into wood or plastic anchor (some times called a \"molly\") that has been pressed into a drilled hole in brick, concrete, etc. (not wallboard/drywall!). An alternative insert uses a threaded rod with a spring loaded wing-like nut, and is called a \"toggle\" (or sometimes a \"butterfly\") nut. Many manufacturers include them for different uses and identify them for use in wallboard. They are actually designed for use in hollow walls constructed of durable materials such as cinder block . They have better success when used in vertical wallboard installations for light loads, but use in ceilings should be discouraged except the very lightest loads. [2] X Research source"

This is done by holding the threaded insert behind the drill bit - the threads should be fully visible from behind the bit. Select a smaller rather than larger bit. It is most important that not too much material be removed from the hole so that the threads can \"grab\". Larger holes provide less gripping strength than smaller holes."

This method requires that the threaded rod be installed into the swag, and the toggle nut is spun only so far that the threaded rod protrudes out of the end by about two or three threads. The toggle nut should be installed so that the wings can be depressed against the threaded rod (towards the base of the swag hook). This same method is used to suspend objects from hooks in the ceiling. When using this method for ceiling installations, only the lightest loads or ornamental type loads should be considered, as this support method is the least robust. [6] X Research source"
