      "content": "Organize and store a first-aid kit. A first-aid kit will prevent small injuries from becoming infected and leading to major medical complications. Things that should go into your first-aid kit include iodine, gauze pads, medical tape, alcohol wipes, antibiotic ointment, aspirin, scissors, and a scalpel. [1] X Research source Optional items in your first-aid kit should include things like vitamins, sunblock, and bug repellent. Remember to pack all medicines needed, including inhalers."

      "content": "Stock up on water. Consider the number of people that you have in your household and determine how much water you'd need for two weeks. You should be able to pack at least one gallon per person, so if you were alone, that would be 14 gallons of water total. If you have more people in your family, you'll need to pack more water to keep everyone hydrated. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Store enough non-perishable food.",
      "content": "Store enough non-perishable food. Bring at least three days of non-perishable food. This includes things like dried and dehydrated foods, canned foods, salt-free crackers, and whole grain cereals. Foods to bring in a survival situation include rice, beans, peanut butter, canned meat, and lard. [3] X Research source Choose things that don't require refrigeration and that don't have long preparation times. [4] X Research source If you are stranded in the wilderness, you may be able to scavenge food from local plants, bugs, animals, or fish. Purchase a manual can opener so that you can use in any situation. [5] X Research source If you forget to bring a can opener, you can use a survival knife as an alternative."

      "content": "Stock up on flashlights and extra batteries. A flashlight can be used to illuminate areas when it gets dark and is a versatile survival tool. Flashlights are critical if your car breaks down on the side of the road or if you're stuck outside at night with no light. Purchase lithium batteries over alkaline because they provide more power and have a longer shelf-life. You can also use a flashlight as a blunt self-defence weapon. Popular survival flashlights include Elzetta Bravo, Olight M23 Javelot, and Eagletac GX30A3D."

      "content": "Keep a wrench or pliers readily available to turn off utilities. During a natural disaster, you may have to turn off your utilities like water, natural gas, and electricity. Cracked lines in water pipes could pollute your water, while natural gas leaks could lead to an explosion. Keep pliers or a wrench packed in your emergency supply kit in case this happens.

      "content": "Store your emergency items together. Let everyone in the household know where the emergency kit is. In the case of an emergency, you may be required to pick up and leave quickly so it's better if all of your emergency items are organized together. Good places to store your emergency kit include an attic, the basement, a closet, or shed."

      "title": "Consider the climate and terrain.",
      "content": "Consider the climate and terrain. Before you start to pack your survival kit, you'll have to determine the climate and conditions of the place that you'll be. For instance, a desert climate will require different equipment than if you were stuck in a forest or at sea. Cater your survival kit to the climate and environment. Special equipment needed for desert survival kits include leaf bags to protect you from the suns rays, extra water, and balloons for carrying water and signalling for rescue. [7] X Research source A survival kit for the sea includes items like life vests, fishing equipment, inflatable boats, and flares. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a survival knife. A good knife can be used in a multitude of ways when you're in the wilderness. A knife can help you build shelter, start a fire, hunt, cut food, clear paths, and cut twigs and string. Find a knife with a good balance of durability and cutting power, with a Rockwell Hardness between 54 to 58. You'll want to find a knife that can both pierce and cut things. [9] X Research source A fixed blade knife is typically more durable than a folding knife under pressure."

      "content": "Bring sufficient water or purchase a water filter. If you are in an area that has fresh streams and lakes to drink from, then you can buy a portable water filter. There are portable survival straws that will filter viruses, microorganisms, bacteria, chlorine, and heavy metals like lead and mercury. If you are in a more arid environment or have limited access to freshwater sources, make sure to pack as much freshwater as possible. [10] X Research source Popular water filter brands include NDur Survival Straw, Sawyer Mini Water Filtration System, and the LifeStraw Survival Water Filter. [11] X Research source"

Fires can help you cook food and stay warm when it gets cold. There are multiple ways to do this including matches, a lighter, or a flint and scraper and each of these fire starting methods have their advantages and disadvantages. [12] X Research source Store multiple matches among your gear in case you lose one batch of matches. Get refillable butane lighters. A flint and scraper will make sparks for a fire when wet. Popular fire starter brands include Exotac NanoStriker XL, Coleman Magnesium Fire Starter, and UCO Titan Stormproof Matches."

For this reason, you should always have a backup. [13] X Research source When you can't use GPS, you can utilize a map in conjunction with a compass to find safety. Popular compasses include the Phosphorescent Lensatic Compass, the Suunto A-10 Field Compass, and the Cammenga 3H Tritium Military Compass. [14] X Research source"

To make sure that your radio can tune into those frequencies, check for the \"Public Alert\" and \"NOAA NWR All Hazards\" label on the packaging of your radio. A hand-crank will ensure that even if you run out of batteries, you'll still be able to tune into critical alerts and announcements. [16] X Research source NOAA AM alerts are available in all 50 states of the U.S. on frequencies 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550.
