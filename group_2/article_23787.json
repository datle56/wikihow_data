Crucial, a major RAM retailer, offers a free and easy tool you can use to determine your PC's maximum RAM capacity, how many SIMM or DIMM slots are available, and what type of RAM will work best. Start by opening Crucial's website on the computer you want to upgrade. Baron notes you can also go to the website of your motherboard's manufacturer to see what the RAM limit is. Using this tool cuts out a lot of the investigation on your end, as it can automatically determine your motherboard and CPU model, the amount and type of RAM supported by your motherboard/processor, how much and what type of RAM you have now, free memory slots, whether there are any size restrictions."

The \"slots\" tell you the size of the RAM stick in each of the slots. For example, if your PC has 6 GB of RAM, you might have a 4 GB stick in the first slot, and a 2 GB stick in the second. The speed of the RAM is also listed here (e.g., 1600). You can click the amount in each slot to see the exact model and speed of the RAM. It'll also show you the product number of the exact RAM you have now.

For example, if your PC can take up to 16 GB of RAM and currently has 8 GB (4 GB in each slot), you can remove both 4 GB sticks and replace them with two 8 GB sticks. You don't have to add the maximum amount of RAM. In the example of your PC taking up to 16 GB and only having 8 GB right now, you simply replace one of your 4 GB sticks with an 8 GB stick to make 12 GB, leaving the other stick alone."

Now that you know your PC's RAM limitations, you can purchase compatible RAM from any tech store (e.g., Best Buy) or online store (e.g., Crucial, which is the retailer that provided your RAM scanning tool). Crucial has been where large companies and individual users alike have purchased RAM for decades, so it's a totally safe place to get what you need. To see Crucial's recommendations and pricing, just scroll down to \"Upgrade details.\". [3] X Research source If you want to run your RAM in dual channel or triple channel mode, you will want to buy an identical pair of two of the same size and speed DDR2 or DDR3 DIMMS. If the DIMMs are different speeds from one another, they'll only run as fast as the DIMM with the lower speed. In general, as long as your motherboard takes DIMMs, which is nearly all PCs from the 2000s and forward, you don't have to install RAM in identically-sized pairs. So, if your PC came with a 4 GB DIMM and a 2 GB DIMM (a common configuration on some Acer and Lenovo laptops) and you want to have 12 GB of RAM, you could replace the 2 GB DIMM with an 8 GB DIMM. However, you do need to make sure your DIMMs have the same number of pins. It's generally cheaper to buy RAM online than in-store, but going to a store gives you the opportunity to speak with someone and make sure you're getting the right thing. For standard computer use on Windows, 6–16 GB of RAM should be enough. If you use more advanced software for 3D modeling, consider getting up to 32 GB instead."
