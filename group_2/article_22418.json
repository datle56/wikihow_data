      "content": "Encourage the person to stay socially connected. Sometimes people who have been abused become isolated from their support networks, especially if the abuser was a partner or spouse.

      "title": "Encourage the person not to contact the abuser.",
      "content": "Encourage the person not to contact the abuser. If the person has chosen to break up or become estranged from an abusive partner, friend, or family member, they may face the temptation of getting back in touch with the person in the future. Encourage them to call you for support instead when they get lonely or feel down. For instance, it may be easier to cut ties with an abusive ex, but how does one completely cut ties with a parent or sibling? The best method is to cut down on contact with the person as much as possible. When your friend does have to come in contact with their abuser, suggest that they have another person present to act as a mediator."

      "content": "Avoid judging the person for their choices. Abusive situations are always more difficult to navigate than they appear from the outside. It might seem obvious to you that someone who’s being abused should just cut contact with their abuser, but from that person’s point of view, things may be more complicated. Remaining non-judgmental is the best way to support someone who’s struggling with an abusive relationship. If the other person feels like you’re judging them or blaming them for getting into their situation, they may shut down and stop talking to you.

Instead of saying, “Why don’t you just get away from her already?!” say something like, “This situation seems really hard for you, and I’m a little worried.
