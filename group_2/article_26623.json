      "content": "Focus your diet on slow carbs and low-protein, low-sugar foods. Damaged kidneys cannot process proteins normally, so give your kidneys time to rest by reducing your protein intake. Focus on fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish, and low-fat dairy products while limiting red or processed meats, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages like soda. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Also eat foods that consist of slow carbohydrates (unprocessed carbs that take longer to digest and don’t cause your glucose levels to spike). Some healthy options include: Slow carbohydrate foods: porridge oats, beans, brown rice, pasta, lentils, carrots, sweet potatoes, whole grains, and asparagus. Low protein food: bread and cereals, pasta, lettuce, celery, sprouts, cucumber, parsley, tofu, fish, and lean meats like chicken. [4] X Research source Low-fat and low sodium-foods: avoid fried foods (use olive oil if need be), adding salt to your meals, and canned products such as soup, vegetables, and pasta sauces [5] X Trustworthy Source Health.gov Online collection of health and fitness standards set by the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Go to source Low-sugar foods: eggs, kidney beans, tofu, walnuts, cottage cheese, olives, spinach, turnips, asparagus, and barley. Eat small, frequent meals rather than binge eating or eating fewer large meals. This helps your kidneys not to overwork and strain themselves from filtering all the waste products."

      "content": "Reduce or eliminate alcohol from your diet. Getting abnormal levels of microalbumin on your test results is indicative of poor kidney function. The affected kidney can no longer filter ethanol from alcohol efficiently, which increases the risk of prolonged high microalbumin levels. To combat this, cut out alcohol and replace it with water, teas, and unsweetened juices.

Anything other than that should be avoided."

[7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aim to cut back a little bit at a time rather than going “cold turkey” to avoid withdrawal symptoms and to make the process easier on yourself. Quitting alcohol and/or smoking can be a struggle, but the positive impacts on your kidney health and microalbumin levels makes the journey worthwhile. Chronic smokers have a greater risk in developing high blood pressure (smoking restricts your blood vessels, forcing your heart to pump harder, which stresses your kidneys). Nicotine from cigarettes can increase your blood pressure to 10mmHg. If you smoke throughout the day, your blood pressure will remain constantly high."

      "content": "Lower your blood pressure with medication, exercise, and diet. Having unmanaged high blood pressure can be a factor of why your albumin levels are high. If you consistently have high blood pressure, talk to your doctor about medication that can control it, such as ACE inhibitors like Privinil or Zestril. Limit foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium, and aim to regularly exercise 3 to 4 times a week for about 30 minutes each time. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Also aim to get a good night’s sleep every night (about 7-8 hours) to reduce stress and high blood pressure Normal blood pressure ranges from below 120/80 (mmHg) to 130/80. Blood pressure that is equal to or more than 140 (mmHg) is considered to be high. Ask your primary health care provider to have your blood pressure checked regularly to make sure you're on the right track."

If you need to cut down on your weight , follow the kidney-healthy diet recommended by your doctor and try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day, including both aerobic activities like walking, cycling, or swimming, and lifting weights . If you’re new to working out or have health concerns, ask your doctor what exercises and intensity levels are best for you.

That way, you can stay focused on a low-protein, low-sugar diet that benefits your kidneys and helps you lose weight at the same time."

      "content": "Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated . The more you're dehydrated, the more your albumin levels will rise. Aim to drink the recommended 8-12 glasses of water every day to help eliminate some of the albumin in your urine, and drink extra if you sweat a lot and exercise routinely (this will also prevent dehydration). Proper hydration is linked to a lower risk of both elevated albumin (albuminuria) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). [10] X Research source Avoid fatty and salty foods. They absorb the water in your body and contribute to both dehydration and high blood pressure. Aim to drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women.

If you’re diabetic or prediabetic, unmanaged blood sugar (glucose) levels can cause kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy), leading to higher microalbumin levels in your urine. [12] X Research source Cut back on sugar, alcohol, and simple carbs (like white rice or sugary sodas) and exercise regularly to manage your glucose levels, avoid diabetes and obesity, and keep an eye on your microalbumin. A normal fasting glucose level ranges from 70 to 100 mg/dl. If your fasting level measures 100 to 125 mg/dl, then you may have prediabetes. [13] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you currently have diabetes, your albumin will be elevated because unmanaged blood sugar damages your kidney function. 180 mg/dl is the average threshold of the kidneys for diabetics in the 2 hours after a meal. That is why if there are excessive amounts of albumin and glucose in your system, it will affect the function of the kidney and will further cause kidney damage. A healthy diet and exercise can help you lower your blood pressure and blood glucose in addition to positively impacting your body weight, too."

Monitoring your levels will let you know if you’re developing or at risk for developing kidney disease, especially since early kidney disease doesn’t usually have symptoms. This test will check the albumin count in your urine. Early detection of the problem can lead to significant changes that lessen kidney damage. [14] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source To test your levels, the doctor will give you either a random urine test or a timed-collection urine test. The first is where you pee in a cup at the doctor's office as normal. The second is where you collect all your urine for a day and record the time. The entire batch is used as a sample to test your microalbumin over a 24-hour period. Avoid intense exercise or eating meat before your exam since these activities can temporarily alter your albumin or creatinine levels."

      "content": "Consider using angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the conversion of the hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This results in your blood vessels widening, which reduces tension on the blood vessels and volume of the blood—in other words, it lowers your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are proven to reduce the leakage of proteins like microalbumin into the urine. [16] X Research source The most common prescribed ACE inhibitors are Captopril, Perindopril, Ramipril, Enalapril and Lisinopril. Your doctor will know what's best for you. Alternatively, you may be prescribed an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)."

These drugs lower the cholesterol in the body by hindering the action of HMG-CoA reductase, which is an enzyme necessary in producing cholesterol in the liver. Lower cholesterol means easier work for your heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, which can reduce the microalbumin in your urine.

Without sufficient insulin, the blood sugar cannot be transported inside the cells and remains in the bloodstream. A daily insulin injection upon the advice of a physician is important to maintain normal blood glucose levels. [18] X Trustworthy Source American Diabetes Association Health-based nonprofit focused on preventing and researching diabetes Go to source This is only for those who are diabetic or have some type of insulin resistance. If your insulin works as normal, taking insulin shots will not help your microalbumin levels. If you’re diabetic, you may also be prescribed a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. This will help protect your kidneys and reduce your overall risk of cardiovascular disease."
