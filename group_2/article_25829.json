Emotional abuse isn’t always as obvious as other types of abuse, but it still leaves an undeniable mark on your life. Here are a few common red flags of an emotionally abusive partner: Isolation: They keep you from spending time with your friends and loved ones, and prevent you from following your usual routine. Gaslighting : They make you question your sense of reality. Verbal abuse and put-downs: They shout at, belittle, and berate you. Financial abuse: They take your money and/or limit your access to your bank account. Fear-mongering: They make threats to hurt you or themselves. Social abuse: They try to sabotage your relationships and keep tabs on everything that you do. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Set aside money that your abuser can’t access.",
      "content": "Set aside money that your abuser can’t access. Many emotional abusers control their victims by blocking their access to their money. Slowly start setting aside money in small amounts, so your partner doesn’t catch on to what you’re doing. For extra security, ask a trusted friend or loved one to hold onto your money so your abuser can’t get their hands on it. A separate bank account is the safest place for your money, but setting one up may not be an option while you’re still living with your emotional (and financial) abuser. That’s okay—just focus on setting aside whatever money you can, and then set up a bank account once you’re out of the relationship."
