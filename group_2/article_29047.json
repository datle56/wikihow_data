      "title": "Think of what song you want to use.",
      "content": "Think of what song you want to use. You can't make a music video without music, right? Put a lot of thought into the song!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Think of a plot",
      "content": "Think of a plot . Doing cliches are boring. Think of something natural, straight out of your brain. It's cool seeing someone make something original. For example, with the song Saints, instead of having an angel be mean and make another angel look mean, there could be a demon pretending to be an angel!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the characters.",
      "content": "Make the characters. Don't make them to bright or flashy, try to use pastel and darker colors. Make them soothing to look at. Don't make the 'edgy' characters wear all black and have black hair and eyes. Give them a color palette, and even blondes can be edgy, they don't have to smoke/vape, and spoiled brats aren't always pink and blonde haired monsters."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start making the first scene.",
      "content": "Start making the first scene. Choose the first scene and find a good background for it. Put the characters in. Make sure to choose good poses with expression, make sure only one person talks at a time, and make sure people open their mouths. Nobody can talk with mouths closed! Continue that for the whole video."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create each screenshot.",
      "content": "Create each screenshot . Make sure characters have emotion, expression, and feelings. Don't just have them standing there, with no emotion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider adding custom backgrounds.",
      "content": "Consider adding custom backgrounds. To do this, make the scene you want, exactly how you'd make it with backgrounds in the game, but make the background green. Then, download the background you want. Put the screenshots in a video and export it (making sure it's on time with the music) and add the background into the final video, then, put the video on top of the background, and use Chroma Key to remove the green background. Move the characters as freely as you'd like!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Edit the video",
      "content": "Edit the video . When you finish the screenshots, go to your editor. Add your intro in (optional) and add all the screenshots, and then the music."
    },
    {
      "title": "Line up the music and screenshots.",
      "content": "Line up the music and screenshots. This is the tricky part, making sure the screenshots line up with the music. For example, with the song saints, you wouldn't want the screenshot of saying the line \"You're not so innocent\" while the lyrics are still \"Counting out my sins just to cross them off\" would you?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add effects.",
      "content": "Add effects. For example, if your character transforms, you could add a white fade in fade out, like a bright light that happens during a transformation. Or say your character is glitching."

      "title": "Finish the video.",
      "content": "Finish the video. Add your outro if you want. After this, save the video and export it. Save this for later."

      "title": "Create your thumbnail",
      "content": "Create your thumbnail . Add your characters into a white background and screenshot it. Then add it into ibis paint or another image editing app. Remove the background and add a custom one in. Shade your characters and add text with the song title, and then \"GCMV\"."

      "title": "Upload the video to YouTube.",
      "content": "Upload the video to YouTube. Save the thumbnail, upload the video, and make it private. Go on YouTube Studio and put the thumbnail on the video, then make it public."
