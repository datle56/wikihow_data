      "content": "Decide if you want to start going barefoot more often. Think back to all those times when you wanted to go barefoot more often but couldn't (being shy, unsure how others will react, thinking your feet are gross, etc.). Try replacing such negative thoughts with more positive ones. Simply take off your shoes and socks; airing your feet feels especially good if you have had a rough day at either work or school. Play with or wiggle your toes. This helps loosen any tense muscles inside your feet and help get the blood flowing, enabling you to relax more easily. Like any other form of physical activity, going barefoot may result in injury if you try to do too much too quickly. Go barefoot for short periods of time in comfortable environments. Remember that the muscles of your feet have most likely atrophied from being supported by your shoes, and it will take time to build them up again."

      "content": "Gradually increase the amount of time you spend barefoot. As you spend more time walking around without shoes, the soles of your feet will get thicker and will be better able to withstand longer periods of activity without protection. Look for new places within your daily routine where you can go barefoot, and try to go without shoes for a longer period each week."

      "title": "Adjust to different surfaces.",
      "content": "Adjust to different surfaces. When first starting out, the cleaner the surface, the more comfortable going barefoot will be. Contrary to popular belief, sand and grass are more dangerous since there can be things hidden there that you cannot see, and humans have perfectly evolved to go barefoot. Start out on a sidewalk, preferably a clean one, and eventually your feet will teach themselves to ignore the gravel lining the street. See if there is a park or trail near you specifically for going barefoot. These often have paths specifically designed for walking over different types of surfaces, and may have places to store shoes and wash your feet after a walk. These places are also called barefoot reflexology parks."

      "title": "Work on strengthening and conditioning your foot and calf muscles.",
      "content": "Work on strengthening and conditioning your foot and calf muscles. These muscles have to work harder when you’re not wearing shoes, so building up strength in these muscles will help you transition into going barefoot. You can strengthen the many muscles and tendons in your foot and get them all working together by doing exercises that require a lot of posture changes, such as pilates, yoga, martial arts, and dance. [1] X Research source “Rolling” your calf muscles and your plantar fascia – the web of connective tissue in the arch of your foot – can help them loosen up and relieve pain. Grab a tennis or lacrosse ball and put it under your arch or your calf. Put as much weight as possible on it, and roll it around the area for about five minutes while flexing your foot or ankle. Do this once or twice a day."

      "title": "Transition into barefoot running or exercise very slowly.",
      "content": "Transition into barefoot running or exercise very slowly. You use different sets of muscles when walking around with or without shoes, so even if you’re currently running long distances in running shoes, you should only go shorter distances at first when going barefoot. Start by running only a couple of minutes at a time without shoes and gradually increase the length of your runs. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust your running form so that you take lighter, faster steps and land under your hips.",
      "content": "Adjust your running form so that you take lighter, faster steps and land under your hips. Most people take steps landing in front of their center of gravity while running, causing force to spring back at them and brake. Barefoot runners tend to land with their feet under their hips, which puts some of that impact force, reflected back by your muscles and tendons, propelling you off the ground. If you're having trouble, set a metronome to 170-175 bpm and coordinate your footsteps with its beat. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source It's important to keep it natural and do what feels right to you. If you force a forefoot strike, your calves and Achilles tendon will pay the price. Some people touch the ground lightly with their heel and place their weight on the balls of their feet. Run on a smooth but abrasive surface like a sidewalk. If you get blisters on your feet, it is a telltale sign your form needs work."

      "content": "Check to see whether your local gym requires socks or shoes. When you go barefoot while doing exercises like lifting, you may be able to strengthen additional muscles. To ease into working out barefoot in a gym setting, start with yoga, pilates, or barre classes that usually prohibit shoes. [5] X Research source Be aware that working out with bare feet on gym equipment that is not properly cleaned can lead to bacterial or fungal infections. Also, take care to avoid surfaces that may cause scratches or rug burn on your feet."

      "content": "Think ahead of time about what surfaces you’ll encounter while barefoot. Adjust your activities or your route if you want to go barefoot but think you may encounter an environment that is too hard or sharp for your feet. Plan to protect your feet from unexpected temperatures, such as heat-retaining black pavement."

      "title": "Pay more attention to where you’re stepping.",
      "content": "Pay more attention to where you’re stepping. Watch the ground in front of your feet so that you can avoid stepping on sharp or dangerous objects such as rusty nails. If you get a puncture wound or deep cut while going barefoot, see your doctor immediately."

      "content": "Check your feet often for common injuries. Blisters and stubbed toes are typical when first starting out going barefoot. Minor burns may also occur if you’re going barefoot on a hot day. Pay close attention to your feet and treat any injuries right away. Your feet will get more adaptable in time, but a part of it is knowing not to go out in very hot weather."

      "content": "Take any foot or leg pain seriously. Going barefoot can lead to more stress in your lower extremities, and may be more likely to cause injuries such as stress fractures or Achilles tendinitis. Watch out for symptoms of these and other injuries, and see your doctor if you’re having difficulties."

      "title": "Protect yourself from disease.",
      "content": "Protect yourself from disease. Going barefoot is safer than you might think – the thick skin on the soles of your feet does a good job protecting you from germs. Non-breathable footwear is often a contributing factor to athlete's foot, since the fungus needs moisture and dark places to grow, and by keeping your feet open to the air, there won't be any moisture nor dark places for the fungus to grow."

      "content": "If there are any open wounds, wait for it to heal, and do not expose it to dirt or grit, like you would every wound. Hookworm can be contracted while going barefoot in developing countries in areas containing fecal matter, so wear shoes in these environments. Make sure they are effective against hookworm, as hookworm can pass through regular shoes. Bare feet are surprisingly dirt-resistant and easier to clean than your shoes. Enjoy getting your feet as dirty as you can, but remember to wash them with soap and water afterwards. Another benefit of being a barefooter is not getting athlete's foot nor foot odor (feet get smelly in shoes if you do not wear socks or if you are on them all day, and that sweat has nowhere to go inside your shoes)."
