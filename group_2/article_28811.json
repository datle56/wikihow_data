      "content": "Add another type of alcohol to enhance the taste of the spirit, if desired. Sometimes, a drink with a lower alcohol concentration is chosen to enhance the flavor of the spirit. If you're going to use 2 types of alcohol in combination, be sure to test whether their tastes are compatible. Gin and light beer may work in a refreshing drink with lemon and honey, or beer and tequila may work as a \"beer-garita,\" but ouzo and red wine probably aren't likely to be paired anytime soon. Beer and wine cocktails have become increasingly popular over the years. Experiment with beer, for example, by making a simple Shandy from lemonade and beer. Experiment with wine by making a Kalimotxo, or red wine and cola. Or try a French 75, which combines gin, sparkling wine, lemon, and sugar."

      "content": "Get a nice cocktail shaker. In order to combine your ingredients together, you're probably going to need a cocktail shaker. Although certain cocktails that cocktails that use distilled spirits or very light mixers are stirred , most other cocktails are shaken. Cocktails that have fruit juices, dairy products or eggs, simple syrup, sour mix, or any other thick ingredients should to shaken."

      "content": "Use a jigger or measuring cup. A jigger is a useful tool if you want to make clean cocktails with exact measurements. Think about it: a cocktail where you \"eyeball\" the amount of alcohol or the amount of mixer can turn out too strong or too weak. Many jiggers or measuring cups contain 2 sides, kind of like an hourglass. The small jigger usually holds 1 fl oz (30 mL) of liquid, while the bigger jigger holds 2 fl oz (59 mL). This makes pouring cocktails that require \"double\" shots much easier."

Simply put the recommended amount of fruit and herbs in the bottom of your cocktail shaker and muddle with a muddler or the end of a wooden spoon. Make sure to get all the juices out of the fruit and break it up sufficiently. Some recipes won't call for muddled fruits, but many will. A mojito, for example, calls for muddled limes and mint to begin with."

      "content": "Put in the ice after adding the liquids. Add ice once you're ready to shake so that you don't dilute the cocktail unnecessarily. This is a mistake that many people make. They put the ice in at the beginning instead of the end, thereby diluting their drink."

      "content": "Close the cap to the cocktail shaker and shake vigorously. This can take anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds, or until the shaker is too cold to hold. Vigorous shaking will combine all the ingredients in the drink together, blending them so that you don't taste an overwhelming amount of juice and not alcohol, or vice versa. If you plan on salting or sugaring the rim of your glass — for a margarita, for example — do it now, before you pour the drink. Dip the glass into a shallow dish full of water, then dip it in a shallow dish of salt, sugar, or whatever is appropriate for your drink."

      "title": "Strain the drink into the appropriate vessel.",
      "content": "Strain the drink into the appropriate vessel. Different drinks call for different glasses. A martini, for example, is always served in a martini glass, whereas a mojito is usually served in a highball glass. Take the time to find which vessel is best for your cocktail. You may think it's a bunch of hogwash, but there are plenty of people who think that choosing the right glass is what sets a good drink apart from a great one. Also, the glass affects the appearance, which influences your perception of its taste. If your cocktail calls for ice to be added after you've shaken it, add fresh ice cubes instead of the ice cubes used while shaking. Fresh ice cubes are larger, meaning they won't melt as quickly, diluting your drink."
