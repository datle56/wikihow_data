      "title": "Use breathing techniques to reduce stress.",
      "content": "Use breathing techniques to reduce stress. It is widely known that stress can increase your heart rate. When you are stressed, your body releases adrenaline, increasing your heart rate to assist in dealing with the stressor. Breathing techniques relax and calm your body and mind, thereby lowering your heart rate.

Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly rise, but the hand on your chest should not move. Breathe out slowly, with your mouth barely open. Use your hand on your belly to push air out, if you want. Repeat this exercise 10 times."

As you begin to practice mindfulness meditation regularly, you can gradually increase the length of the sessions, if you desire."

It can help you focus and relax, decrease the negative impact of stressors, and ultimately lower your heart rate. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Try the following technique for 10 to 20 minutes: Prepare yourself for visualization. Avoid watching television, surfing the net, and other stressors. Find a quiet and comfortable place to rest and meditate. If possible, lie down. Start by closing your eyes and taking a few deep, slow breaths. Focus on imagining a setting that you find peaceful and relaxing. For example, imagine yourself at a beach, walking, striding in the sand, with the breeze blowing in your face. Imagine you are gently floating on the water. Then, allow yourself to explore that peaceful place you are imagining. When you are ready to leave, take a few deep breaths and open your eyes."

It relaxes your body and mind, which can contribute to a lower heart rate. [6] X Research source Sit comfortably in a chair or lie down. Tense the muscles in your toes. Hold for 5 seconds, then release and relax for 30 seconds. Work progressively, tensing and releasing other muscles in your body in the same way: your legs, your thighs, your abdomen, your arms, and your neck. You can repeat the exercise by working the muscles from your neck back down to your toes."

However, over the long term, consistent aerobic exercise can lower your resting heart rate. You can exercise in any way that you are familiar with and reap these benefits.

      "content": "Determine your target heart rate for maximum exercise efficiency. Determining your target heart rate allows you to aim for a certain heart rate range during exercise. This allows you to push your heart to get stronger without dangerously overworking it. [11] X Research source First, you must estimate your maximal heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. This is the maximum number of times your heart should beat per minute while exercising. Then calculate your target heart rate: moderate exercise should lead to 50 to 70% of your maximum heart rate; vigorous exercise should lead to 70 to 85% of your maximum heart rate. For example, if you are 45 years old, your maximal heart rate is 175 (220 - 45 = 175). Your target heart rate should be about 105 (60% of 175 = 105) for moderate exercise and 140 (80% of 175 = 140) for vigorous exercise."

[12] X Research source Taking your pulse at regular intervals lets you know whether you are exercising within your target heart range.
