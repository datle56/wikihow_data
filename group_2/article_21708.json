      "content": "Purchase a bifold door kit that will fit in the designated space. Start by measuring the area you want to hang your bifold doors. Then, head to a home hardware store and purchase a bifold door kit. Be sure that the combined width measurements of both doors are 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) less than the width of the opening and the combined height measurements are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) less than the height of the opening. This is necessary to account for mechanical parts. [1] X Research source For best results, opt for solid wood or solid-core, rather than hollow-core, bifold doors. If you have a small opening, you may only need a single bi-fold door. For larger openings, opt for a pair of bi-fold doors. If you want to stain, paint, or finish your door panels, make sure to do so prior to installation."

      "title": "Install the top and bottom tracks in the opening.",
      "content": "Install the top and bottom tracks in the opening. Before you attach any tracks, align them so that they are flush against the side of the door frame that the doors will fold toward—also known as the jamb side. Now, hold each track in place and fasten them to the top and bottom of the frame using the provided screws and an electric drill. [2] X Research source If you're hanging 2 sets of bifold doors in an opening, you'd have tracks flush against both the left and right sides of the frame on both the top and bottom so you can install a bi-fold door on either side. Keep the screws loose to make it easier to hang the bifold doors later."

      "title": "Attach the pivot plates and locking arms to the tops and bottom of the doors.",
      "content": "Attach the pivot plates and locking arms to the tops and bottom of the doors. Start by checking the manufacturer's instructions to determine how far to position the pivot plates from the edges of the doors and where to place each plate's pin. Use the provided screws and an electric drill to attach the pivot plates to the jamb-side doors and the locking arm to the leading doors (the door farthest from the jamb) using the pre-drilled holes in each door. The pivot plates are the thin, rectangular metal parts that connect to the track and floor bracket, while the locking arms are the hooks that connect to the doors and slide along the track. Each pair of doors should have pivot plates and locking arms on both the top and bottom of the jamb-side and leading doors, respectively. Some bifold doors have bottom pivots that attach to the door jamb—the vertical part of the frame that the door is secured to—rather than the floor. Regardless, always attach according to the manufacturer’s instructions."

Start by finding the jamb side door—the one closest to frame or opening—and mark the inner edge 11 inches (28 cm) from the bottom and 7 inches (18 cm) from the top. Then mark the center point between the previous 2 marks. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Install the top, middle, and bottom hinges to the jamb-side door. Align the bottom of the lower half of a hinge with the bottom mark on the jamb-side door. Be sure that the knuckles are flush to the edge and facing back. Now, drill pilot holes through the hinge holes with a self-centering bit, insert the screws, and fasten the hinge plate. [4] X Research source Repeat this process with the top and middle hinges."

Place it flat down so that it touches the first door back-to-back. Now, align the remaining hinge plates from the jamb-side door to the leading door at the same locations as before: 11 inches (28 cm) from the bottom of the inner edge, 7 inches (18 cm) from the top, and the center point between those 2 locations. [5] X Research source After aligning the hinge plates on the leading door, screw in the plates with the provided screws. Press the top and sides of both doors into a corner of your home to align them evenly before attaching the hinges."

For paneled doors, mark the center location of each leading door's middle rail—the horizontal elevated region that runs across the middle of the door. Start by using a straightedge to draw a line from corner to corner across the rail. [7] X Research source Now, draw a corner-to-corner line in the other diagonal direction on the rail to create an \"x,\" which marks the center of the rail. Repeat the process for each leading door."

[9] X Research source If your dowel has an adjustment screw, put it near the side-wall on the bottom of the panel. For stationary dowels without adjustment screws, place them on the bottom and top of the door panel on the side that is farthest away from the hinge. Attach dowels with spring assemblies into the top of the door panel at the point closest to the side of the installation location's perimeter—the exact distance from the side of the perimeter is noted in the manual."

Afterward, push down on the lever located on the side of the socket to lock the door in place. [10] X Research source Be sure the pin is completely in the socket before locking the pin in place.

[11] X Research source If the door isn't sliding smoothly, pull up the lever on the socket side and make sure the pin is in place. Afterward, press down again on the lever to lock it."

Measure 6 inches (15 cm) from the floor on the leading door(s) and draw a horizontal line at this location. Place 1 aligner horizontally at this location so that the bottom runs parallel to the line. Position the second aligner directly above it parallel to the line. [13] X Research source Connect the aligners to the doors with the provided screws, then check the alignment from the outside. If the alignment is off, adjust the track hardware so the doors open and close smoothly."
