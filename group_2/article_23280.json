      "title": "No, plastic rice is not real.",
      "content": "No, plastic rice is not real. There is no evidence that plastic rice is being manufactured and added to real rice so companies can save money. If rice was actually made of plastic, it wouldn’t expand and cook properly. Instead, it would shrivel or shrink when exposed to excess heat. [2] X Research source Additionally, plastic is more expensive than rice, so it would cost more for companies to manufacture plastic rice. There are claims that rice is plastic if it holds its shape and bounces when you roll it into a ball. However, rice is made of carbohydrate and protein molecules, which can bounce if cooked properly.

      "title": "The plastic rice rumor originated in China during 2010.",
      "content": "The plastic rice rumor originated in China during 2010. While the exact origin of the rumor is unclear, rumors of plastic rice started circulating on Chinese social media by early 2011. The rice was reportedly made by mixing potatoes and synthetic resin together, before being shaped into rice grains. Many social media users reposted videos further fueling the rumor, claiming that their rice would bounce, burn with a plastic smell, or wouldn’t cook normally. [4] X Research source According to Singapore media, a Chinese Restaurant Association official claimed that eating 3 bowls of plastic rice was the equivalent of eating one plastic bag. Research did reveal that some companies were producing a rice substitute, then passing it off as premium “Wuchang” grains for greater profit. But, the rice substitute was made of edible ingredients—not plastic. There were already public fears over food safety due to the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, where the chemical melamine was added to milk and infant formula (causing kidney damage)."

      "content": "The rumor of plastic rice spread to West Africa in 2016. In December 2016, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) intercepted 2.5 tons of rice smuggled into the country. They sent it to a laboratory for testing, and the customs chief initially claimed that the rice was plastic. However, the country’s health minister later backtracked, saying there was no evidence to support those claims. He told Nigerians not to panic and encouraged them to purchase local rice instead. [5] X Research source Despite this, the official investigation and initial report further fueled the plastic rice rumor across Africa. Tests did show that the intercepted rice contained high levels of bacteria, but the results were normal for real rice. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Water Test Add your rice to a bowl, then pour water over the rice until it’s fully submerged. Stir the water for a few seconds and let it settle. Real rice will sink in the water, due to its density, while plastic rice will float to the surface. [7] X Research source You might see bits and pieces of dirt and other debris float, but all the grains of rice should sink. If any grains float to the surface after the water settles, you should be suspicious."

      "content": "Microwave Test Combine equal parts of rice and water in a microwave-safe bowl, or use whichever ratio you prefer whenever you normally cook rice. Microwave the rice on high for 3 to 5 minutes, then skim the surface with a spoon to check for a layer of plastic residue. [8] X Research source If you have plastic rice, you’ll be able to skim a thick layer of melted plastic from the surface. Unlike real rice, the plastic won’t start to fluff and absorb the water. Alternatively, boil the rice on the stovetop for 10 minutes before checking for plastic residue. You might have to lower the heat to calm a rolling boil so you can see the surface clearly. Rice is starchy, and some stickiness or residue is normal, especially in short-grained varieties. [9] X Research source However, there’s a noticeable difference between a thin starchy residue and a thick layer of melted plastic."

When the oil becomes very thin and hot, add a thin layer of rice to the pan so you can observe individual grains. Check for grains that contract and melt, since plastic melts when exposed to high heat. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, rice can have microplastics, depending on the type of rice you buy.",
      "content": "Yes, rice can have microplastics, depending on the type of rice you buy. Studies show that people consume 3 to 4 mg of plastic for every 100 g of rice they eat, with the number jumping to 13 mg per serving for instant or pre-cooked rice. With that being said, washing your rice can reduce plastic contamination by 20 to 40%. [13] X Research source This is especially concerning because rice is a staple food globally. The main types of microplastics found in rice are polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, followed by polypropylene and polyamide. [14] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source There are many unknowns on how harmful microplastics are, but research suggests they can accumulate in the body and trigger an immune response. This may lead to cell damage, allergic reactions, endocrine disruption, carcinogenesis, mobility issues, and reproductive and development issues. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Spoiled rice will have an unpleasant smell and become slimy.",
      "content": "Spoiled rice will have an unpleasant smell and become slimy. Unlike freshly cooked rice, which basically has no odor, spoiled rice has a sour or musty smell. Spoiled rice will also be slimy or gooey, instead of airy and fluffy, and may have blue, black, or green mold spores. Throw out rice that exhibits any of these signs to avoid food poisoning. [16] X Research source You can store cooked rice in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for about 4 days, or freeze it for up to a year. When you’re ready to use it, thaw it in the fridge overnight and cook it as usual."
