      "content": "Think about the sort of colors you would like to wear. Do you have blue eyes? Match your bracelet to your eyes with an alternating blue/green, or blue/yellow bracelet. Are you planning on wearing a red outfit? Make a predominantly red bracelet. Maybe you don't want to match at all. You are versatile and unique, so why not make your bracelets the same? Many websites sell multiple different colors, from monochrome bands to multicolored, tie-dye, and glow in the dark. Mix and match to your heart's content."

      "title": "Gather all your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather all your supplies. To make the most basic bracelets, you will only need rubber loom bands, a loom, and a metal hook tool to attach them together. However, the quality and style of these products differ wildly. Browse at a few sites to see which ones you like the most. You can buy silicon, jelly, latex-free, and other types of loom bands. If you are allergic to latex, the type of band you buy is incredibly important to avoid allergic reactions. Make sure you get the correct looms for your project, and your health. C-hooks are necessary to make bracelets that are easily removable. You will attach these to the end of your loom bracelet when you have finished attaching all the loops. It will attach to the other end of the bracelet, and permit you to put on and remove the bracelet at will. These also come in many different colors. Making loom bracelets is possible without a loom, but it is more difficult to do. As these are relatively cheap, it is definitely a good investment to buy one, especially if you are planning to make many loom bracelets. It is also possible to work without a hook tool, by using your finger or a common household item, like a pen or a screwdriver. Metal hook tools are also cheap, though, and the long hooked apparatus is very useful for getting in the small spaces in and around a loom to hook the rubber band loops. It is best to invest in one of these, if you plan to make many bracelets, as it reduces the time and hassle of your work."

Try to pick an open area to work in, such as a clean kitchen table or a large desk. Working on the couch may be more comfortable, but if you drop your looms, you'll have to dig through the cushions to find them again. If you drop them on a table, they're still right there in front of you. Working at a large, open space is also enticing to other people, who may want to join you. If you enjoy group projects, this is a great way to get your friends or family involved. If not, then pick a smaller space."
