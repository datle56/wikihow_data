      "content": "Find an old pair of jeans that you're happy to distress. The jeans should be 100% cotton, as other fabrics won't work the same. They should be baggy, straight, or boot-cut in order to make a true 90s look, but they can be any color. [1] X Research source Prepare your tools at the same time. These can be found below, under the Things You'll Need."

      "content": "Turn your pants inside out. Then use a ruler, and mark out two slits in the middle of the leg, going crossways across the knee area. To look like true-90s style ripped knees, the slits should go across the knee, stopping 2 centimeter (0.79 in) from the seam on both sides; if you want the rip to be smaller, then mark it 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the seam."

These slits should be about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) shorter than the first. Then again, make two more slits each a ruler-width each from the top and bottom, again making them about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) shorter than the previous ones. Repeat until your last slits are only 1 centimeter (0.39 in) or so long."

[5] X Research source If the tweezers cannot pull white threads out after more than five to seven white threads on each side (2cm away from the slits), turn the jeans right side out and use a razor to distress the edges until you see white threads. If you get two to four threads left after pulling without using a razor, if the slits are small as 1 centimeter (0.39 in), you can pull the blue threads using your hands."
