      "title": "Use deodorant.",
      "content": "Use deodorant. Before you hit puberty, you will notice that you will sweat easier and more often than you used to. Don't worry though; this is easily cured. All you need is some deodorant. If you aren't sure what deodorant is, just ask your parents or guardian. There are many types of deodorant available on the market. They may have different scents, different applications (roll-on, spray etc), marketed for different purposes etc. You should try out different brands and find the one you like. If you get bored with a certain product, or develop an allergy, don't worry! You can get another one."

      "title": "Shower more often.",
      "content": "Shower more often. Another thing you will notice is greasy hair. All this means is that your hair follicles are releasing more oil so that your hair can grow longer. Even though you need some of this oil in your hair, you have to keep the amounts down to keep up with basic hygiene. To do this, shower at least once a day, using soap or shower gel (pay special attention to your armpits and private area), as well as using shampoo (and conditioner) on your hair. If you have long, thick hair, you might not be able to dry it daily - you can wash your hair every 3 days and use hacks, like wearing a pony tail or braiding your hair, as well as products like dry shampoo. Many people have short hair, to make keeping hygiene easier (shorter hair dries faster)."

      "title": "Prevent acne breakouts.",
      "content": "Prevent acne breakouts. Most kids coming into puberty will notice little red spots all over their face that appear to be white; these are called pimples. If there are many of them, it is called acne. Nobody likes these little pests all over their faces, but there is a way to cure them and to help make them go away. Try purchasing pore cleansing rinses, as well as acne clearing creams. Washing your face with a washcloth, some body wash, and water is another way to help clear your face."

    {
      "title": "Consider shaving.",
      "content": "Consider shaving. Coming into puberty, you will notice hairs growing on your legs, arms, and armpits. If you do consider shaving, talk to a parent or guardian to make sure they're okay with it. There's nothing unhygienic about body hair. Just about everyone in the world has it. Shaving it off might help you feel cleaner or more confident, but it's ultimately a personal choice that's okay to say no to. Be careful when shaving any part of your body. There is always the risk of nicks (small cuts), irritated skin, or ingrown hairs."

      "title": "Shaving your private parts.",
      "content": "Shaving your private parts. Not only will you grow more hair on your arms and legs, but it will also begin to grow in your private areas. This is known as pubic hair, and it is completely normal and natural. However, some people dislike the look or feeling of this hair, so they shave it off. As with any other part of your body, shaving is optional and you shouldn't feel pressured to shave if you don't want to. Always consult or ask an adult before you consider shaving or doing anything else to your growing body."

      "title": "Start using menstrual products.",
      "content": "Start using menstrual products. Always wear a panty liner or period underwear when you are nearing the age you think you will start your period. Carry pads, tampons, a menstrual cup, or another form of protection with you. A few folds of toilet paper can be a short-term substitute for a pad if absolutely necessary."
