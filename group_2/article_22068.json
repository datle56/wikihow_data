      "content": "This works well with short messy hairstyles. Ask your barber to cut the hair on the sides and back of your head really short, using the number 1 or 2 guide on their trimmer. Keep some length on the top that you can style for your new messy hair vibe.

      "content": "These types of products keep your hair looking more natural. Rub a bit of the product you choose onto your hands to coat them in a thin, even layer. Work it into your hair by running your fingers through it, then style your hair in whatever messy way you want. For example, if you have medium-length hair, you can brush it to the back after you put the product in for a disheveled swept-back look. Or, just let your hair fall into its natural positions after you put the product in for a more free and loose textured style. Hair wax is also known as putty, clay, texturing paste, or styling paste. Avoid shiny hair products like traditional glossy pomades or gels that can detract from the effortlessly messy vibe you’re going for. You can apply styling products when your hair is dry or damp."

Spray the sea salt spray all over your hair from all sides, then work it in with your hands as you style your locks. [5] X Research source Use as much or as little sea salt spray as you like. The more spray you use, the drier and coarser your hair looks when it dries. You can buy a commercial sea salt spray or make your own by combining warm water and sea salt in a spray bottle at a ratio of 1 c (240 mL) of water to 1 tbsp (17 g) of sea salt."

Brush your free hand through your locks from different angles as you blow dry to get your hair to dry in different directions and achieve that carefree, wind-swept look you want. [6] X Research source Keep the blow dryer moving and pretend it’s like the wind — wild and free. Don’t just blow dry your hair in one direction or your hair won’t look messy and natural. Avoid rubbing your hair dry with a towel because all the static creates frizz You can also do this after you apply sea salt spray to your hair to achieve a look like you just spent the day on a windy beach."

      "content": "This is a great option for people with curly and afro-style hair. Let your hair grow out long and keep it moisturized by not over-shampooing and by applying a moisturizer every day. Leave the locks alone to let them do their natural, messy thing. You can add a side part if you want by picking a spot in the middle of the afro and brushing the locks in opposite directions. Avoid brushing your ‘fro too much, though, so you keep it looking untamed. Shampooing even less than 2-3 times a week is good for afro-style hairstyles. For example, once a week can be enough. Curly hair is drier by nature.
