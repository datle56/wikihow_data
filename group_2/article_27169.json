Unfortunately, glow sticks only glow for a certain amount of time, so it would be best to do this project in the evening when it is already dark. This way, you will not be wasting any of your glow sticks' \"glow\" time."

      "content": "Find a suitable jar for the fairies. You can use any size jar you want, but keep in mind that the smaller the jar is, the more glow you will get. A larger jar will have a less intense glow, and may require more glow sticks. You can also use a bulb-shaped glass bottle with a cork stopper. Consider using a tinted mason jar. You can also tint the jar yourself by mixing a glossy decoupage glue with a few drops of food coloring, and then painting the jar with it."

      "title": "Purchase some glow sticks.",
      "content": "Purchase some glow sticks. Any sort of glow stick will work, but the 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks will have better results than the bracelets or necklaces, which do not glow for very long. The size of your jar will determine how many glow sticks you will need to buy. The larger the jar is, the more glow sticks you will need. You will need two to three glow sticks, depending on the size of the jar. For example, a 16-ounce (473.18 milliliters) jar will need two to three 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks. Consider purchasing a long-lasting glow stick. Most glow sticks only shine for only shine for 2 to 3 hours, while others will shine for 4 to 6 hours. Some glow sticks, however, will shine for up to 12 hours. The package will tell you how many hours the glow stick will shine for. The longer the glow stick shines, the longer you will be able to enjoy your fairy jar. Consider purchasing multiple colors of glow sticks. Most glow sticks come in basic colors, such as: red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white. You can create new and exciting colors by combining existing ones. For example, if you mix blue and green together, you will get teal."

Glow sticks are non-toxic, but the chemicals can burn and irritate your skin. Protect yourself by wearing some rubber gloves for this step. Adult supervision is required for this step. Consider placing a small, tightly-woven strainer over the mouth of the jar. The strainer will catch any bits of glass that might fall out of the glow stick. Do not use this strainer for cooking or baking after this project."

How much glitter you use will depend on the size of your jar as well a your preferences. For example, for an extra glittery 16-ounce jar (473.18 milliliters), you will need Â¼ cup (32 grams) of super-fine glitter. Consider using shaped pieces of glitter, such as flowers, hearts, and stars.

They are often used to decorate miniature villages and houses. You can also use ordinary-sized LED string lights, but make sure that they are battery operated and that the wire is not too long. Look for something with a silver or white-colored cable. You are using LED lights because they do not produce as much heat as regular lights. If you are planning on filling your jar with moss, then consider getting some lights with a green cable instead."

You could try taping the battery pack, so it will be easier to take the pack out and change/charge the batteries. If the battery pack does not fit inside the jar or the lid, purchase a canning mason jar with a two-part lid. Get rid of the flat disk portion of the lid and keep the ring. Tape the battery pack to the top of the lid, and cover it with a piece of fabric. You will wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the fabric after you put the lid on the jar to secure the fabric.

You want the filler to be large enough so that it can be scrunched up loosely in the jar, but not so large that you have to stuff it in tightly.
