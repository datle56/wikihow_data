      "title": "Enjoy the freedom.",
      "content": "Enjoy the freedom. To use your alone time to its fullest, you need to begin by embracing it. Have fun with yourself and learn more about yourself! Learn to love the benefits being alone brings and resolve yourself to have a positive attitude about it. Embrace being able to do, say, think, or act however you want. When you’re by yourself, you don’t have to worry about the thoughts or judgments of others. You can be utterly and unabashedly yourself and never think twice about what someone else might think or say. Love the independence that comes with having time to yourself. You don’t have to take anyone else’s tastes, preferences, or desires into account when making your decisions. If you want to watch terrible reality television, no one can whine about it or beg you to change the channel. If you want to go for an extra-long walk or jog, no one can complain about how long you were out or hijack your plans. Savor not having to look good for anyone. If you want to spend all day in your pajamas with messy hair and unbrushed teeth, do it! No one will be the wiser and no one can look at sideways at your unicorn slippers. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Revel in the lack of awkwardness. Being around people usually means enduring at least some degree of awkwardness some of the time. Being alone, on the other hand, means never having to dodge awkward questions about your dating life or listen to someone tell you all about their cat’s agoraphobia. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Love yourself and all your quirks.",
      "content": "Love yourself and all your quirks. Having time to yourself gives you the chance to step back from all the frantic activity of daily life and interactions. You have time to actually be with yourself--and appreciate your own company. To fully enjoy your time alone, decide to let yourself truly be who you are. Embrace your quirks--talk to yourself, talk to your chair, do a weird dance while you brush your teeth, slide rather than walk whenever possible, etc. And then take time to really appreciate what an awesome and unique person you are. [3] X Research source Start defining yourself by your own unique qualities rather than by your relationships or other people’s opinions. Being alone gives you the chance to really consider yourself for who you are, apart from other people. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Appreciate small things.",
      "content": "Appreciate small things. Another big part of enjoying your alone time is starting to notice and appreciate small things in your life. Being away from the distractions of others lets you pay attention to small details you might otherwise overlook or forget to notice. [5] X Research source Take time to look around you. Notice as many small, fine details as you can. Be aware of the small things that bring you pleasure and then take a moment to really absorb and enjoy that pleasure. Be observant of yourself. Pay attention to small shifts in your mood, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. Try to pinpoint what led to that shift and how it affected you physically and emotionally. As you get more tuned in to yourself and what makes you tick, you’ll start to gain insights into yourself you may have never realized before."

Make a comic strip or a web comic . Use yourself, celebrities, family, or friends as inspiration for the characters. You can make your comic artistically detailed or use messy stick figures.

      "content": "Write a book. The time may never come again when you will have such perfect loneliness--so make the most of it. The silence may help you concentrate. If writing a book seems like too much to take on, try something smaller but equally expressive: Write a journal entry or start a new journal. Write a letter to someone you haven’t seen in a long time. Make a list of your goals for the next month or year."

In fact, it can be pretty nice to go wherever you want, order whatever you want, drink whatever you want, and have a whole table to yourself. If you feel like being a bit social, sit at the bar to eat. People sitting at the bar tend to be friendlier and more open--and to have better stories. [8] X Research source Go to one of your favorite restaurants and order the meal you’ve been craving. Bring a book along if you’d like, or enjoy your meal while people-watching."

      "content": "Catch up on responsibilities. The best thing about \"me time\" is that you're not going to have any interruptions. Catch up on school work, study for an upcoming test, clean your room, get your finances squared away, etc. Use this time to your advantage.

Use your imagination. Go to a different place in your head and imagine a different world. Allow yourself to daydream. You may even come up with a great new idea for a story or a blog post. Meditate . Sit quietly, close your eyes, and pay attention to the sounds, smells, and sensations around you. Let your mind go blank and concentrate on your breathing."

Do the same for each new page you come to and see how far away from your starting point you can get. Then revel in all the obscure knowledge you’re accumulating. Go tutorial crazy by visiting various tutorial and how-to sites--and then trying them out. If you’re into experimenting with hair and makeup, find the craziest hair/makeup how-to you can and be your own experimental subject. If you like making things, look up tutorials on making or building things (birdhouses, crème brûlée, pillows, whatever) and give it your best shot. You may uncover some hidden talent."
