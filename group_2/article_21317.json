      "content": "Use a freshwater tank larger than 5 US gal (19 L). Java moss is a freshwater plant that cannot survive for long in marine aquariums (salt water), so make sure you have a freshwater tank ready. Tanks any smaller than 5 US gal (19 L) could crowd your fish as your moss starts to grow, so use a tank larger than this. [1] X Research source Java moss can survive in slightly brackish water with a low salt content, but it prefers freshwater. [2] X Research source Tap water should work fine, but you may need to add chemicals from an aquarium store, like a water conditioner , to make it safe for plants and fish."

      "content": "Keep the water between 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). Place a heater in the tank so it stays at a consistent temperature. Java moss prefers cooler water temperatures, but it can tolerate temperatures up to 90 °F (32 °C). This will just cause it to grow much slower than at the lower temperatures. [3] X Research source Check the temperature of your tank often to make sure it does not fluctuate. Many pet stores or aquarium shops carry floating thermometers so you can easily check."

      "content": "Maintain a water pH level between 5-8. Use a home pH test to check the acidity of your fish tank. If you find that the pH is off, add store-bought chemicals to raise or lower it to the desired level. Just follow the instructions carefully when adding any chemicals to the tank. [4] X Research source Test kits or strips can be purchased at aquarium specialty stores or online. Test the pH of the water once per week, especially when you perform a water change. As an alternative to chemicals : Add baking soda, shells, or new rocks to your tank to raise the pH if it is too low. [5] X Research source Add peat moss or driftwood to lower the pH if it is too high. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep a filter in the tank to provide water circulation.",
      "content": "Keep a filter in the tank to provide water circulation. Not only will a filter help keep your water clean, but it will create a current in your tank. Water circulation helps spread nutrients throughout the tank, making it easier for your moss to grow quickly. It also prevents debris from accumulating in the moss, which can harm the plant or cause it to turn brown. [7] X Research source Keep the current weak as the moss’s roots are establishing—a strong current could break apart the moss and clog the filter. Keep the moss out of direct flow from the filter to prevent it from getting clogged."

      "title": "Provide overhead fluorescent or LED lights.",
      "content": "Provide overhead fluorescent or LED lights . Java moss is not picky about its lighting conditions and grows well in low light. But, it will grow differently depending on the brightness you give it. If you want your moss dense and to grow quickly, use bright lights and keep them on for 10 hours. For thinner moss with a darker color, use low lights. [8] X Research source While java moss can grow in dim conditions and doesn’t need any specific lighting, it still needs some light to grow. Like all plants, it won’t survive if it doesn’t have any light. In a pinch, a desk lamp secured above your tank will work for a short amount of time. Note : Brighter lights can cause more algae to form in your tank. Keep this in mind if you want to limit algae growth."

      "content": "Drop the java moss on top of the water if you want it to float. Simply leave a piece of the moss on the surface of the water. It will grow and develop into a floating plant. Be aware that the moss will move around the tank and could catch in a filter, so pull it away if it gets too close. [9] X Research source Java moss doesn’t have roots, so it doesn’t need to be planted in a substrate to get its nutrients. It absorbs nutrients from its stem and leaves, so it’s happy to simply float in your tank. Java moss does have root-like rhizoids, which it uses to attach itself to rocks, wood, and other decorations. So, your plant might eventually anchor itself to something in your tank."

      "title": "Tie the moss to driftwood or a rock if you want it to adhere to something.",
      "content": "Tie the moss to driftwood or a rock if you want it to adhere to something. Spread a clump of java moss on a piece of driftwood, rock, or other decoration. Then, wrap dark thread or fishing line around the moss and tie a simple knot . The added security from the line helps encourage the plant’s rhizoids to attach to the rock or wood. [10] X Research source For example , place a piece of driftwood upright in the tank and tie the moss to the top to make an underwater tree. As an alternative , attach your moss to wood or rocks with aquarium-safe glue . Simply apply a bit of glue to the stems or rhizoids and secure it to the wood or rock. [11] X Research source It takes about 1 month for the moss to adhere to the decoration. Then, you can remove the thread with a pair of scissors. Don’t wrap or tie the moss too tightly, as this can prevent it from growing well."

      "content": "Place the moss between 2 pieces of plastic mesh to make a wall or carpet. On one side of the plastic mesh, spread your moss as evenly as possible. Place the other piece of mesh on top. Then, use a needle and thread to tie the sides of the meshes together. [12] X Research source To create a moss carpet : lay the mesh on top of the substrate bottom. To create a moss wall : Attach suction cups to one of the mesh pieces and adhere it to one of the walls of your aquarium. Make sure the materials you use in your tank are non-toxic so it doesn’t contaminate the water."

      "content": "Trim the moss every week with a clean pair of scissors. Reach into your aquarium and slowly cut the branches and stems if your moss is getting too long. Simply shape the moss however you want it. For example, if you attached it to a tree, you may want to trim the moss so it’s round and neat. [14] X Research source You can let moss grow freely, but it may restrict water flow or make it hard for fish to move around your aquarium. Disinfect the scissors with warm water before putting them in your tank. Any added chemicals could harm the health of your plants and fish."

      "content": "Use a water siphon to change the water and vacuum the moss weekly. Move the siphon up and down in the water to create suction and start the water flow. Then, hold the siphon near your moss to suck any food or plant particles. Simply control the suction with your thumb at the end of the hose. [15] X Research source Have a bucket ready to drain 20% of the water from the tank. Aquarium specialist Craig Morton recommends changing 20-25% of the water at each tank cleaning. Alternatively , completely remove the moss from your tank (if possible). Then, hold it under cool running water to rinse off any debris and buildup. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Replace the moss if algae starts to grow on it. Algae forms in water with poor circulation and under bright lights. Though your moss will help prevent algae, it may get into your aquarium. Once algae have grown on your moss, it’s very hard to get rid of and should be removed. [17] X Research source If you want to keep the moss , gently use a soft toothbrush to scrub the moss. Or, cut off the affected branches and stems. Just be careful not to detach the moss from its base. To help prevent algae buildup, gently shake and spread out the moss’s branches and stems once per week. According to professional aquarist Doug Ludemann, the best way to prevent algae from growing is to do regular “water changes.” He says, “algae is the result of light and nutrients in the water” and there’s really “ nothing you can add to your aquarium that will take anything out.” Another option to help reduce algae is to add algae-eating shrimp and snails to your tank, like amano shrimp and nerite snails.

      "title": "Add fertilizer to the tank if your moss isn’t growing well.",
      "content": "Add fertilizer to the tank if your moss isn’t growing well. Most java moss plants grow about 1 inch (2.5 cm) per month, so you should notice new, bright green growth fairly quickly. However, if the moss is still the same size after a few months or it’s starting to turn brown, adding an aquarium plant fertilizer can help boost its health and growth. [19] X Research source Choose a fertilizer that’s safe to use with the fish and other plants in your tank. Follow the directions on the fertilizer to add the correct amount to your tank. Java moss typically starts to turn brown if it’s not receiving the nutrients it needs. So, adding fertilizer can help it recover. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "It helps with breeding fish and shrimp Many species of fish and shrimp like to lay their eggs in java moss, as it provides cover and prevents other animals from eating the eggs. The moss also helps the babies survive once they hatch. The plant gives the babies a place to hide, which keeps other fish from eating them before they’re big enough to defend themselves. [23] X Research source For instance, java moss is a great addition if you’re breeding red cherry shrimp."

      "content": "How fast does java moss spread? Java moss is considered a slow grower and usually grows 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) per month. However, it may grow quicker if you give it a lot of light. It can take 1 month for it to establish itself once you add it to your tank, so you may not see growth for a while. [26] X Research source If you have a small tank, the java moss might seem like it spreads out fairly quickly. Luckily, it’s easy to keep java moss from overtaking your tank. Simply trim off the branches to keep it at the size you like."
