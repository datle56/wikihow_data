      "title": "Measure around the child's head.",
      "content": "Measure around the child's head. Loop a soft tape measure around your child's head at about the temples. Note the measurement mentally or on a scrap of paper. If you're a kid making your own hat, ask an adult or sibling to help you measure your head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 2 cm (0.79 in) or 3 cm (1.2 in) to the measurement.",
      "content": "Add 2 cm (0.79 in) or 3 cm (1.2 in) to the measurement. Write down the new measurement. Forget the original measurement at this point -- you'll be working with this updated number to ensure a good fit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab a piece of white cardstock and mark the length.",
      "content": "Grab a piece of white cardstock and mark the length. You need the cardstock to be the length of your new measurement, so use a ruler to measure it. Mark the length lightly with a pencil on the cardstock. If you don't have cardstock, improvise with a white manila folder, a thin cereal box covered in white printer paper, or several sheets of white paper taped together for durability."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mark the height on the cardstock.",
      "content": "Mark the height on the cardstock. Once you've marked the length, measure it to be 10 cm (3.9 in) tall. Mark the height on the cardstock with a pencil. These measurements form a strip that will become the headband of the chef hat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut out the strip and fold it in half.",
      "content": "Cut out the strip and fold it in half. Use scissors to cut out the strip of cardstock you just measured. Discard the excess paper. Take your strip and fold it in half length-wise."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut a sheet of white crepe paper to be 30 cm (12 in) by 60 cm (24 in).",
      "content": "Cut a sheet of white crepe paper to be 30 cm (12 in) by 60 cm (24 in). If you don't have white crepe paper, use a white paper tablecloth. Use your ruler to measure a rectangle that measures 30 cm (12 in) to 60 cm (24 in). Carefully cut the rectangle out with scissors. You can purchase crepe paper at craft stores, party supply stores, and many big box stores."

    {
      "title": "Place one of the long edges of crepe paper on top of the cardstock.",
      "content": "Place one of the long edges of crepe paper on top of the cardstock. Align them both length-wise. Line up the crepe paper along the fold you made in the cardstock. Tape one corner down securely with transparent adhesive tape, such as Scotch Tape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make about 10 folds down the length of the crepe paper.",
      "content": "Make about 10 folds down the length of the crepe paper. Starting at the taped end, make small pleated folds in the crepe paper. You should end up with about 10 folds by the time you get to the end of the cardstock. Tape the folds down to the cardstock as you go. This will create the gathered look of chef hats."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold up the bottom edge of the cardstock.",
      "content": "Fold up the bottom edge of the cardstock. Fold the cardstock until the two ends meet each other, with the crepe paper sandwiched between them. You're simply refolding in the same place where you folded it earlier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a loop with the cardstock and tape the ends together.",
      "content": "Create a loop with the cardstock and tape the ends together. Bring the 2 ends of the cardstock together to create a circle. Overlap the ends by a few centimeters. Tape the ends to each other to join the circle. This circle is the headband, which fits around your child's head. You can tape the ends together on the inside or outside of the headband. The inside looks more seamless, but if you're using clear adhesive tape, the outside works fine, too!"

    {
      "title": "Gather the ends of the crepe paper into a point.",
      "content": "Gather the ends of the crepe paper into a point. You now have a circle with white crepe paper sticking straight up out of it. Gather the ends of the crepe paper into a point. Wrap tape around the pointed end to secure the paper together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the pointed end down into the hat.",
      "content": "Push the pointed end down into the hat. Then reach your hand up into the inside of the hat and pull the point down from the inside. This will make it puff out just like a real chefâ€™s hat!"
