      "title": "Choose an image and scale it to the size you want.",
      "content": "Choose an image and scale it to the size you want. Before jumping into the puzzle-making process, decide what image to use on your puzzle. If you’re using a photograph, choose a high-resolution image and scale it to the size you want your puzzle to be using photo editing software. If you’re drawing your puzzle’s design, draw it to scale (the actual dimensions of your puzzle). [1] X Research source Draw on thick paper like cardstock for a sturdier, long-lasting puzzle. Use markers or pens, as pencil art might smudge and colored pencils may be too light to see."

      "title": "Print your image on either printer or sticker paper.",
      "content": "Print your image on either printer or sticker paper. Unless you’re drawing your puzzle design directly onto paper, you have to print it out. Double-check that it’s scaled to the dimensions you want the puzzle to be before printing. Print on regular printer paper, or use printable sticker paper to save yourself the hassle of gluing it to the cardboard later. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue or stick your image to a cardboard backing.",
      "content": "Glue or stick your image to a cardboard backing. If you’re gluing, turn your puzzle image face down and apply a glue stick or craft glue over the entire back. [3] X Research source If you printed on sticker paper, peel off the backing to reveal the adhesive. [4] X Research source Place your picture onto the cardboard backing. With a ruler or old credit card, apply even pressure to the picture to help the glue adhere and remove bubbles. The ideal thickness for a puzzle backing, be it cardboard or plywood, is 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). You can use the cardboard from an old box to back your puzzle, but make sure it’s clean, undamaged, and flat. Thin paperboard from a cereal box will work for a simple puzzle, but cardboard is preferable because it’s thicker. [5] X Research source Let the glue dry completely. Glues have different drying times, but give your puzzle at least one hour to set."

      "title": "Spray on an even coat of lacquer.",
      "content": "Spray on an even coat of lacquer. Take your puzzle outside or to a well-ventilated area. [6] X Research source Place it on parchment or wax paper to protect the surface beneath it. Spray an even coat of lacquer (also known as picture varnish ) over the image to protect it from wear and give it a glossy shine. Check the can for drying time, and allow it to dry fully."

    {
      "title": "Trim any excess cardboard.",
      "content": "Trim any excess cardboard. If your puzzle image is smaller than the backing, use scissors or a hobby knife to remove the unwanted border. If you’re using a hobby knife, place the puzzle on a cutting mat so you don’t damage your cutting surface. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Trace a grid on the back side of your puzzle.",
      "content": "Trace a grid on the back side of your puzzle. Flip your puzzle so the image is facing down. Use a ruler to mark out a grid pattern made up of squares that are 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) by 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) (for a puzzle with smaller pieces) or 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 1 inch (2.5 cm) (for a puzzle with larger pieces). Trace the squares with a pencil. Instead of drawing your own jigsaw puzzle template, you can print puzzle templates from sites like Tim’s Printables ."

    {
      "title": "Sketch the grid squares into puzzle piece shapes.",
      "content": "Sketch the grid squares into puzzle piece shapes. To create puzzle pieces, add ball and socket shapes (aka half-circles) along the edges of the grid squares so that the pieces will fit into each other when the puzzle is cut. Alternatively, use inverted and protruding triangles, squares, or other shapes for a more unique puzzle. [8] X Research source If you’re using a printed puzzle template, use a glue stick or craft glue to attach it to the cardboard back of the puzzle and allow it to dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use scissors to cut out your puzzle pieces.",
      "content": "Use scissors to cut out your puzzle pieces. Follow the puzzle piece template you’ve drawn or glued to the cardboard back and use your scissors to cut out the pieces. When you’re finished, gently erase any remaining pencil marks on the backs of the puzzle pieces. [9] X Research source To make it easier, don’t cut out pieces individually. Rather, cut entire rows or columns at a time following every curve, then go back and cut out the individual pieces. If you printed on sticker paper and own a Cricut machine , you can use it to cut the image using a puzzle template as the saw path. [10] X Research source Store your puzzle in a resealable plastic bag so you don’t lose track of the pieces."

      "title": "Prepare your plywood by sanding and staining it.",
      "content": "Prepare your plywood by sanding and staining it. Use a piece of 6 millimetres (0.24 in) thick plywood that’s the height and width you’d like your puzzle to be. Sand the plywood with 120- to 220-grit sandpaper . Cover the back and edges with two coats of spirit stain to stain them . [11] X Research source Ensure you’re working in a well-ventilated area so you don’t inhale stain fumes or wood dust. Protect work surfaces with old newspapers, cutting mats, or wax paper."

    {
      "title": "Paint a design onto your plywood.",
      "content": "Paint a design onto your plywood. Remember, a more detailed design makes the puzzle more challenging to assemble when it’s split into pieces. Use acrylic paint or gouache paint and whatever paint brushes are suited to your design. Let your painted puzzle design dry overnight. [12] X Research source If you’d rather adhere a photo to the plywood than paint your own design, print out an image on printable sticker paper. Peel off the adhesive backing and stick it to the wood."

      "title": "Seal and finish the design using white polish and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "content": "Seal and finish the design using white polish and isopropyl alcohol. Again, work in a well-ventilated area or outdoors when sealing the wood . Apply an equal mixture of wood polish and isopropyl alcohol to the painted design using a microfiber wax applicator . Leave it to dry for 24 hours. Another option is to use oil-based polyurethane in a satin sheen and a natural bristle brush. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Trace a jigsaw puzzle template onto the back.",
      "content": "Trace a jigsaw puzzle template onto the back. Flip the plywood over so the design is face down. Use a printed or hand-drawn jigsaw puzzle template that has the same dimensions as the plywood. Either transfer the template using carbon paper that you trace over with a ballpoint pen or using printer paper and a black marker that bleeds through to the wood. [14] X Research source Trace along every curve in the jigsaw puzzle template. Make sure it’s thick enough to use as a guideline when you’re cutting it with your saw."

      "title": "Cut along the lines to separate rows and tape them together.",
      "content": "Cut along the lines to separate rows and tape them together. Wear protective gear like cut-proof gloves and safety goggles while cutting. Use a scroll saw or a similar tool to cut through the plywood, following the curves down the puzzle to separate it into rows. Then, tape them together so it’s easy to cut along the columns. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut along the opposite lines to separate the pieces from the rows.",
      "content": "Cut along the opposite lines to separate the pieces from the rows. Reset your plywood and cut along the remaining marker or pen lines (going perpendicular to the cuts you made earlier) to separate the individual puzzle pieces. Remove the tape when done. [16] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sand down the edges of the puzzle pieces.",
      "content": "Sand down the edges of the puzzle pieces. While it may take time to sand down every edge, it’ll prevent splinters and ensure they fit together perfectly. Use 120- to 220-grit sandpaper to smooth the edges of every piece. Finally, gather your pieces into a plastic bag or box to keep them together until it’s time to assemble. [17] X Research source After sanding, consider staining or painting the edges of the pieces with a fine-tipped paintbrush to make them more aesthetically pleasing."
