      "title": "Don’t go after a friend’s ex or crush.",
      "content": "Don’t go after a friend’s ex or crush. This is a big one—the idea is that your friendships are sacred, so you should try not to let a guy come between them. When someone dates a friend’s ex or crush, the pain it causes can be immense. That’s why this rule is so important to girl code: if you want to prioritize your friends and forge deep bonds, you should do your best not to hurt them (and if you date someone they’re emotionally invested in, you’ll almost certainly wound them). [1] X Research source If you feel yourself crushing on a friend’s crush, don’t pursue something with them right away—talk to your friend first: “I think I have feelings for Otto, too. You’re my first priority, so I wanted to talk it through with you.” With friend’s exes, talking with your friend is also super important. Make sure they're completely over their ex and are okay with it if you make a move. If they aren't, the more you reinforce the idea that this person is off-limits in your mind, the more likely you are to keep acting respectfully. If you struggle, remind yourself of how your friend would feel if you betrayed them."

      "title": "Keep your friend’s secrets.",
      "content": "Keep your friend’s secrets. Trust is a big part of deep female friendships. You want to make sure that your pal always feels comfortable sharing things with you, even the things that make them feel vulnerable. So when they tell you confidential information, don’t talk about it with anyone else. When someone shares a friend’s secret, it’s sort of like saying: I care more about having an interesting gossip sesh than I do my relationship with you. [2] X Research source Get permission before you share their secret with anyone, even your partner or your bestie (I know, it's hard to keep things from your bestie, but you don't want to hurt your friend). Talk explicitly about who you can share things with and don’t make assumptions. That way, there’s no room for miscommunication! Whether she’s got a secret crush, an embarrassing story, or a hidden talent, keep it to yourself if you want to respect girl code!"

      "title": "Be honest with her—always.",
      "content": "Be honest with her—always. It can be so hard to share tough truths with people we love, but girl code demands it! The whole idea is: wouldn’t you want to know? If you had salad in your teeth, you’d probably want to know. If the last outfit you tried on was cuter, you’d want to know. Even if it might cause you to shed a tear, you’d want to know if your crush was into someone else. So when you have info your bestie needs to hear, be sure to share it. [3] X Research source If you know that your friend’s partner has done something bad or disloyal, tell her. It can be so hard to know that you’re saying something that’ll hurt her, but she’d much rather hear it from you than find out later on. As long as you’re careful with your words and very gentle, then the truth can set her free. Just be sure to be as respectful as possible when you talk to her ."

      "title": "Stand up for your friend when people cross her.",
      "content": "Stand up for your friend when people cross her. Loyalty is a big part of being a great friend. You may not be a super confrontational person, but in general, defending a pal against her haters is a girl-code requirement. If some dude cheated on her, feel free to let him know he was disrespectful. If a girl is talking behind her back, tell her to can it. It can be scary, but if you love your friend, you’ll want people to treat her with respect. [4] X Research source When you defend your friend, focus on protecting her, not shaming others. So rather than name-calling and shouting, just tell the other person why what they’re doing sucks and that they should stop. “Hey, why are you gossiping about Leah? She’s one of my best friends, and that’s not cool. Cut it out.”"

      "title": "Don’t try to outshine her—boost her confidence instead.",
      "content": "Don’t try to outshine her—boost her confidence instead. Insecurity can make people do crazy things, including competing with people they care about. If a person feels bad about their looks, intelligence, or personality, they might feel a strong need to be better than the people around them (including close girlfriends!). But if you want to abide by girl code, you’ll avoid this at all costs. True friends don’t tear you down—they do whatever they can to uplift you. [5] X Research source Take flattering photos of your pal when she looks amazing and hype her up constantly: “Oh my god, girl. You look incredible in that dress!” When she talks bad about herself, be a voice of reason: “You’re not annoying! You’re like, the most lovable person I’ve ever met.”"

    {
      "title": "Support her decisions, but make sure she knows her worth, too.",
      "content": "Support her decisions, but make sure she knows her worth, too. You know the age-old question: should you really support everything that your friends do? On the one hand, you want to respect her decisions and make sure she feels like you’re on her side. On the other hand, it can be tough to watch your bestie accept romances, friendships, and jobs that aren’t on her level. So to follow girl code, you should strike a balance. [6] X Research source Make sure she knows that whatever decision she makes, you’ll always cheer her on: “I’m here for you no matter what. If you really like him, then I’ll try to, too.” But on the other hand, be honest about what she deserves: “You’re a really special person, and you deserve someone loyal, so I don’t like that Thomas lied to you.” This does not extend to abusive relationships. If you’re worried that a friend is being hurt by her partner, reach out to a professional for more help."

      "content": "Be there when she’s going through something tough. Girl code doesn’t leave room for fair weather friends! True friends aren’t just there for the parties and nights at the club—they’re there when life gets tough, too. If your pal goes through a breakup, loses a friendship, or endures a rough patch, make sure that you’re there to support her . After all, that’s exactly the kind of friend behavior you deserve in return, too! [7] X Research source Ask how you can support her. By asking what can you do, you’re reminding her that she can count on you. Just be there. Sometimes, talking is too much. Even just your comfortable presence can make tough times bearable. Don’t underestimate that! Lighten her mood. She might just want to get her mind off things. Try cracking a joke, showing her a funny video, or telling her a story. Remind her of her worth . Sometimes, big events can shake our sense of self. If it seems like she’s struggling, remind her that she’s an amazing person."

If you end up catching feelings for someone close to your friend, make sure to run it by her first. Whether it’s her sibling, her pal, or her coworker, you dating someone who's ingrained in your friends life can be complicated. So if you acknowledge that fact and respect her enough to talk it through, it’ll show how much you care. [8] X Research source “Hey, so I have to talk to you about something. Lately, when we’ve been hanging out with DeShawn, I’ve been having some feelings. Can we talk about that?”"

      "content": "Protect fellow girls when other people are creepy or unkind. This one relates to all girls, not just close friends. If you want to follow girl code, do your best to save others from stressful situations with guys. Maybe you notice that a guy just won’t leave a girl alone at the bar, but her body language is clearly saying I’m not interested. Here comes you to the rescue! You can always glide up to her side, pretend that you know her, and find a reason to go somewhere else: “Hey girl! Did you want to use the bathroom?” [9] X Research source Of course, if you get the sense that there’s a serious safety concern at play, then you shouldn’t insert yourself into the danger. Instead, call into your local authorities ASAP or find someone close by working security."

There are so many things that make being a girl in today’s world difficult. Why add to that for anyone else? Even if someone isn’t exactly your cup of tea, avoid actively gossiping , lying, or insulting anyone unless they’ve done something bad to you (or a fellow friend!). Respond carefully when other people gossip: “Oh, interesting. I don’t know her well enough to weigh in myself, but I hear what you’re saying.” For bonus points, find reasons to compliment random girls you meet. A quick “I love your shoes!” or “You’re so fun!” can make someone’s year!

      "content": "Girl code can help you create deeper, more respectful friendships. Why exactly did “girl code” come to be? The idea is that if girls stick together, they can find true friendship, respect, and community. And by truly honoring and prioritizing your friendships, you can be someone with a big circle of great friends. Romances may come and go, but friendships can be forever—girl code can help you make that happen! [10] X Research source A lot of “girl code” rules are designed for close friendships, but you can use them in your relationships with anyone. You might decide that you want to follow girl code for all of the girls you know, even if you’re not that close. It’s totally up to you!"

      "content": "Big things, like true love and toxic friendships, can eclipse girl code. Is it ever okay to break girl code? That’s up to you. Generally speaking, these “rules” were designed to help foster more respect and companionship between women. But even if someone isn’t respecting you, it might not make sense to stop being a considerate friend. It might also make sense to break girl code if you have serious feelings for someone who, by these standards, would be off limits. [11] X Research source Even if your friend doesn’t follow girl code with you—maybe she lies to you, shares your secrets, and tries to compete with you—you should still stick to it. She's already tarnishing her reputation and proving herself untrustworthy, why would you want to paint yourself in that light as well? If she is being rude , speak up, but ultimately take the high road: leave the catty drama game in middle school. If you fall in love with your friend’s crush or ex, that’s a tricky situation. Opinions vary here, and ultimately, you’ll have to go with what feels right to you. Close friendships should never be thrown away lightly, and you should always do your best to protect the feelings of those you care about. On the other hand, true love is serious business! If you end up having feelings for a friend’s ex or crush, we suggest you think really carefully about how you want to proceed. And no matter what choice you make, talk to your friend before you take action of any kind. Remember that girl code is subjective: you and your friends may have some additional unspoken codes, but for the most part, \"girl code\" is just girl-specific common courtesy! If a friend is thinking of harming herself or others, break girl code and TELL SOMEONE, especially (but not exclusively) if you are a minor. Your friend may feel upset at first, but as you may have heard in the past, potentially saving her or someone else from serious trouble (or physical harm) is worth it!"
