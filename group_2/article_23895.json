Use emojis to showcase your favorite things, list your attributes like ingredients to a recipe, or reference a beloved song. This type of bio is perfect for a personal or blog-style Instagram. Here are some examples: Sometimes silly, sometimes salty, but mostly a good time. Dog lover 🐶 Strawberry connoisseur 🍓 Festival goer 🎡 This isn’t a photo feed. It’s a portal into my life. Alexa, play “Peaches” by Jack Black. When Hagrid said, “You’re a wizard, Harry,” I felt that. I’m a spoonful of sugar with a bit of wild on the side 🤪 I live on the edge (of glory). A chaotic blend of cat photos. You’re welcome. The One Where I Post a Photo As Taylor Swift once said, welcome to New York (via my feed)🏙️ In a world of worriers, be a warrior.

I’ll let the pictures do the talking 😜 Faking it (and posting about it) until I make it. I put pineapple on my pizza. Yeah, I’m a rebel. I’m so strong I make onions cry. Humble with a hint of Kanye. ⚠️Caution: Posts may be highly cringey. Follow at own risk.⚠️ It took me an hour to write this bio. Making history…or maybe just good excuses. Don’t let the filters fool you. In real life, I’m just as beautiful 😉 You’ve come for good content? Let me know when you find it. I’m still looking. I’m as useful as the “g” in lasagna. A life? Sweet! Where can I download one of those? Too busy to update this bio. Instagram bio currently loading… Life isn’t perfect, but your photos can be 🤪"
