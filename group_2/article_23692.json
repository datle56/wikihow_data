      "content": "Discuss your weight loss goals with your doctor. Before making changes to your habits, talk to your doctor about the health benefits of brown fat and the best way for you to increase it. They can help you develop a diet and exercise plan that is right for you. Tell them what your plan is - for instance, \"I'd like to use a cooling vest daily to increase my brown fat,\" - so they can caution you if your plan is risky for you. Your doctor might refer you to a specialist like a dietitian or physical therapist."

[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This technique is not particularly pleasant, but can be effective because brown fat production is stimulated by cold temperatures. Try to spend time daily in an environment that is between 14-19°C, or 57-66°F. If you live in a cool climate, try taking a walk outside for a while each day. Dress warmly enough to stay safe, but limit layers so that your body cools down. Stay warm enough so that you’re not shivering. Sit in an air-conditioned room in summer clothing for two hours a day.
