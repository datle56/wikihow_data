      "content": "File your nails in one direction only. Choose a fine-grit nail file, as it will be kinder to your nails. Start from one outside edge on your nail and move across the nail in that direction. Don't go back and forth, as that can ruin the edges of your nails. [3] X Research source To keep from overdoing it, place the edge of the file under the tip of your nail so you can see what you're doing."

Simply paint on a coating of nail hardener like you would nail polish, moving from the nail bed up to the tip of the nail. Allow the hardener to dry and re-apply as needed. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can find nail hardeners at most drugstores and big box stores. They may also be labeled as \"nail strengtheners.\" Some people find nail hardeners work a little too well, making nails more likely to break. If that's the case for you, try just wearing a clear base coat of nail polish instead. [10] X Research source"

You can also eat nuts, sweet potatoes, spinach, and broccoli to get enough biotin. [12] X Research source If you're over 18, aim for 30 micrograms of biotin a day. A single egg contains 10 micrograms of biotin, while a pork chop or hamburger patty has 3.8 micrograms and 3 oz (85 g) of salmon has 5 micrograms. With nuts and seeds, 1 ounce (28 g) of sunflower seeds has 2.6 micrograms while the same amount of almonds has 1.5 micrograms. If you feel like you're not getting enough biotin in your diet, ask your doctor if a supplement is a good idea for you.
