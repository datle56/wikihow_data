      "title": "He ignores you, but doesn’t cut you off completely.",
      "content": "He ignores you, but doesn’t cut you off completely. Dating coach Erika Kaplan calls this “submarining,” when he’s not really in your life, but keeps popping back up to the surface. Maybe he still hangs out with your friends, or you still see him at places you used to go together. If he keeps showing up, even if he doesn’t make a move, there might still be a connection. This depends on the circumstances. If it’s a small town, he might just not have many other options. If you keep seeing him in unlikely places, though, there’s a better chance he’s still hanging on."

    {
      "title": "He interacts with your social media.",
      "content": "He interacts with your social media. “If they're peeking at your social media or are liking your posts, that kind of stuff, it shows that there's still keeping tabs on your life and how you spend your time,” says Kaplan. Does he like your posts? Does he view your stories? Does he still follow you, and doesn’t have you blocked? He’s probably still into you, and won’t admit it. On the other hand, if he’s blocked you on everything and never responds, he’s probably keeping his distance. Or, if he’s expressing how much he’s hurting on social media, or how much he misses you, that’s an pretty big sign he's regretting the fight."

    {
      "title": "He still contacts you for seemingly no reason.",
      "content": "He still contacts you for seemingly no reason. Dating coach Lisa Shield says that if your ex calls or texts you, like “for advice,” they’re probably not over you. Usually, it feels like he doesn’t actually have a reason, or has a bad excuse for getting in touch, like he “just wants to check in.” It probably means he still has feelings. That said, exes do often have to contact each other for necessary reasons. If he’s texting to ask when he can come get his stuff, for example, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything."
    },
    {
      "title": "He acts possessive or jealous when you talk to other guys.",
      "content": "He acts possessive or jealous when you talk to other guys. Clinical psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz says “it’s pretty natural to feel jealous,” especially after a fight or breakup. It’s a sign that he still wants you, and doesn’t want someone else to have you. If he sees you with other boys, does he get moody? Does he ask you about who you’re hanging out with? Does he criticize your friends or new romantic interests? It’s not very mature, but it’s a good sign he’s jealous ."
    },
    {
      "title": "He tries to make you jealous.",
      "content": "He tries to make you jealous. Dr. Schewitz says that couples, especially exes, tend to try to make each other jealous to get back at each other after a fight. But wanting to “get back” at you means you’re still on his mind, and in some way, you still matter to him. After all, he still wants to impress you. If he didn’t care, he’d drop out of your life altogether. For example, he might purposefully bring up someone new he’s seeing, or brag about himself and his accomplishments."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s hot and cold.",
      "content": "He’s hot and cold. After a fight, you’ve both probably got a lot of mixed up emotions. But if the fight is really the final straw, he’ll act like it. On the other hand, if he’s cold and distant one moment, and calm or even affectionate the next, it means he’s still making up his mind, and there’s a good chance he still wants you. One moment he might ignore you, then the next moment he might give you a gift or crack a joke. It’s confusing, but only because he’s confused, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "He asks other people about how you’re doing.",
      "content": "He asks other people about how you’re doing. Relationship coach Julia McCurley says that if he “asks mutual friends about you,” then he still has feelings. It means he still cares and thinks about you , and wants to know about your life, but doesn’t want to ask you directly and is hiding his feelings . So instead, he takes a less direct approach to get his intel. Wait for a friend or family member to mention it. It’s tempting to ask them if he’s mentioned you, but then you’re the one giving signs that you still want him."

    {
      "title": "He seems open to your attention.",
      "content": "He seems open to your attention. If you try to contact him and he doesn’t totally ice you out, then that’s a great sign. It means he’s still open to reconnecting, and hasn’t just crossed you out altogether. Things can still be repaired, if you both play your cards right! [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He brings up old memories.",
      "content": "He brings up old memories. When he talks to you, he might reminisce on good times you had together. It’s his way of trying to get you to remember the good parts of the relationship, and to try to convince you to come back to him. Be careful, though, and ask yourself if those good times were worth all the other bad times. There’s a reason you fought in the first place."

      "content": "He reaches out first. Communication is key in any relationship. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If he’s ready and mature enough to realize this, he’ll reach out to you and start the process of mending things. It takes a lot of guts to set aside his dignity and reach out, so it’s a strong sign that he’s mature enough to move on. This goes both ways, though, and depends on the argument. If you also played a part in the fight, you might want to consider reaching out first, yourself.

      "title": "His apology is sincere.",
      "content": "His apology is sincere. A good apology doesn’t point fingers or make you even angrier. Instead, a good apology owns up to what he did wrong, acknowledges how it made you feel, and takes responsibility. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If he comes to you with a sincere and heartfelt apology, seems ready to be real with you, and understands what he did wrong, consider accepting his apology . If his apology is sarcastic or weak, or if he avoids taking responsibility for his role in the fight, it's a sign he doesn’t actually care or understand what he did wrong. (Hint: \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" isn't a real apology!)"

If he really wants to make the relationship a success, he’ll acknowledge what he did wrong, and he’ll make a plan to change things going forward. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Otherwise, the behavior will happen again, and you’ll just get caught in a vicious cycle. For example, if you had an argument about the way he flirts with other girls, he’ll apologize for it and assure you he’ll keep things casual and professional with other girls. Most importantly, he’ll follow through on his word, not just say something and then forget about it."

      "title": "He listens and respects your boundaries.",
      "content": "He listens and respects your boundaries. After a fight, things can feel pretty raw and sore. If he really wants what’s best for you, he’ll respect that, and he’ll respect you. [5] X Research source He won’t push you to take him back and he won’t try to shove his way back into your life. Instead, he’ll talk it out, and go at a pace that’s comfortable so you can build trust again. On the other hand, if he keeps blowing up your phone even after you’ve told him to stop, then he’s not mature enough for a real relationship."

      "title": "Ask yourself if the relationship can really be repaired.",
      "content": "Ask yourself if the relationship can really be repaired. Now you have to be honest with yourself, and this is the hardest part. Take stock of the relationship and ask yourself if you really want to try again . Maybe the fight was just one bump in what was an otherwise smooth relationship. In that case, it’s worth trying again. If the relationship is mostly fighting, though, it’s probably best to end things. [6] X Research source Ask yourself if this is a new problem, or an old one that keeps showing up, no matter how many times you try to tackle it. If he’s an ex, remind yourself of why the relationship ended in the first place, and keep in mind that old habits die hard."

      "title": "Tell him clearly what you want and need in a relationship.",
      "content": "Tell him clearly what you want and need in a relationship. Again, communication is key! Tell him what you expect moving forward, and be receptive to his own needs. Maybe you want more alone time, or maybe you want him to spend more time with you. Set boundaries, and let him know what you will and what you won’t tolerate. That way, you’re both on the same page.

      "content": "Take it slow, and don’t rush things. It can be tempting to dive back in and pick up where you left off, but that’s not always the best idea. After a fight, your relationship has changed, for better or worse, and it’s better to feel it out and get to know each other again. Go at your own pace, and take it easy. That way, you can get your bearings again without falling into the same traps as before. [8] X Research source For example, you might decide to go back to the “dating” phase, or to stay away from each others’ homes until you’re more confident that things will work out this time."

If you really want to be with him, but aren’t sure how to fix those problems on your own, consider talking to a relationship counselor or therapist, who can guide you through your relationship issues and come up with strategies for having a healthy relationship moving forward.
