      "title": "Think carefully about the divorce.",
      "content": "Think carefully about the divorce. Is divorce necessary, or are there still other things you can try to repair the relationship? Think long and hard about who is going to be affected—your children; your families; yourselves? In Islam, divorce is a last resort if it is not at all possible to continue a marriage. When a marriage is falling apart, both spouses should try their best to bring the relationship back together . Licensed marriage and family therapist Jin S. Kim agrees that couples should evaluate their relationship and try their best to reconcile . Kim says, “The most important aspect of building and maintaining a healthy intimate relationship is to work on healthy communication.” Communicate with your spouse about your feelings, needs, and why you think things are not working out. Perhaps your partner is particularly stressed or upset about something, thus leading to negative behavior that affects the relationship. Find forgiveness and patience for your partner. Try to focus on their good qualities and accept their minor flaws or habits that annoy you. Remember the good things about your spouse and marriage. Try to rekindle the relationship by reminiscing together, spending quality time together, and going on dates. [1] X Research source According to the Sunnah, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, “The most hated of permissible things to Allah is divorce” [Sunan Abi Dawud 2177]. While divorce is allowed, it is not something you should rush into without thinking. If you think divorce is the only option after evaluating the marriage, speaking with your spouse, and trying to mend the relationship, move on to the next step."

      "content": "Get arbiters from both sides of the family to mediate. The Qur'an says, \"If you anticipate a split between them, appoint a mediator from his family and another from hers. If they desire reconciliation, Allah will restore harmony between them. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware\" [Surah An-Nisa, 4:35]. [2] X Research source A marriage affects the whole family, and it is vital for elders from both spouses’ families to attempt to reconcile the relationship. [3] X Research source Some people are reluctant to get their family involved, says Kim. In this case, you can speak to an independent marriage counselor, although they are detached from the issue. Whether you work with your families or a marriage counselor, the mediators will help you and your spouse communicate, resolve your issues, and find a solution for moving forward. If you still believe divorce is the best option after working through mediation, move on to the next step. Reader Poll: We asked 331 wikiHow readers how they planned to inform their wife about their decision to leave, and only 5% of them said they’d use a mediator or therapist to facilitate the conversation. [Take Poll] However, it might be the best way to move forward."

      "content": "File for divorce. The divorce process is different depending on whether the husband or wife initiates it. [4] X Research source In Islam, Kim says there is a 3-month waiting period before the divorce is finalized. Husband-initiated divorce, or talaq : The husband pronounces “Talaq” (“I divorce you”) with 2 witnesses present—it can be verbal or written, but it must be done once. The wife is able to keep the dowry, or mahr, with her. Wife-initiated divorce, or khula : The wife tells her husband that she wants a divorce, he consents, and she returns her dowry to end the marriage. If the husband refuses, she can petition a judge or imam for divorce. She must show proof that her husband has not fulfilled his marital responsibilities. Mutual divorce, or mubarat : The husband and wife mutually agree to dissolve the marriage. The wife pays the husband, but it doesn’t exceed the price of her dowry. Note : Depending on where you live, such as the US or Canada, a separate legal process of divorce involving hearings and legal decrees of divorce may be required. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Observe the waiting period of 3 months, called 'iddah.",
      "content": "Observe the waiting period of 3 months, called ' iddah . The Qur'an says, \"O Prophet! Instruct the believers: When you intend to divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period, and count it accurately...Do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct...Then when they have almost reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or separate from them honorably. And call two of your reliable men to witness either way—and let the witnesses bear true testimony for the sake of Allah\" [Surah At-Talaq, 65:1-2]. [6] X Research source The wife has the right to remain in the family home during ‘iddah , and the husband is responsible for her well-being. If the wife finds out she’s pregnant during ‘iddah , the waiting period continues until she gives birth to her child. [7] X Research source The purpose of ‘iddah is to allow the couple to cool down, think about their marriage, and potentially decide to reconcile one last time. [8] X Research source For talaq : The couple is free to resume their relationship and end the divorce process at any time during ‘iddah. They don’t have to complete a new marriage contract. For khula or mubarat : The husband cannot take back the wife during ‘iddah . However, the wife can take back her dowry or payment and then the husband can take her back."

      "title": "Decide who gets custody of any children.",
      "content": "Decide who gets custody of any children. Islam requires that the custody must go to a Muslim who is in good health physically and mentally and can meet the children's needs. Some judges allow older children to state their preferences, while others award custody to the mother if the children are under a certain age and to the father if they are older. [9] X Research source The main concern must be that the child is cared for by a responsible parent who can meet the needs of the child. Talk with your spouse about who should have primary custody and how you’ll split parenting time. If you can’t reach an agreement together, work with a divorce mediator or family lawyer to come to an agreement. Scott Levin, divorce mediator and family lawyer, highly recommends hiring a mediator to navigate custody and other negotiations. He says they can help “you work together to figure out solutions.” Stay in communication with your spouse during the divorce process. Clinical psychologist Dr. Asa Don Brown says communication helps “make the process of separation and divorce less divisive.” If you avoid it, that will often “only intensify negative feelings and emotions.” If your spouse is being difficult, Levin says “the best thing you can do is make everything about the business of the divorce in your interactions.” He suggests that you “keep the emotion outside the room, keep your responses short,” and “keep it about the kids.”"

      "title": "Finalize the divorce after the 'iddah.",
      "content": "Finalize the divorce after the ' iddah . Once ‘iddah is over, the divorce is considered final. It’s encouraged that you record and finalize the divorce in the presence of 2 witnesses. After this, the wife leaves the husband’s home and is free to remarry. [10] X Research source It is discouraged to have a yo-yo relationship with your (ex)spouse—in other words, don’t go back and forth about getting together again and separating. Don’t engage in blackmail or try to guilt them into either decision, either. It’s advised that you end the marriage cleanly and amicably. As the Quran says, “When you divorce women and they have almost reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or let them go honorably. But do not retain them only to harm them or to take advantage of them. Whoever does that surely wrongs his own soul” [Surah Al-Baqarah, 231]."

      "content": "Financial settlements or custody payments must be made post-divorce. If the wife is owed her dowry or any other payments agreed upon during the divorce process, the husband must give them to her. Likewise, the wife must return her dowry or any other payments if she initiated the divorce. If the wife has custody of any children, the husband is typically responsible for financially supporting them ( nafqa ) in some way (i.e., paying for living expenses, education, etc.). [11] X Research source The husband is usually only responsible for financially supporting the wife during ‘iddah . Once the divorce is finalized, he doesn’t have to. However, depending on the divorce settlement, he might be required to continue to support her."

      "content": "Irreconcilable differences and ignoring marital responsibilities Allah understands that not all marriages can work out and sometimes, divorce is the best course of action for the couple to be healthy and at peace. Therefore, common reasons for divorce include: [12] X Research source Irreconcilable differences : The couple is incompatible and clashes over their values, goals, personalities, and relationship expectations and there’s no way to resolve their differences. Not fulfilling marriage duties : One or both spouses are unwilling to respect and care for their partner, support them (financially, emotionally), and be intimate with them. Infidelity : Infidelity is considered a sin and breaks down the marital contract. The Quran says “And do not go near adultery; it is truly a shameful deed and an evil way” [Surah Al-Isra, 17:32]. Neglect : This includes emotional, financial, and physical neglect (not engaging in intimacy). Abuse : This includes physical, emotional, and sexual abuse."
