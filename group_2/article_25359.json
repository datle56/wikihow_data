      "content": "Understand that mental illness is not your fault. Society often stigmatizes mental illness and those who suffer from it, and it can be easy to believe that the reason you have problems is because you're worthless or not working hard enough. This is not true. If you do have a mental illness, it is the result of a health condition, not personal failings or anything else. A good medical or mental health professional should never make you feel as though you're to blame for your illness, and neither should other people in your life -- or yourself."
