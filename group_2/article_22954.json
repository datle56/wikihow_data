      "content": "The effects of cord cutting on the other person can vary. A cord cutting ritual is primarily about releasing your own energetic attachments to someone when a relationship is no longer serving you. [1] X Research source As a result, you’ll probably notice more effects than the other person will. However, since cord cutting rituals empower you to withdraw your energy from this person, they may be able to sense this shift. [2] X Research source This can cause different emotional reactions, including: Confusion: The other person may have expected that you would always be there, no matter how unhealthy or toxic the relationship was. When you actually start to withdraw, they might feel disbelief or confusion at first. Loss or emptiness: Once they understand that you’re serious about ending your connection, they may start to grieve your presence in their life. They may also feel like there’s an empty space where your energy used to be. [3] X Research source Relief or closure: After a period of time, the other person may start to feel a sense of liberation, especially if you were stuck in a toxic cycle with them before you cut ties. They might feel like you’re both being released from an unhealthy situation in order to get a fresh start. [4] X Research source"

At first, this may cause the other person to feel some sense of loss or confusion, but it won’t cause them any physical or spiritual harm. A cord cutting ritual isn’t a hex and doesn’t have negative connotations—it’s a positive ritual that’s meant to help you let go (for both of your sakes)."

If you’re in an unhealthy or toxic relationship with someone , you may have an energetic “cord” keeping you tethered to them. The aim of a cord cutting ritual is to help you sever the tie between you and this person, so you can release your emotional attachments to this relationship, stop the energy flow between you, and finally move on. [5] X Research source Many people perform cord cutting rituals to help them get over break-ups, but the rituals can also be performed when other types of relationships have ended. For example, a cord cutting ritual could be beneficial if you’re leaving a toxic job, ending an unhealthy friendship, or trying to break free from negative habits in your personal life.

There are a few different ways you can cut cords with someone or something, but one of the most popular rituals involves tying together two candles (one to represent you and one to represent the other person) with a piece of string or twine, then lighting the candles. [7] X Research source Here’s what you’ll need: Two candles: Black chime candles (shorter candles made for spells) are ideal if you can find them, since they represent protection and banish negative energies. If you can’t find them, white candles are a good alternative—they symbolize purity, cleansing, and new beginnings. Two candle holders : To hold your candles upright as they burn.

For example, you could say something like, “I release this person from my heart,” or “As the candles burn and the cord is severed, I cut all ties to this relationship that no longer serves me.” [13] X Research source As your candles burn, the piece of string or twine will eventually catch fire and break the connection between the two candles. This represents the breaking of the energetic bond between you and the other person. Be sure to keep a close eye on your candles at all times while they’re lit to prevent any fire hazards, since they may spark as the flame reaches the string. Never leave your candles unattended. Once the string is severed, you can end your ritual, or you can wait until both candles have fully burned down."

This cord cutting spell can be performed with just one candle, and it’s a great alternative if you don’t want to perform the above ritual with two candles and twine. Here’s how to do it: Cleanse your space. Choose a quiet, peaceful location to perform your spell. To cleanse it, burn sage or palo santo or open a window to let in some fresh air. Set your intention. Think about your specific goal and condense it into one sentence. For example, “I cut ties with this person and release them from my heart,” or “With this spell, I sever my energetic bond to this relationship.” You can write this down to help you remember it, if you’d like. Dress your candle . This means rubbing an essential oil into the candle to prepare it for the spell. Since the intention of your ritual is to let go of something, rub the oil into the candle from the top downward. You can use any oil you like, but nutmeg and sesame oils are especially good for releasing spells. [14] X Research source Light your candle and speak your intention out loud. As you do this, visualize your energetic cord to this person being cut. [15] X Research source For example, you can picture the cord as an actual string, then imagine yourself cutting it with a pair of scissors. Snuff out the candle or let it burn out. At the end of your spell, don’t blow the candle out—this can blow away your intention. Instead, wait for the flame to extinguish on its own, or use a candle snuffer to put it out when you’re ready to conclude the ritual. [16] X Research source"

You can even attach a photo of you to one end of the string and a photo of them to the other end, if this helps with your visualization. Cut the string in the middle with your scissors. This symbolically represents the severing of your energetic cord, so that you can both move on. End the ritual.

Visualization, which is an important aspect of cord cutting rituals, also has several positive effects.
