      "title": "Pick iceberg, butter, or romaine lettuce to make a classic salad.",
      "content": "Pick iceberg, butter, or romaine lettuce to make a classic salad. These options are great because they add a crunch to your salad and they contain some vitamins and minerals, but they also won’t overpower your plate with any one particular flavor. Always rinse off lettuce before you use it. [1] X Research source Use a salad spinner to rinse and dry your lettuce, or simply run the leaves under water and gently pat them dry with a clean paper towel. You can buy pre-cut lettuce from the store, or you can buy whole bunches of lettuce. If you buy a bunch, rinse off the leaves and either tear them into bite-sized pieces by hand, or use a clean knife and cutting board to chop them up."

      "title": "Pick leafy kale, arugula, or spinach for a flavorful, nutrient-dense base.",
      "content": "Pick leafy kale , arugula , or spinach for a flavorful, nutrient-dense base. If you’re looking for a salad base that’ll have more antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, look for greens that are darker in color. Kale, arugula, purslane and spinach are all great options that will create a hardy base for the rest of your salad ingredients. [2] X Research source Arugula has a peppery flavor. Raw kale can be tough to chew. Use baby kale for a softer option, or cut away and discard the stems from kale leaves to make them easier to eat."

      "content": "Make a cabbage slaw for a crunchy, colorful base for your salad. Use red and green cabbage. Buy pre-sliced bags from the store, or use a knife and cutting board to chop up the cabbage into 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) slices. Toss the slaw in a vinegar-based dressing, or simply leave it plain and add in the other salad ingredients. [3] X Research source The most common cabbages are the cannonball cabbage and the red cabbage, but you can also use bok choy, napa cabbage, savoy cabbage, and January king cabbage.

You could also incorporate shaved Brussels sprouts or even radishes, just depending on what you have in your fridge."

      "content": "Put fresh or dried fruits onto your salad for a sweet flavor. Berries, apples, oranges, dried cranberries, raisins, watermelon, grapes, mango, and even avocado make wonderful, sweet additions to your salad. Plus, they are full of antioxidants! If you’re using fresh berries or fruits without a peelable skin, make sure to rinse them before adding them to your salad.

From a simple vinaigrette to a creamy Caesar, don’t be afraid to try your hand at making salad dressings. [7] X Research source Write down your recipes if you create your own from-scratch mixtures! That way you’ll be able to replicate them easily in the future. Try making a red wine vinaigrette by combining 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of red wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of honey, 1 cup (240 mL) of olive oil, and salt and pepper.
