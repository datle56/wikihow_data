      "content": "Get some good, flat, open wrenches. Make sure they are in sizes 13mm and 15mm. Those are the most common sizes. No other size wrench will work, but any type of adjustable wrench will do for the locking nut."

      "content": "Put the flat wrench on the bearing cone between the hub and the locking nut. Put the adjustable wrench on the locking nut. Hold the bearing cone in place and unscrew the locking nut. The best position to do this is hunched over the wheel while it sits on the ground. Whatever you do, do not open the cones at all while in this position. Just unlock it so you can unscrew everything with your fingers later. [1] X Research source Some hubs requires thin wrenches for this step, due to limited space between the locking nut and the cassette housing for example."

      "content": "Grab the axle on the side that is still locked in place and point the end that you've just loosened, up. Now it is time to unscrew the locking nut almost completely off the axle. Next, unscrew the bearing cone to expose the wheel bearings to the light of day. Any grease in there? [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Re-grease.",
      "content": "Re-grease. The fast way to re-grease your bearings is by just shooting grease in the bearings, screwing the cone back in, flipping the wheel over, hold the cone of the bearing you've just greased, grab the axle now facing up, unscrew it to reveal the other side's bearings and pack them with grease. But the proper way is by taking everything off, clean all the cones, hub cups, bearings, and repack with grease. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Reassemble.",
      "content": "Reassemble. Screw the bearing cone back into place, but not too tight. Bearings should be able to roll smoothly without axle play. Tighten the lock nut into place and check again."
