      "content": "Include protein in every meal. Eating high-quality protein is important to your nutrition in general, and vital to keeping albumin levels up. As a rule of thumb, make sure you have at least one high-protein serving in every meal. Lean beef, pork, and eggs are all good options, as are fish, chicken, and turkey. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In a 3 ounce (85 gram) single-serving portion, a lean beef burger contains 21 grams of protein, chicken breast contains 26 grams, cooked cod or salmon contains 19-22 grams, and ground pork contains 22 grams. [3] X Research source If you prefer not to eat meat, getting enough protein can be especially challenging. For advice about choosing the protein sources that will be best for you, talk to a dietitian. Be sure to eat dialysis-friendly proteins if you are on dialysis. These include lean beef, lean turkey, chicken, pork chops, eggs, fish, meat substitutes, tofu, and protein powders.

[6] X Research source You are also more likely to have a strong appetite when you first wake up. Try including nutritious foods like peanut butter, cheese, or eggs into your morning meal. [7] X Research source A large egg contains about 12.5 grams of protein. [8] X Research source It’s also important to consider egg whites, which are a great source of albumin.

      "content": "Get more protein if you accidentally miss a meal. It’s very important to avoid skipping meals. Strive to eat small frequent meals to maintain your energy levels. However, if you do miss a meal by accident, make sure to eat a larger portion of protein at your next meal. [11] X Research source Eating smaller meals may also be helpful if you have a hard time eating regular sized portions. A great between-meal or bedtime snack is cottage cheese. Try it with some fruit, or put it on some toast with peanut butter. [12] X Research source Cottage cheese is healthier than many other dairy products, as it is lower in potassium and phosphorus, which may pose a risk to those on dialysis with low albumin."

      "content": "Make high-protein smoothies. Smoothies are a quick, easy, and delicious way to get some extra protein. It’s best to use a liquid that is not high in phosphorus, so avoid cow’s milk. Almond milk or rice milk work well. Greek yogurt, pasteurized egg products, or protein powder add the protein. [13] X Research source Blend together with whatever fruit you favor. Ask a dietitian about what type of protein addition or supplement will be best for you. Both powdered and liquid forms are available. Note that a cup of Greek yogurt contains over 20 grams of protein. Smoothies made with Greek yogurt are especially good with granola blended in as well."

For instance, if you don’t eat meat, other forms of protein become especially important. [15] X Research source Your dietitian will help you identify high quality non-meat proteins. When selecting meat substitutes such as soy-based foods, be sure to choose options that are not too high in potassium, sodium, or phosphorus."

While specific nutritional drinks for those undergoing dialysis can be helpful, only rely on these as a significant component of your diet under the guidance of a dietitian. Meanwhile, protein bars can be helpful meal replacements, but should not make up the majority of your diet. [16] X Research source If you are on dialysis and selecting protein bars, choose those that have more than 15 grams of protein but less than 150 mg phosphorus and under 200 mg of both potassium and sodium."
