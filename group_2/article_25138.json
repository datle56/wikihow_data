Pull slowly upward, in a straight motion. Tweezers with wide tips may crush the tick or squeeze out infectious germs. Never use your bare hands. If you must touch the tick, wear disposable gloves.

      "title": "Wrap the tick tightly in tape.",
      "content": "Wrap the tick tightly in tape. Cover the tick with transparent tape on all sides. The tick will die on its own, and cannot get free. This is the best method to use, since the tick will be mostly undamaged. This makes it easy for a doctor to identify the tick, if you end up showing symptoms. You can use a sealed, clear container instead, such as a small zip-locked bag. Check for holes and make sure it is fully sealed."

Many of these can be dangerous for young animals, or for small children who play with the pet. Talk to a veterinarian first if possible. Use a treatment specifically for your pet's species (such as cat or dog). If small children or other pets are in the house, look for an oral medicine. Never use a treatment that contains an organophosphate. Check the ingredients for amitraz, fenoxycarb, permethrin, propoxur, and tetrachlorvinphos (TCVP). [4] X Research source"
