      "title": "Stand tall.",
      "content": "Stand tall. Your posture is the key to conveying your confidence. A slouched or hunched-over posture implies fear and a lack of self-assurance.

      "title": "Take up space.",
      "content": "Take up space. Walk around in an assertive manner while sticking out your chest and holding your head high. If you are standing, widen your stance by spreading your feet and bending your knees. Expanding your physical space makes you appear more powerful and confident, possibly shaking your opponent’s self-assurance. [3] X Research source Avoid standing with your feet closely together. This can make you appear fearful. Try crossing your arms across your chest. This makes you appear bigger and more intimidating. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak with a low tone.",
      "content": "Speak with a low tone. Lowering your vocal pitch conveys authority and confidence. High-pitched voices, on the other hand, convey nervousness and weakness.

    {
      "title": "Maintain eye contact.",
      "content": "Maintain eye contact. Look your opponent in the eye and avoiding breaking their gaze.

[6] X Research source Try looking at your opponent’s forehead if you are uncomfortable maintaining eye contact. This gives the appearance of eye contact without actually doing it."

      "content": "Maintain a calm demeanor.

This will convey to your opponent that you do not care and are an easy opponent."

      "title": "Wear powerful clothing.",
      "content": "Wear powerful clothing. For a competition where you are not wearing a uniform and get to pick your own attire, wear something that exudes confidence.

      "title": "Chat with your opponent.",
      "content": "Chat with your opponent. Let your opponent know that you are not intimidated by having a congenial conversation. Ask your opponent how they are doing and if they are excited for the competition. This is good sportsmanship and conveys to your opponent that you are not afraid of them.
