[1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Nail hardeners will help to prevent chips and breaks that force you to trim your nails back before they reach the desired length.

Reapply the nail hardener daily to keep your nails strong. Nail hardener should be used only as a temporary supplement to a more long-term nail health plan in which you improve the nail’s natural strength."

      "content": "Protect your nails from prolonged water exposure. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Letting your nails soak in water for too long — whether you’re doing the dishes or spending a lot of time in the swimming pool — can result in weak nails that have a tendency to split when they grow a little bit of length. That, in turn, results in having to trim them back more frequently. For longer nails, make sure to protect your nails from water by cutting down on exposure — wearing gloves while washing the dishes, for example."

      "title": "Eat a balanced diet",
      "content": "Eat a balanced diet . You already probably eat more than enough protein for your body, so unless you're protein-deficient (which, per the average U.S. diet, is highly unlikely), you don't need to add more protein to your diet to grow your nails. In fact, too much protein can cause obesity, accelerate kidney damage, and possibly cause diabetes. For strong nails, try to eat a wide variety of healthy foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products."

      "content": "Moisturize your hands and nails. Applying moisturizer to your hands and nails should be part of your nail hygiene routine. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Doing this can help to protect your nails from dryness, which may help them to grow stronger and longer. Try to apply a moisturizer to your hands and nails a couple of times per day or anytime your hands feel dry. Use a thick, creamy lotion, such as a hand lotion. When applying the lotion to your hands, take special care to massage it over the nails and into the cuticles. Be especially careful to apply lotion after you wash your hands, as soap removes natural protective oils from your nails and makes them more vulnerable to breakage."

      "content": "Clip away rough edges. If you notice a tear in a nail or frayed edge, then it is a good idea to clip it away with a pair of nail clippers before it becomes worse. A jagged edge might catch on something and cause you to lose part of the nail. Clip these edges as soon as you notice them to prevent them from becoming a problem. You can also file away less severe jagged edges on your nails."

      "title": "Take care of the cuticle.",
      "content": "Take care of the cuticle. The cuticle is the most important part of your nail, because it protects against infection. Cuticle damage (like cutting it or pushing it back without softening first) can damage your nail, which in turn will make the nail grow less quickly. [6] X Research source Softening the cuticle will make it easier to push the cuticle back without damaging it. Try soaking your fingertips in warm water with a little bit of soap to help soften them. Then use an orange tipped cuticle pusher to push them back. Massage your cuticles to maintain healthy blood flow in that area. While this won’t make your nails grow more quickly, it will strengthen the nail, keeping it healthier and stronger for a longer period of time. Avoid cutting your cuticles. This can lead to bleeding and it may also introduce an infection into your nails."

      "content": "Go for a round look when shaping your nails. Avoid filing your nails in the \"square\" look. Instead, go for a \"round\" or \"pointed\" look. \"Square\" nails tend to catch more on surfaces like clothing, which rips them and causes the nail to break more quickly. If you prefer the square look, then at least try to soften the edges so that your nails will be less likely to catch on things."
