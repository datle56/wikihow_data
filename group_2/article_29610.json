      "content": "Find a paperclip that is a minimum of 2.5 in (6.4 cm) long. Look around your home or office for a paperclip to use to make a phone stand. If possible, choose a paperclip that is covered in vinyl or plastic to avoid any accidental scratches to your phone. [1] X Research source Use a larger paperclip if you want to make a stand for a larger device such as a tablet."

      "title": "Bend the paperclip into thirds.",
      "content": "Bend the paperclip into thirds. Use pliers (or your hands) to create 2 bends in the straightened paperclip. Make each bend ⅓ away along the length of the clip and at a 90° angle. [3] X Research source Aim for the paperclip to look like 3 sides of a square, with 2 “legs” on either side of the middle section."

      "content": "Fold the tips of the paperclip up at a 90° angles. Position the pliers close to each end of the paperclip, about 1 in (2.5 cm) from either tip. Bend each tip upwards and toward you to create 2 corners that bend in the same direction. [4] X Research source This creates the \"feet\" of the phone stand that will prevent your phone from sliding forward."

Use pliers to fold the “legs” of the clip into right angles, bending the paperclip in the middle of each leg so that this section can rest flat on your work surface.

Position your phone horizontally on the stand with the back of your phone supported by the tall back of the stand.

Look around your home or office for a binder clip that is approximately 0.75 in (1.9 cm) in width and a second binder clip that is approximately 1.25 in (3.2 cm) in width. Bring the arms of both clips back so that they can be pressed together to open the clip. [7] X Research source This stand work best with binder clips of different sizes, but use 2 of the same size if that’s all you can find. While black binder clips are the most common, use colored binder clips if you want to make a bright phone holder which stands out."

Position a single arm of the small binder clip into the opening of the larger clip. Release the arms of the larger clip so that the smaller binder clip is clamped in place.

Place your phone horizontally over the small binder clip, resting the back of your phone against the larger binder clip. [9] X Research source Make 2 clip stands and position them 5–6 in (13–15 cm) from each other to support a tablet. Alternatively, use pliers to bend the handle of a single larger clip inward slightly, creating a lip to support your phone with just a single clip."

[15] X Research source Phones tend to range from 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) thick. It’s okay to eyeball this marking—it’ll work as long as it’s at least a bit larger than the width of your phone."

An expired loyalty card, hotel key card, or a gift card that you have already spent make ideal options. You won't be able to use the card again once you have turned it into a phone stand, so ensure that it’s one that you don't mind losing.

Then press down on the center of the card to make a crease that bends through the center of the card. [19] X Research source Bend the card around the edge of a ruler if you’re having difficulty.
