      "title": "Cut out a 9 by 3 in (22.9 by 7.6 cm) rectangle of stiff fabric.",
      "content": "Cut out a 9 by 3 in (22.9 by 7.6 cm) rectangle of stiff fabric. Choose a stiff fabric, such a felt, wool, linen, faux leather, or quilted cotton. This will create a bow tie that is about 4.5 by 3 in (11.4 by 7.6 cm). Measure and mark the fabric with a ruler and some chalk or a pen. Then, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut your fabric. [1] X Research source If you want a larger bow tie, cut a larger rectangle of fabric. Use a 3 to 1 ratio for length and width and make the length twice the desired length of the finished bow tie. For example, if you want your bow tie to be 6 by 4 in (15 by 10 cm), then cut out a fabric rectangle that is 12 by 4 in (30 by 10 cm)."

      "title": "Cut a 3 by 1 in (7.6 by 2.5 cm) strip of fabric for the center of the bow.",
      "content": "Cut a 3 by 1 in (7.6 by 2.5 cm) strip of fabric for the center of the bow. This length will work for most size bow ties because you only need to wrap it around the center of the bow tie. For a bow tie that is larger than 4.5 by 3 in (11.4 by 7.6 cm), start with these dimensions as a base. Then, add 1 in (2.5 cm) to the length and 0.5 in (1.3 cm) to the width. [2] X Research source For example, if you are making a bow tie that is 6 by 4 in (15 by 10 cm), then you might cut a strip of fabric that is 1.5 by 4 in (3.8 by 10.2 cm). Remember that you can always trim the strip down to suit your tie, but you cannot add fabric back on."

    {
      "title": "Fold the rectangle in half so that the short edges are lined up.",
      "content": "Fold the rectangle in half so that the short edges are lined up. Lay the rectangle out on a flat surface, and then fold 1 end of the rectangle over to the opposite end. Line up the edges of the rectangle and hold it in this position with 1 hand. [3] X Research source You can also place a weight on the tie to keep it folded if you need to do something else before continuing. However, do not use pins. They may damage the fabric and you will not be able to complete the bow tie with a pin in place."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze in the bow at the center.",
      "content": "Squeeze in the bow at the center. With your other hand, pick up the rectangle at the center and squeeze it in to create 3 even folds. The center should look like an accordion when you do this. There should be 3 distinct, even folds in the center of the tie. [4] X Research source Keep holding the tie at the center with 1 hand to keep it folded."

    {
      "title": "Glue the bow between the folds with a hot glue gun.",
      "content": "Glue the bow between the folds with a hot glue gun. Heat up the hot glue gun about 15 minutes before you plan to use it. When the glue gun is warmed up, loosen your grip on the center of the tie slightly to expose the area between the folds. Then, apply a dot of hot glue between the folds. [5] X Research source Continue to apply dots of hot glue into the areas between the folds to secure the center of the bow tie."

      "content": "Secure the strip of fabric around the center of the bow with hot glue. Take the strip of fabric and wrap it so that the short ends overlap on the back side of the bow tie. Then, apply a couple of dots of hot glue to the fabric to secure the 2 ends to the back of the bow tie and to each other. [6] X Research source If needed, you can cut off some of the excess material to get a better fit. This completes your bow tie! Attach it to your shirt collar with a safety pin through the backside of the bow tie."

      "title": "Choose a flexible print or color fabric for your bow tie.",
      "content": "Choose a flexible print or color fabric for your bow tie. Cotton works well for making a bow tie, but you can use any fabric you like as long as it is flexible enough to shape into a bow tie. Choose something in the color, texture, and weight of your choice. [7] X Research source You will need about ¼ of a yard of fabric and ¼ of a yard of iron-on interfacing. Purchase fabric from an online fabric store or a local craft store. You can also upcycle unwanted clothing from your own closet, such as an old, cotton dress shirt or skirt."

      "content": "Find and print a simple bow tie pattern. You can purchase a pattern from a craft store or download and print a free pattern from the internet. [8] X Research source Read reviews of the pattern to assess its quality. Also, make sure the pattern is equal to your skill level. The pattern you use will look like a long strip with a couple of wider, rounded spots after you cut it out. This will allow you to create a bow tie that you can actually tie, rather than a clip-on tie. [9] X Research source If you cannot find a tie pattern you want to use, then you can also use an existing tie to create a pattern. Place the untied fabric on a sheet of construction paper. Then, use a pen or pencil to trace the outline of the tie onto the paper. Trace around the edges of the tie leaving 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of extra space all around the edges of the tie. This will be your seam allowance."

      "content": "Cut the fabric and interfacing for your bow tie shape. Place the pattern piece on your folded fabric and insert a few pins through the pattern and fabric layers to secure them. Cut the fabric right along the outer edges of the pattern. Do not cut through the pattern or too far outside of the edges. Then, repeat this with the pattern piece on the folded interfacing. You should end up with 4 pieces of fabric that are the same size and shape."

      "content": "Iron the interfacing onto the fabric. Lay out 1 of your fabric bow tie pieces so that the wrong (back) side of the fabric is facing up. Then, place 1 of the interfacing pieces over the fabric piece. Line up the edges of the interfacing and fabric so that they are even. Run the heated iron over the interfacing to secure it to the fabric. [10] X Research source Repeat this for the other fabric and interfacing pieces."

Sew a straight stitch about 0.15 in (0.38 cm) from the raw edges on both of the long sides of the tie, but leave a 3 in (7.6 cm) opening in 1 side near the center part of the tie. Sew around the short end on 1 side of the tie as well. [11] X Research source You will invert the pieces after sewing them together."

Before you turn the tie inside out, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the excess fabric at the corners of the bow tie. Then, snip notches into the fabric along the curved part of the tie. This will make it easier to push the fabric out on the inside of the tie. [12] X Research source Make sure that you do not cut through the stitches you have made."

Use your fingers to push the material through the opening in the center of the tie. [13] X Research source To make it easier, try using the eraser end of a pencil to help you push 1 end of the tie through the opening in the tie and out the other side."

Sew a straight stitch about 0.15 in (0.38 cm) from the folded edge, or use a needle and thread to hand sew the opening closed. This will secure the open end of the bow tie. [14] X Research source If desired, you may also sew a straight stitch across the other short end of the tie so that the ends of the tie match each other."

Place the bow tie on a flat surface, such as an ironing board or over a towel on a table or counter. Then, run the heated iron over the fabric to flatten it out, especially along the seams. Make sure that the tie is free of bumps, creases, and wrinkles when you are finished. [15] X Research source If your tie is made from a delicate fabric, then you may want to place a t-shirt or thin towel over the tie before you iron it. Place your iron on its lowest setting as well."

Cotton works best, but you can use any lightweight fabric you want. Use your ruler to measure the fabric and mark where you need to cut it with a piece of chalk. Then, cut along the chalk lines to get the 2 pieces. [16] X Research source Make sure to cut the fabric carefully to avoid jagged edges."

Press the edges together to create a seam. [17] X Research source If desired, you may also sew a straight stitch about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the raw edge of the fabric to secure the edges together.

Then, apply a few dabs of hot glue to the areas between the folds and press the folds back together. Repeat this on both sides of the bow to secure the folds in the center.

Then apply another dab of glue onto the strip at the back of the bow, and press the other end into the glue.

Hold them together tightly for a minute to allow the glue to cool and bond with the fabric and clip. This will allow you to clip the bow onto the baby’s shirt, or use it as a cute hair clip. [23] X Research source You may also sew the bow onto a baby onesie or shirt with a needle and thread. Avoid using a safety pin to attach the bow as this may poke the baby if it comes undone. The baby may also try to put it into their mouth and this could result in injury."
