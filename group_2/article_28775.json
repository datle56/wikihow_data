      "title": "Reduce the flame to medium.",
      "content": "Reduce the flame to medium. Deep fry the onions on medium heat until they turn a golden brown. This should take about 10-20 minutes. While they are sizzling in the oil, gently mix the onions around to keep all of them coated, and to disperse the heat and oil evenly. If the flame is very high the onions will burn on the outside and remain watery on the inside."

      "content": "Take out the onions from the pan. Use a big, perforated spoon (a spoon with holes in it for drainage) to removes the onions from the pan once they are golden brown. You want a perforated spoon to drain out excess oil. Place the onions on a plate with a paper towel on it, to absorb the rest of the excess oil. Put the onions aside for later."

The bowl or pan needs to be big enough so there is enough room to mix the chicken in with the marinade, and have the marinade coat the chicken completely. Keep the chicken in big pieces, and on the bone. Keeping the chicken on the bone will create a stock once the chicken is being cooked, adding a nice, full flavor to the biryani."

Once the chicken is coated with all the spices and flavorings, let it marinade. There is a wide range of how long you can let the chicken marinade. You can marinade the chicken overnight to ensure the chicken absorbs all the flavors, or you can marinade it for less time. However, give the chicken a minimum of 4 hours to marinade to set in.

      "content": "Check the consistency of the rice. Since the rice should only be cooked half to a quarter of the way when you take it off the stove, the grains should be soft on the outside but still hard in the middle. This is because the rest of the rice gets cooked on dum (when you layer the chicken and rice, seal it with dough around the edges to lock in the steam, and put it on a very low flame). You can tell how cooked the rice is by taking a grain and pressing it with your fingers. The rice should break apart into pieces, but still have a hard texture to it. If it is soft and mushes in your fingers, you have cooked it too much. [4] X Research source"

If the dough is dry and isn't really mixing well, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of water. Knead the dough by pushing on it with your knuckles and heels of your hands. Make sure your hands are damp with water while doing this so the dough doesn't stick to your skin. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes to ensure it is fully mixed together."

On top of the rice, sprinkle on fried onions(approximately 2 tbsp), chopped coriander leaves(approximately 1tbsp), and mint leaves (approximately 8-10).

[10] X Research source You add the chapati dough to the edges of the lid, so when you turn the lid right side up, the dough seals the pot so the chicken and rice can steam cook together. Press lightly but firmly to make sure the lid is secure and tight. You can add a weight to the lid to ensure that it stays sealed, but usually if you use the dough, it is sealed good enough."

A lot of steam will come out so be careful not to burn yourself. Slowly stick a large spoon on the inside side of the hand and lift to get the bottom layers of the rice out.
