      "title": "Pick a color that is two or three shades darker than your own hair.",
      "content": "Pick a color that is two or three shades darker than your own hair. Pick one to three colors in a similar shade. Pay attention to the shade of your skin, working with colors that are cool or warm, depending upon your skin's natural color. Make sure you are using the same brand of dyes, to avoid timing confusion when you color. Blondes should try a deeper shade of blonde or a light brown. Most store-bought coloring advertises these shades as caramel, coffee and honey colors. Brunettes should choose rich brown and red shades. These may appear on the box as cinnamon or auburn. Brunettes with pale skin should avoid color that is too dark, as you need to compliment your skin tone. Choose gold or copper tones instead. Red heads should choose red shades. However, if your hair is dark, try golden brown or brunette tones. Black haired people should choose dark shades that are tinted with other colors, such as a blue-black color. Also, keep in mind that if your hair is black or very dark brown, then lowlights may not work for you."

      "content": "Perform an allergy test on yourself. This is recommended by most box colorants. Test the dye by placing a drop or two of it on a small area of your skin. Wait 10 minutes to see if you have a reaction. If the skin that the dye is on or near begins to turn red or bumpy, you are allergic to the dye and should not use it."

In order to protect against dye stains, cover the ground where you will be dyeing your hair, as well as any nearby surfaces, with newspaper. You should wear an old t-shirt that you don’t mind getting stained or a cape. It is a good idea to have paper towels nearby, just in case there is a dye spill."

If this is the case with your dye, mix it into the dye. If you are using multiple dyes, mix them all at once to make the dyeing process more efficient.

To do this, use a tail comb with a metal end to section off your hair for lowlights, just as you would for doing highlights. However, unlike highlights that are added to the top of your head, these will go at the bottom, so you will need to pin your hair up on top of your head if it is long. [2] X Research source It also helps to brush your hair thoroughly so that you do not have any tangles that make sectioning off the hair harder."

It will look more natural if they are varied. For a more noticeable look, plan your lowlights close together. Or, you can also “slice” hair sections for a bold look. For a more natural look, plan your lowlights further apart and weave them in. Blondes should avoid adding too many lowlights in the back of the hair, as these may not look natural, especially when they are exposed to direct sunlight."

Continue rinsing your hair until you can see anymore dye going down the drain. If post-dye conditioner did not come in your dyeing kit, purchase some at a beauty supply store. It should be a conditioner specifically made for dyed hair. Do not use normal shampoo and conditioner for at least 24 to 48 hours.
