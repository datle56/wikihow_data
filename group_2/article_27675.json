[1] X Research source With a Premium subscription, you'll earn 2x the sweatcoins for the same amount of steps, plus up to 100 sweatcoins per day. Premium members can also access special gift cards and offers in the marketplace.

Sweatcoin tracks your steps as long as it's running in the background. [2] X Research source You don't have to have the app open on the screen—just make sure you don't force-quit the app."
