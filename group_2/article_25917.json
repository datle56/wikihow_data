      "content": "Gather your materials. This trick works best with a playing card or business card. But it can also be performed with a dollar. Get some wax or a similar adhesive like clear double-sided tape, and thin string. [1] X Research source If you don't have a lot of time to prepare for this trick, or are going to levitate something like a dollar, wax is better to use as tape is harder to remove from the object. [2] X Research source The best type of string to use is an elastic string or thread which will easily stretch. You can find these threads in magic shops or online. You are going to attach one end of the string to the back of your ear and the other to your object. Make sure you cut the string so it's long enough to easily stretch from behind your ear to your finger. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Attach the string to the back of your ear.",
      "content": "Attach the string to the back of your ear. Using your wax or a piece of tape, fix one end of the string to your adhesive. Then stick it behind your ear. If you are using tape, place the tip of string on the tape, then wrap the string around the tape. Fold the tape over so that your string is firmly attached."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the other end of the string to be applied to your object.",
      "content": "Prepare the other end of the string to be applied to your object. Using the wax or a small piece of clear double-sided tape, connect it to the other end of the string. Attach this end of the string to one of your fingers so you can easily stick it to your object when you're ready. It's easiest to use the hand that is on the opposite side of where you placed the string behind your ear. For example, if you placed the string behind your right ear, use your left hand, and vice versa. Only apply the adhesive to one finger. Because you will be handling an object like a dollar or card, you want to keep most of your fingers free of wax. Doing this will allow you to hold the object without having it stick to your hand."

    {
      "title": "Discreetly place the other end of the string onto your object.",
      "content": "Discreetly place the other end of the string onto your object. If you are using a card, crumpled piece of paper, or a dollar you can transfer the string from your finger to the object as you explain that you can make the object levitate. This part can be a little tricky as the end of your string is sticking to your finger currently. Transfer the string and adhesive from your finger to the object. Hold the object in place with your free hand as you pull away with the hand that had the string. For example, if you are levitating a card, place the tip of the string with your tape or wax onto one side of your card. Slide your finger away to cause the string to stick to the card and not your finger. If you are levitating a crumpled up object such as paper or a dollar, Crumple the object around the string and adhesive. Then remove your finger. Make sure the string is now sticking to the object and not your hand."

      "title": "Use your hand to move the string up and down, levitating your object.",
      "content": "Use your hand to move the string up and down, levitating your object. With the hand which is on the same side of your body as your string, place the string between two of your fingers. Move your hand to catch the string making the object appear to float in the air between your hands. You can use your hand which is touching the string to manipulate your object's movements. Think of it like directing a puppet on strings. Place your other hand under your object to make it look like you are using the energy between your hands to make the object float."

    {
      "title": "Discreetly detach the string from your object.",
      "content": "Discreetly detach the string from your object. If someone gave you an object that you will return, such as a dollar, you need to detach it from the string. Uncrumple the object such as the dollar and as you do so, either pull the tape off or pull the string away if you used wax. If you did use wax, rub the area a bit to disperse the wax and wear down the adhesive property. Your audience will most likely not notice any leftover wax on the dollar. If you used tape, you will have to quickly peel the tape off your object."

      "content": "Get an elastic string known as a loop. You can also use any thin elastic string and make it into a loop yourself. You can purchase pre-made loops or create your own. It's essentially an elastic band. [4] X Research source If you make your own, simply tie two ends together into a small knot to form a loop. Start with your loop around your wrist like a bracelet. Or, if it feels more comfortable to you, position your loop around your index finger and the outside of your thumb. This is a great method for doing up-close street magic on the spot."

      "content": "Grab a dollar or other small light object. You can ask a spectator for a dollar and levitate it without much prep. Because your loop is so thin and light, you will need a light object that won't break the thread."

      "content": "Bring your free hand over and on top of the object. You can begin to rub your hands together around the object, and while you do so, get your finger under your loop. You want to grab the loop with your other hand and begin to stretch it. With the loop going around both hands you now have a small platform to balance the object on."

      "content": "Position the object on top of your loop. As you hook your loop around your other finger, slide it forward so it's stretching across your palm. Use your fingers from both hands to get the object on top of the string. This will allow you to quickly balance the object on top of your loop, making it look like it's levitating."

      "content": "Grab the object and release your loop. You don't want to levitate the object for too long and give the audience a chance to see the loop. So as you grab the object, release the loop from your hand. It will snap back to the hand you had it wrapped it around. [6] X Research source You can now let your audience inspect the object to see that it is ordinary."

      "content": "Grab two straws. This trick requires you to do a little bit of prep, but can be performed easily at a restaurant or bar. [7] X Research source This trick is less of an illusion where your audience won't see you prep. Because you won't have much time in between prep and actually performing the trick, it's more of a science trick. You need two straws that are still in the paper wrappers. Tear the wrapper toward one end of the straw, but don't remove the wrapper. Your straws will still be in the wrappers, but you will have separated a long portion of the sleeve. This longer sleeve will be used to create friction. The small bit of paper left on the other end stays in place to prevent you from touching the plastic straw before you need to."

      "title": "Place the ends of both straws between your teeth, not touching the actual plastic.",
      "content": "Place the ends of both straws between your teeth, not touching the actual plastic. You will have a long sleeve of paper wrapper which you can now slide up and down on the straw to create a static charge. Pinch the ends of the straws between your teeth, making sure that you don't get the paper wet. Slide the long sleeves of paper up and down on the straws several times to build a charge. Make sure to pinch the end of the straws firmly, using the tip of the wrapper as a barrier between your teeth and the plastic."

      "content": "Slide the paper sleeves up and down a few times, then quickly slide the paper off each straw. You will now have two straws that are holding a static charge. These straws will act like rods which you will grab to transfer the current of energy to your hands. [8] X Research source With the straws still pinched between your teeth, slide the long sleeves up and down on the straws a few times before sliding the paper off completely. The up and down motion of the paper on the plastic creates the charge. You will now have two straws which have a static charge."

      "content": "Grab the straws in each hand. With the straws full of static charge, you want to grab each straw and close your fists around the plastic. Doing this will transfer the static charge from the straws to your hands. Hold the straws for about three seconds. Then let go and drop both straws. Make sure to not touch anything except the dollar you will levitate."

      "content": "Pick up your dollar. It's best to already have your dollar placed on the table so that it is hanging off the edge of the table slightly. Pick the dollar up by pinching it between your two middle fingers. You need to grab the dollar so one finger is on the top and one on the bottom. Raise your hands up, making sure not to touch anything other than the dollar."

      "content": "Slowly move your hands apart. Your hands will still be charged so when you slowly move your fingers away from one another the dollar will levitate in the air. Keep your hands close to the dollar with one hand above it and the other below. The dollar will levitate because of the transfer of static electricity moving between your hands. It will only last for a few seconds before the charge dissipates. You can also take your hair and wrap it around a marker. (Make sure to take off the cap first) After that put the cap on. Boom!"
