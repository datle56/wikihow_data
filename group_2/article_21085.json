      "content": "Purchase a Microplane zester/grater. These stainless steel kitchen utensils have sharper edges than regular zesters or graters and they are ideal for grating hard spices like nutmeg and mace. If you don't have access to this type of zester, use a nutmeg grater or a small zester. You need a very sturdy grater with small, hard holes to adequately grind the hard seed."
