      "content": "Cover a flat surface with newspaper. Paint can get a little messy, and it’s no fun to clean up a huge mess after a fun craft. Spread out a few pieces of newspaper to cover the area that you’re working. If you don’t have newspaper, try some paper bags instead. [1] X Research source You should also wear some clothes that you don’t mind getting paint on just in case."

      "content": "Paint the outside of a shoebox a warm, hopeful color like gold or pink. Think about a color that represents goodness or hope to you. Pick out that color in acrylic paint, then use a paint brush to put a thick layer on the entire outside of the shoebox. [2] X Research source Light yellow, pastel pink, and tan are all great colors to go for, but you can pick whichever ones you’d like. There’s some debate about the appearance of the original Pandora’s Box. Some say it was a wooden treasure chest, while others say it was a clear glass jar."

      "content": "Add jewels and glitter to the outside to entice people to open it. The aim of Pandora’s Box is to get someone to open it up and spill its secrets. Using hot glue, attach a few fake jewels to the corner and some glitter to the sides of the box. Make it look as pretty and appealing as you can so people feel tempted to open it up. [4] X Research source You can find fake jewels and glitter at most craft stores."

      "title": "Write a note that says “DO NOT OPEN” and tape it to the box.",
      "content": "Write a note that says “DO NOT OPEN” and tape it to the box. In some versions of the myth, Pandora’s Box has a note warning her not to open it up. Grab a notecard and write “DO NOT OPEN” on it in large letters so everyone can see it, then use clear tape to add it to the top of your box. [5] X Research source You can use a permanent marker or some glitter glue to spell out your message."

      "title": "Cut out pictures that represent evil and hope.",
      "content": "Cut out pictures that represent evil and hope. Find a few magazines and start cutting out pictures that represent famine and sickness. Then, cut out 1 to 2 photos of something that represents hope. You’ll need both of them for your box, and you can choose any images that speak to you. [6] X Research source For evil images, you might choose fiery explosions, extinct animals, or dead plants. For a hopeful image, you might cut out a rainbow, a newborn baby, or a plant sprouting."

      "title": "Glue the hopeful photos to the bottom of the box.",
      "content": "Glue the hopeful photos to the bottom of the box. Grab a glue stick and spread some glue onto the images of hope that you cut out. Glue it down to the very bottom of your box so you can only see it if the box is empty. [7] X Research source The symbol of hope is supposed to come out of the box last, which is why you need it at the very bottom."

      "content": "Fill your box with “evil” items. Find some items around your home that represent sins. You can pick classic ones, like envy, sloth, and pride, or you can find modern objects for a new interpretation of sin. [9] X Research source You could put some unhealthy snacks in the box to represent gluttony, a TV remote to represent laziness, a medal to represent pride, or a social media logo to represent envy."
