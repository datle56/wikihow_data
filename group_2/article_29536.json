      "content": "Draw an 8 in × 2 in (20.3 cm × 5.1 cm) rectangle on a sheet of paper. If you want to make a cube that’s 2 × 2 × 2 in (5.1 × 5.1 × 5.1 cm), use a pencil and a ruler to create a rectangle that’s 8 in (20 cm) long and 2 in (5.1 cm) tall. For a cube of this size, your paper should be at least 8 in × 6 in (20 cm × 15 cm). [1] X Research source Construction paper is best for this project because it’s sturdy, but you can also use standard copy paper. If you want to make a cube that’s a different size, start with a rectangle with a length-to-width ratio of 4:1. For instance, if you want to make a cube that measures 4 × 4 × 4 in (10 × 10 × 10 cm), draw a 16 in × 4 in (41 cm × 10 cm) rectangle to start."

      "title": "Divide the rectangle into 4 squares.",
      "content": "Divide the rectangle into 4 squares. Use your ruler to measure exactly 4 in (10 cm) across the long side of the rectangle, which should be the halfway point. Mark that spot, then, draw a vertical line to divide the rectangle in half. You should see two rectangles that measure 4 in × 2 in (10.2 cm × 5.1 cm). Divide each of these rectangles in half again so you have 4 2 in × 2 in (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm) squares. [2] X Research source If you chose to make a cube that’s a different size, adjust the measurements to divide the original rectangle into 4 even squares."

      "title": "Add a new square on top of the second box in the rectangle.",
      "content": "Add a new square on top of the second box in the rectangle. Find the second vertical line in your rectangle, which is the left side of the second box. Use your ruler and pencil to extend that line upward by 2 in (5.1 cm). Do the same thing above the third vertical line, or the line that runs down the center of the rectangle. Then, connect the tops of the two new lines with a horizontal line. This will create a new 2 in × 2 in (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm) square just above your original rectangle. [3] X Research source Try to keep your lines as straight as possible, or the sides of your cube may not connect."

    {
      "title": "Draw another square just below the third square in your rectangle.",
      "content": "Draw another square just below the third square in your rectangle. Find the center line of your original rectangle again, and extend this line downward so it reaches 2 in (5.1 cm) below the rectangle. Do the same to the line to its right, which is the fourth vertical line in your rectangle. Connect those lines at the bottom. [4] X Research source You should now have a total of 6 boxes that measure 2 in × 2 in (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm)."

      "title": "Draw 7 parallelograms to create the flaps for your cube.",
      "content": "Draw 7 parallelograms to create the flaps for your cube. Starting on the far left side of the far-left box, draw 2 lines that angle in toward each other at about 45°. The lines should be about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) long. Then, connect the angled lines with a straight vertical line to make your flap. You’ll also need flaps on either side of the top box, a flap on the bottom of the box just below that, one on the bottom of the very bottom box, and a flap on the top and bottom of the far-right box. [5] X Research source The only box that won’t have a flap is the third box on your original rectangle. The very top and far-right boxes will have two flaps each, and the far-left, second-from-the-left, and bottom boxes will each have one flap. This will be 7 flaps total, and you’ll use them to glue your cube together."

      "content": "Cut out the cube template. Using a pair of scissors, carefully cut along only the outside lines of your template, including the flaps. Don’t cut along the lines that divide the boxes from one another, or the lines between the flaps and the boxes. [6] X Research source Your template should be 1 big piece when you’re finished. If you accidentally make the wrong cut, either tape the template back together or draw a new one."

      "title": "Fold the template along the lines you drew.",
      "content": "Fold the template along the lines you drew. Start by folding each flap inward along the line that separates it from the box it’s connected to. Then, fold the template along the lines separating the squares. The four squares from your original rectangle will make the sides of the cube, and the top and bottom squares will become the top and bottom of your cube. [7] X Research source All of your folds should be in the same direction. For instance, you might fold upward along all the lines. Be sure to press each fold tightly to make a crisp crease."

      "title": "Add glue to each flap as you put the cube together.",
      "content": "Add glue to each flap as you put the cube together. Place a small line of glue on one of the flaps, then hold the flap tightly against the corresponding side for several seconds. Continue doing this until you’ve glued down all of the flaps, then leave the cube alone for several minutes to give it time to dry. [8] X Research source You can use tape to fasten the flaps, if you prefer."

You can find origami paper at most craft stores or online. [9] X Research source If you don’t have origami paper, you can use regular copy paper that’s been cut into squares instead."

Line up the top and bottom edges carefully, then press down on the paper to make a fold. Crease the fold, then reopen the paper. [10] X Research source Since the paper is square, it doesn’t matter whether you make this fold from side-to-side or top-to-bottom, but the crease will need to be arranged from top-to-bottom as you continue."

Grasp the top corner of the parallelogram and fold it so the tip of the triangle is touching the very right corner of the shape. This move will fold the top triangle in half.

Slide the end flap of 1 piece of folded paper into the center fold of another piece. Then, slide the end flap of a third piece of paper into the other side of the center fold. As you continue adding the other pieces, you’ll see the shape of a cube starting to emerge. Continue until you’ve connected all of the end flaps from each piece of paper, and you’ll have a cube! [17] X Research source You may need to bend the flaps to fit them into the center fold."
