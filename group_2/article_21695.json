If your spouse acts violently towards you or anyone else in the home, the first thing you need to do is get yourself (and any other innocents) to a safe place. This may be a locked room somewhere else in your home, a neighbor's house, another family member's home or your local police station.

If she comes at you, try to shield yourself from harm as much as possible without retaliating as this can cause you to be considered a perpetrator, too. If you have children in the home, alert them to head to your \"safety zone\" whenever shouting or other signs of violent behavior takes place. If you believe you are in danger, call the emergency services immediately. [2] X Expert Source Frank Blaney Certified Tai Chi & Qigong Instructor Expert Interview. 28 September 2021."

      "content": "Confide in someone you trust. The first step in getting out of a potentially harmful situation is often just letting others know you are in an abusive relationship and you need support and help. Beyond telling someone you trust, it can be helpful to ask them to assist in helping you find a way to leave. You generally need to gather resources, copies of documents and other items as you prepare to leave. A trusted friend can store these items for you. Gather any items you may need to leave like your own cell phone, a separate bank account and legal ID so you are not forced to stay in the home."

If you keep a journal or other documentation, make sure you give a copy of it to a friend for safe keeping outside of the home. You might document the abuse by photographing injuries you or others sustain, having others write down testimony to what they witness, or keeping a journal with dates, times, and details of what happened. In order for this to be considered documentation of abuse, you must refrain from expressing opinions or making judgments. Stick to the facts."

This plan would not only include what your actions need to be but also letting those close to you know what is going on as well. Your family, for example, should know if you are leaving with your children and what to do if your partner calls looking for you. Many support programs have resources that can help prepare and support a safety plan.

For example, she may tell you if you call the police, it is the man who is always arrested. Striking does not always mean hitting. It is also physical abuse if your partner pushes, kicks, trips, or otherwise physically hurts you.
