      "content": "Improve your running form and stamina with strides. Strides are slower and easier than sprints, so they allow you to focus on running correctly instead of wearing yourself out. [1] X Research source To do strides, run for 15-30 seconds at your fastest comfortable pace—that is, the fastest you can run while still moving smoothly and not getting out of breath. Aim for about 8 sets of strides lasting 20-30 seconds each, with about 1-2 minutes of easy jogging between sets. [2] X Research source Strides work best when you incorporate them into a light, easy run. Try to do strides 2-4 times a week, incorporating them into the second half of a longer run. Try to run at about 70-80% of your maximum speed during a stride. With practice, you’ll be able to run more smoothly and comfortably at faster speeds."

      "content": "Do “fast arms” exercises to improve upper body form and speed for running. Stand in front of a mirror with your knees slightly bent and your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your arms 90° at each elbow. Position your hands on either side of you so one hand is next to your face and the other is next to your butt. Keeping your elbows bent, pump your arms as if you were sprinting as fast as you can for a full 20 seconds. Switch the positions of your hands with each pump. [3] X Research source This exercise will not only improve your upper body speed but will also help you master better form for running. Your hands should brush past your pockets each time they return to the starting position. Don’t let your shoulders start to hunch up. When you’re starting out, do 5 sets lasting 20 seconds each. As you build strength and speed, increase each repetition to 30 seconds. Aim to do this type of drill 2-3 times per week along with other speed and agility exercises, or incorporate them into your regular warmup routine. [4] X Research source Your arms actually help you run faster when they work together with your legs! [5] X Research source"

Bend your elbows at 90° and position one hand by your face and one by your rear, just like you would for a “fast arms” drill. This time, pump your arms while also running in place as fast as you can, bringing your knees up about half as high as you can raise them. Keep sprinting in place for about 20 seconds, then rest for a minute. [6] X Research source Stay on the balls of your feet as you run in place. Don’t let your heels touch the ground. Try to let your feet touch the ground as many times as possible in 20 seconds. [7] X Research source Do 5 sets of 20 seconds each with a 1-minute rest in between. Aim to do this exercise 2-3 times a week, along with “fast arms” and other speed drills. To keep track of your progress from one drill to another, count how many times your right foot touches the ground in 20 seconds. You should notice an improvement over time!"

      "content": "Start any run with a dynamic warmup to prevent injury. Whether it’s a light jog or an intense sprint, always warm up before you run. This will improve circulation and make you less likely to strain your muscles or put stress on your heart. For example, do 2-3 sets of each of the following exercises: [8] X Research source Spider-Man stretches. Get into a plank position, then bring your right knee up to your right elbow with your foot flat on the ground. Hold this position for 3-4 seconds, then switch sides. Do 8-10 reps. Bounces. Stand with your knees slightly bent and bounce on your feet. Lower your heels all the way to the ground, but keep your weight on the balls of your feet. Bounce 12-15 times per set. Jumping jacks. Do 12-15 reps and rest 30 seconds between sets. Lateral shuffles. Bend your knees slightly and plant your feet shoulder-width apart, then shuffle sideways, like a crab, about 5–10 metres (16–33 ft). Walk back to the starting position and repeat the shuffle 2-3 times."

Run about 20–30 metres (66–98 ft), going as fast as you possibly can. When you reach the end of the running distance, walk back to the start, then rest for 30-45 seconds. Repeat the sprint 4 or 5 times. [9] X Research source As you get more comfortable with intense sprints, you can work on increasing the distance you cover and the number of reps you do in a session. Do sprints or other high-intensity or high-speed workouts no more than once or twice a week. [10] X Research source"

It’s also great for boosting endurance! [11] X Research source To do HIIT, pick a favorite cardio exercise, like running or cycling, and do a short workout (e.g., 20-30 minutes) in which you switch between going at an easy pace and going as fast as you can. Do a HIIT workout once or twice a week. [12] X Research source For example, you might: [13] X Research source Start with a 5-minute warm up at a medium pace. Sprint for 1 minute, as fast as you can. Switch to a comfortable run for 2 minutes. Continue to switch between 1-minute sprints and lighter 2-minute runs for the next 10-15 minutes. Finish with a 5-minute cooldown, e.g., walking at an easy pace."

At least once a week, do a long, slow run at a light to moderate intensity. You’ll find that the more intensive exercise gets easier over time! [14] X Research source For example, you might start out running about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) at an easy pace once a week, then gradually increase your distance as you build strength and stamina."

Fitness experts typically recommend doing plyometrics 2 times a week. Since this kind of exercise is pretty intense, give yourself 2-3 days of rest between sessions. [15] X Research source If you don’t rest up enough between sessions, you could injure yourself or feel too sore to work out! During a session, keep your number of reps small and rest between sets. For example, when you’re starting out with a new exercise, you might do as little as 3 reps or work in 10-second bursts, then rest for up to 2 minutes before moving to the next set.

Grab a medicine ball and hold it close to your chest with your elbows bent. Pull your arms back slightly, then push through your elbows to throw the ball forcefully. [17] X Research source If you’re working with a partner, ask them to catch the ball and toss it back to you. If you’re doing the drill with a wall, bounce it hard against the wall and try to catch it as it comes back. Either way, stand about 10 feet (3.0 m) away from your target.

Build a bigger stride by sprinting in place while lifting your knees up to hip level, using a motion almost like pedaling a bike. [20] X Research source Make sure to use good form while pumping your arms, too! [21] X Research source Do the high-knee sprint 5 times, 20 seconds at a time, with a minute of rest in between each sprint. High-knee sprinting will also build stronger leg and core muscles, giving you the strength and endurance you need to go faster. Doing squats is another great way to improve your strength and stride length."

[25] X Research source As you get more confident, try more complicated drills, like hopping into each square with both feet or alternating jumps with your feet together and then slightly apart, so they touch the outer edges of each square. If you don’t have access to an agility ladder, draw some chalk lines on the sidewalk or use the lines between floor tiles as guides for your feet. Aim to do these drills for about 10 minutes total per session, up to 5 days a week. If you like, you can incorporate them into your regular cardio routine."

Toss a tennis ball underhand so it bounces off the wall, then catch it and toss it again. The bumpy surface of the wall will make the ball bounce in unpredictable ways, so be ready to move fast to catch it! [26] X Research source Do 4-6 sets of this drill, then rest for 1-2 minutes before moving on to another exercise. You can incorporate this kind of drill into your regular cardio routine. As you get better at catching the ball, mix it up by throwing and catching with opposite hands.
