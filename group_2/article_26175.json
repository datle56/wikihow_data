      "content": "Gear up. Bastions should typically be explored after you have gone to the End and defeated the Ender Dragon. Piglins, the defenders of the bastions, are much harder to defeat, especially with their speed boost. [1] X Research source You should be bringing items with enchantments similar to those found in an End City. You will want full enchanted diamond armor, along with enchanted diamond tools and a sword. You should also bring along a bow, arrows, blocks, golden apples (enchanted if possible) or potions of fire resistance, an elytra, fireworks, a hopper to loot chests, one piece of gold armor, a lava bucket, food, and multiple shulker boxes. [2] X Research source Having a good shield and regenerative items are always a good idea for this situation. [3] X Research source"

If your current world was created in a version older than v1.16.0, you'll need to travel to an un-generated area of your Nether in order to have a chance at finding the new biomes and structures.

Bastion Remnants can spawn in the Crimson Forest, Nether Wastes (the only biome pre-1.17 Nether), Soul Sand Valley, and the Warped Forest."

      "content": "Identify a Hoglin Stable Bastion. Hoglin Stables are perhaps the most useless of Bastions, and should typically be avoided. These places contain stable-like structures and consist of two separate buildings. [6] X Research source These should not be confused with Housing Bastions, which do not have an abundance of Hoglins inside. The loot in these structures is minimal, and will rarely contain any useful items."

Piglin Bastions, although similar to Hoglin Stable Bastions, can be identified through the Nether Wart, which grows in the center courtyard of the Bastion.

Treasure Room Bastions are very abundant in loot, and can contain around 16 blocks of gold, enchanted but damaged diamond armor, and Netherite Ingots.

To avoid this, place a hopper under the chest you want to loot, and take the loot from the hopper. If you want to place the loot in your shulker box, place the shulker box under the hopper. You can always loot the chests without a hopper, but beware of any Piglins that may backstab you."
