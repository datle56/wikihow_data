      "title": "Eat more eggs and poultry.",
      "content": "Eat more eggs and poultry. These contain an antioxidant called glutathione which reduces high levels of GGT in your bloodstream. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Healthy proteins like eggs and chicken will break down GGT and protect the health of your liver. Try having 2 or 3 fried or scrambled eggs in the morning for breakfast, or eating a chicken sandwich or grilled chicken for lunch. Certain legumes and nuts, including Brazil nuts, also contain glutathione. If you have cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, heart disease, or type 2 diabetes , limit your egg consumption to about 3–4 whole eggs per week.

      "content": "Decrease the amount of red meats that you eat. Unlike white meat and eggs, red meats like beef and pork do not contain glutathione. In fact, increased consumption of red meat, like beef and steak, is strongly associated with elevated GGT levels. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So, skip the steak for dinner, and opt to have a roast chicken or fish filet instead."

      "title": "Eat 10 to 11 servings of vegetables",
      "content": "Eat 10 to 11 servings of vegetables each week. Eating veggies that are high in fiber, vitamin C and antioxidants can help to lower your GGT levels. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aim to eat at least 2 servings of veggies every day. For example, you could have a side salad with your lunch, and a plate of steamed broccoli or grilled asparagus with dinner. Vegetables that are naturally high in fiber and vitamin C include romaine lettuce, carrots, spinach, tomatoes, potatoes , broccoli, peppers, and cabbage."

      "title": "Consume 5–6 servings of fruit weekly.",
      "content": "Consume 5–6 servings of fruit weekly. Like vegetables, fruits have been found to lower your GGT levels, especially when they’re high in vitamin C, beta-carotene, and folate. This includes fruits like oranges and lemons, tomatoes, apricots, berries, and pumpkins. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to eat at least 1 serving of fruit every day. For example, you could have an orange with breakfast or slice a tomato on top of a salad with dinner. If you want extra fruit in your diet, you can also lower your GGT by drinking fruit juices. Drink natural fruit juices that have a high juice percentage and are not just sugary, flavored water."

[6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, it's best to stick to light-to-moderate exercise, as heavy exercise can stress your body and temporarily increase your GGT levels.

      "content": "Take a magnesium supplement to support healthy GGT levels. Your body needs magnesium for healthy liver function and to help maintain healthy levels of GGT. You may not be getting enough magnesium through your diet, but a supplement can help. Take your supplement for at least 6 weeks before you evaluate its effect on you, as it takes time to work.

      "content": "Avoid drinking more than 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks per day. High levels of GGT in the blood can also stem from frequent alcohol consumption, even if the liver is in fine condition. When a person drinks alcohol excessively, it activates a metabolic pathway which releases GGT to help break down the alcohol. So, to lower your GGT, work on drinking less alcohol. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The guidelines for moderate drinking suggest that women under 65 have up to 1 drink a day, and that men under 65 have up to 2 drinks a day."

Have 2 cups in the morning and another cup later in the day. In individuals with high levels of GGT—whether from a liver condition or from alcohol use—frequent coffee drinking can lower the amount of GGT in your blood. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Excessive coffee consumption can carry health risks.

      "content": "Ask your doctor for a GGT test if you drink excessively. Excessive or heavy drinking is defined, on average, as 5 or more drinks per day or 15 or more drinks per week for men, or 4 or more drinks per day or 8 or more drinks per week for women. [19] X Research source If your drinking habits fall in this range, you may be raising your GGT to unhealthy levels. Visit your doctor and ask them to administer bloodwork to measure your GGT levels. Your doctor will draw blood from a vein in your arm, and send it to a lab for testing. [20] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor will likely instruct you to avoid eating, drinking, or taking medications for 10–12 hours prior to your bloodwork as food, drinks, and medicines can affect your liver function tests. Talk to your doctor about all of the medicines and supplements you're taking, including those available over-the-counter. Expect your lab results to take at least a few hours but possibly a few days to be ready. While any amount of alcohol can raise your GGT, those who have only 2–3 drinks per day or who only drink heavily on occasion have significantly lower GGT than those who heavily drink regularly.
