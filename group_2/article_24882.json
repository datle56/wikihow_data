      "title": "Detangle the hair with a wide-tooth comb.",
      "content": "Detangle the hair with a wide-tooth comb. Large bristles, unlike smaller ones, are less likely to snag on individual strands, making them perfect for most synthetic wigs and extensions. If you’re cleaning a wig with tight curls, use your fingers instead of a comb to avoid damaging the hair. If you have difficulty combing through the hair, spray it with water or a wig detangler to loosen the strands."

    {
      "title": "Mix cool water and shampoo in a tub.",
      "content": "Mix cool water and shampoo in a tub. Fill a basin with enough cool or lukewarm water to completely cover your hair. Then, pour in around 1 to 2 capfuls of a mild, synthetic-safe shampoo, using a bit more for large wigs and a bit less for small extensions. Mix the water and shampoo together to create a slightly soapy solution."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set your hair in the tub for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Set your hair in the tub for 5 to 10 minutes. Make sure your hair is fully stretched out, then place it in the tub. Press it down until it is fully submerged, then let it soak for 5 to 10 minutes. The shampoo will help remove dirt and grime from the hair, making it cleaner and easier to soften."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swish the hair around to agitate it.",
      "content": "Swish the hair around to agitate it. While the hair soaks, swish it around by pushing it up and down and moving it from left to right. Use gentle motions so the hair doesn’t tangle up. Avoid scrubbing or pulling the hair, as it can damage or even tear off the strands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the hair off using cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the hair off using cool water. After 5 minutes, remove the hair from the tub and place it under a stream of cool water. This will help remove the shampoo without changing the hair’s shape or removing any outer coatings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill a tub with cool water.",
      "content": "Fill a tub with cool water. If you’re using the same container you shampooed the hair in, dump out the soapy mixture and clean the tub. Then, fill it up with enough cool or lukewarm water to cover the hair completely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix in .5 cups (120 ml) of conditioner or fabric softener.",
      "content": "Mix in .5 cups (120 ml) of conditioner or fabric softener. Using conditioner will prevent the hair from tangling while helping it stay soft and shiny. Fabric softener will make the hair significantly softer, but it will not address tangling, clumping, or similar issues. If you’re using conditioner, look for products labeled as ‘synthetic safe’ or something similar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the hair in the tub for at least 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the hair in the tub for at least 10 minutes. Fully stretch out the synthetic hair, then set it in the solution. Press the hair down until it is fully submerged, then leave it in the water for at least 10 minutes. For damaged hair, try soaking it for 30 minutes, an hour, or even a full night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Agitate the hair by swishing it around in the water.",
      "content": "Agitate the hair by swishing it around in the water. Just like when you shampooed it, move the hair up and down and from side to side, making sure every strand gets covered with conditioner or fabric softener. To avoid unnecessary damage, do not rub the hair or handle it harshly. If you’re letting the hair sit for a long time, you only need to agitate it for the first 5 to 10 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the hair but do not rinse out the conditioner or fabric softener.",
      "content": "Remove the hair but do not rinse out the conditioner or fabric softener. When you’re ready to dry the hair, remove it from the tub. Leave any remaining conditioner or fabric softener in, that way the hair can continue to absorb it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze out excess water.",
      "content": "Squeeze out excess water. Grab a segment of synthetic hair and gently press it between your thumb and index finger. Then, run your fingers down the strand, squeezing out most of the remaining water. Repeat this with the rest of the hair. To avoid damaging the hair, do not twist it or attempt to ring the water out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pat the hair down with a towel if necessary.",
      "content": "Pat the hair down with a towel if necessary. For hair extensions and wigs with long strands, gently blot the hair with a clean towel. Be careful not rub the hair with the towel, that way you don’t damage it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the hair out so it can air dry.",
      "content": "Set the hair out so it can air dry. If you’re cleaning a wig, set it on a wig stand, spray hair canister, or head form. Avoid styrofoam stands as they can damage the wig. If you’re cleaning hair extensions, set them on a clean, flat surface. Blow dryers and other heat-based tools can permanently change the shape of synthetic hair, so avoid using them whenever possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use hair products made specifically for synthetic hair.",
      "content": "Use hair products made specifically for synthetic hair. Because synthetic hair is not made from the same materials as human hair, you’ll need to use different products to keep it soft and clean. Look for shampoos, conditioners, and other styling items designed specifically for synthetic hair or wigs. If your local supermarket does not stock these products, look for them at beauty and costume shops. Though you shouldn't use any normal hair products on wigs or extensions, avoid hairspray in particular as it can actively degrade the synthetic strands."

    {
      "title": "Brush your hair with a wide-toothed comb.",
      "content": "Brush your hair with a wide-toothed comb. When detangling your synthetic hair, make sure to use a wide-tooth comb or brush so that the bristles don’t get snagged on the fiber strands. If possible, purchase a styling tool specifically designed for use with wigs. To avoid ruining your wig, start by brushing out the ends before moving up to the roots. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid overwashing your hair.",
      "content": "Avoid overwashing your hair. Unlike human hair, synthetic hair is not affected by the oil your body produces, meaning you don’t need to clean it nearly as often. If you wear your synthetic hair every day, wash it about once a week. Otherwise, wash it about once a month to make sure it stays soft."
    },
    {
      "title": "Minimize the number of hair products you use.",
      "content": "Minimize the number of hair products you use. Over time, using too many hair products can make your synthetic hair weaker and coarser. To keep this from happening, stick to synthetic-safe shampoos, conditioners, and sheen sprays. Unless they’re specifically designed for your type of wig or hair extension, stay away from gels and similar items. When applying your styling product, use as little as possible to avoid damaging the hair."

      "title": "Keep synthetic hair away from extremely hot temperatures.",
      "content": "Keep synthetic hair away from extremely hot temperatures. This includes hot water as well as heat styling tools like blow dryers, curling irons, and straightening irons. Unless your synthetic hair is made from heat-resistant fibers, extremely hot temperatures will mess up the hair’s shape and permanently damage the strands. Give bendy rollers a try if you'd like to curl your hair without heat. They're affordable, effective, and versatile—plus, they can create curls of any size."

    {
      "title": "Take your synthetic hair off at night.",
      "content": "Take your synthetic hair off at night. Bedhead can completely ruin the shape and texture of synthetic hair. To avoid this, take your wig off or extensions out before going to bed. Keep wigs on a wig head, and lay extensions out on a flat surface. If your extensions are sewn in and can’t be removed, try sleeping on a satin pillow or securing the extensions in a braid before bed."
