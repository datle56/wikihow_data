There are several ingredients that you can only gather while in the Nether, so you'll need to go to the Nether in order to kick off the potion-brewing process. The Nether is incredibly dangerous, especially for new players. Consider setting the game difficulty to \"Peaceful\" while in the Nether to avoid dying until you want Ghast tears, Magma cream, Blaze rods and Blaze Powder."

(Can be found in Nether Fortress or Bastion Remnant as of 1.16) Blaze Rods: Blazes drop blaze rods when killed. You will need to bump the difficulty up to 'Easy' for Blazes to spawn.(Save some for crafting some Eyes of Ender later on) Soul Sand: If you wish to grow more Nether Wart in the Overworld, you can grab some of these brown blocks that look like they have faces trapped inside. (Not to be confused with Soul soil.)"

Glistering Melon - You can craft a glistening melon by surrounding a Melon with eight Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Grid. Used for instant health potions. Golden Carrot - Can be crafted by surrounding a single Carrot with eight Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Grid. Used for night-vision potions. Blaze Powder - Can be crafted by crafting a single Blaze Rod, dropped by Blaze enemies. This will produce two Blaze Powders. Used for strength potions. Fermented Spider Eye - Can be crafted from a Spider Eye, Mushroom, and Sugar. Used for weakness potions. Pufferfish - Can be caught by fishing or (As of Update Aquatic) in a Water Bucket. Used for water-breathing potions. Magma Cream - Dropped by defeated Magma Cubes, or can be crafted by combining Blaze Powder (Crafted from Blaze rods) and a Slimeball (Dropped by Slime). Used for fire resistance potions. Sugar - This can be crafted from single pieces of Sugar Cane. Used for speed potions. Ghast Tear - Dropped by Ghasts. (Can be difficult to obtain since Ghasts tend to hover over lava). Used for health regeneration potions. Rabbit's Foot - Dropped by defeating Rabbits (2.5% drop rate). Used for leaping potions. Phantom Membrane - Dropped by phantoms. Used in potions of slow falling. Turtle Shell - Crafted by placing 5 turtle scutes in a helmet formation in a crafting table. Scutes are obtained by first breeding turtles, waiting for the eggs to hatch and the babies to grow into adults, then killing the resulting adult turtles. Used in potions of the turtle master."

You can also make potions throwable so that they splash on impact. Redstone - You can find Redstone by mining Redstone Ore. This will typically yield 4-5 Redstone. This can make potions last longer. Glowstone Dust - Can be obtained by breaking a block of Glowstone. You can receive up to four Glowstone Dusts per block of Glowstone. This can make potions stronger, but shorter. Gunpowder - This can be found by defeating Creepers, Ghasts, and Witches. This makes potions throwable. Fermented Spider Eye - This secondary ingredient can also be used to further modify potions. It typically reverses or corrupts the effects of the potion. (Crafted from a Spider eye and brown mushroom) Dragon's Breath - Can be obtained by using an empty glass bottle on the Ender Dragon's purple breath attack. This makes potions linger on the ground."
