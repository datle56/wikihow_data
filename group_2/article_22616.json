      "content": "Place a folding screen beside your bed to create some privacy. These screens typically fold into 3 or 4 sections, and they come in a huge array of styles. They're usually pretty lightweight, so it's easy to unfold the screen when you want to block off your bedroom area. Then, if you want to open the space back up, you can simply fold up the screen and lean it against a wall. [1] X Research source As a bonus, you can move the screen anytime there are any other areas you need to hide, like if your kitchen is a mess."

      "content": "Set up a bookshelf beside your bed, then fill the shelves with your favorite decor. Fill the shelves with books, statues, decorative bowls, and anything else eye-catching that you really love. If you can find a bookshelf with open shelving, opt for that—the apartment will feel more spacious if it isn't blocked off, and you'll also be able to see your decorations from the front and back of the shelf. [2] X Expert Source Patricia Penker Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. A cubby-style bookshelf is perfect for this! As a bonus, you can put decorative boxes into the cubbies for added storage. If all you have is a closed bookshelf, it's probably best to turn it so the shelves are facing the outside of the room. However, if you prefer, you could turn the shelves facing into the bedroom area, then hang art on the back of the shelf."

      "content": "Use furniture as a wall for a solution that's effective and practical. When you're figuring out the arrangement for your apartment, you might naturally gravitate toward placing it against the walls. However, you can use your furniture to create barriers that will define different spaces within the studio. This is especially helpful for your bedroom area, where you'll likely need a little extra storage for clothing. [3] X Research source If you want to keep an open line of sight throughout the apartment, use long, low furniture, like a horizontal dresser or a desk. As long as the furniture is a little taller than the bed, it will add some privacy to the space. For even more privacy, you could use taller furniture, like an armoire."

      "title": "Place a garment rack close to your bed, then fill it with your very favorite clothes.",
      "content": "Place a garment rack close to your bed, then fill it with your very favorite clothes. This will create a visual divide that separates your bedroom from the rest of the apartment. It's a practical way to add more room for clothes, and it also allows you to admire your greatest designer buys or thrift-store snags! [4] X Research source To create a cohesive look, stick to a simple color palette for the clothes you hang on the rack. For instance, you might opt for all neutrals if your style is more modern. However, you could display clothes in bold, warm colors for a pop, or you could even stick to all animal prints to show off your wild side! If you like the idea of using a garment rack but clothes aren't really your thing, hang planters filled with pretty trailing plants, instead."

      "content": "Hang fabric from the canopy and posts to create a sense of privacy. Use lightweight fabric—something sheer and drapey will look especially romantic. When you're ready for bed, just close the fabric to give you a feeling that you're in your own little world. [5] X Research source You can do something similar by hanging fabric from the posts of a normal bed, but it can be hard to secure it so it doesn't slip off."

      "content": "Save space with a Murphy bed that you can fold away during the daytime. Murphy beds are perfect for small spaces because you don't have to dedicate an entire area of your home to being a bedroom. Just mount the Murphy bed system to the wall. When it's time to sleep, lower the bed and climb in. Then, in the morning, simply fold the bed back into the wall, and enjoy your open space! [6] X Research source Murphy beds are available in a wide range of styles. For instance, a simple Murphy bed might just look like a cabinet when it's folded up, whereas more elaborate systems might seem to disappear into the wall completely when they're closed."

      "content": "Purchase a sofa or chair that pulls out into a bed when you're not using it. You can usually find these in budget-friendly options, so you're not having to make a big commitment. Also, even if you move into a bigger place later, these tend to come in handy when you have company. [7] X Research source Trundle beds are a good option, as well—these are made to slide out from under another piece of furniture (like a couch) when you need them. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Build or purchase a loft bed, then make use of the space underneath. Lifting your bed off the ground will give you more privacy since it won't be right in anyone's line of sight. Then, you can use the area under the bed as added storage space. If you lift the bed high enough, you can even put a desk or a little sitting area underneath it."

      "content": "Measure your closet, then choose a bed that will fit neatly inside. Not all studio apartments have walk-in closets, but if yours does, you may be able to convert it into a small sleeping area. Just find a mattress that will slide into the space, then hang a small light from the wall or ceiling. [9] X Research source If you don't like the feeling of being closed in, consider replacing the closet door with a screen or curtains. Use garment racks or an armoire to hold your clothing, since your closet will be taken up."

      "content": "Install brackets on your ceiling and stretch a curtain rod between them. Then, hang curtains from the rod to create a room divider. You can easily slide the curtains closed when you want more privacy and open them again when you want to let in more light. [10] X Research source Sheer curtains will give the room a light, airy look. Or, you could use the curtains to add a pop of color to your space. Install a track system for more stability if your curtains need to stretch over a wide area."

      "content": "Hire a contractor to build a free-standing wall just beside your bed. You can even choose to install a half-height wall if you don't want to entirely block the line of sight in the apartment. Just keep in mind that if you're renting, you'll need written permission from the owner before you have any construction done inside your apartment. [11] X Research source Glass partitions are a stylish option that will create a cozy space around your bed while still allowing you to see into the rest of the apartment. [12] X Research source If you can't make any permanent changes to the apartment, consider installing movable walls. That way, you can change the arrangement of the bedroom whenever you want to, and you can remove them when you move out. [13] X Research source"
