      "content": "Glue a strong magnet to the end of a small stick or dowel. Pick up a pack of strong earth magnets from your local craft store, then hot glue them to the bottom of the small stick or dowel that’s about 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long. Wait for the glue to dry completely so you can use the stick as an impromptu stud finder. [1] X Research source Earth magnets are super small, and are about the size of your pinky fingernail. You can take a branch from your backyard or local park and trim it down so it’s short."

      "title": "Locate the ceiling joist with your magnet.",
      "content": "Locate the ceiling joist with your magnet. Climb up on a ladder so you can comfortably reach the ceiling with your arm. Hold the magnet up to the ceiling, moving it around as you search for the stud. Keep moving the magnet around until you feel it tug a bit. At this point, let go of the magnet and see if it holds in place. Shift the magnet around that area to get an idea of where the joist begins and ends. [2] X Research source A stud finder can be a bit difficult to maneuver on a ceiling, so a magnet might save you some time and trouble. It may take a few tries before you find the joist successfully. As a general rule of thumb, keep in mind that most joists are spaced 16 in (41 cm) apart. [3] X Research source Whenever possible, it’s best to hang a heavy object from a ceiling joist. That way, the item has plenty of support."

      "content": "Mark the exact spot with a piece of painter’s tape. Rip off a small section of painter’s tape and place it exactly where the magnet is sticking, so you can remember where your joist is. Ideally, this joist will be around where you want to hang up your heavy object. [4] X Research source As an extra precaution, you can use a stud finder to find and mark both edges of your ceiling joist. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Take extra measurements if you’re hanging the item in more than 1 spot. Keep in mind that certain heavy objects, like a swing, may need to connect to the ceiling in more than 1 spot. Measure out the distance between these additional spots, taking time to mark them with a piece of painter’s tape or pencil. [6] X Research source For certain objects, like a swing, you’ll want to measure out at least 14 in (36 cm) of space in front and behind the joist so you have enough room to use the object. Double-check with a stud-finder or magnet to make sure any additional marks are still running along the joist. Some large objects must be supported in several places. For these, mount to more than one joist, and if necessary, use large toggle bolts where there is no joist."

      "content": "Choose a sturdy attachment that can hold your heavy object. Think about how much weight the attachment will be holding—if you’re hanging a piece of furniture, you may want to use lag bolts to mount the heavy object. [7] X Research source If you’re hanging something lighter, like a bassinet, you may want to use a screw-eye hook instead. Pick something with a thread that’s at least 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm) long, so it can securely fit through the drywall as well as the ceiling joist. Plastic attachments won’t be able to hold as much weight as metal attachments. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Drill pilot holes into the marked areas on the joist. Measure the inner thread of the hanging attachment that you’ll be using to attach the object to your ceiling. Install a drill bit that’s the same size as that diameter measurement. At this point, drill holes into the marked holes in the ceiling joist, so it’ll be easier to install the screw later on. [9] X Research source Aim to make the pilot hole as deep and long as the anchor thread of the attachment you’ll be screwing in. [10] X Research source You need to make the pilot hole slightly bigger if you’re drilling into especially hard wood, like maple or oak. If you’re working with softer wood, like pine or cedar, the pilot hole can be slightly smaller. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Screw hanging attachments into each marked spot. Twist the threaded end of your attachment into the pilot hole. Continue twisting the hook or attachment into place until it’s completely sturdy and snug. At this point, you can hang the object from the hook to make sure that everything is stable."

      "title": "Anchor an object to a heavy ceiling with a toggle bolt.",
      "content": "Anchor an object to a heavy ceiling with a toggle bolt. Check the “wings” on the bolt can move easily along the thread of the bolt, so you don’t have difficulty installing it. Keep in mind that these 2 wings will open up above the drywall or plaster, distributing the weight of the object over a larger area. You may want to use multiple hanging attachments to help distribute the weight of a heavy object. A single, thick toggle bolt designed for holding heavy objects can carry up to 50 lb (23 kg) on its own."

Measure along the ceiling to find the exact spot you’d like to hang your item, and mark it in place with a pencil. If your item requires more than 1 toggle bolt, measure and mark the distance between the bolts, double-checking that the marks are where you want the bolts to go. [12] X Research source For instance, if you’re hanging a porch swing, you’ll have at least 2 marks that are more than 2 ft (0.61 m)."

Center your drill above the marks you’ve already made, and start drilling into the mark. Ideally, make your pilot hole as long as the toggle bolt you plan on attaching to the wall. [13] X Research source For instance, if your toggle bolt is 2 in (5.1 cm) long, you’d want the pilot hole to be 2 in (5.1 cm) long as well."

Screw the toggle bolt into place with a Philips-head screwdriver until it’s installed securely to the ceiling. Repeat this process with any other toggle bolts you’ll be using to hang your heavy object. [15] X Research source The toggle bolt wings are spring-loaded, which allows them to fold down as you install the bolt in your ceiling. As you screw in the bolt, the wings will spread out, providing a lot of security and support for your item. [16] X Research source"
