      "content": "Prepare the mint leaves. Pull the leaves off the stalk, and be sure to leave the stems. This will make them easier to handle, and you can always trim the stems off at the end. Rinse the mint leaves in cool water and gently pat them dry with a paper towel. If you are planning on using these leaves to decorate a cake, choose ones that look nice. Don't use any bruised or torn leaves."

If you are worried about Salmonella, use pasteurized egg whites or dried egg whites instead. If you are going to use powdered egg whites, mix them with about 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water first. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Brush the egg white mixture onto the mint leaves as thinly as possible. Make sure that both sides are evenly coated, or the sugar won't stick. If the mixture is too runny after you have brushed it on, wait 1 minute before proceeding. This will allow the egg white to solidify a little."
