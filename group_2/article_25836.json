[1] X Research source So, it’s not much of a surprise that some people associate itchy left feet with a lot of negative energy and vibes.

An itchy left foot might be a warning that you’re carrying a lot of negative energy with you. What to do: Practicing positive thinking is a great way to welcome more positive vibes into your life. A few simple changes to your routine, like laughing a little more , spending time with positive friends/loved ones, and practicing positive self-talk (“I can do my best to accomplish this” vs. “I can’t do it) can make a big difference.

According to superstition, an itchy left foot points to an upcoming journey in your future that might be a little more difficult than you’re expecting. Whether it’s a physical move to a new location or an emotional journey with a loved one, prepare yourself for potential bumps in the road that might make your path just a little more demanding. What to do: Try to view your future with an open mind . At the end of the day, everyone experiences both highs and lows in their life. Instead of dreading the potential negatives, view them as a future learning experience that will help you grow. If you’re feeling anxious, try coming up with some alternative plans in case your original journey doesn’t go the way you expect it to. Did you know? An itchy foot foretells an upcoming journey in Turkish superstitions. Apparently, you’re destined to travel soon if the bottom of your feet start itching. Turkish culture also associates unlucky circumstances with “left” things—for instance, an itchy left palm is a sign of financial loss, while a twitching left eye is an omen of bad news. [3] X Research source By this logic, it could be reasonable to assume that an itching left foot could signify a less than lucky trip on the horizon."
