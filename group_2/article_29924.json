You should now have a right triangle made from the folded sheet, plus an extra rectangle of single-sheet paper. [1] X Research source"

[2] X Research source If you do not have scissors, fold the small rectangle over the triangle and crease well. Unfold the paper. Press down hard on the small rectangle with one hand, and on the rest of the paper with the other. Slowly move your hands apart to tear along the crease. [3] X Research source"
