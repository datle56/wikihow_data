      "content": "Gather the necessary materials. For this experiment you will need 1 cup (240 ml) of milk, 4 tablespoons (59 ml) of white vinegar, a stove cookpot or microwaveable container, cotton cloth or mesh strainer, a bowl, paper towels, and adult supervision. If you want to make more plastic or do this experiment more than once, you will need more milk and vinegar. [1] X Research source Whole milk or heavy cream will work better than 1% or 2% milk. An old T-shirt will work fine as the cotton cloth. You will be working with hot liquid so adult supervision is recommended."

      "content": "Heat 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. This experiment can be done using either the microwave or heating the milk on the stove. Use a microwave-safe container if using the microwave. Pour the milk into a cookpot if using the stove. Heat the milk until it is just under boiling. [2] X Research source If you have a candy thermometer, make sure the temperature is at least 120 °F (49 °C). [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source Stir the milk continuously if heating on the stove. Have an adult help you with this step. To microwave milk, put your microwave on 50% power for about 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, microwave in 30 second increments until the milk is hot."

      "content": "Add 4 tablespoons (59 ml) of vinegar to the milk and stir. While the milk is still hot, add all of the vinegar to the container and stir for about 1 minute. [4] X Research source As you stir, you should notice that clumps will start to form. If no clumps form, the milk was probably not hot enough for the reaction to occur. Try again with hotter milk. The milk curdles due to a change in its pH. The vinegar contains acetic acid, which makes the milk more acidic and causes the protein, called casein, to unfold and reorganize into a long chain.

      "content": "Pour the warm milk through the strainer. If you’re using an old T-shirt, wrap the T-shirt around the mouth of a jar or over a bowl. Rubber band it in place so it doesn’t move around. If you’re using a mesh strainer, simply place the strainer on top of the bowl. Let the milk cool for a bit and then pour it over the strainer and let it drain. [6] X Research source As the milk drains through the strainer, you will see the clumps remaining on top of the strainer."

If you’re using a strainer, scoop out the curds onto paper towels using your hands or a spoon. Squeeze the curds on the paper towel to get out any extra moisture."

You can also press the dough into a mold to form a shape. Remove it from the mold and set it aside to dry. Alternatively, you can sculpt the dough as you would with clay or play dough into any form you’d like. [9] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source You can add food coloring if you’d like all your shapes to be the same color and you don’t want to wait for them to dry and paint them later. Put on gloves, add some food coloring to the dough, and work it until the color is even throughout the dough. Gel food coloring works better than liquid."
