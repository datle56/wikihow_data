      "title": "Begin with a square piece of origami paper (you’ll need two in total).",
      "content": "Begin with a square piece of origami paper (you’ll need two in total). An origami menko is one of the quintessential modular origami pieces and is great for illustrating the principles of how modular origami works. Fold the first piece of paper into thirds like you would a letter going into an envelope: Beginning with the backside of the paper facing up on a flat surface, fold the top third of the paper down to create a horizontal fold. Crease well. Fold the resulting shape in half, creating a horizontal fold. Crease well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the corners.",
      "content": "Fold the corners. Fold the right bottom corner up so the bottom tip meets the top of the paper, making a diagonal crease. Crease well. Fold the left top corner down to meet the bottom of the paper, making a diagonal crease. Crease well. You’ll have what will look like a square in the middle of the paper, flanked on each side by triangles (which will be facing opposite ways--one facing the front, one facing the back)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the previous steps with the second piece of paper.",
      "content": "Repeat the previous steps with the second piece of paper. You should then have two identically folded pieces of paper. Now you can begin to join them together to form an origami menko."

      "title": "Place one piece over the other.",
      "content": "Place one piece over the other. Lay the first piece so it’s oriented horizontally with the triangle folds facing up towards you. Lay the second piece over the first, but oriented vertically with the triangle folds facing up towards you."
