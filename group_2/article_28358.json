Keeping your skin properly hydrated can help firm your skin, prevent wrinkles, and make you appear younger. Use a moisturizer even if your skin is oily. Try an oil-free product. Try products that not only boost collagen and elastin, but also make your face more youthful looking by plumping it up with products such as silicone and hyaluronic acid. You can find out if products have these ingredients by reading the labels. However, be aware that many companies over-promise results. Consider consulting online forums such as Paula’s Choice, which includes product reviews from medical professionals and individuals who have tried the product. Apply a moisturizer with a sunscreen may help prevent wrinkles. Consider running a humidifier in your room at night to boost moisturize on your skin. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply topical retinoids.",
      "content": "Apply topical retinoids. Retinoids are skincare products with vitamin A derivatives. These can improve skin elasticity, the appearance of fine wrinkles, splotches, and skin roughness, which may make you look younger. Ask your dermatologist or doctor about using prescription tretinoin and tazarotene to reduce signs of aging. Be aware that many insurance companies do not cover retinoids when they’re used for cosmetic purposes. Consider getting an over-the-counter skin cream that has low-grade retinoids in it. These products are not as powerful as prescription retinoids and may not make your skin look younger over the long term. Be aware that retinoid use can cause redness, dryness, and burning of your skin. Keeping your skin moisturized may reduce redness, as can staying out of the sun."

      "content": "Dab on an eye cream. There is a long-held truism that the eyes are the window to the soul. Using an eye cream every day and night may help reduce wrinkles and fine lines, sagging, puffiness, and dark circles around your eyes, helping you to appear more youthful. Consider an eye cream that has a roller for application, which can reduce puffiness and make you appear more awake. Use an eye cream with emollients for plumping and mica for brightening dark circles during the day. Purchase an eye cream for day or night with ingredients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, collagen, and peptides to improve the overall appearance of your eye skin. You can find these ingredients by readings the labels. Just like with other products, consider consulting your dermatologist or an online forum with medical and public reviews before you buy. Apply the cream using your ring finger. Because eye skin is so delicate and thin, it’s easy to pull it, which can lead to sagging. Using your ring finger can help prevent from pulling too harshly at your eye skin."

      "content": "Use at-home microdermabrasion. Although microdermabrasion used to be a treatment reserved for doctors’ offices, many skincare companies have begun offering less potent at-home microdermabrasion kits. Consider using one of these if you want to avoid more involved medical procedures. Buy a kit at your local pharmacy or larger retailer. Many cosmetics or skincare stores also sell kits. Ask a professional for help with selecting the best product for your needs. Talk to your doctor before using an at-home microdermabrasion kit. She may have suggestions on brands you can buy or if you should avoid them altogether because of a skin condition or allergy. Make sure to follow the packaging instructions on any kit you purchase. Not applying products or using the tool properly can result in damage to your skin. Recognize that at-home microdermabrasion kits contain products far less potent that what doctors use. This will result in less dramatic, and perhaps more natural, results than professional microdermabrasion."

      "title": "Apply makeup.",
      "content": "Apply makeup. There has been significant advancement in the technology of makeup. New formulas help not only hide the signs of aging, but can also help combat them. Putting cosmetics strategically on your skin can help lighten and liven up your entire face. [9] X Research source Remember that less is more. Spackling on heavy makeup, such as eye shadow or foundation, can have the opposite effect and make you appear older. Use a primer to help disguise discoloration and hyperpigmentation. Primers often help reflect light off of your skin, which can also make you appear younger. Apply a liquid foundation or tinted moisturizer to even out your skin tone and make a smooth palette for blush. Avoid cream foundations, which can settle into lines and wrinkles. Top off your primer and foundation with a dusting of translucent powder to set them if you like. Finish your face with a cream blush, which helps impart a healthy, youthful glow. Apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks to recreate the plumpness of youthful, full cheeks. Use eye makeup to help counteract sagging eye skin and make your eyes look large and youthful. Apply a light, nude-colored shadow such as beige or mocha, from your lashes to your brow. Define your lash line with an eye shadow in gray, brown, or black for a soft look. Top it off with one coat of mascara. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Try light source, laser, or radiofrequency therapies.",
      "content": "Try light source, laser, or radiofrequency therapies. Skin treatments that use light sources, laser, or radiofrequency can promote new collagen to grow in your skin. New collagen can make your skin more elastic and appear more youthful. Keep the following in mind if you want to try any of these treatments: Light source and laser options remove the skin’s outer layer and then stimulate collagen growth by heating the underlying layer of skin. Your skin becomes smoother and tighter as it heals from the procedure. Light source or laser resurfacing can take months to heal and it may scar, lighten or darken your skin. Ask your doctor about trying a nonablative laser treatment. This may be a better option if your skin has less sagging and wrinkles. Consider another nonablative treatment using radiofrequency. Be aware that the results from radiofrequency are less dramatic than lasers and light sources. The results can range from mild to moderate. Ask if your insurance company covers any of these treatments."

      "title": "Undergo skin peeling.",
      "content": "Undergo skin peeling. If laser or light therapies scare you, there are less invasive treatments you can consider. Chemical peels, dermabrasion and microdermabrasion remove the outer layer of your skin and may improve elasticity and make your face look more youthful. Keep in mind some of the following facts if you are considering these treatments: Your doctor will apply an acid to the top layer of your skin during a chemical peel. This can burn away some wrinkles, fine lines, and freckles. Healing from a chemical peel can take weeks. You may also need multiple treatments to get results. Dermabrasion sands away the surface layer of your skin. This stimulates the production of a newer, more youthful looking skin. You may see results and fully heal from the procedure within a few months. Microdermabrasion is like dermabrasion, but takes off only a small layer of skin. You may require several microdermabrasion treatments to see results, but it takes less time to heal than dermabrasion. Be aware that microdermabrasion doesn’t always have dramatic results. Consider that insurance companies generally don’t cover these treatments peeling treatments."

      "content": "Have Botox injections. Botox, which is a product made with the Botulinum toxin type A, may help your skin appear smoother and less wrinkled. Consider Botox if you prefer to avoid removing layers of skin or other more invasive treatments. Keep in mind the following if you want to try Botox: Botox lasts for three to four months. You’ll need repeat injections to keep your results. Botox keeps muscles from contracting and can make it difficult to move your face muscles. This might limit how well you can express your emotions. Be aware that most insurance companies will not cover Botox for cosmetic purposes."

      "content": "Get soft tissue fillers. There are other types of injections in addition to Botox called fillers. These use soft tissues, including fat, collagen, and hyaluronic acid to plump up and firm your skin. Keep in mind the following if you are considering fillers: They can cause swelling, redness and bruising. Like Botox, you may need to get repeated injections because most fillers last for a few months. Be aware that most insurance companies will not cover filler injections for cosmetic purposes."

      "content": "Consider a surgical facelift. If you are very concerned about making your face appear younger, you may want to have a facelift. This is the most extreme way to make your face look younger and you should only undergo if after careful consideration and consultation with your doctor. Keep in mind the following if you are considering a facelift: A facelift can come with significant medical risks.

It can take a long time to heal and you may have bruising and swelling for many weeks after the surgery. Face lifts have long-lasting results of 5-10 years. Be aware that most insurance companies will not cover face lifts for cosmetic purposes."
