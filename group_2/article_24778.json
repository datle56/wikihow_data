      "content": "Mopping will loosen any stubborn mud, dirt, or hair stuck to your floor. Alongside your daily sweeping routine, add a weekly mopping session to give your floors a deeper clean. You can use a traditional mop or try a spray mop. Spray mops feature a trigger release that directly sprays cleaner onto your floors. [2] X Research source If you have tile floors, you can also use a steam mop to both clean the surfaces and kill any bacteria or germs that are lingering on the tiles. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can simply spray a floor-safe cleaner onto the floor and wipe it up with a microfiber cloth. This method is effective for removing dirt and dust, but it’s more time- and labor-intensive."

      "content": "Daily brushing sessions will keep hair buildup to a minimum. One of the biggest problems for pet owners is the amount of fur and hair that dogs and cats shed on a daily basis. To minimize these messes, brush your pet’s hair every day with a de-shedding brush. Ideally, brush your pet outside so that less hair is flying around and settling in your living space. By brushing away your dog or cat’s loose fur and disposing of it once a week, there will be less of it accumulating on your floors! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "A towel or paw cleaner will keep your pet from tracking mud indoors. On rainy days (and even some dry ones!), it’s important to get as much moisture and mud off of their paws before they tarnish your home with it. For a simple solution, keep an old towel by your outside door and wipe your dog's paws off when they come in. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Routine grooming reduces the amount of dirt and debris on your pet. Every fur baby needs regular baths, typically about every 1-3 months, depending on the breed. When you’re ready for bathtime, brush your dog before placing them in a tub filled with lukewarm water and pet-friendly shampoo. Suds them up and gently massage the shampoo from head to tail, then rinse the soap out thoroughly. After the bath, reward your pup with plenty of treats and cuddles!

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source If your dog is not a big fan of bath time, try putting peanut butter or spray cheese on the wall of the shower. They’ll be occupied with licking up the treat, which will hopefully allow you to finish their wash without them jumping out of the tub! [7] X Research source"

Set up a designated feeding area for your pet to reduce messes, scratches, and stains in other parts of your home. Place down food and water bowls with a durable rubber mat underneath them to pick up any drips or splashes. Wash your pet’s bowls every day, and, while you’re at it, wipe down the floors, walls, and baseboards around the feeding area at least once a week. [9] X Research source"

Select a comfortable and washable bed for your dog or cat (and remember to wash their bed every week!). Place it in a specific room of your home—this can be a shared space or a bonus room that’s specifically used for your pet. Over time, this room will become the place where your pet likes to hang out and spend most of its time. [10] X Research source As a result, most of their hair and dirt will also stay in that room, making your cleaning process easier!"
