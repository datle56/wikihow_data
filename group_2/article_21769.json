      "content": "Measure your room and choose how far apart to space your lights. Use a tape measure to find the length and width of the room where you want to hang your lights. Once you know the dimensions, choose the distance you want to have between your anchor points on the ceiling. If you put them closer together, you’ll need to use more lights but your room will be brighter. [1] X Research source For example, if you want a soft light throughout your entire room, choose to space your lights 2–3 ft (61–91 cm) apart from one another. String lights can be purchased from hardware and home design stores."

      "title": "Hang the first hook from your ceiling near the outlet you’re using.",
      "content": "Hang the first hook from your ceiling near the outlet you’re using. Look for small removable adhesive clips or hooks that you can put onto your ceiling without damaging it. Place your first hook directly above your power outlet so you have an easy place to plug it in. Remove the adhesive backing from your clip and press it onto the ceiling for 30 seconds. [2] X Research source If you don’t want a portion of your string lights hanging down your wall to the outlet, try running the lights down a corner of your room or using an extension cord. If you want a more permanent lighting solution or if you have a popcorn ceiling, get clips that you can easily nail into your ceiling instead. If you have a drop ceiling, place the hook on one of the supports instead of on the tiles."

      "content": "Space the hooks along the edge of your ceiling. Install the rest of your hooks across the length of the wall at the distance you chose earlier. Press the adhesive backing onto your ceiling and hold it in place for at least 30 seconds so it’s secure. Work out from your first hook towards the edges of your room so you have even spacing between them. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Offset the hooks on the other wall by half the distance between your hooks.",
      "content": "Offset the hooks on the other wall by half the distance between your hooks. Find the point on the opposite side of your room that lines up with your first hook. Instead of placing your hook directly in line with the one on the other side of the room, move it over by half of the distance you’re using. That way, your lights will make the zig-zag pattern on your ceiling. Install the rest of the hooks along the ceiling, working towards the edges of your room. [4] X Research source For example, if you spaced your hooks 2 ft (61 cm) on the first wall, offset the hooks on the other side of your room by 1 ft (30 cm)."

      "title": "String the lights tightly between the hooks.",
      "content": "String the lights tightly between the hooks. Start from the hook closest to your outlet. Run the lights across your ceiling to the other side across the length of your ceiling. When you reach a hook, pull the lights tight and coil the string once around the hook. Continue working in a zig-zag pattern until you’ve covered your entire ceiling. [5] X Research source If you want a more relaxed look to your lights, let them hang down slightly from the ceiling instead of pulling them tight."

Remove the backing from the hook and press it onto the ceiling for 30 seconds until it’s secure. Keep adding hooks around your room at 2 ft (24 in) intervals.

If you want to keep your lights more discrete, run the lights down a corner of your room and to the outlet. Once they’re plugged in, coil the string lights once around the first hook to hold them in place. [7] X Research source Some of your string lights will hang down your wall into the outlet. Choose an outlet behind a dresser or piece of furniture if you want to hide them."

As you reach each of the hooks, coil the string around the hook once so your lights don’t fall down.

Hold the string lights tight so they make a straight line up your wall. Loop the light string around the hook once to keep it securely in place. Run the lights horizontally to another top hook and wrap it in place. [11] X Research source If there isn’t an outlet close to the edge, use an extension cord to get them closer."
