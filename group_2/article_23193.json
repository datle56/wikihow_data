      "content": "Point your toes inward and make curves with your skates to move backward. The basic idea of skating backward is easy – you push the outsides of your skates forward and out, curve them back to the center of your body and repeat. If your skates could draw on the ice they would paint curvy waves, like a child's drawing of the ocean, across the surface. [1] X Research source Think of each skate making an “S” shape as you move backward"

      "title": "Bend your knees.",
      "content": "Bend your knees. You cannot skate backward if you are standing up straight. Bend your knees slightly so that your butt drops closer to the ice. Your torso should be upright like you were sitting in a chair. [2] X Research source As you get better at it, you should be able to lift each skate and put it back down comfortably, but at first, it's to keep them on the ice. It is easiest to use the wall or a hockey stick for balance as you start."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your skates shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Keep your skates shoulder-width apart. Your skates will be pointing directly ahead of you and your shoulders in a straight line over your ankles. This is your \"center\" as you skate backward. With your skates shoulder-width apart, you have the power and strength needed. Hold onto the wall with both hands for balance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push off a wall to start moving backward.",
      "content": "Push off a wall to start moving backward. Focus on keeping your knees bent and back straight as you get used to moving backward. If it is more comfortable for you, lean on a hockey stick for stability. [3] X Research source If you don't have a hockey stick, rest your hands on your knees."

    {
      "title": "Angle your toes inward as you glide backward.",
      "content": "Angle your toes inward as you glide backward. Slowly turn your toes to face each other and you’ll feel your feet start to separate as your skates move outward. Think of skating backward as leading with your heels -- as you toes turn inward, you heels turn out to your left and right, and the rest of your skate follows. This does not need to be a big angle. Even slightly angling your feet will work. This is the beginning of your \"S\" shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Angle your heels inward as your legs split apart.",
      "content": "Angle your heels inward as your legs split apart. This is usually where people feel the most uncomfortable -- your legs are splitting apart, and they will keep moving apart as long as your toes are pointing in. Turn your skates too so that your heels point back towards your body. As you do you will feel your legs coming back together. Again, this does not need to be a large angle. Just turn your feet enough so that you feel your legs gliding back together."

      "title": "Use the muscles in your inner leg to pull your feet back to the center of your body.",
      "content": "Use the muscles in your inner leg to pull your feet back to the center of your body. With your heels turned back to the center, use your groin muscles to bring your skates back to the middle. While you will not bring them this close, imagine you are trying to click your heels together. This is the middle point of your \"S.\" Focus on keeping your knees bent – this will help you with the power and flexibility needed to control your skates."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curve your feet back to the outside.",
      "content": "Curve your feet back to the outside. When you reach your starting position, feet roughly shoulder-width apart, it's time to repeat your curve. Turn your feet so that your toes face inward again, then let them start to glide back out to the side. Pull them in again and repeat -- these are the \"S\" shaped curves that you need to make."

      "title": "Keep your weight over your feet.",
      "content": "Keep your weight over your feet. One of the most common mistakes people make is leaning too far forward, with their bodies over their toes. Focus on keeping your athletic stance the entire time. A good tip is to put your hands on your knees, using them to support you and prevent you from leaning forward."

    {
      "title": "Keep making “S” curves to move backward smoothly.",
      "content": "Keep making “S” curves to move backward smoothly. The “S” curve is the simplest way to move backward on skates. Once you have some momentum, just keep repeating the “S” shape to skate backward, working on transitioning smoothly through each part. Start along the wall – knees bent and back straight. Push off the wall to gain some momentum. Turn your toes in and move your feet apart. Pull your legs back together by turning your toes out and pulling in. Turn your toes to the center again as your feet approach each other. Repeat to skate backward."

    {
      "title": "Use the “C” cut to skate backward quickly.",
      "content": "Use the “C” cut to skate backward quickly. The “C” cut, named because your skates make small C shapes in the ice, is the most common way to skate backward with speed. Your knees are bent and your torso is upright as you alternate pushing your skates out and then arcing them smoothly back in. Stay near a wall or lean on a hockey stick to help with your balance as you start to practice."

      "content": "Bend your knees into an athletic position. Comfortably bend your knees so that you can quickly move your feet. It is difficult to spring into action with your legs straight. You should be able to easily lift your skates and balance. For a good athletic stance: [4] X Research source Knees bent. Torso upright, not slouching. Back straight. Shoulders relaxed."

      "content": "Pull your right heel back to the center. Bring your skate back to the center of your body by leading with your heel. After pushing out and to the side, turn your heel to face your left foot. Your toes will turn to face forward as you return, completing the \"C\" shape. Your foot should return to where it started, with both skates facing forward."

      "content": "Bring it all together with quick, power cuts. Skating backward quickly is crucial for figure skaters and hockey players, so you need to practice all of the steps together to learn a smooth, speedy motion. [6] X Research source Start in a strong stance – knees bent, torso upright, feet facing forward. Point one toe in as you begin to push. Push forward and out with your skate, using the other foot for balance. Curve your foot back to the center in the shape of a C Repeat with the opposite foot. Alternate feet quickly to build speed."

      "title": "Use crossovers to change direction while skating backward.",
      "content": "Use crossovers to change direction while skating backward. Crossover steps are a simple way to move around. You simply cross one foot over the other, letting your momentum continue moving you backward. For this explanation, all of the examples will be to move ‘’’right.’’’ To move left, simply switch the feet in the directions."

      "title": "Perform a crossover to change directions.",
      "content": "Perform a crossover to change directions. As you move backward, cross your left leg over your body then quickly uncross your legs with your right foot. When done correctly, you should shift horizontally while maintaining backward momentum. Think of the motion you make if when you start running to your right. Your left leg takes a step to the right and then your right leg quickly follows. Practice Drill: Do two \"C\" cuts, one with each leg, and then one crossover. Do two more cuts, then a crossover the other direction. ’’’Practice Drill:’’’ Skate backward around the edge of the rink, and use crossovers to change direction in the corners. Skate both clockwise and counter-clockwise to practice both directions."
