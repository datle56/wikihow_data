You don't have to be mean or cut them out completely, but some distance is necessary for you to put these feelings to rest. [7] X Research source If this person is part of your daily life (like a coworker or classmate), do everything you can to minimize your contact with them. Don't sit next to them at lunch, don't walk with them to class. This also means minimizing your contact online, too. If you can unfollow, unfriend, or at least hide this person from your social media, do so. Checking on their Facebook/Instagram/Twitter will just keep the feelings alive. If the person knows you have feelings for them, tell them you need some space. Ask that they respect that space so you can heal. Staying away from someone you really like can be hard, but it's an important part of putting a stop to these feelings."

If this person is part of your main crew or is someone with whom you’ve been very close, it’s time to expand your circle of friends. Call up someone you haven’t seen in a while and ask if they want to hang out. Or chat with that guy you’re sort-of friends with in science class and see if he wants to catch a movie sometime. Focusing on this one person you have feelings for can narrow your scope: it can seem like no one else exists or can make you happy. Meeting new people reminds you this is not true. Don't isolate. You may feel like you just want to be left alone, and that's okay sometimes. But spending time with other people will speed up the healing process and distract you."
