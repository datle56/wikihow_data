      "content": "Purchase a package of Yippee noodles in a flavor that you like. Yippee noodles come in all sorts of flavors, such as Magic Masala, Mood Masala, and Classic Masala. They are sold throughout India and are very popular. If you live outside of India, then you may be able to find them online or in an Indian supermarket. This method assumes that you are using a single-serving, 2.4-ounce (70-g) package of Yippee noodles. Masala is a combination of Indian spices, such as chili, garlic, ginger, galangal, etc. Each flavor of Yippee noodles will have a different combination of spices."
