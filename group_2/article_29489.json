      "content": "Cut a long strip out of the fabric. You want the fabric to be long enough so that you can wrap it around you head, tie it, and have a couple inches leftoverâ€”about 3 feet (0.91 meters). If this is for an adult, start with a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide strip. [1] X Research source If this is for a child. start with a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strip."

      "content": "Figure out the eye placement. There are two ways you can do this. You can measure the distance between your eyes, and make marks on the mask. You can also drape the mask across your face, and make marks over your eyes with a pen."

      "title": "Refine the eye shapes.",
      "content": "Refine the eye shapes. Spread the mask out on a flat surface. Draw two almond-shaped eyeholes on the mask, right where you made the marks. It is better to start with smaller shapes that you think you might need. Remember, you can always cut the holes bigger if they are too small."

      "content": "Try on the mask and make any adjustments. Be sure to tie the mask behind your head, as the fabric will scrunch up a little. If the eye holes are too small, take the mask off and make them bigger. If the mask is too wide, untie the mask, and cut it narrower. [2] X Research source"

Measure across and down the person's face, then draw a mask shape based on those measurements. You can also use an existing mask as a template. You will be placing colored fabric across this mask, so make sure that it is tall enough."

Make sure that the fabric is centered, with equal amounts hanging off to either side. Once you are happy with the placement, secure the fabric to the mask with hot glue or fabric glue.
