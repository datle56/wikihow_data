      "content": "Open 2 plastic eggs. Place 1 hand on each half of the plastic egg. Gently twist and pull the halves to separate them. You will be able to make 2 maracas using 2 plastic eggs. If you want to make more maracas, simply use 1 extra egg for each subsequent maraca that you want to make. [1] X Research source You can purchase plastic eggs from dollar stores or use leftover eggs from Easter."

      "title": "Fill 2 plastic egg halves with dry rice and then close each egg.",
      "content": "Fill 2 plastic egg halves with dry rice and then close each egg. Use a spoon to scoop dry rice into 2 of the plastic egg halves. Gently twist the plastic eggs back together after adding the rice. There needs to be enough rice in each egg to fill it halfway. [2] X Research source You can use any type of rice, provided that it isn’t cooked. Alternatively, you can also use small plastic beads or small pieces of dry pasta if you prefer. [3] X Research source Be careful to hold the half that is full of rice secure while you twist the other half back on. Filling each egg halfway with rice is only an approximate measurement. Try adding different amounts of rice to see how the sound changes when you use the maracas."

      "content": "Place each plastic egg in between 2 plastic spoons. Sit the plastic egg crosswise between the bowl part of 2 spoons, with 1 spoon on each side of the egg. When 1 spoon is resting on a surface, the egg will be able to easily balance in this position. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the plastic egg and spoons in washi tape to hold them together.",
      "content": "Wrap the plastic egg and spoons in washi tape to hold them together. Attach the plastic spoons to the egg by wrapping washi tape around the outside of the spoons and the egg. Make sure that you wrap the washi tape around the egg and spoons at least twice so that it is held in place securely. Either wrap the washi tape all over the egg and spoons or just wrap it a few times around the middle, depending on what you prefer. [5] X Research source You may need somebody else to help hold the plastic egg and the spoons in place while you wrap around the washi tape. You can stick to just 1 pattern or color of washi tape, or use a variety of different styles to make your maracas bright and colorful. If you don’t have washi tape, you could use colorful duct tape instead. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the spoon handles together using washi tape if they are too far apart. Wrap washi tape tightly around the ends of the spoons to secure them. This allows the maracas to comfortably fit in your hand. [7] X Research source If the spoon handles are close enough together for you to comfortably hold, then you don't need to wrap them in washi tape unless you prefer to add more decorations!"

Once your maracas are held together securely, decide if you want to add any additional decorations aside from the washi tape. You could place small stickers over the plastic eggs and spoons to make your maracas stand out. Alternatively, you can get creative with paint and make a design or pattern on your maracas to make them bright and colorful. [8] X Research source You could also wrap washi tape down the handle of the spoons for an easy decoration. [9] X Research source"

Empty the bottles and clean them out thoroughly with hot, soapy water before you use them. Make sure that they are completely dry before you begin filling them. [10] X Research source 2 plastic bottles will make 2 maracas. Get more plastic bottles if you want to make extra maracas. Check that each bottle has a secure lid."

Wait until the paint dries before you use the maracas. Feel free to decorate your maracas with other craft items too, such as plastic beads, buttons, ribbon, or washi tape. [21] X Research source"
