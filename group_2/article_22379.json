[1] X Research source To keep the croissants from sticking, you can either line the sheet with parchment paper. If you're worried about burning the tops/bottoms, double up on your sheet pans (use 2 stacked on top of each other). That will give it some extra insulation so the bottoms won't burn. If the croissant isn't warm enough but it's starting to get too brown, lay some foil directly on top of it."

If you want something more savory, for example, you can top a croissant with mustard and a few slices of deli meat.

      "content": "Toast your croissant for short intervals. Different toasters have different heat settings and it's hard to tell exactly how long something will take to heat up. It's a good idea to heat your croissant in small intervals and check it every two or three minutes to see if it's crisped and mildly browned. Croissants are light pastries, so they tend to burn easily. For best results, err on the side of caution and start with a lighter setting. If your croissant is not toasting fast enough, you can increase the heat to a higher setting."

Set the tray in an area in your home where the temperature is between 75 °F (24 °C) and 80 °F (27 °C). Let them sit for an hour to 90 minutes. When completely proofed, you will be able to see clear layers when you view the croissants from the side. Also, if you gently shake the tray, you should see the croissants wiggle slightly. Note: This doesn't apply to pre-made croissants that you roll out of a tube."
