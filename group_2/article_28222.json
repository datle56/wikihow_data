[1] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. It doesn't even have to be fine dining.

      "content": "Plan a day out. If you're like most people, there are probably so many things to do in your area that you've just never gotten around to. Spend an entire day exploring with your significant other, and make a point of going places neither of you have ever been before. Go to a new museum, go paintballing together, or hike a long trail that you've both been interested in, but never had the time for. You never know--you might even get to see a fun new side of the person you love. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Take your partner out for coffee.",
      "content": "Take your partner out for coffee. It sounds so cliché, until you realize that it has been forever since you last took an hour or two to simply sit down across from them at a table to talk. Put your phones on silent and out of sight, and just give each other your full attention."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for a long walk together.",
      "content": "Go for a long walk together. If you go to a nature preserve or big park, bring a field guide to birds or wild flowers and have fun working together to identify what you see. If you're in the city, do a self-guided walking tour together, wander down adorable side streets you've never noticed before, and make lots of stops to smell the roses."

Book a few nights at a cosy bed and breakfast, or visit a nearby city for a few days.

      "content": "Take your partner out dancing. Swing dances often include a brief lesson beforehand for beginners and people who want to brush up on rusty skills, and they can be a lot of fun. Or get up close and personal with a tango class. Nothing says romantic like a jazzy number and a beckoning dance floor."

      "title": "Write your Valentine a note.",
      "content": "Write your Valentine a note. Tell them how much you love them, and include specific things that you love about them, whether it's how passionate they are about the things they love or their strong sense of justice or just the way they smile when they're a little embarrassed. [5] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. Usually the first attempt at writing a note is awkward and disjointed and you run out of space before you've said what you want to. Don't stress: jot down a few ideas on a separate sheet of paper or write an entire first draft before you set anything down in your card."

      "content": "Volunteer with your partner for a cause they care about. If they love dogs, offer to spend a day cleaning kennels and walking dogs at the local SPCA. If they lost a loved one to cancer, then assist with a Relay for Life event in your area.

[7] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. Especially try to note things you might normally take for granted. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a simple, \"Thanks for letting me borrow your coat,\" or \"Thank you for cancelling your plans to be with me when I was sick.\" Try to work in appreciation for general qualities, like, \"You're so thoughtful. I appreciate that you always open the door for me when we go out.\" Or, \"That was so kind of you to give them a ride home. You're a really good friend.\""

      "content": "Sit down together and tell your partner face-to-face what you love about them. Notes are nice and can be saved for another day, but few things are as thoughtful and affirming as having someone look directly into your eyes to tell you how much they love you and why. Try to make it about them. Say things like, \"You're such a compassionate person, and it really comes through in your interactions with people. They can tell how warm and kind you are within minutes of meeting you.\" It's okay to talk about how they make you feel, since you're telling them why you love them, but try not to make it too self-centered. For example, \"You're such an open person that I've always felt like I could tell you anything,\" is great, because it emphasizes a particular quality they possess and it tells them that you trust them. If you compliment them on physical features, be specific. Don't just say, \"You're sexy,\" or \"You're beautiful.\" Say, \"You have gorgeous eyes,\" or \"You walk so confidently, and it's really attractive.\""

When you know someone well, you learn their quirks: how well they like their burgers cooked, what they're allergic to, that they can't stand the texture of artichokes or hearts of palm. When you can actually order for someone, you show your love by actively paying attention to their likes and dislikes and communicating that you want to treat them well."
