Paint that is peeling, chipping, cracking, chalking, or scaling can be a potential sign of lead, as this implies the paint is old.

High-impact areas like windows, doors, baseboards, stairs, railings, and porches tend to deteriorate more quickly and are at a higher risk of exposure because children can chew these areas and they’re more heavily trafficked.

Deteriorating paint is simply a potential sign. To confirm if paint contains lead, you have to get a professional test done. If you notice the paint is deteriorating and suspect it may be lead-based, test the paint so you can address the issue immediately. Check if there are multiple layers of paint, too. This can be a sign that the lead paint was painted over to encapsulate it."
