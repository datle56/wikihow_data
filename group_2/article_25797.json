      "content": "Give yourself permission to say no. Many people have a natural reaction to say \"Yes\" when they're asked to do someone a favor. Keep in mind, you are never required to say \"Yes.\" It's actually okay to say \"No\" sometimes. Accept this as you prepare to say \"No\" to someone. This will help you say \"No\" with ease. [1] X Research source If you never say \"No,\" this can have negative consequences. You can enable someone who relies too much on you for favors. You can also burn out on your own end and lose focus. If you say \"No\" too often, you may miss out on things that may be good for you. If you're overcommitted to doing things you don't want to do, you won't have much time left for yourself. Make time for the things you really enjoy rather than saying \"Yes\" as a knee-jerk response. If you, say, agreed to help a friend move all weekend, you may have to turn down an invitation to go on a weekend hiking trip with another group of friends."

Many people think if they can do something, they should. Your reason for saying \"No\" can be a simple matter of your own personal boundaries. Think about what boundaries you have, and embrace the fact you're allowed to stay true to them. [3] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Consider what you are reasonably able to do, and what you actually enjoy doing. You can say \"No\" to things that drain you or distract you. You can set specific boundaries regarding what you will and will not agree to do. For example, maybe you value solitude. You can set a boundary that you won't go out two nights each weekend. You can use this boundary as a reason for saying \"No.\" For instance, \"I would love to go out with you Saturday, but I have plans Friday. I never go out two nights in a row because I get too tired.\" You can also set boundaries in regard to personal commitments. You can, for example, have a rule that you only volunteer for two charity events per month if this is reasonable for you given your schedule."

Remember, just because someone did you a favor does not mean you owe them. Friends do not keep score. People may also ask twice. If you say \"No\" to one thing, they may try to get you to agree to a smaller commitment or favor. Remember to be firm. Keep saying \"No.\" A person may also try to get you to do something by comparing you to other people. They may say another person agreed to help. You are not that person. You do not have to do something simply because someone else did."

Your knee-jerk response to being asked for a favor may be to say \"Yes.\" Make a habit of not giving an automatic \"Yes\" all the time. When asked to do something, instead respond with, \"I'll think about it\" or \"Can I get back to you on that? I'd like to, but I might have something scheduled.\" [7] X Research source Saying \"I'll think about it\" will usually get the person off your back. This will give you time to genuinely consider your response. After agreeing to think something over, you can decide later whether or not you agree. If you decide against doing something, you can give a firm \"No\" later. For example, a friend asks if you'll watch her cat over the holiday weekend. Say, \"I have to look over my schedule.

If you do not want to do something, then you don’t have to do it. Try to remind yourself of this in situations where you can’t think of a reason to say no. For example, if a friend invites you to see a concert with him or her and you simply don’t like live music, then say so. Try saying, “No thanks. I am not a fan of live music, so I am going to sit this one out.” Or, if someone invites you out on a night when you just don’t feel like going anywhere, then try saying, \"You know, I really don't feel like coming out tonight, maybe another time.\""
