      "title": "Improve your balance.",
      "content": "Improve your balance. Practice balancing exercises to increase overall agility. This not only strengthens your muscles, it also helps focus your activity on a small scale. Try standing on one leg with your other leg out in front of you. After holding it for ten seconds, switch legs and do the same. You can also use a mirror to ensure that your legs are straight. Do handstands or cartwheels when you feel you've mastered beginner's balancing. These will help you improve your coordination as well as your balance. Make sure your weight is distributed evenly. You don't want to injure or strain certain areas when all your body should be working together. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Train with weights. There are multiple types of exercises that you can do that focus on different muscle groups. Work progressively, starting with handheld weights and moving to heavier weights as you build up strength. Do squats and deadlifts to strengthen the muscles in your legs and hamstrings. You can hold one hand weight in each hand while you perform the squat or deadlift, although deadlifts traditionally call for barbells. You can also use a barbell for squats. If you choose this option, place the barbell over your shoulder. You can do bench presses or other arm exercises. This increases your arm strength, which in turn will help you with activities such as throwing and catching. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Perform cone taps. Place one cone in front of you. Lift one leg high, gently tapping the top of the cone with the ball of your foot before returning it to resting position. Repeat with the opposite foot. Switch back and forth for three sets of 30-second drills. This exercise strengthens feet muscles and ankles. It also makes you lighter on your feet and increases foot coordination. Try to not trip over the cone. If you find you are knocking over the cone, slow your movements down until you are no longer hitting the cone. Once you've mastered this exercise at one level, increase your speed to gain more skill and balance. You can also add more 30 second repetitions. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Do ladder drills.",
      "content": "Do ladder drills. Using an agility ladder, which is about 10 yards (9 m) long with 18 inch (45.7 cm) blocks, run through each rung of the ladder slowly. On each step, pump your arms high and bring your knee up to your chest, changing arms and legs as you make your way through the ladder. Once at the end of the ladder, return to where you started to complete one drill. Complete each drill you perform 2 to 4 times, increasing repetitions once as you get better at them. You can also increase your speed as you improve. If you do not have an agility ladder, you can create your own with sticks and string or with tape. As an alternative, try this exercise going sideways instead of forward. Jump sideways between rungs before lifting your leg and arm as you do in the original exercise. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Run suicide runs. Start by running about 20 feet (6 m) away. As soon as you reach that point, turn around and run back to where you began. Without stopping, turn around and run 30 feet (9.1 m) away, then return back to start. Finally, without stopping, turn and run 40 feet (12.2 m) away, then return back to start. Complete multiple cycles of these runs for the best results. You can also extend the distance once the initial runs become too easy for you. These are great ways to improve your strength, speed, balance, and precision. Do these a few times a week to fully see the benefits."

      "content": "Jump hurdle drills. Set up a 5-10 count row of 6 or 12 inch (15.2 or 30.5 cm) hurdles in a straight line. Starting beside the first hurdle, jump over it with your first leg, pausing for a few seconds before you drop your other leg to stand in between the first two hurdles. Jump back over the first hurdle, returning to start. After this, repeat the same lateral jump across block 1 and then block 2 before moving back to start. Follow the same pattern for all the blocks, jumping over all of the hurdles before returning to start. Repeat with your other side, turning around and leading with your opposite leg. Once you have mastered this, try increasing your speed over the hurdles, removing the pause in between each jump. Instead of hurdles, you can use cones, yoga blocks, or any 6 to 12 inch (15.2 to 30.5 cm) object you have on hand. Just make sure it is in a shape that is easy to jump over and that won't cause injury. [6] X Research source If you are just beginning, try the 6 inch (15.2 cm) first. If that is still too tall, try a smaller object or simply jump imaginary hurdles in the air. After completing a few weeks of this exercise, you can add additional height. The purpose of these types of drills is to increase your balance and stride length. This will help you improve your performance in sports such as tennis, soccer, and football. [7] X Research source"
