      "content": "Learn the definition of irregular verbs. To truly learn irregular verbs, you need to first understand what makes a verb irregular. An irregular verb is any one that doesn't follow the standard rule of making a verb past tense. The standard rule is to add \"-ed\" to a verb to make it past tense. [1] X Research source For instance, a regular verb is \"to want.\" To make it past tense, you add \"-ed\" to it, making it \"wanted.\" \"Wanted\" is also the past participle. The past participle is what usually follows \"have\" or \"has\" in English, such as \"I have wanted.\" An irregular verb doesn't follow this rule. For instance, \"to begin\" is an irregular verb. The past tense is \"began,\" while the past participle is \"begun.\" Irregular verbs don't follow any specific patterns. Some irregular verbs are different in American and British English. Try to focus on one or the other when you're learning irregular verbs. [2] X Research source For instance, British English adds \"t\" at the end of more verbs to make them past tense, such as \"dreamt.\""

      "title": "Understand that some irregular verbs stay the same in each form.",
      "content": "Understand that some irregular verbs stay the same in each form. A verb like \"set\" is the same in the infinitive, the past tense, and the past participle. That means that you don't change it all for these three forms. [3] X Research source You would say, \"I set the book down here\" (present), \"I set it there yesterday\" (past tense), and \"I have set it there\" (past participle). Other verbs that fall into this category include the following: let, spread, shed, thrust, split, upset, hurt, shut, put, burst, hit, cut, and cost."

      "title": "Look for verbs that stay the same in the past tense and past participle.",
      "content": "Look for verbs that stay the same in the past tense and past participle. Other verbs change when going from present tense to past tense. However, they stay the same when moving from the past tense to the past participle. For example, \"keep\" and \"shoot\" are examples of these verbs. [4] X Research source For \"keep,\" you'd say, \"I keep this with me all the time\" (present), \"I kept it with me all the time\" (past tense), or \"I have kept it with me the whole time\" (past participle). These verbs fall into several patterns. Some verbs change vowels, such as \"sit\" (\"sat\") and \"get\" (\"got\"). Some verbs add \"t\" at the end, often exchanged for a vowel or consonant elsewhere in the word. Examples include \"feel\" (\"felt\"), \"lend\" (\"lent\"), \"keep\" (\"kept\"), or \"build\" (\"built\"). Other verbs add \"d,\" sometimes with an extra vowel or vowel/consonant changes, such as \"pay\" (\"paid\"), \"say\" (\"said\"), \"sell\" (\"sold\"), \"tell\" (\"told\"), \"hear\" (\"heard\"), and \"stand\" (\"stood\"). Verbs like \"bring,\" \"buy,\" \"fight,\" and \"think\" change to \"brought,\" \"bought,\" \"fought,\" and \"thought.\" These verbs add \"ght.\" [5] X Research source"

Unfortunately, this category includes some of the most common verbs, such as \"be\" and \"go.\" [6] X Research source For instance, for \"to be,\" you'd say, \"I am here\" (present), \"I was there\" (past), and \"I have been there\" (past participle). In this category, some verbs take \"-en\" in the past participle, such as \"break-broke-broken,\" \"fall-fell-fallen,\" \"ride-rode-ridden,\" \"see-saw-seen,\" and \"speak-spoke-spoken.\" Other verbs change the vowel to an \"e\" in the past tense and/or add \"wn\" in the past participle. Examples include \"flow-flew-flown,\" \"draw-drew-drawn,\" \"show-showed-shown,\" and \"grow-grew-grown.\" Still others take different vowels in each form, such as \"swim-swam-swum,\" \"begin-began-begun,\" \"sing-sang-sung,\" and \"drink-drank-drunk.\""

Verbs like \"light\" become shorter in the past tense and past participle (\"lit\"). That can confuse some learners. \"Shoot\" is another example, as it becomes \"shot\" in the past and past participle. [7] X Research source"

You'll notice them because the sentence will be in past tense, but the verb won't end in \"-ed.\" Use context clues to help you. If the whole passage is in past tense, then the sentence you're reading is likely in past tense, too, even if the verb doesn't have \"-ed\" at the end."
