      "content": "Decide which foot you will take off with. The takeoff foot is the one that hits the takeoff board; it is the foot you jump off the board with. Generally, a right-handed long jumper takes off with the left foot. New jumpers can try both styles to see which works best. [1] X Research source To determine your takeoff foot, have a friend gently push you from behind. The foot you step forward from is your dominant foot and can be used for the takeoff. Alternatively, you can determine your takeoff foot by thinking about which foot you kick with or which foot leads when you jump over something, such as a hurdle."

      "content": "Figure out the number of strides you will take. Practice your run-up several times to determine how many strides you'll take before performing the jump. Generally, the number of strides corresponds to your age, for example: [2] X Research source 10 years = 10-11 strides 11 years = 10-12 strides 12 years = 11-13 strides 13 years = 12-14 strides 14 years = 13-15 strides 15 years = 14-16 strides 16 years = 15-17 strides 17 years = 15-21 strides"

      "content": "Determine your starting point. To discover the starting point for your jump, start with your back to the sand pit at the point you will jump from. Run toward the area you generally start from, but only run the same number of strides you have determined you will take before jumping . The spot where you end your last stride is your starting point. Do this several times and adjust your starting point if necessary. [3] X Research source Another way to determine your starting point is to begin from a certain point on the track and run forward the number of strides you have determined you will take. Mark the point of your last stride. Do this several times so you can find an average distance based on the number of strides you take."

      "content": "Place markers at your starting point. You'll need to use visible markers that will stand out from other jumpers who have a similar starting point. You can put cones, small flags, brightly colored rocks, or colored tape at your starting point. Place them off to the side of the track so they don't get in the way of jumpers or people competing in other events."

      "content": "Run down the track. Gradual acceleration is key, and after a few strides you should be in an upright sprinting position. Keep your head and eyes up rather than looking down. Run full speed until you reach the takeoff board."

      "content": "Plant your takeoff foot flat on the ground. It's important that you plant your takeoff foot flat on the ground, rather than using your heel or toe. If you take off heel-first, your speed will be reduced. If you take off on your toes, your jump will be unstable and you're also at a higher risk for injury. [4] X Research source"

When your heels touch the pit, press your feet down and pull your hips up. This, in addition to your momentum, will carry your body past the mark where your heels touched down."
