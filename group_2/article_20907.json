      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. Performing a subcutaneous injection properly requires more than just a needle, syringe, and medicine. Before proceeding, make sure you have the following: [1] X Research source A sterile dose of your medication (usually in a small, labeled vial). A suitable syringe with a sterile needle tip. Depending on the size of your patient and the amount of medication to be administered, you may choose to use one of the following configurations or another safe, sterile means of injection: A 0.5 or 1 cc syringe with a 27-gauge needle A pre-filled, disposable syringe A container for safely disposing of your syringe, such as an empty plastic milk container. Tape over the lid to secure it after putting a syringe inside and then dispose of the container. A sterile gauze pad (usually 2 x 2 inches) A sterile adhesive bandage (note - make sure the patient is not allergic to the adhesive, as can lead to irritation near the wound) A clean towel"

      "title": "Ensure you have the correct medication, dosage, patient, route, and date.",
      "content": "Ensure you have the correct medication, dosage, patient, route, and date. Most subcutaneously-injected medications are clear and come in similarly-sized containers. Thus, it's easy to get them mixed up. Double-check the medication's label to ensure you have the right medication and dosage before proceeding. Then, check the patent’s name, the route of injection, and the date before administering. Note - some medication vials contain only a single dose, while some contain enough medication for multiple doses. Ensure you have enough medication to administer the recommended dose before continuing. Heparin subcutaneous injections often come in pre-filled syringes, so it will be easier to administer the medication."

      "title": "Prepare a clean, ordered work area.",
      "content": "Prepare a clean, ordered work area. When performing a subcutaneous injection, the less you have to come in contact with un-sterilized materials, the better. Having all your tools laid out ahead of time in a clean, easily-accessible work area makes the process of injection quicker, easier, and more sanitary. Lay your towel on a clean surface within easy reach of your intended work site. Lay your tools on the towel. Arrange your supplies on the towel in the order you will need them. Note: You can make a small tear on the edge of your alcohol wipe packages (one that doesn't puncture the inner pocket containing the alcohol wipe) to make them easier to quickly open when you need them."

    {
      "title": "Choose an injection site.",
      "content": "Choose an injection site. Subcutaneous injections are meant to be given into the layer of fat below the skin. Certain areas of the body allow this fatty layer to be accessed more easily than others. Your medication may come with instructions about which specific injection site to use - check with your local health care professional or the medication's manufacturer if you are uncertain of where to administer your medication. Below is a common list of sites for subcutaneous injections: The fatty part of the tricep on the side and back of the arm between the elbow and shoulder. The fatty part of the leg on the outside front portion of the thigh between the hips/groin and knee. The fatty part of the frontal abdomen below the ribs, above the hips, and not directly adjacent to the belly button. Use 3 fingers placed under the belly button to find the location. Note: It's important to rotate injection sites, as repeated injections into the same location can cause scarring and hardening of the fatty tissue, making future injections more difficult and interfering with absorption of the medication."

    {
      "title": "Wipe the injection site.",
      "content": "Wipe the injection site. Using a fresh, sterile alcohol wipe, clean the injection site by gently wiping in a spiral motion from the center outward, being careful not to go back over already clean areas. Allow the site to air dry. Before wiping, if necessary, expose the area of the body where the injection will be given by moving any clothing, jewelry, etc. away. This will not only make it easier to give the injection without obstruction, but also reduce the risk of infection from un-sterilized clothing coming into contact with the injection wound before it's bandaged. If, at this point, you discover the skin at the injection site you've chosen is irritated, bruised, discolored, or distressed in any other way, pick a different site."

    {
      "title": "Wash your hands",
      "content": "Wash your hands with soap and water. Because subcutaneous injections pierce the skin, it's important for the person administering the injection to wash his or her hands. Washing kills any bacteria present on the hands, which, if accidentally transferred to the small wound caused by the injection, can cause infection. After washing, dry thoroughly. Be sure to wash methodically, ensuring all the surfaces of your hands receive soap and water. Studies have shown that the vast majority of adults don't wash their hands well enough to kill all of the bacteria. [2] X Research source Wear a clean pair of gloves if possible."

Using your non-dominant hand, gather about 1 1 ⁄ 2 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) of skin between your thumb and index finger creating a slight mound of skin, taking care not to bruise or damage the surrounding area. By bunching up the skin, you create a thicker area of fat for you to inject into, ensuring the entire dose is administered into the fat and not into the underlying muscle. [6] X Trustworthy Source Immunization Action Coalition Nonprofit organization focused on promoting the use of vaccines by distributing information about vaccines and the diseases they prevent. Go to source When gathering your skin, do not gather any muscle tissue. You should be able to feel the difference between the soft upper fat layer and firmer, lower muscle tissue. Subcutaneous medications are not intended for injection into the muscle and, if administered into muscle, may result in bleeding into the muscle tissue. This is especially true if the medication has blood-thinning properties. However, the needles used for a subcutaneous injection are usually too small to hit the muscle, so this should not be a problem."

Usually, the needle should be inserted into the skin at 90 degrees (straight up and down, relative to the skin) to ensure that the medication is injected into the fatty tissue. However, for exceptionally thin or muscular people with little subcutaneous fat, you may need to insert the needle at a 45-degree angle (diagonally) to avoid injecting it into muscle tissue. Make sure to gather the skin and hold it gently while giving the injection.
