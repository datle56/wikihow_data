      "title": "Be assertive.",
      "content": "Be assertive. You want to make sure that your personality is dominating and that your presence can't be ignored. Otherwise, who is going to notice that you've got attitude? Practice doing this so that you can pull it off naturally. Assert your independence by not following along with things just because they are popular (clothing styles, popular music, t.v. shows, movies, etc.). Act as if you are far better than other people and therefore more deserving of things. [1] X Research source You want to couple this with your assertiveness. Do things like borrow your sister's clothes without permission, heckle your parents into buying you an iPhone, play your music really loudly late at night when other people are trying to sleep. Never apologize for your actions. Be stubborn. When people try to get you to act differently, do something you don't want to do, or change your behavior, make sure that you stick to your guns. You're going to have attitude however other people feel about it."

      "title": "Ignore consequences.",
      "content": "Ignore consequences. When you have attitude you're going to get a lot of flak for the way you're acting. People (in particular, adults) are not going to be happy with you and they'll probably try to mete out punishment. To have proper attitude, you'll need to ignore these consequences, or do things in spite of the consequences. [2] X Research source Ignore what you don't want to deal with and dismiss anything except what you want to do. This means not doing your homework, or your chores and spending the time watching movies, playing video games, hanging out with your friends, etc. instead. Ignore reality. Everything that you do is going to have consequences. The more you have attitude towards the authority figures in your life, the more you're going to be punished. Likewise ignoring things like school, trying to get a job, or expecting things to simply fall into your lap, are probably not going to work out well for you. To maintain your attitude, you're going to have to ignore these potential consequences."

      "title": "Question authority.",
      "content": "Question authority. Part of having an attitude is questioning the people who have the power to make you do things you don't want to do and punish you if you don't do them. Learning to question their decisions and commands is actually a useful skill that develops your independent thinking. [3] X Research source Use the phrases \"But so and so's mom always lets her do it\" or \"But everyone else gets to do it,\" when you're trying to get your parental units to do let you do something they don't want you to do. Always ask why when someone asks you to do something (this works especially well for parents and teachers). For example, if you hate math, make sure to ask your math teacher what the point of algebra is. If your parents set a bedtime, challenge that bedtime and ask them why you have to go to bed at that time. Disobey rules. Another way to have attitude and severely irritate those in authority, is to disobey the rules that they set in place. When they punish you (if they catch you), act like you don't care and ignore the punishments, as well. Do things like stay out past your curfew, borrow the car without permission, go out with friends without telling anyone where you are. When you get grounded, or otherwise punished, ignore the punishment. Constantly push the boundaries, at school and at home, to see how far you can go without getting in trouble. Just operate under the assumption that everyone has a breaking point and that you can push them to it by constantly arguing with them, lying to them, and rebelling against their rules."

      "title": "Cultivate an air of disinterest.",
      "content": "Cultivate an air of disinterest. Copping an attitude means not giving a single care about other people. You need to have an air of \"I'd rather be anywhere but here\" whatever it is that you're doing. This is especially important when your parents, or authority figures want you to do something. [4] X Research source The use of “yeah, whatever” to any attempt to get you engaged in activities that you don't want to do, and a scoffing laugh, can get your attitude across perfectly well. Using sarcasm can be a very effective tool to showing your disinterest and superiority. These phrases are particularly good for having an attitude (said in a sarcastic tone): “how interesting” and “I am so glad you told me that.\" Laugh derisively when given a suggestion or a talking to by an authority figure. This will show them how little you care for their opinion. Make sure that when people are talking to you that you are busy texting on your phone. You can also do this in class when you're not interested in whatever the teacher has to say. Be uncommunicative. When your parents take an interest, make sure to respond as shortly as possible. For example: when they ask “How was your day?” you shrug and mutter, “Fine.” If they ask “What are you doing this weekend?” just say, “eh...whatever.”"

      "title": "Dress the part.",
      "content": "Dress the part. You need to make sure that people notice your attitude and one way to do that is to dress with the intent of showing how little you care, or by actively trying to piss people off. Wear things your parents won't approve of like clothing that doesn't fit you right, has inappropriate slogans on it, or is dirty and ripped. Create your own style. You want to make sure people know that you don't care what they think about you and one way to do that is to be obvious about crafting your own style. Remember, you don't just want to wear all black to show your attitude (anyone can do that), you want to make yourself unique . Piercings and tattoos are all the rage with the rebellious and those who are trying to really piss their parents off. You will need to be over 18, however, to get a tattoo or piercing without parental consent, unless you go to an disreputable place (and that's bad for things like infections, so it's not recommended."

      "title": "Use the right body language.",
      "content": "Use the right body language. Body language is the perfect way to communicate how you're feeling. Showing the proper amount of attitude means using the right body language, so that other people know what's up. Cross your arms across your chest. While this is a defensive gesture, it can also be a gesture of irritation or boredom and can mean that you aren't interested in the person or persons you're with. Rolling eyes is a great way to express irritation or derision towards another person. Whatever they say make sure to roll your eyes, especially if you've gotten in trouble for breaking rules. Not making eye contact or making too much eye contact are good ways to show attitude. Not making eye contact can be really irritating to other people because it shows a lack of interest on your part. Making too much eye contact can be intimidating. Slamming doors and making a lot of angry noise (like playing angry music really loudly) can show your displeasure and disrupt everyone else's life. It's especially good to use this tactic after you've had an argument with an authority figure. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't let anyone into your physical space. Your room is your own personal realm and you get to rule it however you want, and that includes letting people (like your family) into it, when and if you choose to do so. [6] X Research source Yell at family members who try to come into your room. Put signs on your door that it'll be instant death for anyone who tries to come into your room without your express invitation. If someone knocks on your door, tell them to \"go away!\""

      "title": "Say whatever comes into your head.",
      "content": "Say whatever comes into your head. Don't filter the things that you say. If they're rude, so what? You're looking to have an attitude and an attitude means not caring how the things you do and say affect others. [7] X Research source Point out the mistakes of others. When people screw up (especially adults like your parents or your teacher) make sure that you ridicule them for it. Say things like \"Oh my god, mom, I can't believe you burnt dinner. Can't you do anything right?\" [8] X Research source Speaking your mind is a great skill to cultivate and it is also one that will serve you well if you're copping an attitude. If someone is wearing a truly hideous outfit, make sure that you tell them so. If your friend is acting like an idiot over a boy, make sure that you mention it loudly."

      "title": "Have a sense of entitlement.",
      "content": "Have a sense of entitlement. This is an important part of having an attitude, because the attitude comes from the belief that you are better than everyone else (hence pointing out mistakes, and shooting down suggestions). Act like people's time and energy belongs to you (especially people like your parents; definitely take them for granted). Act like you know everything. When someone tries to change your mind or convince you otherwise, simply laugh at them or roll your eyes and walk away. [9] X Research source Never say \"please\" or \"thank you.\" These are phrases that are way to polite and mannered for your attitude, so you'll want to avoid them at all costs. Never try to help out around the house and definitely don't try to give your teachers at school a hand, even with something simple like holding the door for them."

      "content": "Hang out with people your parents don't approve of. You will want to make sure that you're hanging out with people who support your attitude, which basically means hanging out with people that your parents won't like or approve of; people who have as much attitude as you do. You can easily find these people at school, as long as you cultivate an air of disinterest in them and in everything, they'll be dying to be friends with you. You definitely want to make sure that the people you're hanging out with are people who aren't going to tell on you to your parents that you stayed out past curfew or your teacher that you haven't done your homework all year."
