      "content": "Flamboyant Naturals have broad shoulders and an athletic figure. The Flamboyant Natural is one of the 13 body types defined in David Kibbe’s 1987 book Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle As Only You Can . In the book, Kibbe describes the body types as falling along a yin/yang spectrum. [2] X Research source Yin represents the more feminine or romantic figure, while yang represents a more masculine or dramatic figure. [3] X Research source Flamboyant Natural falls on the masculine side of the yin/yang spectrum with some feminine characteristics. The Flamboyant Natural body type has long limbs, broad shoulders, and blunt edges. They have the sharp yang bone structure combined with softer yin curves and facial features. When a Flamboyant Natural gains weight, they tend to appear more square and stocky. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Flamboyant Naturals are often tall with broad shoulders and long legs. They are one of the tallest body types and are the most masculine of the 3 Natural body types. If you have most of the following characteristics, your body type is probably a Kibbe Flamboyant Natural.

      "content": "Flamboyant Naturals aren’t petite or extremely curvy. You can also rule out whether you’re a Flamboyant Natural by identifying characteristics they don’t have. This can be helpful if you feel like you fit into two body types. Flamboyant Naturals don’t have the following characteristics: Voluptuous curves Delicate facial features Petite frame Narrow bone structure"

      "title": "Wear clothing that highlights your natural lines.",
      "content": "Wear clothing that highlights your natural lines. Try oversized silhouettes and soft fabrics to balance your blunt characteristics. Avoid sharp tailoring and stiff fabrics. The Flamboyant Natural looks great in relaxed, flowing outfits. Free-spirited boho looks are perfect for you if you have this body type, but you don’t have to limit yourself to any specific clothing style. In general, avoid sharp tailoring, fussy or ornate details, harsh lines, sheer fabrics, and too much symmetry when choosing clothing and accessories. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for tops that are simple with a relaxed fit.",
      "content": "Opt for tops that are simple with a relaxed fit. Off-the-shoulder, open necklines, or boat necks work best with a Flamboyant Natural’s broad shoulders. Long, relaxed fits, asymmetrical hemlines, and drapey or belled sleeves help to relax some of the blunt lines associated with the Flamboyant Natural body type. Avoid lace, ruffles, and other fussy trim, severely structured styles, and cropped lengths."

    {
      "title": "Choose pants with straight or wide legs and light tailoring.",
      "content": "Choose pants with straight or wide legs and light tailoring. Flamboyant Naturals look great in menswear-styled tailored pants with deep pleating, wide legs, and a relaxed fit. When wearing jeans, wide or straight-legged styles work best with your long, lean frame. Avoid tapered legs with gathered waists or sharply tailored, fitted pants."

      "title": "Go for straight maxi skirts for an easy-breezy style.",
      "content": "Go for straight maxi skirts for an easy-breezy style. Choose skirts that are at mid-calf length or longer with slits or button fronts that give you the opportunity to show off your long legs. When shopping for skirts, look for simple details, like pockets or trouser-style pleats. Avoid both full and pencil-slim skirts, opting for pieces that have some movement but aren’t overly flared."

    {
      "title": "Wear long, loose dresses with roomy, dropped waistlines.",
      "content": "Wear long, loose dresses with roomy, dropped waistlines. Simple unstructured dresses that are long and relaxed or oversized complement your broad bone structure. Narrow and relaxed fits with dropped waists are flattering to your vertical lines. Avoid flouncy, ornate styles with super-high necklines that overpower your slim frame. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose sweaters that are soft and relaxed but not too thin.",
      "content": "Choose sweaters that are soft and relaxed but not too thin. Oversized cardigans with chunky or ribbed knits and long lengths are cozy and flattering. Wear rough or ultra-plush (but not fluffy) knits with oversized patterns. Avoid classic sweater sets and fitted crewnecks that may overemphasize your broad shoulders and cropped sweaters that cut off your long lines."

    {
      "title": "Try minimalist coats and jackets that are at least mid-thigh length.",
      "content": "Try minimalist coats and jackets that are at least mid-thigh length. Oversized and unstructured coats fit your broad shoulders and are comfortable to wear. Always wear double-breasted styles open to fit with your relaxed style. Avoid peplums and severely tailored styles that can make your blunt edges seem harsh."

      "title": "Wear shoes with low-to-moderate heels in a simple, classic style.",
      "content": "Wear shoes with low-to-moderate heels in a simple, classic style. If you wear a higher heel, choose chunkier styles, wedges, or stacked heels with square toes. All flats, including classic sneakers, work well for you. Flats inspired by men’s styles are also good choices. Choose materials like suede, leather, and satin (for evening). Avoid stiletto or thin, tapered heels and strappy or overly ornate sandals."

    {
      "title": "Choose soft, flowing fabrics that accentuate your long lines.",
      "content": "Choose soft, flowing fabrics that accentuate your long lines. You can also try heavier fabrics with lots of sheen for eveningwear. Whether lightweight or heavy, wear fabrics that have lots of texture. For example, choose raw silk or shantung instead of smooth silk or chiffon. Avoid lightweight, floaty pieces made of sheer or clingy fabrics and overly stiff pieces made of flat, tightly woven fabrics. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear bold, geometric prints with blended edges and asymmetrical shapes.",
      "content": "Wear bold, geometric prints with blended edges and asymmetrical shapes. These types of prints can soften blunt edges. Pick prints with vivid color combinations that fade into each other. Your long vertical line means you can choose bolder patterns like larger florals and thicker stripes. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Classic earthy prints like animal and tropical are also good choices and add a sophisticated flair. Avoid sharp, symmetrical geometric prints and small or intricate prints. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Go big when it comes to choosing accessories.",
      "content": "Go big when it comes to choosing accessories. Wear oversized statement pieces, like big, funky necklaces, large hats, wide belts, and slouchy totes and handbags. Shiny metals and natural stones fit your vibe perfectly. Chunky or heavy jewelry with rounded edges works best for a Flamboyant Natural. Try handcrafted pieces with bright colors or bold costume jewelry. Avoid delicate jewelry or anything antique and ornate."

      "title": "Try breezy, relaxed hairstyles with lots of tousled layers.",
      "content": "Try breezy, relaxed hairstyles with lots of tousled layers. [12] X Research source When choosing colors, stick with natural sun-kissed highlights or balayage to give your hair dimension and volume. If you have thicker hair, let it go wild in a big lion’s mane style. Flamboyant Naturals with thinner hair can go shorter as long as the style is layered around the face for more volume. You can choose a more drastic hair color as long as you keep the root area closer to your natural shade. Avoid sharply structured bobs or cropped boy cuts and styles that look “done” or slicked back."

      "title": "Wear natural makeup with either bold eyes or lips.",
      "content": "Wear natural makeup with either bold eyes or lips. Flamboyant Naturals look best with a healthy glow, so don’t be afraid to use a little highlighter for a lit-from-within look. Your perfect everyday makeup could be a subtle eye shadow and blush with a bold red lip. [13] X Research source If you go for heavier eye makeup, choose vivid colors and dial down the intensity on the lip with a gloss or lipstick with a bit of shimmer. Avoid thin eyebrows and matte lipsticks in neutrals that can look dull and cold on you. [14] X Research source"

While the body types outlined in David Kibbe’s book can help you develop a flattering personal style, they don’t have to represent you. If you’re categorized as a Flamboyant Natural and don’t like the suggested style, ignore it! Wear what you like. The most important thing is that you feel confident and comfortable in your clothes."

      "content": "Kibbe identified 3 body types that fall within the Natural spectrum. They are Flamboyant Natural, Pure Natural, and Soft Natural. All three of these types have more dominant yang, or male, energy with angular edges and straight, athletic bodies. However, there are a few characteristics that differentiate them from each other. Soft Natural has broad hips and shoulders with a curved waistline. Pure Natural has a lean, muscular body, often with flat hips and a flat bustline. Flamboyant Natural has a long vertical frame with a prominent shoulder line."

      "title": "Flamboyant Natural vs. Soft Natural",
      "content": "Flamboyant Natural vs. Soft Natural The Soft Natural body type is a little closer to the yin side of the spectrum. They have softer bodies that are more proportional. This body type is also a little smaller overall than the Flamboyant Natural, which can make weight gain more obvious on them than the taller Naturals. [16] X Research source"
