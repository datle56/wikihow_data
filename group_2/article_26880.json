      "content": "Soak your paper for a few days. Place the papers in a bowl or bucket and cover them with water. Let the papers soak for two days. This allows the papers to soften and also releases fibers from the papers, which act as a binding agent for your briquettes. [2] X Research source Reuse old scrap paper, such as mail, to make briquettes. This way, you're reusing old waste during the process."

      "content": "Work the paper into a porridge-like paste. After two days have passed, use your hands to knead and squeeze the paper. Keep going until you have a porridge-like mixture. The precise amount of time this will take depends on how much paper you're using. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add in your organic material. Organic material must be mixed into the paper to make briquettes. You can use saw dust, pine needles, rice husks, or chopped leaves and grass. Mix one part soaked paper with three parts of your organic material. [4] X Research source Most organic material will already be fine enough that it should not require shredding. If you're using larger leaves, however, it can't hurt to break them up a bit."

Find a dry place, either in your home or outdoors, where the briquettes will not be disturbed. For example, store the briquettes in a closet in your living room. Avoid humid areas of the home, like the bathroom or kitchen. If you store the briquettes outside, do not leave them in the open air in case it rains. Instead, you could store them in a shed."
