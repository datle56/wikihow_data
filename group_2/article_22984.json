      "content": "Vape cartridges can last a few days to several months, depending on size and use. Two popular size choices for vapes are a half-gram (500mg) or a full-gram (1g). However, some dispensaries carry 250mg for casual smokers or 2g for the seasoned pros. Every vape has an estimated puff count based on the recommended three-second puff. For instance: [1] X Research source 250mg Carts: 25 three-second puffs 500mg Carts: 80-160 three-second puffs 1,000mg (1g) Carts: 160-320 three-second puffs 2,000mg (2g) Carts: 500+ three-second puffs"

      "content": "A vape’s size, potency, pull lengths, and usage habits can impact its lifespan. Before purchasing a vape, there are several things you should consider besides the cost. While purchasing a 1g or 2g cart saves you money in the long run, this can cost you more if you're a casual vaper. Infrequent use of a vape can lead to higher risks of heat damage, bacteria growth, and a decrease in potency. [2] X Research source Pulling longer than three seconds can drain more of the oil and put it at risk of burning or overheating. So, opt for lighter, shorter hits to make a cart last longer. If you have a high tolerance to weed, you may need to take more hits to feel “high,” which can drain a cart faster. Opt for a 2g cart if you’re a frequent user. Additionally, purchase a quality vape from a trusted dispensary. Fake vapes are generally made of lower quality, which can negatively impact a cart’s lifespan."

      "content": "Vapes are more cost-effective than smoking cigarettes or pre-rolls. Whether you get your kick from nicotine or marijuana, vaping has proven to be a cheaper habit that can save smokers nearly thousands of dollars per year. [3] X Research source A standard gram of THC costs between $20 to $60 in the United States, with half-grams as low as $10. However, prices vary depending on the type of weed you're purchasing and how frequently you buy them. [4] X Research source Live Resin THC carts are sourced from fresh marijuana plants and offer a premium vaping experience. These carts can cost between $30 to $80 per cartridge. This could be a cost-friendly option for high-tolerance users who require a more potent vaping experience to feel high. CBD carts, which offer the therapeutic effects of marijuana without the high, can cost between $20 to $50 for premium and non-premium carts. Delta 8 THC carts derived from hemp, while offering a mild high, can cost between $20 to $50 for a half-gram. Stanford University of Medicine created a cost calculator to determine how much smokers spend on vaping/e-cigarettes or cannabis per year. Visit this site to view your estimated yearly expenditure."

      "content": "Choose an appropriate cart size depending on your frequency of use. Do you enjoy hitting your vape throughout the day without much thought? Or is one or two hits just enough? Casual or infrequent vapers should consider a 250mg or half-gram (0.5mg) cartridge since leaving vapes unused can lead to clogging issues or a loss of potency. Regular vapers may consider larger cartridges, like 1g or 2gs, to maximize their vape's lifespan. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the voltage battery settings to low heat. In many disposable or refillable vapes, you can adjust the voltage settings by clicking the device's power or draw button two or three times. While high voltage creates more vapor, this causes the oil to burn faster, lowering its lifespan. [6] X Research source Switch your device to the lower setting to avoid burning the oil."

Draws longer than three seconds can deplete the cannabis concentrate faster, with the increased risk of overheating the oil or cart, which can damage and lower the weed's potency.

      "content": "Store the vape in cool, dark environments. Cannabis vapes have a shelf life of up to 2 years when stored in the proper conditions. Store your vape in cool, dark, dry environments, like a cabinet or drawer when not in use. Avoid leaving a vape in direct sunlight, as this can cause the battery to overheat and the oils to oxidize. If possible, keep the cart upright to avoid leakage. [8] X Research source Some say you can store a cart—without the battery—in a fridge, but not the freezer. Look for signs of discoloration, crystallization, cloudiness, or flavor changes that may indicate the cannabis has degraded or expired."

      "content": "Clean your vape after each use or once a week. Vapes end up everywhere—in your pocket, under your bed, or in the cushions of your couch. When this happens, they're prone to getting dirt, debris, and crumbs stuck in the mouthpiece or charging port, which can make a vape not work. Take a toothpick, Q-tip, or alcohol pad to remove debris or built-up e-liquid to keep the device working properly. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Top off the e-liquid in refillable vapes, if necessary. To get the most out of your carts, use a toothpick to gather any remaining droplets inside the cart. However, once it's out—it's out. Continuous use can overwork the coils and lead to a burnt taste in your mouth. Instead, fill a vape by purchasing fresh oil from a local dispensary. Use a syringe or medicine dropper to transfer liquid from its bottle to the cart. Push the syringe tip into the vape cartridge, filling to the max line. [10] X Research source You can also purchase a pre-filled cartridge and screw or snap it onto your vaping device. Make cannabis oil at home by extracting oil from a cannabis nugget between a piece of parchment paper and heating it with a straightening iron. Transfer the rosin to a small bottle, add a few drops of terpenes, and heat it."

      "title": "Delta 8 is a less potent cannabis compound compared to Delta 9.",
      "content": "Delta 8 is a less potent cannabis compound compared to Delta 9. While both strains derive from the same cannabis plant, when Delta 9 is smoked or consumed beyond a certain point, users may experience a high that marijuana is well-known for. On the other hand, Delta 8 is less potent, causing users to run through it faster to experience similar psychoactive effects as Delta 9. [11] X Research source Delta 8 has approximately one-quarter to one-third less potency than Delta 9. Delta 8 THC is a hemp-deprived product and doesn’t have as many legal restrictions as marijuana. It can be purchased legally in most states."

      "content": "Yes—vapes can last up to 2 years before losing potency and flavor. Several factors, including heat, light, and air exposure, humidity levels, storage, and usage, can affect how long a cannabis vape can last, which is why proper storage is important. Similarly, carts can grow mold, harming your health if inhaled. It's best to dispose of old cartridges and use a fresh one properly. Using an old or expired cart may cause users to experience nausea, respiratory discomfort, or headaches. Pay attention to a cartridge's taste, smell, color, and clarity. If the oil looks darker, this is a sign of potential degradation. Dab pens have the same shelf life of up to 2 years."

      "title": "The effects of cannabis can last between 6 to 12 hours.",
      "content": "The effects of cannabis can last between 6 to 12 hours. When you smoke or vape weed, it delivers THC into your lungs, bloodstream, and brain. It can take a few minutes to start feeling the effects—with the full effect peaking within 30 minutes. Generally, smoking can last up to 6 hours after each use. Ingestion, on the other hand, travels through your stomach and liver before getting into your bloodstream. It can take 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingesting to feel the full effects, which can last up to 12 hours. [12] X Research source Residue effects can last up to 24 hours in either case. However, that isn't as common. Inhaling cannabis includes joints, bowls/bongs, vaping, and dab pens. However, dabbing—which is a highly concentrated dose of THC—can last anywhere between 2 to 10 hours and can stay in your system for up to 4 weeks. [13] X Research source Ingesting cannabis includes beverages or edibles, like \"pot brownies\" or \"canna-butter.\""
