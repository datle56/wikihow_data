      "content": "Let the shirt slip over a shoulder for a flirty feel. If you’re comfortable, and the shirt is big enough, this can be a great way to emphasize how casual you are while still showing off some skin!

      "content": "Create a dress out of an oversized t-shirt. Start by slipping your body through the neck hole so that the shirt hangs around your breasts with the sleeves hanging down. If the shirt looks odd, you’re doing it right! Then, grasp the sleeves and tuck them into your bra so they form a fringe over your breasts. Make sure to overlap the sleeves to make a complete fringe! In seconds, you can go from drab t-shirt to simple but cute dress! [7] X Research source To accentuate your breasts, take the sleeve and tie the together outside your shirt beneath your breasts. Note that this only works well with t-shirt that doesn't have a logo. For a bonus look, create fake “pockets” by inverting the sleeves and tucking them into the shirt. This will create a “pockets” look, and you can even put your hands in them. Just don’t forget that they aren’t actually real pockets!"

Cut as low as you want - a simple muscle tank can show off a cute bralette, while a more adventurous muscle tank can show off your belly as well! [8] X Research source Make sure you keep the hem intact, so the t-shirt doesn't fall apart. Pair with skinny jeans or leather for a bold statement during a night out."
