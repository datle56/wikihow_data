      "content": "Gather your materials. Making a clay keychain requires mold-and-bake clay (also known as polymer clay), a small cookie cutter, a large needle or toothpick, and a split ring or keychain assembly. Make sure to cover your space with newspaper or something that can keep the clay from sticking onto the table! Split rings come in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can buy larger ones that a decorative clay shape can be directly attached to or you can buy a more complex split ring and chain assembly that is made specifically to attach your own keychain art to. Pick whichever one you like. You can even reuse parts from an old keychain if you have one lying around."

      "content": "Roll a small piece of the mold-and-bake clay to a thickness of about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.3 cm), using a rolling pin or other rolling tool (you may even be able to use a pen or pencil). The clay should come out smooth and the thickness should be uniform throughout. If desired, press more than one color together to create a swirled effect. You can even make small shapes and press them into a larger piece of the clay. Be creative!"

      "content": "Use a cookie cutter to cut the clay into the desired shape. Choose the shape of your choice, such as a flower for Mother's Day, a clover for St. Patrick's Day, a heart for Valentine's Day. Sports fans will enjoy a keychain shaped like a basketball, baseball or football. You can also create your own shape for your key chain with a sharp paring knife or utility knife."

      "content": "Create a hole approximately 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) from the top of the shape, using a sharp object such as a needle or toothpick. This hole will be used to attach your clay shape to the split ring, so make sure the hole is in a position that will make this possible. Many mold-and-bake clays allow you to attach small jewelry findings, such as small metal loops, directly into the clay before baking. If the clay you purchased allows this, it may be a good idea to attach a loop of wire to your clay shape so that a split ring can be easily attached to it later."

      "content": "Gather your materials. You will need to collect at least two colors of craft foam (one that has adhesive on it and one that doesn't), scissors, and a split ring or key chain assembly. You do not need a ton of craft foam! Even pieces only a few inches long and a few inches wide will work just fine. In fact, this project is a good one to use up scraps from other projects."

      "content": "Cut out small squares of the adhesive craft foam measuring approximately 2 1 ⁄ 2 inches (6.4 cm) each. You will need to cut out as many squares as letters you want on your keychain. Alternatively, use up to four different colors to create a keychain with layers of color. When deciding which letters to put on your keychain consider using your initials (if the keychain is for you) or a simple four letter word that is important to you, such as \"love\" or \"cute\". You don't want a huge keychain hanging off your keys, so keep it short and sweet."

Use block letters to draw each letter to that when you cut out the letter the center of the letter will be the color of the foam, not the color of your pen or pencil. Try a creative design or font that will make the letters unique but legible."

If the letter you are cutting out has a central area that you need to cut out, start cutting in the center of the area, away from the edge line. This way you can be careful and gradually cut away the foam up to the line."

      "content": "Gather your materials. To make a lanyard keychain all you will need is a split ring or keychain assembly and some thin rope or plastic lacing. The rope or lacing will need to be at least four times as long as you would like your finished lanyard to be, so lengths will vary, but they need to be at least three feet long so you will have enough rope to handle. [1] X Research source Cut two pieces of the rope or lacing the same length. It is nice if each is a different color, so that your finished keychain is colorful and so it's easier to keep track of where you are in your weaving process. Some people like to make these keychains with paracord, so that if you are ever in an emergency and you need a bit of rope, you will have it with you! [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Thread both ropes through the ring or keychain assembly. Make sure the center of each rope is positioned at the ring (unless you are using a weaving technique that requires something different). Secure the ring to a flat surface with a piece of tape. This will allow you to have a secure project as you weave. You should now have four ends of rope to weave together. Pick a spot to attach your ring that allows you to have a lot of room to weave your ropes together. A great spot is a table that is free of clutter."

There are a variety of techniques you could use for weaving your keychain, but even a simple braid can look beautiful with the right rope or plastic lacing. Whichever technique you use, make sure to keep your strands tight and don't be afraid to undo a bit of your weaving if you find you have made a mistake. It's better to fix a problem now than notice it in your keychain forever. For an assortment of weaving techniques see: How to Make a Cobra With Plastic String , How to Make Lanyards , and How to Make a Box Styled Gimp . Any technique you have used for lanyards or friendship bracelets should work for making a keychain."
