      "content": "Show her through your actions that you deserve forgiveness. To a Virgo woman, actions will always speak louder than words. If there’s something you broke that can be fixed, definitely put in the effort to do so. Some things will take longer to mend – if you broke her trust or hurt her feelings, for example. But for others, you can take steps to fix things right away! [8] X Research source If you ruined something she loved, like a piece of clothing or a nice vase, you can find a way to replace it. Or, if you promised to come to an event and then didn't show, clear your schedule so you can be at the next one. Let her know you want to be someone she can count on and then stick to that. If your mistake doesn't have a simple fix, you can still promise to be better and then keep that promise. Acknowledge that you know you struggle with [anger, jealousy, loyalty – whatever it may be]. Then, make sure she knows that you really want to improve and that you'll work hard to do so. This should go a long way with a Virgo woman, making her way more likely to forgive and forget!

      "title": "She’ll be frustrated if your apology isn’t grounded in facts.",
      "content": "She’ll be frustrated if your apology isn’t grounded in facts. Women of this sign usually prefer to make their decisions without a big emphasis on emotions. Instead, they look at the cold, hard truths and make informed decisions from there. Of course, it can be so hard to keep your emotions in check when you're upset, but when apologizing to a Virgo, this will be important. [10] X Research source Centering your apology on how you feel will probably make it harder for you to prove that you understand your mistake – which is all she’ll care about. If you’re afraid you might let your emotions get the best of you, plan out exactly what you want to stay. Then, stick to the facts. State what you did wrong, why you think it happened, acknowledge that you hurt her, and finally, say you’re sorry. For example, avoid phrases like, \"I'm so miserable because I hurt you.\" Instead, go for, \"I know I hurt you and I really regret that. I regret it because you don't deserve to be treated poorly and our relationship is important to me.\""

If she’s not speaking to you and you feel a bit helpless, showing up to her house with chocolates will probably be super tempting. But you should definitely avoid anything that gives her no warning. She'll be more likely to forgive if you offer her a clear apology, time to think, and lots of space. If, either before or after your apology, she needs time to think, don't intrude on that. Instead, just let her know that you'll want to talk whenever she's ready. Then, wait for her to reach back out to you. If she's going to forgive you, she'll need to do so on her own terms."

      "content": "Virgos can be insecure, so she'll need to be told that she's not to blame. She’ll probably have a deep fear that every problem in her life stems from the fact that she’s imperfect.

[17] X Research source For the two of you to move on in a healthy way, it’ll be crucial that your Virgo lady doesn’t internalize the issue. Once you’ve taken some time to really understand your role in her hurt, this should be a snap! Take full ownership of the mistake and explain why you think everything happened the way it did. The clearer you are, the less likely she'll be to believe it was actually about her shortcomings. Avoid pinning blame by saying something like, \"I snapped at you because I was tired, and you started peppering me with questions that I didn't want to answer.\" Instead, you could try something that takes responsibility, like, \"I snapped at you because I was tired and being really careless. It's my fault, and I'm sorry.\""

Last, if you're trying to win a Virgo's forgiveness, loyalty will be important. Make sure she knows you can trust her in every way, and if you've done something to jeopardize that trust, your focus should definitely be on trying to get it back. Showing her that your relationship is full of love and support will make her way more likely to forgive."
