      "content": "Place eggplants in a refrigerator for up to 3 days. Place the eggplants inside of a vegetable bag or a plastic bag with holes. Store the eggplant with other vegetables in a vegetable drawer, but keep it away from fruit like apples and tomatoes. These release gases that can cause the eggplant to over-ripen. [10] X Research source If your vegetable drawers in your refrigerator have a humidity switch, turn it to “high” or “vegetables.” Store your eggplants in the drawer with other humidity-loving vegetables like spinach and peppers. If the fridge's temperature dips below 41 °F (5 °C), your eggplant will begin to form brown pits on the surface. You must throw away the eggplant if this happens."

If you want to save your eggplant for later, either roast it or puree it before putting it into the freezer. It will last for up to 1 year using this method. [11] X Research source To roast the eggplant, slice it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) rounds. Turn the oven to 350 °F (177 °C), and cook it for 15-20 minutes. Wrap the rounds in freezer paper and store them in freezer bags before putting them in the freezer. To puree the eggplant, poke the whole eggplant several times with a fork.

Just make sure to cut them open to speed up the process."
