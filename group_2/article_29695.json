      "content": "Choose the wall or area you want to place your screen on. You can use a white sheet for an indoor or outdoor projector screen, but it’s an especially good choice for backyard setups. Make sure to place your screen somewhere where you’ll have plenty of room for seating, whether audience members are seated on blankets or chairs. If placing your DIY projector screen outdoors, take into account any streetlights or porch lights that may shine onto your screen. If you have any weather concerns, allow enough space to place an event tent or other weather shelter over your screen and seating area. Using a white sheet projector screen indoors will give you the best image quality, but choose the room with the least amount of natural light. Try standing in your chosen room, closing the door, and turning off the lights. Note any significant light seepage coming in from the outside and adjust accordingly."

      "content": "Measure the dimensions of your projector screen. Determine the best height for your screen by multiplying ⅙ by the distance from your screen to the farthest chair or seating area. Calculate the distance between your projector and your screen by determining your projector’s throw distance. Most projectors have a throw ratio of 2.0. In this case, the projector needs to be 2 feet (0.61 m) away from the screen for each 1 foot (0.30 m) of image width. If you’re unsure, use this projector throw distance calculator to figure out how far from the screen your projector should sit. If you’re using your screen indoors, make sure your chosen room has enough space to allow for the necessary dimensions of your projector screen."

      "title": "Choose your screen materials.",
      "content": "Choose your screen materials. Use one twin or full-size white sheet without any patterns or prints. Add a dark backing material to reduce the amount of light peeking through the white sheet. You can use a black bed sheet , or another dark material like a blackout curtain . [1] X Research source Sew together the white and dark sheets or secure them with safety pins. White sheets with higher thread counts will give you better image quality, although you can also fold over or hang multiple low-thread count sheets for the same results. You can also use a white tarp for outdoor or more casual movie screenings. Tarps are weather-resistant, durable, and cheap. However, tarps may show wrinkles or reduce the brightness of your film—make sure to pull the tarp taut and smooth out any large wrinkles."
