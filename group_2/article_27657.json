      "title": "Decide what you want to sell.",
      "content": "Decide what you want to sell. Food items or crafts, such as handmade jewelry, are two great options. Snacks, such as baked goods or beverages can be fun to make and often only require ingredients that are already in your pantry. If you are an aspiring artist or enjoy making crafts, you can earn money by selling your handmade items. These custom made crafts also make great gifts which add to their appeal. Materials for crafts and jewelry making are often cheap and easy to buy at hobby shops."

      "content": "Make the initial investment. If you don't have money to spend on your first batch of food ingredients or crafting materials, then ask your parents or someone else to lend you money (but be sure to pay them back)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread the word.",
      "content": "Spread the word. Let your friends and others know about your plans. Generating excitement beforehand is a great way to gather potential customers. If you’re allowed to, you may even want to make signs to hang up at school to let as many people as possible know about your new business. Just be sure to ask a teacher for permission first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a place to sell your items.",
      "content": "Pick a place to sell your items. You could sell your items at a physical location, for example, at a local farmer’s market or even online. If you would like to sell your goods at a farmer’s market, search online or ask in person at the market to find more information about how to become an official vendor. Look for websites, such as Etsy, that will allow you to set up an online shop. Etsy and other websites often require parents or legal guardians to manage the account, so enlist the help of your parents if you choose this route."

      "title": "Start selling your goods.",
      "content": "Start selling your goods. Be sure to clearly label the prices of what you’re selling and have a friendly, approachable manner to attract customers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Track the money you make.",
      "content": "Track the money you make. One simple way to this is by writing down your income and expenses in a notebook. Keeping track of your budget and income is essential to make sure that you are actually making money. For example, if you are making and selling jewelry, figure out how much you are spending on materials and keep that in mind when deciding how much to charge for each piece. You don’t want to end up actually losing money by charging too little!"

      "title": "Decide what kind of work you would like to do.",
      "content": "Decide what kind of work you would like to do. Opportunities to make money are often right in your neighborhood, from mowing people’s lawns, washing cars, dog walking, or babysitting. Think about what your strengths are. Do you have experience watching over younger siblings? Are you an animal lover? Do you like getting out and being active? Reflecting on these kinds of questions will help you pursue a job that not only pays but is emotionally rewarding for you."

    {
      "title": "Decide what a fair asking rate would be.",

      "title": "Start advertising.",
      "content": "Start advertising. Tell your friends and parents and ask them to spread the word that you are available and looking for a certain type of work. Most people find jobs through words of mouth [2] X Research source but you can also reach more potential customers through other advertising means. Printing out fliers offering your services and putting them up around your neighborhood with contact information can be a great way to reach people who might not otherwise know about your offering. You can also advertise online by posting on social media sites."

      "title": "Be a hard worker.",
      "content": "Be a hard worker. Always be punctual, respectful, and try your best. If you have any questions, it’s always best to ask sooner than later.

      "title": "Ask for referrals.",

      "title": "Brainstorm what your skills are.",
      "content": "Brainstorm what your skills are. Just because you are in middle school, that doesn’t mean you don’t already have specialized skills to offer. With some creative thinking, you might discover you already have a skill you can profit from. Write down a list of your skills, hobbies, or interests. Maybe you are an aspiring barber, enjoy fixing broken electronics, are great at taking photos, or like to code in your spare time. Even activities that you consider to be hobbies, such as using Photoshop to edit your photos, could be a service people are willing to pay you for. If you are feeling stuck, go and ask a parent or someone else who knows you well. They might surprise you by pointing out a skill you didn’t even notice you had."

      "content": "Help older people with technology. A lot of skills you might take for granted, such as the ability to navigate the Internet and other programs such as Word and Photoshop, are actually very difficult for older people to pick up on.

      "content": "Offer to clean or organize. Did you know that there are professional organizers, who work to clean or organize homes, office spaces, and more? If you are a neat and detail-oriented person, de-cluttering other people’s living spaces could be a perfect side job."

      "title": "Find an internship.",
      "content": "Find an internship. Maybe you have a specific interest but know that you don’t have the necessary experience to find work in that area quite yet. A paid internship could be a great opportunity because, not only will you earn money, but you will also be getting paid to learn about your passion and gain valuable work experience. Ask at your school, local businesses, or online to find internships. For example, if you’re interested in botany, you could try visiting different florists, botanical gardens, and the like to see if they would be willing to take on an intern."

    {
      "title": "Ask for referrals.",
      "content": "Ask for referrals. Once you start getting clients, ask them for testimonials or if they would be willing to serve as references. As a middle schooler, you may run into people who doubt your abilities because you are young. Having references will be extremely useful as they prove that you are serious about your work. The more experience you have, the bigger your network of clients will get and eventually you may even start getting people coming to ask you for your services."
