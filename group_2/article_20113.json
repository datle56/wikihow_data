You may be able to use this to your advantage. Use a search engine to look for your full name and any other versions of your name that you've used in the past. You can narrow this search by including other information such as the name of the city or state where you lived at the time. Look not only for actual documents that would display your work history, but also for words or accounts that might jog your memory.
