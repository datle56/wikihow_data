      "title": "Curl your lashes.",
      "content": "Curl your lashes. Even if you are wearing makeup, most makeup artists agree curling your lashes is a must, because it makes your eyes look larger and more awake. Use an eyelash curler to first curl along the very base of your lashes (squeezing for 10 seconds), then the middle of your lashes and the ends. This will give your lashes a natural curl instead of just bending them up at one harsh angle. [1] X Research source If an eyelash curler is out of the question, there are other ways to make your lashes stand out. Blow on the ends of your fingertips to warm them up, then gently press your lashes up. Hold for ten seconds, and repeat if necessary. Heat a spoon in a mug of warm water, then hold the edge of the spoon along the root of your eyelashes. The curved side of the spoon (the side that holds soup or cereal) should be facing out, away from you. Use your fingers to gently push your lashes up and against the edge of the spoon. Use a clean toothbrush to brush your lashes upward. Run the bristles under hot water to warm up the brush, wiping off excess moisture on a towel. Then brush the bristles up through your lashes, a starting near the root, and holding at the tips for ten seconds."

      "content": "Wear colors that make your eyes pop. Figure out what shades really highlight your eye color and buy shirts and scarves in those colors. Think about what color you are wearing when people compliment your eyes, or try holding up a bunch of different colored fabrics to your eyes and have a friend tell you which ones look best. Blue eyes should start out with black and different shades of blue (darker blues will make your eyes look a deeper blue, lighter blues will lighten), purple, pinks, and light green. [2] X Research source Brown eyes should start with oranges and red (or combinations like peach), shades of light brown, bold blues, lavender, gold, and moss green. [3] X Research source Green eyes should try any shade of purple or green, black, navy, pale yellow, and deep browns. [4] X Research source Hazel eyes should try black, navy, and other dark neutrals, orange, burgundy, and lavender. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your eyebrows on point. Your eyebrows frame your face and bring balance to your features. Stick with a strong, natural looking brow over over-plucked, pencil-thin lines. If you can have a professional salon shape your brows they will give you a template for how they should look and then you can do maintenance with a tweezer. [6] X Research source Avoid waxing your brows, as the process damages the extremely sensitive skin around your eyes. Try plucking or threading instead. [7] X Research source If you aren't allowed to tweeze your eyebrows, use a toothbrush to brush the hairs upwards slightly. This trick will make your eyes look bigger. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Set off eyes with your hair color. If you like to color your hair, choose a color that accentuates your eyes. You can focus on your general eye color, such as brown, blue, green, or hazel, or you can bring out the different colored flecks in your iris. Darker hair usually makes lighter eyes pop, while rich colors or lighter undertones can bring out darker eyes. Reds and coppers look great with green eyes, and you can use color to bring out your favorite shade in hazel eyes.

      "content": "Get a good night's sleep to minimize puffiness and dark circles. The skin around your eyes is extra thin, which means it is extremely sensitive and will show the effects of a sleepless night. Lack of sleep can affect your circulatory system, making the blood vessels more visible through the paper-thin skin under your eyes. [11] X Research source Sleep with your head propped up on two pillows, allowing the skin under your eyes to drain while you sleep and prevent puffiness. [12] X Research source Dark circles can also result from allergies, genetics, or bone structure. To lessen puffiness, try sleeping propped up on two pillows, which can help drain excess fluid from your face overnight. [13] X Research source"

Gently massaging the skin around your eyes can help move the fluid out of your face and into larger lymph nodes where it can be processed efficiently. Gently tap and massage the skin around your eyes, using your ring finger (this is the weakest finger and will make sure you don't press or pull too hard). Work your way around your eye in a circle, starting at the outside corner, going down under your eye, and then over along the brow bone.

      "content": "Invest in a good eye cream. You may need to experiment with a few different eye creams to find the right one, but you ultimately want something that is moisturizing and contains vitamin E. Beware of eye creams that are too rich, greasy, or waxy, as these can trap dead skin cells and lead to tiny white bumps, or milia, around your eyes. Look for creams that de-puff your skin (caffeine can help reduce puffiness) or contain gentle exfoliants. [15] X Research source Older women should look for creams that reduce wrinkles and firm the skin around your eyes, which can begin to droop as you age. A cream that plumps the skin can help the area around your eyes look youthful. [16] X Research source"

Too much salt can cause your body to retain water and appear bloated. Because the skin around your eyes is so delicate, this puffiness will be even more apparent around your eyes. [17] X Research source Cut back on your salt intake to reduce puffiness, especially the day before a special event. [18] X Research source"
