      "content": "Put on some socks. Fuzzy ones work the best, however, any socks will do. Why should you put on socks? Well, socks keep your foot bones from pounding on creaky stairs. They also keep your feet from sticking to the floor, which can make noise when you lift your foot up."

      "content": "Open the door as quietly as possible. If you're noisy, you could wake your parents up! Do not close the door. You can do that once you get your snack."

      "title": "Open the fridge or cabinet door slowly.",
      "content": "Open the fridge or cabinet door slowly. Do not turn the lights on. It will give you away. Before you start pushing things around looking for something and making noise, take a glimpse at the food, and push things away slowly, then grab your food. If it is in a package, hold it in your mouth for this next step."

      "title": "If you have stairs, go up them the way you came down them.",
      "content": "If you have stairs, go up them the way you came down them. If not, then go to your room the way you came. Be sure to close the door and leave everything the way it was before you came down - otherwise, your parents might become suspicious!"

      "title": "Be careful in your room.",
      "content": "Be careful in your room. Once safely in your room, go under your covers or some other place you can eat, and eat your food quietly . If it is in packaging, open it slowly - don't rip it up."

      "content": "If you find it easier, you can move to a different empty room, preferably furthest away from your parent's room. There, even if you accidentally make a noise, they most likely won't hear it. If you have a room on another floor, for example, a guest room, you can eat your snack there. Depending on your house, you can even go to the basement."
