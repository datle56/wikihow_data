      "title": "Wipe your vagina from front to back whenever you pee or poop.",
      "content": "Wipe your vagina from front to back whenever you pee or poop. Since your vagina is located near your anus, it’s important to wipe front to back after urinating or defecating. Fold a 12 in (30 cm) piece of toilet paper several times to create a small rolled up piece. Press the toilet paper between your labia near where your urethra ends. Wipe back towards your anus and over it, if needed, and then discard the toilet paper. Repeat as needed until your vagina and anus are clean. [1] X Research source Use soft, unscented toilet paper that does not contain dyes or other irritating chemicals. Even after urination, wiping from front to back will help to keep bacteria and fecal matter away from your vagina."

Then, apply a small amount of mild soap to your vagina to cleanse it. Rinse away the soap completely, and then use your fingers to spread the vaginal lips apart. Let warm water flow over your vagina to cleanse between your labia and over your clitoris. After you’re finished washing, dry off with a clean, dry towel.
