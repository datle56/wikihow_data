      "content": "“Agender” doesn’t have a universal definition in the gender-diverse community. Some people use the word agender to identify as someone who doesn’t fit within the male/female gender binary, while other individuals use the label to represent a complete absence of gender. Think about what parts of the label really vibe with you, and why you think it’s a good fit for your gender identity. Feel free to chat with your agender friends and acquaintances to see what the label means to them."
