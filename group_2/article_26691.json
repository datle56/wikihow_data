      "content": "Relax and talk about your topic. Eye contact will come a lot more easily if you feel at ease. Try not to get yourself too stressed out. Stay focused on what you are trying to convey in words. As you get into a conversational rhythm with the person you are talking to you will become more comfortable and more able to make eye contact."

      "content": "Look at other parts of their face to start. If it is too uncomfortable for you to look someone directly in the eye, you can try looking at other parts of their face such as their mouth. They won’t know you aren’t looking them in the eye and once you get more comfortable with this you can start actually making eye contact. [1] X Research source It is also best to start with people who are not intimidating to you, such as friends or parents. If you’re talking to someone really attractive or powerful you’re less likely to feel comfortable looking them in the eye. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source The base of the triangle should be between their two eyes and the point of the triangle should be at their mouth or just below it. As you talk to this person let your eyes wander between these three points. This will make you look engaged without staring at one spot the entire time. Rotate between the three points every five seconds or so. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t look too much. Maintain a balance between looking at them and looking away. Try to look at them or look away at natural points in the conversation. For example, if they say something you agree with you could try looking away and nodding your head in agreement. Replacing eye contact with non-verbal cues is a great way to assure the other person you are paying attention."

      "content": "Make an effort. Even if you feel uncomfortable and awkward looking people in the eyes, it is healthy to force yourself to do it. Science tells us that making eye contact with someone is not so dissimilar to the idea of ‘keeping your eye on the ball’. [5] X Research source It is something that you choose to do voluntarily, and it gets easier with practice. [6] X Research source When you are talking or listening to someone and you catch yourself looking over their head or off into the distance, force yourself to reinitiate eye contact."

      "content": "Try feigning eye contact if you are disabled and find actual eye contact upsetting. While you certainly don't need to suffer through eye contact if it's jarring to you, it is helpful to accommodate non-disabled people by sending signals that tell them you're paying attention. Look at somewhere near their face, where you can be comfortable. You can also give other signals that you're listening , such as nodding and interjecting with questions or statements like \"I see.\" Try looking at their...

      "content": "Understand that eye contact varies depending on culture. Studies show that East Asians desire less eye contact than other cultures. Eye contact can even come off as angry or unapproachable. [7] X Research source On the other hand, Westerners tend to think of eye contact as being assertive and confident. Recognize that eye contact is rude in some disability subcultures. Autistic people and some others find eye contact alarming and upsetting, [8] X Research source which means it hinders a conversation instead of helping. If you're talking to someone who avoids eye contact, it's polite to look elsewhere, such as at their hands or their shirt, so they can be comfortable."

      "content": "Give each person attention. If you are speaking you have to make sure that you switch your eye contact between all the people you are talking to. If you only maintain eye contact with one person then the others will feel like they are not a part of the conversation. Try looking at one person per sentence and then switching when you start your next sentence. [10] X Research source"

If you are talking to an audience and you make eye contact with someone who is frowning or shaking their head at what you are saying, don’t be thrown. Maintain eye contact with this person for three or four seconds just like you would with everyone else. Maybe even throw in a smile just so they know you are taking their nonverbal criticism good-naturedly. Then move onto the next person unflustered. [11] X Research source If making eye contact with so many people makes you nervous, try looking at the tops of their heads. From a short distance, they can't tell the difference. People will naturally have different opinions on what you are saying but maintaining eye contact is important regardless of what they think. This establishes a subconscious connection [12] X Research source that is vital in social situations."

      "content": "Keep your eye contact head on. Don’t look at people out of the corner of your eye as you talk to the group. Move your whole head to face theirs when you make eye contact. Making eye contact out of the corner of your eye is not much better than making no eye contact at all."

Try to maintain a balance by responding to what the other person is saying rather than waiting for your turn to speak. Giving positive feedback during the conversation is very helpful. For example, if the person tells you something say \"oh, interesting. Can you tell me more?\" [13] X Research source"

You have to understand that while your ten year old cat may be a very important part of your life, other people don't necessarily want to hear about it constantly. Understand what is of interest to others and react according to the way that they respond. [14] X Research source You don't only have to use stories from your own life as you make conversation. Don't be afraid to talk about anecdotes that you read or heard from someone else. This will show that you are willing to pay attention to and talk about topics other than yourself."

      "content": "Don't feel put off by the end of the conversation. All conversations end at some point, so don't feel discouraged if you stop talking with someone. If you have had a good conversation with someone you don't need to force it to continue along. Gracefully end the conversation. For example, say something like \"it was good talking to you, we should hang out again sometime\", or \"hope to chat again soon\".

[16] X Research source . You shouldn't disagree in an impolite or aggressive way, but being willing to express your own opinion will make the conversation more interesting. It will also last longer. Talking about sports is a good example of polite disagreement. Someone might say, I think this player is the best player in the league right now. If you don't agree you can say something like, \"I'm not so sure, have you seen this other player play? He is having a really good year this year. I think he may have passed your player by.\" This is a polite way of disagreeing that will spark debate without offending the person. [17] X Research source"
