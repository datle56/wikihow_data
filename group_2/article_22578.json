      "content": "This method only works if you’re texting another iPhone user. One of the simplest ways to hide messages on your iPhone from prying eyes is to use the built-in Invisible Ink feature that comes with the iOS Messages app (iOS 10 and later). When you send a text this way, it will appear blurred out on both your phone and the recipient’s phone. To reveal the hidden text, simply swipe your finger over it. To send an Invisible Ink message: [1] X Research source Open a new or existing conversation. Type your text into the Text Message field at the bottom of the screen. You can also insert an image. Tap and hold the Send button next to your message (it looks like a blue or green circle with an arrow pointing up). Select Invisible Ink from the list of animation options that appears. Tap the Send button again to send your message. Both you and the recipient will see a blurred-out message with animated “static” over it. Once the message is revealed, it will stay visible for a few seconds before the effect turns on again. The recipient of the message will get a notification that says “Message sent with Invisible Ink.” If the person you sent the message to doesn’t have an iPhone, or if they’re using an old version of iOS (pre-iOS 10), the message won’t be hidden on their phone."
