      "content": "Stay positive and don't dwell on the negative parts of life. Instead, be mindful about the good things and think about tomorrow's opportunities. This bit of common self-help advice is actually supported by science. Positive thinking makes us more successful, happier, and can even improve our health. [1] X Research source At the same time, however, don't blame yourself for having \"negative thoughts\" or for things that are outside your control. Mental illnesses like depression make positive thinking difficult. While staying positive can spur you into action, thoughts alone can't change reality. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Believe in yourself.",
      "content": "Believe in yourself. Build your self-confidence with daily affirmations. You will need to rely on yourself to make your wishes come true. When you don't believe you can achieve your goals, you're making a self-fulfilling prophecy. Turn that around and you'll be more likely to succeed. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on a concrete goal.",
      "content": "Decide on a concrete goal. Figure out exactly what you want to wish for and state it in concrete terms. You won't be able to achieve your goals if you don't know what they are. The simpler and more concise the goal is, the easier it will be to achieve. If your dream is to be famous, decide what you want to be famous for, then put it into action. For example, if you want to be a rock star, learn guitar and start a band. If you want to find love, think about what kind of relationship you want. Consider who your ideal partner may be. Know what you want to avoid missing out if they find you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prioritize your dream.",
      "content": "Prioritize your dream. Don't let yourself get distracted by instant gratification. If something seems appealing right now but actually puts your wish further out of reach, don't do it. For example, if your goal is financial independence and you come across a great deal on a TV, consider which will help you become more financially independent: saving money on a TV or putting that money into a savings account. In the TV example, putting the money into a savings account might be a better option because it will gain interest. The TV's value will only decrease as time goes on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be open to compromise.",
      "content": "Be open to compromise. While it's fine to go for the improbable (like being famous), remember that truly impossible wishes really are unattainable. Instead, try turning fantastic goals into realistic ones. Do you want to be a mermaid? Think about what aspects of being a mermaid you like the most. For example, you could be a world-class swimmer or a respected marine biologist. Do you want to fly like a superhero? Start studying for your pilot's license or join your country's air force."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be persistent.",
      "content": "Be persistent. Whatever your goal, whether lofty or simple, there will probably be setbacks and difficulties along the way. Recognize temporary setbacks for what they are and learn how to move past them. Don't beat yourself up if your actions or inactions cause setback. Learn from them and modify your strategy for next time. Did things not work out due to sheer luck and coincidence? If so, there's no reason why you shouldn't try again. If along the way you find that your goal isn't practically obtainable, consider revising your original wish and think of an alternative."

    {
      "title": "Stop procrastinating.",
      "content": "Stop procrastinating. Procrastination tricks you into inaction and sabotages your success. [4] X Research source Don't keep waiting for the right moment to start working towards your wish. The \"right moment\" doesn't really exist. The right moment is now. The sooner you start working, the sooner your wish will come true. The right moment won't come when you have enough money or when you have enough skill. It won't come when you get someone else's approval."

    {
      "title": "Do your homework.",
      "content": "Do your homework. Search the Internet for information about what you need to do to make your wish come true. This website is a great resource. Simply type what your wish is into the search bar to look for help. For example, if you want to be an animator, you'll need to learn to draw and build a portfolio. Look for programs that have trained successful animators and have internship programs with major animation studios."

      "title": "Create an outline for yourself.",
      "content": "Create an outline for yourself. Make a list of everything you'll need to do to achieve your goal as a loose timeline. You should be very detailed about the initial steps, but later steps can be left vague. For example, if you want to be an astronaut , your first step might be to apply to an accredited college that offers bachelor's degrees in various scientific disciplines. [5] X Trustworthy Source NASA Independent agency of the U.S. government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program Go to source Be creative and put yourself in a position to realize your dreams. While you may never become a best-selling author, you definitely won't be unless you start writing. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Take that first step.",
      "content": "Take that first step. No amount of preparation will make your wish come true unless you follow through. Make sure you stick to your outline and keep up with important deadlines. While your wish may involve some sort of waiting, you should fill that time by practicing your talent or educating yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep track of your progress.",
      "content": "Keep track of your progress. During your journey towards fulfilling your wish, you should write down everything you do that puts you closer to achieving it. This will help you see your progress and help keep you motivated. You can write your progress in a physical notebook or type it up on a computer. You may even choose to publish your progress online as a blog. How often you update will depend on your goal. For instance, if you are a college student who wishes to be a neurosurgeon, you may choose to update weekly or monthly. Write about your successes and your setbacks. Being mindful of your achievements will help you to stay positive, while writing out what you still need to work on will help you plan for your next step."

      "title": "Talk to other people about your wish.",
      "content": "Talk to other people about your wish. While your family, friends, and business associates may not share the same wishes, they can be valuable resources. Talk to them and share your dreams and your ideas on how to accomplish them. They may have helpful ideas of their own. You may even find like-minded individuals to collaborate with on your dream project. When you open up to others, be prepared to listen honestly to what they have to say. It will not always be what you want to hear, but an alternate point of view can be invaluable. If you need money to achieve your dream, other people are an important resource. Whether it's your parents helping with college application fees or investors giving you startup capital for your company, you'll need to learn how to ask for help."

      "title": "Be selective about whose advice you choose to take.",
      "content": "Be selective about whose advice you choose to take. While some people may help make your wish come true, others will try to shoot you down. Still others may derail you with bad advice, whether on purpose or unintentionally. While your decisions may come down to instinct, there are a few things to keep in mind: Think about where the advice is coming from. What is their background do they have relevant experience? People who seem knowledgeable may be outdated or uniformed. Always check \"facts\" when you can, especially if they seem outlandish. Listen to as many opinions about a topic as possible. If you can't verify a claim, it might be false. [7] X Research source Learn the difference between naysayers and realists. A naysayer may tell you that wanting to direct a blockbuster movie is a ridiculous goal. A realistic critic may tell you that you may not become a famous director while still offering tips on choosing a film school."

      "title": "Consider posting your wish to social media and/or crowdsourcing platforms.",
      "content": "Consider posting your wish to social media and/or crowdsourcing platforms. For certain wishes, there may be very little you can personally do to make them happen. On the other hand, there are plenty of wealthy or well-connected people in the world who perform random acts of kindness. [8] X Research source If you have an interesting wish and a story to tell, try posting about it on social media. Crowdsourcing for \"impossible\" wishes is becoming more popular, connecting people to others who can grant them. You never know who may read your story and want to help you."

      "title": "Try spiritual methods consistent with your beliefs.",
      "content": "Try spiritual methods consistent with your beliefs. There is very little you can personally do to make some wishes come true. For those types of wishes, you may decide to turn to supernatural methods in an effort to make them come true. Exactly what you should do in these situations will depend on your religion. If you believe in one or more deities, or other spiritual beings, try prayer . How you do this will depend on your faith. If you're unsure, talk to a local spiritual leader. Some religions use spells to make wishes come true. In some spiritual practices, spells channel the caster's own power while in others they are cast to ask a higher power to intercede on the caster's behalf. A popular New Age philosophy called the Law of Attraction asserts that people shape reality through their thoughts. If you believe this, focus your thoughts on your wish to make it happen.

      "content": "Turn to your culture's folk superstitions. There are many fun, supposedly wish-granting traditions that people engage in every day. Since they typically don't require much more effort than a simple thought, there's no harm in trying them. Some examples include: Silently make a wish when blowing out the candles on your birthday cake. If you see a shooting star, make a wish. When you notice the time line up on a clock, for example at 11:11 or 03:33, say your wish to yourself. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Post on wishing websites and applications. There are many websites that take traditional wishing into the Digital Age. These sites typically instruct you to type your wish into a textbox for it to come true. Depending on the site, your wish may be posted publicly or kept private. Don't reveal personal information when typing your wish, especially if you're a minor. This includes your phone number, name, address, or location."
