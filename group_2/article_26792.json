As you pull off the bark, make sure that you are getting the papery material that underlies the bark. It is a good idea to strip the bark from younger branches rather than from the trunk. The bark from the trunk is harder to remove and it is also tougher to break up for boiling."

If you don’t have these purifiers, make a fire and boil the water for at least 10 minutes before using. If you can’t start a fire, let the willow bark soak in the water for at least an hour. Keep in mind that even though wilderness water can be purer in many ways than other water, it does contain various parasites. Boiling water or using a purifier is the best approach to protect yourself from these parasites. If you are in an area where giardia (a parasite found in water) is present, or may be present, make certain you follow the correct purification procedure. Giardia can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms that may cause abdominal pain and may also cause you to become severely dehydrated. [4] X Research source"
