      "content": "Sharpen your conversational skills. Being a good conversationalist is just as much about being a good listener as it is about having lots of funny or interesting things to say. Keep the discussion centered around her as much as possible to make her feel special. When it’s your turn to talk, say what you have to say, then look for a way to put the spotlight back on her.

Always having an entourage with you sends a subliminal message that says “I’m likable.” It’s even better if you know a few of the same people, as this will tell her right away that you have similar interests and a compatible personality. [7] X Research source If you have mutual friends, start asking them to do things with you more often. This will give you a convenient in to strike up a conversation or invite her to tag along.

      "content": "Focus on making a lasting impression when you’re together. Whenever you find yourself with a moment alone, take advantage of the opportunity to dazzle her with your natural magnetism. Make her laugh, listen attentively, and treat her like she’s the only person in the world—at least until it’s time to make a strategic exit. You’re practically guaranteed to have her thinking about you the rest of the night. [10] X Research source Really connecting during your one-on-one time is key to ensuring that your efforts to downplay your interest pay off the way they’re supposed to. There’s no reason for her to pursue you if she doesn’t actually enjoy being around you. While coming across as desperate or needy can drive girls away, acting completely disinterested may discourage her, producing the opposite effect of the one you’d hoped for."

Throwing yourself at her is a great way to put her off and convince her that you’re probably not worthy of her time and attention. Whatever you do, don’t make it obvious that you’re actually the one chasing her by playing hard to get. [11] X Research source Fight the temptation to always text her first or be the one to offer to hang out. It’s better to bide your time and wait for her to come to you."

      "content": "Be the first one to walk away from an interaction. Many people make the mistake of becoming too clingy or eager to be in a girl’s presence once they’ve got her hooked. Don’t be afraid to cut a magical conversation short when you see someone you know, or duck out a little early because you’ve got other places to be. Doing so will make her look forward to your next meeting while also advertising that you’re in high demand. [12] X Research source Remember: if you want her to chase you, you can’t be around all the time."

On the surface, this will help you portray yourself as passionate and goal-driven, both of which are attractive qualities. Secretly, though, you’ll be encouraging her to try harder. [14] X Research source Bring up your hobbies, interests, and projects frequently in conversation so she’ll know how serious you are about them. You could even go so far as to say things like, “My ideal girlfriend would love gaming as much as I do,” or, “It would take someone really special to get my mind off of cars.” She may take it as a challenge.

While talking to her, say things like, “I’m thankful to have such a great friend,” or, “You’re just like one of the guys.” If she’s into you, dropping hints that you see her as a casual friend rather than a serious romantic prospect may make her work even harder to win your affection. You don’t have to keep her in the friend zone forever, but putting her there temporarily is a good way to fan the flames of her desire and motivate her to get out. If you’re going to take this approach, reel in the flirtiness a little. Sending mixed signals could just confuse her or make her suspect that you’re playing games. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Try ignoring girls who won’t give you the time of day. Sometimes when you’re dealing with a hard case, the best thing you can do is employ a little reverse psychology. Refusing to acknowledge her the way everyone else does will cause her to doubt her assumptions about you and lead her to wonder what’s so great about you that you’ll hardly give her a second look. [17] X Research source Ignoring is more subtle than just pretending like she doesn’t exist. It could mean laughing halfheartedly at her jokes, acting unimpressed when she tells stories intended to make her look cool, or simply engaging with everyone around her more than her. Giving the cold shoulder to a girl you secretly like can easily backfire. Try to do it in a way that feels unintentional, not deliberate or mean-spirited. [18] X Research source"

If she suddenly seems determined to get you to notice her, be receptive to it, but don’t take the bait all at once. Instead, play it cool and give her just enough to keep her coming back without sacrificing the upper hand. [19] X Research source Once you’re certain that she’s after you, you can begin gradually increasing the amount of fondness you show towards her until the two of you’re on a level playing field. Going from lukewarm to hot too quickly could cause her to lose interest in the dynamic that you’ve worked so hard to establish. In the worst case, it may even lead her to believe that your behavior has just been an act."
