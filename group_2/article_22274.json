      "content": "Know that this was not your fault. Sexual assault or violence is “never the survivor’s fault,” affirms Tenzer, “yet they are often made to believe the opposite.” [1] X Expert Source Rebecca Tenzer, MAT, MA, LCSW, CCTP, CGCS, CCATP, CCFP Clinical Therapist & Adjunct Professor Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. No matter how it happened, nothing you did caused someone else to harm you. [2] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Do not be afraid of telling people for fear of being blamed. It was not your fault. Your body belongs to you and only you. Rape and sexual assault can happen to anyone, anywhere. People of any identity can be victims of sexual violence. You never asked for it, no matter the circumstances. Consent is always needed, and you're not alone. [3] X Research source Being forced or pressured into sex or being sexually assaulted by someone you are on a date with is still acquaintance or date rape. It doesn't matter if you know them or are dating them. You can be in a regular relationship with someone and still be forced into having sex against your will. 8/10 rapes are committed by someone that the survivor knows. [4] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Drinking alcohol or taking drugs is not an excuse for someone to rape you. Intoxication loosens inhibitions and can increase violent tendencies. Drugs and alcohol can also decrease your ability to get help. Regardless of who was drinking or taking the drugs, there is still no excuse for sexual assault. You shouldn’t be afraid to report your assault, regardless of anyone’s intoxication level at the time. Sexual acts cause physical responses from your body. If you did have such a reaction, do not be ashamed or feel guilty as if you enjoyed it. Erections, wetness, and orgasms can result from stimulation even if you didn't want it and didn't enjoy it."

If you suspect you were drugged, save any cups or bottles that you drank out of, if possible. Drug testing may be conducted to confirm use of the drug and provide evidence that can be used later. The most common date rape drug is not Rohypnol – it's alcohol. Tell the police if alcohol or drugs were involved. Even if you willingly drank alcohol or took drugs before you were assaulted, it is never your fault. Informing police can also help you feel a sense of control and help you recover from the crime."

You have gone through an event that will likely cause shock, depression, anxiety, fear and hypervigilance, and nightmares. The trauma that survivors of rape and sexual assault experience is a specific kind of post-traumatic stress disorder known as rape trauma syndrome. This syndrome and its symptoms are normal, and both will get better. [8] X Research source Survivors may also feel guilt and shame, suffer disturbed eating and sleeping patterns, and have trouble focusing. These symptoms are normal, but still extremely challenging to experience. Seek support in whatever way you need it—whether by staying home and taking care of yourself, speaking with a mental health professional, or leaning on friends and family. Take time to rest and take breaks when you need them. If it feels good to go out into the world, get back to work, or throw yourself into activities, go for it! But avoid the temptation to over-extend yourself in order to ignore or forget about your emotional symptoms. As you’re resting and recovering, be smart about what TV programs or films you’re watching. Avoid any media about crime reporting, sexual violence, or that contains sexually explicit scenes. You may also want to temporarily refrain from any over-stimulating media sources, including social media.

[10] X Research source After you’ve sought medical attention and had an exam or “rape kit” administered by a healthcare professional, try having a hot bath, meditating, or other stress relaxation techniques that work for you. Once your body is physically healed, try to reconnect to it (when you’re ready). You can try physical techniques like rhythmic movement, yoga, tai chi, and massage. However, don’t push yourself to do anything you’re not comfortable with too soon. Continue to do all the things you would typically do to take care of your body. Eat balanced meals, exercise, get plenty of sleep, and temporarily avoid potentially harmful substances like alcohol and drugs."

These are normal post-traumatic stress and rape trauma reactions. There’s nothing wrong with you, but you may find comfort in mental health support. If you can, try to learn to recognize your body’s danger signals and triggers. You may notice that certain things set off flashbacks.

[21] X Research source Helping others may also help you to reclaim your sense of power and agency. When you feel ready, consider joining a charity organization, donating blood, reaching out to a loved one in need, or even looking for volunteer opportunities at a sexual assault hotline. Eventually, you’ll be able to integrate these past emotions into the new reality of your life.

When someone you love is raped or has experienced sexual violence, it’s normal to experience painful emotions yourself. You might feel angry, frustrated, and even vengeful. However, what your friend, partner, or family member needs in this moment is your support and care, which you can begin to provide with the following tips: Tell your loved one that you believe and still love them. This fact may seem obvious to you, but it might not to a survivor of sexual violence. Reassure your loved one that you believe their story and the assault was not their fault. You can also reassure them that nothing they did or didn’t do makes them culpable, and that the event hasn’t changed how you see them. [29] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Allow your loved one to open up when they’re ready. Some survivors struggle to talk about what happened, while others may want to repeatedly rehash the event with you. In either case, let your loved one take the lead—neither pressure them to open up or urge them to stop talking about their assault. Just let them know that you’re there to listen whenever they’re ready to talk. [30] X Research source Gently encourage your loved one to seek help. Advise the survivor to reach out for help, but don’t push them toward seeing a counselor if they’re not ready. They may be feeling a need to take back some control and power in their life, and making the decision to move forward on their own is one way that they can do that. [31] X Research source Be empathetic about their comfort with physical intimacy. Your loved one may begin to shy away from physical touch or express discomfort with intimacy. These reactions may have their own emotional effect on you, but be careful not to withdraw from the survivor or act like they’re fragile. Instead, express your affection for them verbally, ask permission to hold or touch them and act neutrally no matter the response. [32] X Research source Understand that sexual intimacy may take time. If your spouse or partner has experienced sexual violence, understand that it may take quite a bit of time before they are ready to be sexually intimate. They’ll likely have to process what happened and regain a sense of control over their life and body before feeling a want for this type of intimacy—it has nothing to do with you. [33] X Research source Be patient and look after yourself. You can’t pour from an empty cup—manage your own stress and mental health so that you’re better able to help your loved one. The healing process for survivors takes time, so be patient and continue to lean on your own support systems as you help your loved one recover.
