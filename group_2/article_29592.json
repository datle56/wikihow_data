      "content": "Your period kit could be a pencil pouch, makeup bag, or small box. Use whatever you want—or make three different period kits so you’ve always got one on hand. A small pencil bag with grommets will be discreet enough to help you hide that you’re on your period and also latch into your binder. You can find a pencil bag at most office supply or big box stores. If you don't want anyone to know what's inside, opt for something opaque. Consider keeping a zippered bag full of period supplies in your backpack, desk, or locker at all times. A binder period kit is convenient, but you’ll be able to pack more supplies in a bigger bag. If you’re really embarrassed, you could put your kit into a box advertising something else—granola bars, cereal—and keep it in your locker so that people think you’re just keeping a snack on hand."

      "content": "You might prefer using pads, tampons, or something else. Whatever menstrual implement you choose, consider how many you’ll need throughout the day and figure out how many will fit without bulging. You want enough to get you through a whole school day. You can always restock when you're getting low! If you choose a reusable menstrual cup , you will only need one, as it can get emptied and washed throughout the day. [1] X Research source If you use tampons , reusable pads , or period underwear , you may need about two or three. Exactly how many supplies you'll go through in a day will depend on your body as well as what day of your cycle it is. Many people's periods are heavier in the first few days and peter out. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to take your entire period kit to the bathroom but still want to be discreet, stash a pad or tampon in a tissue container in your kit. Wrap a tissue around the pad or tampon and take it with you from class to the bathroom."

You may also want to include a body mist or a spray fragrance of some type if you are worried about smells. Keep in mind that scented wipes can irritate your vagina–opt for unscented wipes if possible. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "You may never need extra clothes—but it’s good to have them, just in case! Put an extra pair of undies and pants in your period kit. If you’ve had an accident, you’ll be able to change and get comfortable quickly. [4] X Research source Even if you're using another product, like a pad or menstrual cup, keeping an extra pair of period underwear at school can give you extra peace of mind. Black leggings are a good choice for spare pants since they roll up small and can be stored easily."

      "content": "If you need to change, you’ll need a place to put your used clothes. Using a watertight bag can keep any soiled underwear or pants separate from the rest of the contents of your kit and backpack. If you use any used reusable period products, such as a menstrual cup, and you remove it at school, you can add this to the bag, too. Consider adding some small plastic baggies to your kit as well. Sometimes you have to throw away your disposable products outside of the stall, and it can be messy."

      "content": "Hand wipes are useful in case you’re somewhere you can’t clean up easily. Sometimes, you’ll be in a place where it’s difficult to clean up (such as a field trip to a park), and having a way to sanitize your hands is essential. If you have to change your underwear or pants, it can be really useful to have them in the stall with you. Use travel size packs that fit easily into your kit."

      "content": "Chocolate, bananas, and tea can all help ease period symptoms. Consider adding your favorite dark chocolate to your period kit; not only can it lift your spirits if you're feeling discouraged or frustrated, but the magnesium in chocolate has been shown to alleviate cramps. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Be sure to go for a low-sugar dark chocolate, as sugar can actually make period cramps worse. [6] X Research source Herbal tea, especially thyme or chamomile, may help you calm down and can ease period pain. Certain fruits, like bananas or berries, can help reduce period cramps, too."

      "content": "If you get cramps on your period, pain relievers can help. Over-the-counter painkillers, like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), can help ease the pain of cramps. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure that you’re allowed to have pain relievers at your school and that your bottle won’t be confiscated. You could also keep some tampons in a pill bottle (like Aspirin). It’ll hide your tampons, and you’ll have painkillers on hand when you need them. You can easily take it with you to the bathroom. If you’re not allowed to bring your own pain medicine to school, you may be able to ask for some from the school nurse if you need it."

      "content": "If you know “that time” is coming, prepare yourself ahead of time. If you know you’re on your period (or suspect you will be soon), place a pad or tampon in your pocket before your school day starts. This way, if you ever go to the bathroom without your kit and discover you’ve gotten your period, you’ll be prepared. Plus, no one will get suspicious or ask about you bringing a pencil pouch into the bathroom with you. Consider keeping the tampon, pad, or other menstrual tool in a zippered pocket to make sure that it doesn’t fall out."
