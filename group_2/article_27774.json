      "title": "The color wheel",
      "content": "The color wheel Before we break down how to mix paint colors, it’s important to learn why colors work the way they do. So, let’s start with the color wheel! The color wheel is a circular chart that displays how colors interact with one another. By reading a color wheel, you can determine what colors to mix with what. But first, it’s important to understand how the color wheel is divided: [1] X Research source Primary colors consist of red, yellow, and blue, which are the only colors that cannot be mixed to create one another. Secondary colors consist of green, orange, and purple and are made by combining primary colors. Tertiary colors are yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green, and yellow-green and are created by mixing a primary and secondary color. Complementary colors are two colors directly across from each other on the wheel that “complement” one another, such as red and green. Analogous colors are any three colors that are side by side on the color wheel, such as yellow-green, yellow, and yellow-orange."

      "title": "Warm and cool colors",
      "content": "Warm and cool colors On the color wheel, there are two tones of color: warm and cool. Warm colors (yellow, red, and orange) are reminiscent of fire and are generally brighter, whereas cool colors (blue, green, and purple) are found more commonly in nature and tend to be duller. When mixed, the temperatures or tones of colors can affect the outcome. [2] X Research source For example, mixing a warm red and warm yellow will make a bright, warm orange. Alternatively, mixing a cool red with a cool yellow will make a muted cool orange. Warm and cool colors can also be mixed together to create more unique tones. When mixing a warm and cool color, the undertones of the color will mix. For instance, a warm red mixed with a cool blue makes a cool maroon."

      "title": "Lightening and darkening colors",
      "content": "Lightening and darkening colors White and black paint can alter a color's tint, saturation, and shading. Tint and shade refer to how light or dark a color appears, while saturation is how “intense” or gray a color is. Experimenting with mixing in small amounts of white or black paint can allow you to create variations of basic colors. [3] X Research source Similarly, you can also lighten paint colors by adding a little bit of yellow or darken them by adding a little bit of blue. Whether white and black count as primary colors is debated. For paint-making purposes, it's important to know that a variety of black shades can be created with existing paints, whereas no paints mix to create white. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix yellow and blue to make green.",
      "content": "Mix yellow and blue to make green. Use an equal amount of yellow and blue paint. Mix them together using a paintbrush or painting knife to create green. Using an unequal amount of either paint will skew the color of the green toward whichever color was dominant—blue or yellow. As artist Kelly Medford explains, “It’s all about the proportion of the mixture.” [5] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 26 July 2019 Blue and yellow both come in warm and cool hues. A cool yellow will look greenish, while a warm yellow will look orange-ish. [6] X Research source To get a brighter shade of green, use a cool yellow and a cool blue, both with a greenish tint to it. If your green is murky, you might have used a warm, orangish yellow or a warm, purplish-blue."

If you use an unequal amount of either paint, the orange will have a tone based on whichever color is more present (yellow or red). [7] X Research source Like blue and yellow, red comes in both warm and cool hues. A warm red will look orangish, while a cool red will look purplish. [8] X Research source To get a brighter orange, use a warm, orangish yellow and a warm, orangish red."

      "content": "Mix blue and red to make purple. Mix an equal amount of blue and red paint until you achieve your desired color. If you use more of one color than the other, your purple will come out with more of the dominant color’s undertone. [9] X Research source Like other shades, blue has warm and cool hues. A warm blue will look more purple, while a cool blue will look greenish. To get a bright purple, mix a cool red with purple undertones and a warm blue with purple undertones. If your purple came out murky, you might have used a warm, orangey red or a cool, greenish blue."

      "content": "Mix a primary and secondary color together. Each tertiary color is created via the same method: mixing a primary and secondary color. Choose which colors you want to combine (making the secondary color if you don’t have it already). Then, play around with the proportions and mix them together. Equal amounts of both paints will make a more balanced shade, while having more of one color will make it dominant the other. [10] X Research source Here are the six tertiary colors you can make: Yellow-green. Blue-green. Blue-purple. Red-purple. Red-orange. Yellow-orange. Note that tertiary colors are always named so that their primary colors are listed first."

In the case of browns, the ratio of each paint will affect the type of resulting brown. [11] X Research source Adding a greater portion of a warmer color, such as red, will result in a warmer brown. For instance, Medford recommends using a darker red and blue to make a muted purple and then adding in a little warm yellow. [12] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 26 July 2019 Using greater quantities of colder colors, such as blue and green, will result in a brown that is very dark, nearing black in color."

[13] X Research source Mixing these colors together creates a black mixture that leans toward one of the colors used in the mix. This is referred to as chromatic black. [14] X Research source A dark blue and brown can also provide a deep black that may be keyed cooler or warmer depending on the ratio of paints. Note that purchasing a pure black paint from the tube will limit your mixing opportunities with that particular black. [15] X Research source"

For example, analogous colors of green are yellow and blue. [16] X Research source Adding an analogous color to a color plus complement mixture will neutralize the intensity of the color, creating a more gray color. [17] X Research source Alternatively, to make a more basic gray, mix all three primary colors and alter the color temperature as needed. Add white to lighten the value of this mixture until you are satisfied with the gray. Dark colors mix more easily into light than vice versa. Mix a small amount of the gray mixture into the white to start, and add more as necessary."
