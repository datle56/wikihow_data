      "content": "Use calf releases to lengthen muscles. To perform this exercise, sit on the floor. Place a tennis ball under one calf. Put your other leg on top of the first leg. Roll your calf up and down on the tennis ball. If you hit a tight spot, wiggle your foot up and down for about half a minute. This exercise helps stretch out your calf muscles. If these muscles are tight, they can put pressure on your knee, possibly pulling the kneecap out of alignment. Try this exercise 6 times a week."

If you hit a sore spot, spend extra time using the foam roller on that spot. This ligament stretches from your thigh to your shin. Sometimes, it has tight spots that tug on your knee, putting pressure on it.

Lay face down on the floor, and put the roller under your hip just below the hip bone. Lean into the balls as much as you can, and lift that calf off the ground, creating a 90-degree angle with your leg. Swing your leg side to side for 30 seconds or so. The hip muscles also work to keep the knee properly aligned. If they are out of whack, it can cause problems with your knee.
