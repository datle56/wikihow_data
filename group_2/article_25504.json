      "content": "Notice eye contact. Eye contact is an important part of human interaction, and it just so happens that when people feel romantically inclined or particularly at ease with someone, a natural physical response is for the pupils to dilate. [1] X Research source If she holds your gaze longer than normal, or if you find her staring your way frequently, this could be a sign that she's interested in you. Each case will be different, but shy people tend to favor indirect interaction, so you may never catch her looking your way. If she avoids looking at you entirely, this can also be a strong sign she's interested. Another scenario might be she is looking straight at the clock, whiteboard, or friends to distract herself and will look all directions except at you."

      "content": "Watch for jealousy. Some shy girls may become jealous if you flirt with others.

Also, the direction her feet point might point out whether she's digging you or looking to dash out the door."

      "title": "Note her wardrobe and preening gestures.",

      "content": "Pay attention to how she talks. Many shy people are worried about saying the wrong thing, which sometimes leads to quietness around a crush. Oppositely, nervousness at being close to a crush might cause a shy girl to be a little more chatty. In either case, research has shown that if she responds to you smoothly and quickly, she likely is interested in some kind of relationship with you. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask through a mutual friend.",
      "content": "Ask through a mutual friend. Shy people frequently fear direct confrontation, so asking her if she has feelings for you through a note passed on through a friend or in a message that friend relates to her could save you from unnecessary detective work. [14] X Research source Remember, she will find out that you asked, and sometimes people use this information to pick on other. There is nothing wrong with asking someone if they like you. Remember that some shy girls are very reserved and may keep their crush a secret, even from their best friends.
