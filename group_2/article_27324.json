      "content": "Make some more fans using colored paper, if desired. Cut some colored paper down to the same size as your bills, about 2½ by 6 inches (6.35 by 15.24 centimeters) first. [3] X Research source Then, fold them into fans starting from the narrow edge. You will need about 30 to 35 pieces as well. [4] X Research source Add school spirit by using one or both of your school's colors. Cardstock or colored printer paper will give you a nicer look, but you can use construction paper if you have nothing else."

      "title": "Tape the edges of your fan together.",
      "content": "Tape the edges of your fan together. Fold your fan in half, widthwise. Tape the two side edges together. When you are done, you should have a half-circle, fan shape. [5] X Research source Do this for all of the folded bills and colored pieces of paper. Set them aside when you are done."

[6] X Research source The ribbon can be any color you want, but something that matches one of the school's colors would be ideal. Seal the ends of the ribbon with a flame. This will keep it from fraying. [7] X Research source"

You should now have something that looks like a disk. Tape the two ends of the paper together to secure the disk. [8] X Research source Start from the center of the ribbon and work your way outward."

Place a small candy bar on top of it, about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from one of the narrow ends. Make sure that both are oriented horizontally. It's best if you use wrapped candies so that they don't melt. If the candies are very small, you could fit 3 to 4. [9] X Research source"

Tie each ribbon to either side of the candy bar. [11] X Research source You can tie the ribbon into a bow or a simple double-knot. If you use a double-knot, consider curing the ribbon with scissors.

If yours is too short, cut another strip of cellophane, and tape it to the end of your lei. Continue adding candies and ribbons until the cellophane is filled. [13] X Research source Something around 4 feet (1.2 meters) would be ideal, so trim off any excess."
