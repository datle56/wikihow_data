      "title": "They feel protective of you.",
      "content": "They feel protective of you. The King of Pentacles is a regal, powerful presence who cares deeply about protecting his kingdom and his loved ones. [6] X Research source If you pulled this card when asking about someone’s feelings, it’s a strong indication that they feel incredibly protective of you. This person wants to make you feel safe and secure, and they won’t hesitate to use their strength to stand up for you. If you have a crush, keep an eye out for any subtle protective body language, like putting their arm out in front of you at a busy crosswalk. This may be a clue that they have feelings for you! If you’re in a relationship, the King of Pentacles serves as a confirmation that your partner cares deeply about you and wants to protect you from any kind of harm. If you’re asking about an ex’s feelings, the King of Pentacles suggests that this person still feels protective toward you and would defend you if anyone said something negative about you."

    {
      "title": "This person feels possessive or controlling toward you.",
      "content": "This person feels possessive or controlling toward you. The King of Pentacles is a powerful monarch who wants to be in complete control of his kingdom. Reversed, this card indicates that the person you're asking about is embodying this energy. [7] X Research source They might feel jealous when other people talk to or flirt with you, resorting to possessive behaviors like asking you to change the way you dress or telling you to limit your interactions with people they deem a threat. If you’ve asked about an ex’s feelings, the King of Pentacles in reverse suggests that they’re still possessive of you and would feel upset about any new potential suitors trying to woo you. If you’re dealing with a possessive partner or ex, let them know how their actions make you feel. Set boundaries with them about the behaviors you won’t accept moving forward."

    {
      "title": "This person is feeling greedy or materialistic.",
      "content": "This person is feeling greedy or materialistic. In the reversed position, the King of Pentacles represents an excessive focus on material wealth. [8] X Research source The person you’ve asked about could be extremely focused on their career right now, leaving little room for their romantic life. Their ambitions and desire for financial success could be blinding them to any other emotions. If you’ve asked about a crush or someone you’re casually dating, this person might be too preoccupied with chasing wealth to commit to anyone right now, and that's okay! It can be tough to recognize that someone doesn't have the time or energy for a relationship, but it can save you a lot of frustration in the end. You deserve someone who will make you a priority, who will value you just as much as they value their personal success."

    {
      "title": "They’re feeling rigid or set in their ways.",
      "content": "They’re feeling rigid or set in their ways. Like stubborn earth signs Virgo, Capricorn, and Taurus, the King of Pentacles feels assured that their way is the right way. [9] X Research source If you’ve recently given this person life advice, they’re likely resistant to your suggestions, preferring instead to do things their way. Or, if you're single and have been trying to get them to commit to you, they could be stubbornly avoiding this change so they can keep living their life on their terms. If you’re dealing with a stubborn partner in a romantic relationship, it’s totally normal to feel frustrated. It can be tough to communicate with someone who is so set in their ways! It’s not always possible to get the other person to reevaluate their behavior, but calming practices like doing mindful meditation or performing breathing exercises can help you manage your frustrated feelings."
