      "content": "Conserve water at home. Wasting water is one of the biggest ways individuals impact the health of the planet. Taking measures to use less water is something you can start doing right away. If you live in an area with a water shortage, this is even more important for the health of your region's environment. Try to check off as many items as possible from this list: Check and fix any water leaks. A leaky faucet can waste a lot of water. Install water-saving devices on your faucets and toilets. A low-flow showerhead could be a good start. Take shorter showers. Don't wash dishes with the water running continuously. Use a method that requires less water to get the dishes clean. Turn off your washing machine's water supply to prevent leaks. It doesn't need to be on all the time. Replace old toilets with new ones that use a lot less water. Wash and dry only full loads of laundry and dishes. Doing a half-load wastes water. Don't use too much water to water your lawn. Don't leave the faucet running while you brush your teeth."

      "content": "Use fewer chemicals. Chemicals used to wash our bodies, homes, cars and everything else get washed down the drain or absorbed in the grass, and eventually, end up in the water supply. Since many people use heavy-duty chemicals for all sorts of things, chemicals are doing real damage to waterways and aquatic life. Chemicals aren't good for humans, either, so do your best to cut back on them. Here's how: [1] X Research source Learn about alternatives to household cleaning items that do not use hazardous chemicals. For example, using a solution of 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 water works as well as most commercial cleaners for basic cleaning jobs. Baking soda and salt are cheap, non-toxic cleansers, but should be used in moderation. When no good alternatives to a toxic item exist, determine the least amount required for an effective, sanitary result and use a minimal amount each time you clean. Paying close attention to the requisite amount will help you reduce and also save money. Instead of using chemical-laden shampoos and soaps, try making your own . Instead of using pesticides and herbicides, find natural ways to get rid of weeds and pests."

The burning of these substances is a major factor in world air pollution. Reducing your reliance on electricity is a great way to play a part in saving the planet. Here's what you can do: [4] X Research source Use solar power for home and water heating. Shut off electrical equipment when you leave work to head home. If you have central air conditioning, do not close vents in unused rooms. Lower the thermostat on your water heater to 120. Turn down or shut off your water heater when you will be away for extended periods. Turn off unneeded lights even when leaving a room for a short time. Set your refrigerator temperature at 36 to 38 and your freezer at 0 to 5. When using an oven, minimize door opening while it is in use; it reduces oven temperature by 25 to 30 every time you open the door. Clean the lint filter in your dryer after every load so that it uses less energy. Wash clothes with warm or cold water instead of hot. Turn off lights, computers, televisions and other appliances when not in use. Use compact fluorescent light bulbs to save money and energy. Plant trees to shade your home. Replace old windows with energy-efficient ones. Keep your thermostat higher in summer and lower in winter when you are away. Insulate your home as best as you can."

The manufacture of the vehicles, the gas needed to run them, the chemicals they burn, and the production of roads all play a part. If you can drive and fly less often, you'll be doing a lot to help save the planet. [6] X Research source Walk or ride your bike instead of driving, whenever possible. Find bike routes in your town and use them! Join a carpool or vanpool to get to work if biking or walking isn't an option. Report smoking vehicles to your local air agency. Maintain your vehicle properly. Purchase radial tires and keep them properly inflated for your vehicle. Paint with brushes or rollers instead of using spray paints to minimize harmful emissions."

Making smart choices about where your food, clothes, and other goods come from can help make a dent in air pollution. [7] X Research source Shop at farmer's markets and buy food that was produced as close to your home as possible. When you're online shopping, pay attention to how far the items you order will travel before they arrive. Try to find items that won't have to travel long distances.

Industrial farming practices are not only harmful to individual animals, but they're also unsafe for the planet itself. Factory farming produces a lot of air and water pollution. You can address this issue in a personal way by doing the following: Eat more vegetables. This simple change is a way of opting out of the factory farming industry. Question where your meat comes from. Buy only locally-sourced meat from a small farm. Avoid eating beef. Cows emit lots of methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas, and other pollutants.

By making less trash, you can reduce your impact. [9] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. Try making these changes: [10] X Research source Buy products that you can reuse. Use glass containers instead of flimsy plastic ones, for example. Don't use plastic bags - use long-lasting fabric bags. Maintain and repair durable products instead of buying new ones. Avoid products with several layers of packaging when only one is sufficient. About 33% of what we throw away is the packaging. Use reusable plates and utensils instead of disposable ones. Use reusable containers to store food instead of aluminum foil and cling wrap. Buy rechargeable batteries for devices used frequently. Copy and print on both sides of the paper. Reuse items like envelopes, folders and paper clips. Use e-mail or texting as a substitute for paper correspondence. Use recycled paper. Mend clothes instead of buying new ones.

Put out a bird feeder and birdbath stocked with clean food and water. Let beneficial snakes, spiders, bees, bats, and other creatures live. Having these animals around is a sign your ecosystem is in good health. Install a beehive if you have the room. Use cedar chips or aromatic herbs instead of mothballs. Don't use chemical pesticides.

Did you know that globally three billion animals are bred and raised in industrial farms every day, being confined to a cage and fed largely unnatural diets? [14] X Research source The easiest way to respect animals worldwide is to have a meatless diet. Hunt deer, squirrels, or other animals for their meat. Although you still have to kill animals to procure meat, this is more natural and environmentally appropriate than most domestic alternatives. If practical, respect the sacrifice of life that has been made for your nutritional sustenance. Do not let any of the meat go to waste. If you are buying eggs opt for cage-free and certified humane and organic eggs. Make sure the eggs you are buying have the Certified Humane stamp on the carton. (The stamp is a rectangle with blue text at the top reading \"Certified Humane\". There are green hills at the bottom that have white text reading \"Raised and Handled\".)

Try being more mindful in the following ways: Let creatures like moles and groundhogs live instead of trapping and killing them. They may cause a little inconvenience in your garden, but they have a part to play in your region's ecosystem. Don't disturb wild places like forests, beaches, wetlands and other areas where animals make their homes.
