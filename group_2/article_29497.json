      "title": "Get two wooden dowels.",
      "content": "Get two wooden dowels. They should be about the length of your forearm, the distance from your elbow to your wrist, or about 3 ⁄ 4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) thick in diameter. If you want, you can paint them black or another color to make them look a bit more threatening. But keeping the wood bare can be nice, too. Each dowel should be about a foot long, if you're shorter than 6 feet (1.8 m), and about 16\" if you are taller, because the Nunchaku should be able to go around your body. If they're too small for you, you won't be able to use them effectively. If you cannot find two dowels that are about this size, you can get a larger dowel rod and use a hand saw, jigsaw, or a band saw to cut it into two pieces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get 2 feet (0.6 m) of rope.",
      "content": "Get 2 feet (0.6 m) of rope. The rope or rawhide string should ideally be around 2 feet (0.6 m) long, or a bit longer if you're taller than 6 feet (1.8 m). Your best bet is to procure some 3/16 nylon braided rope. You can also buy more rope and just cut it to meet the length requirements you need. This doesn't mean you'll have 2 feet (0.6 m) of rope between the nunchucks; you'll have less because you'll have to tie each end of the rope to the dowels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drill a hole through the top of each dowel.",
      "content": "Drill a hole through the top of each dowel. The hole should be wide enough to place the rope into, and should go at least 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) deep into each top of the stick. Use a 3/8 drill bit, or an even thinner one, depending on the diameter of your Nunchaku."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drill a smaller hole through the side of each dowel.",
      "content": "Drill a smaller hole through the side of each dowel. Now, you should drill a smaller hole through one side of each dowel, so that the rope can be looped through this hole and the top hole so you can tie it in place. This hole should reach the main hole so that the rope can go through it easily. It should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of each dowel; if the hole is too close to the top, the rope may open up the hole and come out of it after frequent use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed one end of the rope through the side hole and out the top of one of the dowels.",
      "content": "Feed one end of the rope through the side hole and out the top of one of the dowels. Then, tie it securely to hold it in place. Make sure you leave enough room (at least a few inches) for you to be able to securely tie the end of the rope in place."

    {
      "title": "Repeat this process with the other end of the rope.",
      "content": "Repeat this process with the other end of the rope. Now that you have secured one end of the rope to the wooden dowel, you can secure the other end of the rope to the other wooden dowel."

      "title": "Fill the top holes with glue.",
      "content": "Fill the top holes with glue. Use regular glue or crazy glue to add stability to the Nunchaku and to secure the rope in place."

      "content": "Finished. Just wait a few minutes for the glue to dry, and get ready to use those nunchucks! You can even begin to learn some nunchuck skills."

      "title": "Get one piece of PVC pipe that is at least 7 feet (2.1 m) long.",
      "content": "Get one piece of PVC pipe that is at least 7 feet (2.1 m) long. The pipe should also be ¾ inches in diameter. You will need to use a handsaw, hacksaw, or miter saw to cut the piece into two parts. The pipe should be hollow inside so the Nunchaku aren’t too heavy or dangerous."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the PVC pipe into two pieces.",
      "content": "Cut the PVC pipe into two pieces. You should make it so that the length of each pipe is as long as the distance from your wrist to your elbow, which should be about one foot long each. If you’re over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, it may be a little longer."

    {
      "title": "Connect the ends of the chain to each screw eye.",
      "content": "Connect the ends of the chain to each screw eye. Now, take a 12-inch piece of metal chain and use some needle nose pliers to bend open the link at each end of the chain so it opens up enough to put it around the screw eyes. Place each opened link around the screw eye and use the pliers to close the link again, so you’ve made it so that the screw eye is essentially just another link in the chain. Do this to both ends of the chain."

      "content": "Wrap the electrical tape around the pipe. Now, carefully wrap some black electrical tape around each pipe as much as you want. You can cover the entire pipe, or leave the end caps out to create a pipe with two colors. Either way, the black tape will give your Nunchucks a sleeker, more sophisticated look."

      "content": "Cut two foam tubes into 2 twelve-inch sections. You can use a sharp knife or an X-Acto knife to create two foam tubes, if you don't have tubes of that length already. Each tube should be about the length from your wrist to your forearm, so if you are smaller or making these for a child, then they may be a bit smaller than one foot each. These foam nunchuks are a perfect addition to a Halloween costume and are completely safe to use, though they are not the most effective."

Take about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of pipe cleaner, run it through the two holes on one tube, tie it together at the top of the tube, leaving about an inch of space. Then, repeat the process on the other tube, so you now have two tubes with two little pipe cleaner circles at the top."
