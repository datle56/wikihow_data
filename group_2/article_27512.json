Using apple cider vinegar or plain vinegar to wash hands and any other materials you will be using is a good substitute for antibacterial soaps. Use of non-latex gloves is also recommended, especially if touching the culture directly. [2] X Research source"

If you don't have much extra water for cleaning and rinsing, put 2 drops of iodine into the jar, add water, and swirl it all around to sanitize. Rinse out the jar, cover, and keep waiting. You also could put the jar into the oven for about 10 minutes at 285°F or 140°C if it is only made of glass or ceramic."

      "content": "When the tea is cool, pour it into the glass jar and add the starter tea, which should constitute about 10% of the liquid. Using about a 1/4 cup of vinegar per gallon of tea also works. This keeps the pH low to prevent any foreign molds or yeast from growing while the tea is getting started. [7] X Research source To make sure it's acidic enough, measure the pH (optional). It should be below 4.6 pH. If not, keep adding starter tea, vinegar, or citric acid (not Vitamin C; that's too weak) until the desired pH is reached."

      "content": "Wait about a week. When the tea starts to get smelly like vinegar, you can start tasting it and checking pH levels. [10] X Research source The culture will sink or float or do something in between. It is better that the mushroom floats on top to block aspergillus contamination. The best way to pull a sample is with a straw. Don't drink directly from the straw, as backwash may contaminate the tea. Also, do not dip the test strip into the brewing vessel. Instead, dip the straw about halfway into the tea, cover the end with your finger, pull the straw out, and drink the liquid inside or put that liquid on the test strip. If the kombucha tastes very sweet, it probably needs more time for the culture to consume the sugar. A pH of 3 tells you that the brewing cycle is complete and the tea is at the correct point to drink. Of course this can vary a bit to suit your needs and taste. If this final pH is too high, then either the tea will need a few more days to complete the brewing cycle, or it should be chucked."

If there isn't enough, you can either get smaller containers. Or, if there's just a slight gap, fill the rest with juice or more tea. Use only a small amount, or else you risk watering down the tea. Leave about 10% of old tea in the glass jar as starter tea to start a new batch of kombucha. Begin the cycle again: Pour in freshly brewed tea, put the culture back in, cover, etc. [12] X Research source You may use each layer of culture to make a new batch of tea; some recommend using the new layer of culture and discarding the old one. It is not necessary to put both layers of culture back into a single new batch; one will suffice. Every fermentation cycle creates a new child from the mother. So once you have fermented your first batch you will now have two mothers, one from the original mother, and one from the new child. This multiplication will occur for every subsequent fermentation."
