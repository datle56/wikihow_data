One of the biggest hurdles to helping someone with a marijuana dependency is proving that (despite popular belief) marijuana use can lead to addiction. Research has shown that overuse of marijuana can overstimulate certain systems in the body which will cause brain changes leading to addiction. It is estimated that 9 percent of people who use marijuana will become dependent, and 25-50 percent of daily users will become dependent.

Make sure the person knows that you will support them when they are ready to address their issue, but will not continue to provide support that helps them to continue their current behavior.

      "content": "Determine if the person is ready for treatment. On average, those who seek treatment for marijuana addiction (or marijuana use disorder) are adults who have used marijuana for ten years or more and who have tried to quit using six or more times. The most important part is for the person to want to quit using. You can’t monitor anyone twenty-four hours a day, so you have to be able to depend on the person’s will to stop using."

      "content": "Assist with finding a therapy to which the person responds. Individuals can seek treatment for marijuana use disorder through individual or group therapies. The process may be one of trial and error to find what works for your loved one. Therapies used to treat marijuana and other substance-use disorders include: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - CBT is used to teach strategies to identify and correct thoughts and behaviors to enhance self-control, stop drug use, and handle other issues that may occur. Contingency management - This approach uses frequent monitoring of the target behavior and the use of positive reinforcement to help modify behavior. Motivational enhancement therapy - This therapy aims to produce changes internally driven by the addict’s own motivation to stop using. Seeing a therapist during this period may also help the person confront the issues that led to marijuana use as a coping mechanism in the first place. There are no medications on the market for the addiction counselor (via a psychiatrist) to prescribe to treat marijuana addiction. However, a physician may prescribe medication for peripheral issues to help the person with anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders as he or she beats the dependency."
