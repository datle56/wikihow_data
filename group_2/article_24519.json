      "title": "Uber One is a paid membership program that offers users exclusive perks.",
      "content": "Uber One is a paid membership program that offers users exclusive perks. It applies to both Uber and Uber Eats, so you can receive special discounts on rides, groceries, food deliveries, and pickup orders. Uber claims that members save around $27 per month on average (excluding the cost of membership). [1] X Research source Since the program works across all of Uber’s platforms, you don’t need to download a separate app to access the benefits—you can use the same Uber One membership for both Uber and Uber Eats. Uber One is the replacement program for Uber Pass and Uber Eats Pass, which were discontinued at the end of 2021."

      "title": "Uber One costs $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year.",
      "content": "Uber One costs $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year. The monthly membership auto-renews every month unless you cancel it at least 48 hours before your next billing date. For the annual membership, you pay the full amount upfront, and it auto-renews every year on your enrollment date (unless you cancel it). [2] X Research source With an annual Uber One membership, you pay slightly less per month ($8.33) than the monthly membership, but you cannot get a refund for the year once your payment processes."

      "content": "6% back on eligible rides and top-rated drivers. Uber is best known for helping you get a ride , but it can get quite expensive if you take multiple trips per week. With Uber One, members receive 6% back in uber credits on all eligible rides, including UberX, Black, and Comfort (plus, priority access to the best drivers on the platform). [3] X Research source To be eligible for this discount, your ride must be at least $15 before taxes and fees. This offer doesn’t apply to shared rides or rides that are booked more than 30 minutes in advance."

      "title": "Unlimited $0 delivery fee on eligible Uber Eats orders.",
      "content": "Unlimited $0 delivery fee on eligible Uber Eats orders. One of the most annoying aspects of Uber Eats is having to pay a delivery fee for “small orders” under $25. This fee can cost up to $8 per order, but Uber One eliminates it entirely for members who spend $15 at participating restaurants and stores (and $35 at participating grocery stores). [4] X Research source To check if your restaurant or store is an Uber One partner, open up the Uber Eats app and look underneath the name of the establishment for the Uber One logo—a gold-colored circle with the number 1 inside. Keep in mind that you still have to pay service fees, taxes, and tips for your order, which can make it significantly more expensive than buying directly from the store."

Along with an unlimited $0 delivery fee, Uber One members also receive 10% off eligible orders from restaurants and non-grocery stores marked with the gold Uber One icon (and 5% off eligible orders from participating grocery stores). [5] X Research source To qualify for this offer, you must place an order of at least $15 at participating restaurants and non-grocery stores (and $35 at participating grocery stores)."

      "content": "Uber One is worth it if you spend over $9.99 in delivery fees on Uber Eats each month. If you order food often (and spend over $15 per purchase), Uber One can be a great way to save money on food deliveries. Depending on your location, some delivery fees can be as high as $8 per order. So, you’re likely to break even with a monthly membership if you order food 2-3 times a month. [6] X Research source Before committing to Uber One, think about how often you use other apps for the same services. If you also use Doordash, GrubHub, or Instacart for food deliveries, you might not reach the minimum amount per month to get your investment back."

      "title": "For rides, Uber One is worth it if you spend at least $200 on Uber every month.",
      "content": "For rides, Uber One is worth it if you spend at least $200 on Uber every month. If you order rides multiple times a month (and spend over $15 per purchase), Uber One may help lower your monthly costs. Since it provides 5% off eligible rides, you would have to spend $200 to break even with a monthly membership, or $167 per month to break even with an annual membership. [7] X Research source Before committing to Uber One, review your previous transactions to see how much you typically spend on rides. For instance, if your trips are usually less than $15, the 5% discount on rides wouldn’t qualify for most of your purchases, and you may end up wasting money on the membership."

This temporary “surge” in pricing is common on weekends, or anytime there’s a big event or festival. Consider planning your trip outside of these times to get the best deal on your ride. [11] X Research source If you can’t schedule your trip around peak hours (and you’re in the middle of a price spike), move your pick-up area a few blocks over to see if it changes the cost of your ride. You may need a walk a little bit outside of your original location, but you can instantly save $10-15."
