      "content": "Make a split step. Make a split step from the ready position to help you to get into position for the two-handed backhand. The split step is a small hop about an inch (2.5 cm) off the tennis court to load up in your legs. Your weight should be evenly divided over both your legs and they should feel like springs so that you can push off explosively to whichever direction you need. [1] X Research source Your split step should occur right before your opponent makes contact with the ball. This enables you to be ready to chase down the ball as soon as you know where it is going to hit."

      "content": "Make your pivot and shoulder turn. This is the first step of the two-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. From the split step take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot and putting all your weight on your left. As you step forward your body and shoulders will begin turning sideways. [2] X Research source All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot. By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot. Your arms should not be turning back during this step. They should stay directly in front of your chest. It is very important that your arms are not used during this step."

      "title": "Adjust to the proper grip.",
      "content": "Adjust to the proper grip. The two-handed backhand grip uses a Continental grip for your dominant (right for right-handers) hand and a Semi-Western forehand grip with your non-dominant (left for left-handers) hand. The non-dominant hand will be just above your dominant hand. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders. [3] X Research source To achieve the Continental grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket. Place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, sloped side of the grip to the right of the flat side top, and close your hand around it squarely. The sloped side should go diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. To achieve the Semi-Western forehand grip you will place the bottom knuckle of your non-dominant hand on the bottom left slanted facet of the grip and close your hand around the grip. The same slanted face should point diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm beneath your pinkie."

Let your racket drop down as you push off with your back foot, lifting your heel off the ground. At the same time your upper body should rotate towards the net; lifting your heel will help you to rotate your upper body. This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. You have the option of taking a small step forward with your front foot at the same time but this is optional. For beginners it is a good idea to take this small step forward at the same time. Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height."

You want your follow through to be one easy motion so that the deceleration of the racket is smooth. Your shoulders should be facing the net by the end of your follow through.

The one-handed backhand will usually use an Eastern backhand grip to create topspin on the ball. Relax your dominant hand and use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip. Grip the racket with your dominant hand once more. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders. To achieve the Eastern backhand grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely. An alternative grip includes the Extreme Eastern or Semi-Western Backhand grip. This grip is for use by stronger, more advanced players and is good for hitting high balls but not good for hitting low balls. Another alternative grip is the Continental grip, which holds the racket at a 45 degree angle and is good for hitting slices. The Semi-Western backhand grip is a rare backhand grip that is good for hitting heavy topspin but bad for hitting flat shots and slices."

This way your arm position relative to the racket does not change as you swing. The racket should come as low as your knee right before you make contact with the tennis ball.
