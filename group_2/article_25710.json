      "content": "Study the Hindi vowels. Hindi has 11 vowels, some of which are indicated by the use of diacritic marks, or symbols added to the letters of an alphabet in order to show different pronunciations. [2] X Research source Vowels in Hindi have two forms: one form for when they are used by themselves, and one form for when the vowel is joined to a consonant in a word. [3] X Research source अ a and आ aa अ does not change the consonant, so if you see a consonant without a modifying symbol, it will have this vowel sound. [4] X Research source When आ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ा to the end of the consonant (for example, न na becomes ना naa when आ is added to it). इ i and ई ee When इ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ि to the left-hand side of the consonant (before the consonant). When ई is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ी to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant). उ u and ऊ oo When उ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ु beneath the consonant. When ऊ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ू beneath the consonant. ए e and ऐ ai When ए is added to a consonant, you add the symbol े above the consonant. When ऐ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ै above the consonant. ओ o and औ au When ओ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ो to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant). When औ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ौ to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant). ऋ ri When ऋ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ृ beneath the consonant. This vowel isn't very common in Hindi and is only found in Hindi words of Sanskrit origin. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Study the Hindi consonants. There are 33 consonants in Hindi. [6] X Research source They are organized in the alphabet by how you use your mouth and throat to pronounce them. Because Hindi uses more consonants than English does, some of them have no direct equivalent in English. [7] X Research source The (a) next to some consonants indicates that they are pronounced as aspirated (i.e., with a strong breath of air such as p in \"pit\" or \"puff\"). Velar consonants, pronounced by using the back of the tongue at the roof of your mouth (e.g., k or g in English): क k , ख k (a), ग g , घ g (a), ङ n Palatal consonants, pronounced by raising the front of the tongue just behind the gums [8] X Research source (e.g., j in \"job\"): च ch , छ ch (a), ज j , झ j (a), ञ n Retroflex consonants, pronounced by curling the tongue backward and touching the roof of your mouth just behind the gums (none exist in English): ञ t , ट t (a), ड d , ढ d (a), ण n Flap consonants, pronounced by \"flapping\" the tip of your tongue toward the roof of your mouth behind your upper front teeth (e.g., the t softening in words like \"butter,\" which often sounds like \"budder\") : ड़ d and ढ़ d (a) Dental consonants, pronounced by touching the tip of your tongue behind the back of your upper front teeth (e.g., th in \"thin\"): त t , थ t (a), थ d , ध d (a), न n Labial consonants, pronounced by using the lips together (e.g., b in \"baby\"): प p , फ p (a), ब b , भ b (a), म m Semivowels are vowel-like consonants, such as the w in \"wet\": य y (as in \"young\"), य r , ल l , व w or v Sibilant consonants, pronounced by using the tip of the tongue to push air out in a hissing noise [9] X Research source : श sh , ष sh , स s Glottal consonants, pronounced by using the glottis at thee back of the throat [10] X Research source : स h"

Reading explanations for these pronunciations may seem a little complicated, but don't worry; once you start trying to practice the sounds, you'll be able to feel the difference between voicing and not voicing. Voiced consonants are pronounced by vibrating your vocal cords. [11] X Research source For example, voiced consonants in English include z in \"zoo\" and g in \"good\". Unvoiced consonants are pronounced without vibrating your vocal cords. For example, unvoiced consonants in English include s in \"snap\" and k in \"kitten\"."

      "title": "Become familiar with Hindi nouns.",
      "content": "Become familiar with Hindi nouns. Nouns are words for objects, places, emotions, animals, and people. In Hindi, all nouns have a gender: masculine (M) or feminine (F). The gender of Hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication, so when learning Hindi nouns, you must also learn their genders so you can use the nouns correctly. [13] X Research source A very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel आ aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel ई ee are usually feminine. However, there are many exceptions to this rule, so it's important to still learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice. For example: The noun for boy is: लड़का ladkaa (M) and the noun for girl is: लड़की ladkee (F). So in the case of these nouns, the general rule of gender applies. On the other hand, nouns like केला kelaa - Banana (M) and मेज़ mez - Desk (F) or घर ghar - House (M) are all exceptions to the general rule of gender."

      "title": "Become familiar with Hindi pronouns.",
      "content": "Become familiar with Hindi pronouns. Simple pronouns like “he, she, I, we, they” are key to communicating in any language, including Hindi. The pronouns in Hindi are: First person singular: मैं main - I First person plural: हम ham - We Second person singular: तू too - You (Intimate) Second person plural: तुम tum - You (Informal/casual), आप aap - You (Formal/respectful) A note on informal and formal pronouns: each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. Use the formal आप aap when meeting someone for the first time, talking to someone older than you or simply to show respect to the person you are addressing. Use the informal तुम tum when chatting with your friends or close relatives. Use तू too when you are in a very informal or intimate conversation, such as talking to your partner or to young children. It would be considered extremely rude in Hindi to use तू too when talking to a stranger or someone you barely know. Third person singular: यह yah - He / She/ It / This Third person plural: वह vah - He / She/ It / That In spoken Hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently: यह is pronounced yeh and वह is pronounced voh. Use यह yeh when talking about someone or something close to you, so if someone is standing right next to you, use यह yeh. Use वह voh when talking about someone or something further away, so if someone is standing on the other side of the street, use वह voh. When in doubt, use वह voh. Third person plural: ये ye - These / They Third person plural: वे ve- Those / They You will often hear वे ve being pronounced as the singular “voh”. The third person plural pronouns follow the same rules: ये ye for people / things close to you (in the distance sense) and वे vo for people / things further away. Note that both यह yeh or वह voh could mean either “he” or “she”, so there is no difference based on the gender of how you are talking to. You must rely on the context of the sentence to determine if a person is talking to a “he” or “she”."

      "content": "Become familiar with Hindi verbs. Verbs describe an action, occurrence, or state of being. Learn Hindi verbs in the infinitive form (in English, “to ___”), as verbs are conjugated by dropping the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. Hindi infinitives end in ना naa.

      "title": "Learn the basics of conjugating verbs.",
      "content": "Learn the basics of conjugating verbs. Like nouns, verbs in Hindi must be conjugated to reflect grammatical categories such as number, gender, tense, and mood. For example, the infinitive verb होना honaa- to be, conjugated for number becomes: मैं हूँ main hoon - I am हम हैं ham hain - We are तू है too hai - You are (intimate) तुम हो tum ho -- You are (informal) आप हैं aap hain - You are (formal) यह है yah hai - he/she/this is वह है voh hai - he/she/that is ये हैं ye hain - these/they are वे हैं ve hain - those/they are There are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense: For masculine singular subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ता taa. For masculine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ते te. For feminine singular or feminine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ती tee. Because Hindi verbs have many tenses, you’ll want to use a textbook or other reference materials to learn verb conjugations beyond the basic present tense. A good reference dictionary will also help you conjugate new verbs."
