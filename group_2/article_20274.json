You can get a quick bearing if something is right or wrong by asking: \"How would that make me feel?\" [1] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Treating others as you would like to be treated is the golden rule of humanity. It is shared by religions, philosophers, humanists and atheists alike and has been expressed by every culture in history: Buddhism: “Treat not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.” Hinduism: “Do not do to others what would cause pain to you.” Ancient Greece (Aristotle): “Conduct ourselves towards others as we would have them act toward us.” Applying this rule triggers your conscience to consider if you could be more helpful, listen to others and treat people with more respect. Read up on ways that you can live the golden rule."

      "content": "Think about the values and behaviour of people you do and don’t respect. Focus on how they treat others and if their words (what they say) and actions (what they do) match up to one another. This will sharpen up your knowledge of right and wrong and provide positive and negative role models to learn from. [2] X Research source Some positive role models might be people who always keep their word, go out of their way to help, stand up for what is right, or are patient and kind. Some negative role models might be people who lie, are unkind to others, or feel no remorse or concern when they hurt or upset others. Be wary of people who show by their words or actions that they lack a conscience. They are termed sociopaths and can be manipulative and dangerous. If you know someone like this you can protect yourself by limiting your contact with them. You can learn how to spot a sociopath here: [3] X Research source"

You can learn from famous examples such as Gandhi and also from daily news stories of ordinary people living in line with their conscience. Check out literature on morality and ethics. [4] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Gandhi famously called his conscience his “little voice within.” It enabled him to oppose injustice in the face of huge difficulty. The Abolitionists are another example of how a strong moral conscience can create change and right injustice. They relied on their moral conscience to successfully end slavery. [5] X Research source Conscientious objectors oppose war due their religious, moral or ethical conscience. At times of war they are in a tiny minority and their strong conscience is what enables them to maintain their beliefs in the face of huge opposition. Reading about the atrocities and moral failings of the Holocaust shows how vital keeping a conscience is to protect people from harm. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Unlock your conscience by practising empathy. The ability to truly see things from different points of view is essential. This means really listening to what people say and trying to understand them before jumping to decide what is right or wrong. Applying the golden rule is a good rule of thumb. In any situation you can quickly ask yourself: \"How would I feel if I were in their situation right now?\" It is important to also realise that their life experience may have been very different to yours. How you would feel in this situation and how they feel might not be the same. Go beyond thinking how you would feel and honestly try to put yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself: “What are they feeling? Why do they feel that way?” Try out different actions and see which ones make a positive impact and make you feel good. For instance, try volunteering at a charity and see how it makes you feel. [7] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021."

It is easy to stay in the same, safe routine and think you know what is right and wrong, but you miss the opportunity to learn from other possibilities. Be curious about other people. Get to know people you would normally not stop and talk to. Ask questions about their lives. Speaking to people from different cultures can bring surprising changes in your own beliefs about life. Speak to older people who have a lifetime of experience. Have meaningful conversations and ask for their advice on life and how to live it.
