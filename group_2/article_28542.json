      "content": "Switch on the bathroom faucet. As soon as you enter the bathroom, turn on the faucet before you sit on the toilet. Some people believe that your body is programmed to urinate whenever you hear the sound of trickling water. Others believe that the soothing rush of running water helps switch on your parasympathetic nervous system, which in turn allows your bladder muscles to relax. In any case, a little background noise could be exactly what you need to get that plastic cup filled up. [1] X Research source When you’re stuck on the road with no rest stop in sight, the last thing you want to hear is the sound of trickling water. By that logic, a little running water could be just what you need when you’re stuck in the bathroom."
