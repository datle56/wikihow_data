If the children see that you are becoming annoyed or you start yelling, the situation will likely only become louder and out of control. Always stay calm and act in control, even if you don't feel like you are. [1] X Research source Try taking a deep breath and counting to 3 in your head before you do or say anything."

[2] X Expert Source Courtney Copriviza Elementary School Teacher Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Keeping things consistent can help your kids know what's expected of them and when it's expected. Whenever you are trying to keep a group of kids quiet, always use the same commands and consequences to help make your directions clear. [3] X Research source If you work with other instructors, have them use the same commands and consequences that you do. Make sure that everyone is phrasing “no’s” in positive terms. For example, instead of saying, “No running!” everyone could say, “Use walking feet!” Avoid changing your instructions to keep quiet. Try to quiet the kids down using the same methods to make them routine and familiar. Try to use the same methods in different situations. For example, if you have a key word that means \"be quiet\", you'll want to use it in the classroom, on a field trip or any other situation you might need to. Invite your students to help you come up with 3-4 classroom rules that they think are most important. Keep this list of rules short and concise, so you can keep the kids on track and on task.

      "content": "Know how to regain control over the kids. Even though you may have some great methods that usually work to keep kids quiet, they may not always work. Maybe the day is a particularly exciting one or the kids are just not ready to quiet down. If you feel that you've lost control over your class and the usual techniques for quieting down aren't working, try some of these basic methods to help you regain control: Slowly increase the level of consequences. For example, if you are using a point system, take away more and more points for every minute the kids are too loud. If one child is responsible for the disruption, send them out of the class and speak with them apart from the class. Changing the activity you are doing can shift the focus onto something other than the disruptive activity they are engaged in. Once your kids have started to quiet down, have them put their materials away and simply sit in silence. Wait for at least five minutes in silence before resuming. You could also try a calm response technique with your students, such as \"1, 2, 3, eyes on me, 1, 2, 3, eyes on you.\" [8] X Expert Source Courtney Copriviza Elementary School Teacher Expert Interview. 18 June 2021."

Work with your kids to let them know that the quiet sound is something fun and something to pay attention to.
