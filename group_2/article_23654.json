      "title": "Practice blinking slowly and rapidly to help reduce eye strain.",
      "content": "Practice blinking slowly and rapidly to help reduce eye strain. Blinking gives your eyes a brief rest and moisturizes them so they don’t dry out. Take 2 minutes and blink once every 30 seconds, making sure your eyes are completely closed before opening them again. After slowly blinking, spend another 2 minutes where you blink every 4 seconds. Repeat the process several times throughout the day to train your eyes to blink more. [1] X Research source This is especially helpful if you focus on a computer or TV screen all day since your eyes get strained more easily. Be sure your eyes close completely when you blink, or else they may still get strained."

      "content": "Trace a figure-8 pattern with your eyes to strengthen your eye muscles. Pretend that there’s a horizontal figure-8 shape about 6–10 feet (72–120 in) in front of you. While keeping your head still, follow along the figure-8 pattern using only your eyes. Continue tracing the pattern in one direction for about 2 minutes before changing following along in the opposite direction. Repeat the exercise 2-3 times daily to improve your eyes’ flexibility. [2] X Research source If you can’t easily make a figure-8 pattern, try rolling your eyes instead. Keep your eyes open and move them around clockwise. After 1-2 minutes, switch to rolling your eyes counterclockwise for 2 minutes."

      "content": "Shift focus from your thumb to something far away to improve vision. Hold your arm straight out in front of you and stick your thumb up. Focus on your thumb for about 5 seconds before changing your focus to something that’s about 15–20 feet (4.6–6.1 m) away to relax. Continue changing focus every 5 seconds for 2 minutes to improve your near sight. [3] X Research source Practice outside or in front of a window so you can easily look out and choose something to focus on that’s far away. Keep your thumb out in front of you when you’re focusing on the far away object so it’s easier to refocus on. When you aren’t focusing on your thumb, it will look blurry in front of the far away object."

      "content": "Move your thumb closer and further away from you to practice focus. Put your arm straight out in front of you and stick your thumb up. Pull your arm closer to your face, maintaining focus on it so it doesn’t go blurry. Stop when your thumb is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from your face or until you see double. Slowly stretch out your arm again until your thumb is back in the original position. Repeat the process for at least 10 minutes to help you develop better focus. [4] X Research source"

Try palming 2-3 times per day to help alleviate your eyes. [5] X Research source Don’t apply pressure to your eyes since you could damage them."
