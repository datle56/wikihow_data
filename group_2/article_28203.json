[2] X Research source Some melt-and-pour soap bases have a grid molded into them; you can use this as a cutting guide. You can use any type of base you want. White glycerin is popular, but goat milk or shea butter would be more luxurious!"

      "content": "Add in some essential oil or soap making fragrance oil. You will need 2 teaspoons total of either oil. You can use just one type of oil or a combination of 2 to 3 oils for a unique fragrance. Great choices include lemon and lavender. Thyme essential oil pairs especially well with turmeric. [3] X Research source For a more subtle fragrance, use less essential oil. If you are using essential oils instead of soap making fragrance oils, make sure that they are skin safe. Do not use candle-making fragrance oils. They are not the same thing, nor are they skin-safe."

Plan on using about 1 tablespoon of your desired exfoliant."
