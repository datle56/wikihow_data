      "content": "Determine where you want to hang your mirror. Gym mirrors come in various sizes but the standard widths are 3 and 4 feet (0.91 and 1.22 m) and the standard heights are 6 and 7 feet (1.8 and 2.1 m). Kits are available that include 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 mirrors. Keep in mind that you’ll need a little space on the top of the mirror to install the mirror clips. If you want to have the mirrors reach down to floor level, be sure to check for electrical outlets. Most outlets are 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) off the floor. You will still be able to see your full body from 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) back if you hang your gym mirror to accommodate outlets. Before installing your mirror, think about what it will reflect in the room. Look directly across from the location to see what will be reflected.

      "content": "Purchase your gym mirror if you haven't already. Now that you know where you would like to put your gym mirror, you know what size you need. You can call and place an order with a mirror and glass company. Many companies offer to install the mirror for you, sometimes for free and sometimes for a fee. Inquire about this option, especially if you have multiple mirrors to install or the installation is for a professional gym rather than a home gym. Choose mirrors that are at least 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick. Thin glass shatters easily and is dangerous in a gym setting. [2] X Research source If you have some extra money in your budget, consider glass-less gym mirrors. They are just as reflective but are nearly shatter proof."

      "content": "Use a J bar, mirror clips, and mirror glue for your installation. If you have purchased a brand-new gym mirror, it will come with the necessary hardware for installation. [3] X Research source If you have a used gym mirror that didn’t come with any hardware, you will need: A J bar and anchor screws to hang it. A J bar (sometimes called a J channel) is what the bottom edge of the mirror will be placed in for support. If you are hanging multiple gym mirrors side by side, your J bar can be the length of all of the mirrors combined. 2 mirror clips for the top edge of each mirror and two anchor screws to install them. Mirror glue. Make sure to use glue specific for mirrors, since other types of glue can damage the silver lining on the back of the mirror. [4] X Research source"

Slide the stud finder along the wall at the height that you will be drilling. When the machine indicates a stud, either by beeping or a red light flashing, make a mark with your pencil. If you cannot locate your studs, make sure you are using anchors that are specifically made for your type of wall."

For example, if you want the bottom of your mirror to be 1 foot (0.30 m) up from the floor, measure that distance with a tape measure at intervals of 6 inches (15 cm) for the entire width of the mirror. Mark each spot with your pencil. Make sure to mark the beginning and end of the space that the mirror will occupy."

Space the circles around, leaving about 1.5 feet (46 cm) of space around each circle. Use a generous amount of the glue, filling in the circles fully. Don’t put the circles of glue too close to the sides of the mirror. When the mirror is pressed into the wall the glue will spread a little and you don’t want it to ooze out the sides. [9] X Research source Some mirrors might already have circular marks to help you know where to apply the glue."

While it is being held in place by someone else, climb up the step ladder with your drill, mirror clips, and screws. Screw each clip into the anchor. Because the mirror is supported by the J bar and the clips, you do not need to hold it in place as the glue dries."
