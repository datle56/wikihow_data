      "title": "Purchase a kit for growing white or black truffles.",
      "content": "Purchase a kit for growing white or black truffles. Black truffles are typically easier to grow, but white truffles are more valuable since they’re rare. Choose which type of truffle you want to grow, then buy the right kit. You can find truffle kits online. Check the kit to make sure it’s intended for indoor use. Some kits are designed to be used outdoors on existing trees."

      "title": "Inoculate the substrate if your kit isn't pre-inoculated.",
      "content": "Inoculate the substrate if your kit isn't pre-inoculated. Add substrate to a sterilized jar, then use a spore syringe to inject the truffle spores into the substrate. Cover and shake the jar to mix the spores into the substrate. Place the jar in a dark place that stays between the temperature of 21 to 25 °C (70 to 77 °F). Wait 2-4 weeks for your spores to colonize in the substrate. [1] X Research source It's best to shake the container 2-3 times a week to help distribute the spores evenly throughout the substrate."

      "title": "Follow the instructions to set up the kit.",
      "content": "Follow the instructions to set up the kit. Read the instructions that came with your kit. Some kits come with the spores mixed into the substrate, so you just need to add water. [2] X Research source If not, add the truffle spores to the substrate by following the instructions that came with your kit. Push the spores about 2-3 mm below the top of the substrate."

      "title": "Add water to the soil to start your truffle garden.",
      "content": "Add water to the soil to start your truffle garden. Use a watering can or spray bottle to moisten the soil that contains the truffle spores. This should activate the spores and provide them with the moist environment they need to grow. Check the instructions that came with your kit to find out how much water is recommended."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse and shake the substrate if the instructions say to do so.",
      "content": "Rinse and shake the substrate if the instructions say to do so. Some kits that come with a premixed substrate require you to rinse the mixture to help activate the truffles. After you add water, cover the container and shake it. Then, turn the container over to drain the water out of the top of the lid. Repeat 2-3 times to ensure that your truffle spores are activated. [3] X Research source You may not need to rinse your substrate. Always follow the instructions that came with your kit."

      "title": "Keep the lid on your truffle garden at all times to avoid contamination.",
      "content": "Keep the lid on your truffle garden at all times to avoid contamination. Spores from other types of fungi, like mold, can get into the substrate if you leave it exposed. The fungus will compete with the truffles, preventing them to grow. Additionally, it may damage your truffle crop. Secure the lid over your truffle garden to keep it protected. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the grow kit in a dark area that's between 21 to 25 °C (70 to 77 °F). Mushrooms don't need light to grow. Since they're a fungus, they grow best in a dark, moist environment. Keep your kit in a pantry, cabinet, or under a towel at room temperature. This will help you grow your crop as quickly as possible. [5] X Research source"

If it's starting to dry out, use a spray bottle add more water to the grow kit. However, don't add any water if the soil feels wet. [6] X Research source Spritz the entire surface of the substrate with water when you're doing a watering."

      "title": "Expect your truffles to grow in about 2-3 weeks.",
      "content": "Expect your truffles to grow in about 2-3 weeks. Truffle kits grow much faster than truffles grow in the wild. Check on your truffles daily to monitor their progress. You'll likely see growth after 1-2 weeks, and your mushrooms should be ready to harvest after 2-3 weeks. [7] X Research source Some kits promise a faster crop, so check the instructions that came with your kit. Typically, the kits that grow faster only produce 1 small crop."

      "title": "Purchase a sapling that’s been inoculated with truffle spores.",
      "content": "Purchase a sapling that’s been inoculated with truffle spores. Truffles naturally grow on tree roots, so the best way to grow them is to use a sapling that’s already infected with truffle spores. Choose a birch or beechnut tree since they’re smaller and easier to grow indoors. Alternatively, grow a hazelnut tree in a small pot so it gets about the size of a bonsai. [8] X Research source You can find inoculated trees online or through some nurseries."

      "content": "Choose a planter that's between 18 to 22 in (46 to 56 cm) in diameter. The planter will restrict the root ball's growth, which can keep your tree a manageable size. A large planter will provide your tree with just enough space to get the nutrients it needs so it stays alive, allowing your truffles to grow. Generally, an 18 to 22 in (46 to 56 cm) planter works great for small trees.

Use a soil testing kit to make sure your potting soil is in the correct pH range for growing truffles. Follow the directions on your kit to test the soil. [10] X Research source If the pH is too low, add limestone to the soil to raise it."

To ensure your soil has great drainage, mix gravel into the potting soil at the bottom of the pot. [11] X Research source You can find potting soil and gravel at your local gardening store."

Check that the container gets sun for at least 6 hours a day. Without proper sunlight, your truffles may not grow. [14] X Research source If you don’t have a window that gets proper sun, move the container between windows to ensure it gets sun."

Alternatively, use a heat lamp to warm the soil and encourage the truffles to produce a crop. [15] X Research source In the wild, truffles grow well in areas that have all 4 seasons, so you can still grow truffles in a room that has varying temperatures. However, it can take years for the truffles to grow under natural conditions. They may grow faster if you keep the soil warm."

      "content": "Water the soil every day to keep the it moist. Like other fungi, truffles thrive in a moist, well-draining soil. Use a watering can or cup to moisten the surface of the soil, whether you’re growing a tree or using a kit. [16] X Research source Check your drainage pan after each watering. If it contains water, empty it out in a sink."

      "content": "Begin checking the soil for truffles after 3-4 months. You likely won’t get any truffles for at least a year. However, some kits may sprout truffles in as little as 3 months, so it’s okay to start looking for them at this time.

      "content": "Check for lumps growing below the soil. Press your finger into the soil to feel for lumps. Look for black lumps if you're growing black lumps or white lumps if you're growing white truffles. Since truffles usually grow on tree roots, they’ll likely be under the surface of the soil. If you don’t see any lumps, the truffles aren't producing a crop yet."

Collect the truffles in a separate container for use later. The truffles should leave spores in the soil for the next crop. [18] X Research source Wash your truffles before cooking with them. If the truffles are wet and very spongy, they're likely rotting and aren't fit for consumption. You'll likely get multiple crops of truffles, as they'll leave behind spores. However, some kits only produce 1 crop, so read the instructions that came with your kit."
