      "content": "Select a light yarn in any color and size 6 US (4.0 mm) needles. Determine what color yarn you want to make the blossom; think about what colors look nice together. Choose a yarn that's light worsted weight. You'll also need to get out a pair of single pointed needles. [1] X Research source Light worsted weight is sometimes labled as #3 weight."

      "content": "Cast on 51 stitches. Make a slipknot using the yarn you chose and slide it onto one of your needles. Hold the needle in your non-dominant hand. Then cast on 51 stitches to make the foundation of your blossom. [2] X Research source This will make a blossom that's 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter. If you'd like to make a blossom that's smaller or larger, cast on a multiple of 10 stitches plus 1."

Knit every stitch of the third row and finish by purling every stitch for the fourth row. The pattern will look like this: [3] X Research source 1: Knit all 2: Purl all 3: Knit all 4: Purl all"

      "content": "Knit 1 and bind off 9 stitches across row 5. To begin shaping the petals of the blossom, knit the first stitch of row 5. Then bind off the following 9 stitches. You should now see just 2 stitches on your left needle separated by a gap where you bound off the 9 stitches. Continue to K1, BO 9 across the row. [4] X Research source Once you reach the end of the fifth row, you'll have 6 stitches on your needle with gaps in between. These will form the petals of your blossom."

Thread the tail through a tapestry needle and insert it through each of the loops on the needle. Slide the stitches off as you go. [5] X Research source"

Once you've sewn through each of the stitches and you don't have any more on your needle, pull all of the yarn tail until it begins to cinch the center of the flower together. [6] X Research source The knitted piece should now be circular like a blossom. You should see a decorative center in the middle of the work."

      "content": "Whipstitch the sides and petals. Ensure that the yarn tail is still threaded onto the tapestry needle and use it to sew the sides of the blossom together so they're flush. Then whipstitch between each petal down towards the center of the blossom. Remember to leave a long yarn tail once you finish so you can attach the blossom to another project. [7] X Research source Pull on the yarn tail as you sew so the center of the blossom becomes secure. Whipstitching between the petals will create a distinctive blossom shape. If you'd like to decorate the blossom, sew a knit center or button onto the middle."

If you plan on attaching it to another project, keep the yarn tail long so you can sew it onto the other fabric."
