If you have not unlocked the sea race feature, which allows you to compete against others in Jet Ski races, your best bet to riding a Jet Ski is finding one in the open world. These Jet Skis are available from the very beginning of the game. A Seashark Lifeguard model can be found parked in the water at the Del Perro Beach and the Vespucci Beach. Del Perro Beach is located on the left side of the map, and Vespucci is located a bit further down the coast. Once on the coast of the beach, the Jet Ski docking area can be found located to the left of the pier; it will appear as a dock with several Jet Skis parked in front of it."

Race through these checkpoints alongside your competitors. The race will end when you drive through the checkered checkpoint. Racing in sea races will help you practice driving a Jet Ski (in case you need it to escape from the police again later on), but it really doesn’t give you any points or rewards for winning."
