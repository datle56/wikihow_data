If you're traveling, using Facebook Messenger is a great way to make calls over the internet for free."

The recipient will be notified that they are receiving a call. [1] X Research source If the call button is grayed out, the other person cannot currently receive phone calls.

If you don't want to hold up the phone, tap the \"Speaker\" button to turn on the speakerphone. This will play the call audio loud so that you don't have to hold the phone to your ear. Tap the \"Mute\" button to mute your audio. This will prevent the other person from hearing you until you turn mute off. Tap the \"Video\" button to turn a voice call into a video call. The other person will be notified that you want to turn on video, and can either accept or deny the request. If the other person accepts, you'll be able to see each other using the cameras on your devices."

Remember, everyone that you want to include in the call must be connected to the internet. Connect to Wi-Fi if possible. Facebook doesn't charge for video calls, but if you're on a cellular data connection, the call will count against your data plan.

This icon looks like a video camera and is near the top of the chat if you're using the web browser, desktop client, or mobile app. Video calls are placed just like phone calls. You'll see a small window displaying how you appear, and the recipient's video will take up the main screen. [3] X Research source If the video button is grayed out, the other person cannot receive video calls. They may be offline or may not have Messenger updated to the latest version. Make your call from a well-lit area and hold the phone away from your face. The other person will be able to see you a lot easier if you are in a well-lit room or outside. Direct sunlight may not work well with your device's camera. Hold your phone out and away so that the other person can get a good look at your whole face. There's also a transparent video camera icon with stars on it that you can drag around the screen. Tap the icon for more options, like filtering or special effects. The interface disappears during conversations, so you can see the other person clearly. In that case, tap the screen once to reveal the many icons."

Tap it again to unmute your audio. Tap the video camera icon to turn off your camera.
