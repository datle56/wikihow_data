      "content": "Measure from your belt-line to the floor, double it, and add 20 cm (7.9 in). If you prefer to wear your pants higher in the back and lower in the front, then start measuring from the highest point where you will wear the pants. This measurement will help you to determine how many yards of fabric to purchase. You will also need this measurement when it is time to cut the fabric for the pant length, so be sure to write it down. [1] X Research source For example, if your measurement is 75 cm (30 in), then double it for a total of 150 cm (59 in). Then, add 20 cm (7.9 in) for a final total of 170 cm (67 in). This is equal to about 1.85 yd (1.69 m), so you would need to round up and plan to purchase 2 yd (1.8 m) of fabric."

Opt for a fabric that is lightweight and flexible. [2] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. Gauzy cotton, silk, satin, chiffon, georgette, and jersey are all great options. [3] X Research source You can choose any color of fabric you like. Go with a solid color, a print, or a fabric that has been embellished, such as with sequins."

      "content": "Choose wide elastic for the waist and narrow elastic for the ankles. The waist elastic should be about 2 to 2.5 cm (0.79 to 0.98 in) wide and the ankle elastic should be about 5 mm (0.20 in) wide. Purchase enough of the wide elastic to fit around your waist with a 2 cm (0.79 in) allowance and enough of the narrow elastic to fit around each of your ankles plus an extra 4 cm (1.6 in). [4] X Research source For example, if your waist is 60 cm (24 in), then opt for a piece of elastic that is 62 cm (24 in). If the circumference of each of your ankles is 17 cm (6.7 in), then double that for a total of 34 cm (13 in) and add 4 cm (1.6 in) for a total of 38 cm (15 in)."

Smooth out the fabric to ensure that there are no lumps or bumps. [6] X Research source If your fabric is wrinkled or has creases in it, then you may want to iron it first to ensure that it will lay flat. This is optional, but it will make cutting and sewing the fabric much easier."

Then, position the crotch of the shorts about 1 cm (0.39 in) from the raw edge of your fabric. Adjust the shorts as needed to get the positioning right and ensure that the waistband is parallel to the fold.

Then, add 6 cm (2.4 in) to it for seam allowance. Measure from the fold and mark the fabric with the measurement in a few places. Use the marks to draw a line across the fabric with a fabric marker or a piece of chalk. [12] X Research source For example, if your pant length is 75 cm (30 in), then add 6 cm (2.4 in) for a total of 81 cm (32 in). Mark the fabric 81 cm (32 in) from the fold."
