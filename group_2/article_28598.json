      "content": "Make 1 gallon (3.78 liters) of brine for 6 lbs. (2.72 kg) of meat. Mix 1 cup (227 grams) of salt for each gallon (3.78 liters) of water you use in your brine. If you make sweet brine, mix 1 cup (227 grams) of brown sugar plus 1 cup of salt per gallon. Cut the salt and sugar by half if you need just a half gallon (1.89 liters), or by 3/4 if you need just 1 quart (.946 liter)."

      "content": "Make a flavored brine with garlic powder and ground black pepper or other seasonings. Add 1 cup (227 grams) of salt, 1 cup of white sugar, 4 tablespoons (60 grams) of garlic powder and 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of ground black pepper to 1/2 gallon (1.89 liters) of hot water. Stir until salt and sugar dissolve. Add crushed ice until you have about 1 gallon (3.78 liters) of brine. Experiment with flavorings in your brine. Add to the brine water apple juice, wine, lemon, thyme, maple syrup, soy sauce, chili powder or onions. You may also add cumin or coriander seeds, jalapeno peppers, fresh herbs, honey or rosemary. Amounts of seasonings vary depending on how much water you use. Do not over-season brine because you could ruin the meat. Add seasonings to your taste. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Submerge the meat in the brine and refrigerate. If you can't fit the container in the refrigerator, place ice cubes in the brine as needed to keep the water cold. Put the ice in a sealable plastic bag and place the bag in the brine if you are brining a thick piece of meat or a turkey in a large amount of brine liquid. Keep the piece of meat submerged, if possible. If not, turn the meat occasionally and lengthen the time you brine."

      "content": "Brining time depends on the thickness of the meat and the intensity of the brine. It takes more time to thoroughly brine a thicker piece of meat. Brine a 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) thick piece of meat in the refrigerator for a half hour; 1 inch (25.4 mm) for 1 hour; 2 inch (50.8 mm) for 3 hours; and 3 inch (76.2 mm) for 8 hours. [4] X Research source"
