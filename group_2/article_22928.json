      "content": "A propeller in the base of the fan draws air into the pedestal. That’s right, bladeless fans aren’t actually bladeless. It’s a tad misleading, since there is actually a propeller with blades concealed in the base of the fan, which takes in air through the vents in the fan’s pedestal. [1] X Research source These fans are “bladeless” because you don’t see the blades, not because they don’t have them!"

      "title": "The propeller pushes air out through the fan’s ring.",
      "content": "The propeller pushes air out through the fan’s ring. Once inside the base of the fan, air is directed up into the ring of the fan. Then, the air is expelled out through a slot in the fan’s ring. This slot spans the entire length of the ring, creating a circle of flowing air. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "The expelled air creates “negative pressure,” which sucks in more air.",
      "content": "The expelled air creates “negative pressure,” which sucks in more air. The inside of the fan’s ring is shaped like a slight cone, and the expelled air exits the wider end of the cone. This movement creates what’s known as “negative pressure” around the ring of the fan. The air around the fan wants to fill this area of negative pressure, and so more surrounding air is directed or sucked through the fan, creating a more intense breeze. [3] X Research source “Negative pressure” occurs because the air inside the ring is moved out of the ring, and so more air is pulled into the ring in order to equalize the pressure. This phenomenon of air getting sucked into the ring of the fan due to negative pressure is known as “inducement.”"

      "title": "Air around the fan also begins to move in the direction of the breeze.",
      "content": "Air around the fan also begins to move in the direction of the breeze. As the air is expelled through the fan’s ring, it pulls additional air outside the ring along with it. This process is called “entrainment,” and adds to the overall airflow created by the fan. [4] X Research source Note that the air is “multiplied” now in 2 different ways: air pulled in through the ring, and air pulled along from outside the ring as the air inside the ring exits. By the time the air exits the fan, its flow is about 15 times more intense than when it started, all thanks to some clever physics! The physics that make bladeless fans possible, namely air inducement and entrainment, are the same physics that lift an airplane as air flows over its wings."

      "title": "Traditional fans provide weaker air flow.",
      "content": "Traditional fans provide weaker air flow. A traditional fan merely pushes air with its blades. Though many of the same principles are in play—air still pulls more air along as it passes through the blades—bladeless fans optimize this process with their clever design, which takes full advantage of physics."

      "title": "Bladeless fans are safer than traditional fans.",
      "content": "Bladeless fans are safer than traditional fans. Because the “blades” of a bladeless fan are tucked away in its base, they pose less danger, especially to curious infants and pets. [5] X Research source While most traditional fans are surrounded by a cage, the cage may break or fail to prevent children from sticking their fingers into the fan itself."

      "title": "Bladeless fans are quieter than traditional fans.",
      "content": "Bladeless fans are quieter than traditional fans. The original Dyson bladeless fans had something of a noise problem, but later redesigns smoothed out the harsh noise. Bladeless fans are now typically much quieter than their bladed counterparts, which makes for a cooler, more peaceful space. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Bladeless fans use less energy.",
      "content": "Bladeless fans use less energy. Heating and cooling typically comprise the largest percentage of your energy bills, so you want to lower that however possible. Bladeless fans are capable of circulating air much faster than traditional fans, which cools any given space much faster, which lowers the amount of power needed to stay cool yourself.

      "title": "Traditional fans are typically cheaper.",
      "content": "Traditional fans are typically cheaper. While bladeless fans may offer better airflow and safety, they also are significantly more expensive, due to their highly engineered design. In addition, many bladeless fans now come with additional features, like remote controls and air purifying or even heating capabilities, which will cost you more. [8] X Research source"
