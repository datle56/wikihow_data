      "content": "Apply a generous amount of shampoo to your hair while it’s dry. You can use any kind of shampoo you want, but don’t wet your hair first. If you wet your hair, the shampoo will mix with the water. Since wax repels water, the shampoo then won’t be able to penetrate the wax to start breaking it down. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use about the same amount of shampoo that you would normally use, or a little more. While your regular shampoo will work fine for this, a clarifying shampoo might give you a little more cleansing power. You could also apply a water-soluble styling product like hairspray or dry shampoo to your hair to start breaking down the wax. Work the product into your hair, then rinse it out and wash your hair the way you normally do.

      "content": "Work the shampoo through each strand of your hair. Starting at the roots, use your fingers to massage the shampoo all the way down your hair. You should feel the wax starting to loosen, but don’t worry if you don’t get it all on the first pass. [3] X Research source By working on one section at a time, you’ll be less likely to miss any spots."

      "content": "Rinse your hair with very hot water, but not hot enough to scald you. Turn on your shower and get the water as hot as you can stand it. Then, thoroughly rinse your hair, starting close to your scalp and working your way down. [4] X Research source Cold water will make the wax even harder, but hot water will help soften it so you’ll have an easier time removing it from your hair."

      "title": "Repeat with more shampoo if you used a lot of wax.",
      "content": "Repeat with more shampoo if you used a lot of wax. If your hair still feels waxy, you may need to shampoo it again. Use the same amount of shampoo as you did the first time, and follow the same procedure, massaging it into your hair section by section. [5] X Research source Since the initial shampoo should have broken down a lot of the wax, it’s fine to apply more shampoo while your hair is still wet."

      "title": "Apply conditioner",
      "content": "Apply conditioner to your hair. In addition to providing nourishing moisture to your hair, using a conditioner may help break down any remaining wax. You don’t need any special conditioner for this, so just use one that’s formulated for your hair type. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For example, if you have very dry hair, you might need a thick, moisturizing conditioner. If your hair tends to be oily, you should use a light-weight detangler that won’t leave behind much residue. Avoid putting conditioner directly on your roots, as this may make your hair look greasy. If there’s still wax residue in your hair, let it rest for a day without putting in any product, then wash it again.

      "content": "Wrap a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) section of your hair in a paper towel. If your hair is covered with hard wax, you may need to use heat to soften the wax before it will come out. To protect your hair from getting too hot during the process, it’s best to wrap sections of your hair tightly in paper towels before you apply the heat. The paper towels will also help draw the wax out of your hair. [8] X Research source You’ll need to use a clean paper towel for each section."

Be sure to keep the nozzle at least 6 in (15 cm) from the paper towel so it doesn’t burn. Move the hairdryer back and forth for 1-2 minutes until you feel the wax start to soften. [9] X Research source Be careful not to burn yourself, and don't leave the hairdryer on any one section for too long, or you could damage your hair. If you need to, ask someone else to help you with this part."

      "content": "Press down on the wax and slowly pull off the paper towel. Try to use the paper towel to remove as much wax as you can from your hair, but avoid tearing the sheet, if possible. Some of the softened wax should stick to the surface of the paper towel, although you may need to go over some sections more than once. [10] X Research source To determine if you’ve removed all of the wax, run your fingers through your hair. If there are small pieces of wax left behind, try to pull them free by hand. If that doesn’t work, wait a few minutes for the section of hair to cool off, then apply the heat again."

When it’s ready, slide the paper towel off again, and continue until you’ve covered all of your hair. [11] X Research source Try not to heat the same section of hair again until it’s cooled. Otherwise, you could cause heat damage to your hair."

If that doesn’t cover all of the wax, add a little more as needed. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Olive oil is a popular option for removing wax. However, any oil will work, so it’s fine to use whatever you have on hand. For extra nourishment, use a coconut, argan, almond, or jojoba oils. If you like, you can even try this with your hair conditioner."
