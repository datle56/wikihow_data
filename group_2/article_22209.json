    {
      "title": "Research your local zoo.",
      "content": "Research your local zoo. Every zoo is different, so a little research can go a long way. Check your zoo’s official website for information on paid restaurants and attractions within the park, special events, daily tours, and feeding times. If you’re near a holiday, look for themed events like Haunt the Zoo or ZooLights."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid specialty days.",
      "content": "Avoid specialty days. Zoos often hold family discount days, where children get in at a reduced price, and field trip days, where they invite multiple schools out for educational events, tours, or camps. Though fun for the kids, they make the zoo louder and busier, which is not an ideal date environment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid extremely hot days.",
      "content": "Avoid extremely hot days. Animals hate the heat just as much as humans do, often even more if they have thick fur. Avoid going to the zoo on days where high temperatures are predicted, since many of the animals will be inside or sleeping under dark, shady areas to beat the heat. If your heart is set on visiting when it’s hot, make sure to bring sunscreen and a hat or visor. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Go on a weekend or day off.",
      "content": "Go on a weekend or day off. Unlike dinner or a movie, zoos can be a rather lengthy experience. Try going on a weekend, school break, or day off to have as much time as possible. Though zoos can be enjoyed in two or three hour chunks, it leaves less time to talk to your date, flirt, and see everything you want to. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress for the weather.",
      "content": "Dress for the weather. Though they may have aquariums, insectariums, and other closed buildings, most zoo exhibits are outside. To stay comfortable, make sure to check your local weather forecast and dress accordingly. Because you will be walking a lot, avoid tight dresses and other constricting clothes. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get there early.",
      "content": "Get there early. You can’t predict which animals will be awake during your date, but you can boost your chances of seeing more. Animals are most active during the morning, so arrive when the zoo opens to catch as many as possible. Look for animals that are currently being fed, since they will be more active and energetic than those that are full."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab a map right away.",
      "content": "Grab a map right away. Unless you’re staying for the whole day, chances are you won’t get to see every exhibit. Before you start exploring, grab a map of the zoo and find the spots you’re most interested in. Go to them first, that way you won’t be anxious about time or leave the date disappointed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear comfy shoes.",
      "content": "Wear comfy shoes. Zoos are massive and require a lot of walking, so it’s important to dress accordingly. For your date, wear shoes you could walk in for multiple hours at a time, like sneakers or flats. Avoid shoes with open toes or backs since they can make themed trails and interactive exhibits harder to enjoy. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring water bottles.",
      "content": "Bring water bottles. Though zoos sell bottled water and provide free water fountains throughout the park, it’s still a good idea to pack some ahead of time. Bring at least two bottles for you and two for your date, freezing some so they can thaw while you’re exploring. If you plan to stay the whole day, grab a few more to be safe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack a picnic for lunch.",
      "content": "Pack a picnic for lunch. Zoo restaurants can be tasty, but they are often expensive and can’t hold a candle to a nice picnic lunch. Some pre-made sandwiches, potato chips, fresh fruit like oranges or apples, and a brownie or cupcake for dessert will make for a filling and romantic meal. When you’re at the zoo, look for a canopy or pavilion table where you can sit and enjoy your food together. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk next to your date and, if both of you are comfortable, hold hands.",
      "content": "Walk next to your date and, if both of you are comfortable, hold hands . Whether you’re gazing at gazelles or spying on spiders, zoos are a great place to simply lock arms and enjoy the view. If it's a first date, a good way to break the touch barrier is to pull them gently by their wrist or hand and lead them to another animal enclosure. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Laugh along with the animals.",
      "content": "Laugh along with the animals. Wild animals can be just as silly as people, so a zoo date doesn’t need to be super serious. If you see something really funny, point it out and laugh together. If you're already close, you can playfully tease each other, like comparing your date to a tiger who sleeps a lot or a penguin who slips on the ice. Outdoor dates are great because there's so much going on around you that there's always something to talk about. That can help the date feel less intense, and it can also help you avoid any awkward silences."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be romantic",
      "content": "Be romantic . Put your arms around each other while looking idly at animals. Compliment your date and, if you’re already close, whisper something sweet or sultry to them. If you're going steady, you can ramp things up by sneaking a kiss in the nocturnal animal exhibit or in front of the aquarium. Just remember to keep it PG since the zoo is a family place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take plenty of photos.",
      "content": "Take plenty of photos. Zoos are perhaps the perfect camera date. Whether it’s an elegant lion photo, a funny picture with the gorillas, or a cute selfie with your date, each picture will have a unique style and memory attached to it, making them perfect for scrapbooks and social media. If your zoo offers photo booths, take a few shots together to hang on your wall or put in your wallet."

    {
      "title": "Play an observational game together.",
      "content": "Play an observational game together. Though beautiful, zoos can be a bit slow if the animals aren’t very active. To keep things fun and interesting when the animals are snoozing, try: [7] X Research source Playing I Spy in dense or busy exhibits. Playing 20 Questions with animal-related answers. Coming up with a backstory for different animals."

      "title": "Buy ice cream, cotton candy, or another zoo snack.",
      "content": "Buy ice cream, cotton candy, or another zoo snack. For longer dates, a small, tasty treat can be a perfect pick-me-up. For cool days, cotton candy or popcorn will make you full while keeping you mobile. For warm days, ice cream or a smoothie may be just what the doctor ordered. Zoo food is priced similarly to carnival or movie theater snacks, so make sure you bring enough money to cover them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take time to relax and talk.",
      "content": "Take time to relax and talk. No matter how unique a zoo is, most of your time will be spent walking through the park, watching animals, and sitting on benches. These moments give you a stress-free chance to talk about the park, each other, or life in general. If you run out of things to say, you can always fall back on the animals for unique, and sometimes silly, discussion starters. Reader Poll: We asked 297 wikiHow readers and 52% of them said that their favorite date conversation starters are questions about hobbies and interests . [Take Poll] So try a question about your date’s favorite activities!"

      "title": "Surprise your date with a souvenir.",
      "content": "Surprise your date with a souvenir. A small gift is a perfect way to end any date, and a zoo’s souvenir shop will have plenty of options to pick from. If your date mentioned a favorite animal or enjoyed a specific exhibit, get them a related trinket or stuffed animal to show you were paying attention. If you’re not sure what they’d like, go to the gift shop together and secretly buy something they pointed out. If you're a girl, don't be afraid to break gender roles and buy something for your date! Not only is it kind, but it will show how invested you were in it."
