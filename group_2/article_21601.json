      "content": "Slowly scroll down to read the new message. Only scroll far enough to read most of the message. If you scroll all the way to the bottom so the entire message is on the screen, it will be marked read. If you need to practice doing half-swipes, ask a friend to send you a DM so you don't risk accidentally viewing a DM that you don't want to have a read receipt on."
