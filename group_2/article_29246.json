      "title": "Leave the blister intact if it is not painful.",
      "content": "Leave the blister intact if it is not painful. The majority of blisters will heal naturally, without the need to be drained. This is because the unbroken skin covering the blister forms a protective shield which prevents infection. After a couple of days, the body will reabsorb the fluid inside the blister (known as serum) and the blister will disappear. This is the best option if the blister is not causing you any pain, as it minimizes the risk of infection. If the blister is on your hand or somewhere it will not be exposed to further friction, you can leave it uncovered as the air will help it to heal. If it is on your foot, you may want to cover it with a gauze or moleskin pad, which will protect the blister but also allow it to breathe. If the blister bursts on its own, allow the fluid to drain, clean the area well, then cover in a dry, sterile bandage until it heals. This will heal to prevent infection.

      "content": "Drain the blister if it is causing you pain. Although doctors recommend that you avoid bursting a blister if at all possible, in some scenarios it is necessary to drain a blister , especially if is causing a lot of pain or pressure. For instance, competitive runners may need to drain a large blister on the sole of their foot if they have a race coming up. If you need to drain a blister, it is very important that you follow the correct procedure in order to avoid infection. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean the area with soap and water. The first thing you need to do is clean the skin on and around the blister using warm water and soap. Any soap will do, but antibacterial soap is best. This will help to remove any sweat or dirt from the area before you proceed with the draining.

      "content": "Puncture the blister. Use the sterilized needle to puncture the blister in several spots around the edges. Use a clean piece of gauze or tissue to gently compress the blister, allowing the fluid to drain. Do not remove the loose skin covering the blister, as this will help to protect it.

      "title": "Apply some antibacterial ointment.",
      "content": "Apply some antibacterial ointment. Once all of the fluid has drained, dab a little antibacterial ointment or cream on the blister. Any over-the-counter antibacterial product will do, like Neosporin, Polymyxin B or Bacitracin. The ointment will help to kill any bacteria around the blister and fight off infection, while also preventing the bandage from sticking to the loose skin. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Loosely cover with a gauze pad or bandage. After you have applied the ointment, cover the drained blister with some gauze padding or a gel-based plaster. These will prevent any dirt or bacteria from entering the open blister, and also provide some comfort when walking or running if the blister is on the foot. You should apply a new plaster every day, especially if the existing plaster becomes wet or dirty."

Don't attempt to peel away any skin that is still attached, however. Clean the area again, apply more ointment and cover with a clean bandage. The blister should be completely healed within three to seven days."

      "content": "Choose well-fitting shoes. Many blisters form due to the friction caused by ill-fitting shoes. As the shoes rub or slip against the foot, they pull the skin back and forth, causing the outer layer of skin to separate from the inner layer, creating a pocket that becomes a blister. To prevent this from happening, invest in good-quality, breathable shoes which fit perfectly.

      "content": "Wear the right socks. Socks are very important when it comes to blister prevention, as they minimize moisture (which encourages the formation of blisters) and reduce friction. Choose nylon socks over cotton socks, as they provide more breathability. Wicking socks, which are a type of wool-blend socks, are another good option, as they draw moisture away from the feet. [15] X Research source Runners can also find special athletic socks which provide extra cushioning in areas most prone to blisters."

There are many products available over-the-counter which can be applied to feet before walking or running to reduce friction and the build-up of moisture. Try using a foot powder, which is sprinkled into the socks before wearing in order to keep the feet dry, or a cream which allows socks and shoes to glide over the skin, rather than causing friction.
