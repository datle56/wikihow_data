      "title": "Create a viewing schedule.",
      "content": "Create a viewing schedule. Twenty hours is a long time to watch anything, even something that you love. You might want to split your marathon into two days and do a half marathon each day, or you might only want to marathon your favorite movies. In any case, write down your general viewing schedule, so you can tell your friends the start and end time of your marathon. You can add some fun and imagination to your marathon by also making it a theme party. For true, diehard fans who plan on watching the entire series from beginning to end, you should plan a sleepover party. Otherwise, you may have trouble fitting 20 hours of viewing into a single day."

      "content": "Choose break-time activities. Sitting for long periods of time without moving can be bad for your health. Think of Harry Potter themed activities you might do to stretch out your body between viewings. This might include: Pretend dueling Muggle quidditch A Potterverse based board game Potter themed charades or pictionary Potter themed online quizzes"

      "title": "Make and send invitations.",
      "content": "Make and send invitations. Due to the combined length of the movies, you'll have to start watching early in the day and end late at night. You might even need to continue watching until the morning of the following day. Include your viewing schedule for your guests on your Potter themed invitation, and don't forget to include the address for the party, the time it starts and ends, and whether or not there will be refreshments. If you're trying to plan your party on a budget, you might consider making your party a potluck, where everyone brings a dish to pass. This should be clearly indicated on your invitations. [3] X Research source Write your invitations on yellowed, parchment style paper so your invites imitate mail in the Potterverse. Purchase this paper at your local craft store or at an art supply store. You can try adding the Hogwarts symbol to one side of the envelope, too. Use pictures that reference Harry Potter in your invitations. For example, since owls deliver mail in the wizarding world, you might include the picture of an owl on your invitation."

Think about some popular treats served in the wizarding world, and then do some research online to find recipes for these. You might serve butterbeer or pumpkin juice as drinks, and for food, you might prepare golden snitch cupcakes or Bertie Botts strange flavoured jellybeans. You might make: [4] X Research source Homemade butterbeer Treacle tart Cauldron cakes Pumpkin juice"

      "title": "Buy or rent the movies.",
      "content": "Buy or rent the movies. If you don't have any of the Harry Potter movies, or if you are missing some of them, you'll have to purchase or rent the missing DVDs. Check for scratches ahead of time and give each movie a test run before the day of your party. It would be disappointing if you made it most of the way through your marathon and then had to stop due to a damaged disk or corrupted digital file. If you're missing one of the Harry Potter movies in your collection, you might ask one of your friends to bring the movie to the party. That way you can focus on getting ready!"

Depending on the recipes you've found, or depending on your favourite Potterverse treats, you may need to buy additional supplies from your local grocery store. Once your treats are made, arrange your snacks in a way that mimics the movie, like arranging food on a long table. Organize your treats on a rolling cart and pretend during food breaks that you're riding the Hogwarts Express! Have backup treats ready so that when you've finished one you don't have to interrupt viewing."

If you plan on playing muggle quidditch you'll need brooms for players, and these could be stacked off to the side as decorations in the meantime. Posters from the movies can be taped to walls, butterbeer served in an intricate-looking carafe or coffee press, and the books can be placed around the viewing area to give your home some Potter flair.

Move furniture that is blocks walkways or takes up unnecessary space, and bring extra seating from other rooms if you are able.

You might award points for: Quoting lines with the movie Knowing obscure movie facts Pointing out errors and mistakes"

Be sure food is conveniently placed so that your guests can eat as they get hungry. Stopping to prepare food can put you behind in your viewing schedule. Have pre-made food ready to go in your refrigerator, or plan in advance to order in once the snacks are gone."
