      "content": "Pick or buy fresh basil leaves. You'll need several handfuls of basil leaves to make 1 1/2 cups (30 grams) of packed fresh leaves. You can use basil fresh from your garden, from the supermarket, or from a local farmer's market. Basil comes in many varieties and you can use any of them to make basil oil. Sweet basil is the most common kind of basil in the United States. It's perfect for use in Italian dishes and soups. Sweet Thai basil is often used in Asian cooking; it is slightly spicier with hints of licorice and cloves. Lemon basil has hints of lemon along with the typical sweet basil flavors. Purple basil types, such as dark opal basil or purple ruffles basil, are also spicier than sweet basil."

[5] X Research source The longer you leave the basil in the water, the more limp the leaves will become. You may lose some of the flavor if you leave the basil in for too long. Quickly boiling fresh herbs is called blanching. Blanching helps the basil maintain its color. [6] X Research source"
