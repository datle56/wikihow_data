      "content": "The “glizzy gobbler” TikTok trend started in 2020. In June of 2020 a Facebook post making fun of an unaware hotdog eater sparked the “glizzy gobbler” trend. [5] X Research source Glizzy gobblers, or glizzy gladiators, are people who eat hotdogs extremely quickly or in a silly way, like shoving the sausage way too far into their mouths. Popular glizzy gobbler hashtags are #glizzy, #glizzygobbler, and #glizzy3000. “Did you see how fast he ate that?” “Yeah, he’s a real glizzy gobbler.” “Did you just eat a hotdog in one bite?” “What can I say, I’m a glizzy gladiator.”"

      "title": "Just like “weiner” or “sausage,” glizzy can refer to a penis.",
      "content": "Just like “weiner” or “sausage,” glizzy can refer to a penis. This meaning is pretty cut and dried. Hotdogs and penises have similar shapes, so once glizzy started being associated with hotdogs, it became sexual as well. Usually, this version of glizzy is used to imply a man is gay. While the word itself isn’t explicitly derogatory, it’s often used with that connotation. This is the least common use of glizzy. “Stop looking at my glizzy bro.” “You really like to gobble glizzies, huh Tyler?”"
