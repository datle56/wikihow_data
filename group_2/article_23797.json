      "title": "Someone other than the recipient can sign for a FedEx package.",
      "content": "Someone other than the recipient can sign for a FedEx package. If a FedEx delivery requires an indirect signature, someone at the delivery address or someone nearby, like a neighbor or building manager, can sign to have a package delivered for the recipient. The recipient can also authorize for the package to be released without anyone present by requesting a change through FedEx Delivery Manager or by signing a FedEx door tag. [1] X Research source This type of signature is required if the shipper selects it when creating the shipping label for the package."

    {
      "title": "Sign for the package electronically.",
      "content": "Sign for the package electronically. If you know you won’t be home for the delivery, sign for your package ahead of time with an electronic signature. Do this through the FedEx Delivery Manager app or by visiting FedEx’s website . Create a FedEx Delivery Manager account if you haven’t already, then you’ll be able to access your delivery instructions. [2] X Research source Note that you can only sign electronically for indirect signature deliveries, not adult signature or direct signature. If you’ve already missed the delivery, check your door tag to see if you can sign it instead. When the driver attempts redelivery, they’ll accept this signature and drop off your package."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have someone else sign for the package.",
      "content": "Have someone else sign for the package. If you’re unavailable, FedEx will ask someone nearby to sign for the package on your behalf. This can be someone at your residence or a neighbor. If you know you won’t be home, give someone you trust a head’s up and see if they’ll be available to sign. [3] X Research source You should be able to see who signed for the package once it’s been delivered. If you can’t find your package at your address, contact FedEx customer service . If you don’t have anyone else to sign for you, consider having your package redirected or delivered at a later date. Redirect FedEx Ground shipments for free up to 10 days and Express for up to 5 days. A fee may apply otherwise."

      "title": "The FedEx driver will leave a door tag at the mailing address.",
      "content": "The FedEx driver will leave a door tag at the mailing address. If a shipment requires a signature but no one is available to sign, the driver will leave a door tag on the recipient’s front door. The recipient can sign this tag as an indirect signature, and the package will be delivered upon the next attempt. FedEx will typically attempt to deliver a package up to 3 times, after which the package will be taken to a nearby FedEx location for the recipient to pick it up. [4] X Research source If a label has been applied to the back of the door tag, it means the driver was unable to leave the package due to signature requirements or because they felt the package was not safe to deliver. In these cases, the driver may not attempt redelivery and will instead take the package to a FedEx location. Contact FedEx customer support if you’d like them to attempt redelivery. The door tag label will include the pickup location address, business hours, and the time the package will be available. The door tag and a government-issued ID are required for pickup. Download the FedEx mobile app and scan the barcode on your door tag to access information about the missed delivery and your options for redelivery."

      "title": "Contact the shipper.",
      "content": "Contact the shipper. If you see that your package requires an indirect signature early in the shipping process, reach out to the shipper directly to see if they can change the requirements. This may be a good idea if you’d prefer to sign for the package directly or if you don’t want a signature to be required at all. Be aware that the shipper may not always be able to change the signature requirements, and changing the requirements may affect the delivery time and security of your package. If you request for no signature to be required, FedEx will not be responsible for lost or stolen packages."

This allows you to authorize the driver to leave the package at a secure location or with a neighbor. Additionally, if you know you won’t be home, this allows you to change the delivery date or have the package delivered to another location.

      "content": "An indirect signature helps ensure the package is delivered safely. By obtaining an indirect signature, FedEx can hold someone accountable for receiving the package. This ensures the package was delivered to a responsible party so it is less likely to get lost or stolen. The recipient can easily see who signed for the package and where it was left in their proof of delivery details. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "It allows for flexibility in delivery. An indirect signature provides several delivery options; the recipient can sign for the package electronically, have someone nearby sign on their behalf, or have the package delivered to a FedEx location to be picked up at their convenience. This helps ensure that the package is delivered as quickly and efficiently as possible while giving the recipient options if they’re unavailable. [7] X Research source"

A government-issued ID or identification accepted by local authorities is required to sign for the package. If there is no one of age present to sign, FedEx will often attempt to redeliver the package at a later date. In the United States, the recipient must be 21 or older with a government-issued photo ID to receive the package. [10] X Research source Unlike indirect signature deliveries, if a package requires an adult signature, it cannot be signed for electronically."
