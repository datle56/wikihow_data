      "content": "Cut the hook off of 4 wire hangers with wire cutters . Make sure to cut the hook down to where the triangular base begins, but avoid snipping the twisted part. If the hangers came wrapped in cardboard, cut it away with a box cutter. If you can't find wire coat hangers, use some 12-gauge wire instead. Cut and twist the wire to make 4 large loops. Keep the twisted part 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long."

      "content": "Bend the hangers into oval or circular shapes. Make 2 pairs of the same shape with the 4 hangers—a bottom and top part for the left and right wings. Don't worry about making the shapes perfect, as you can alter them later. [1] X Research source ttps://lusaorganics.typepad.com/clean/2016/10/diy-fairy-wings-tutorial-.html"

      "title": "Overlap and tape 2 of the twisted parts together to make each wing.",
      "content": "Overlap and tape 2 of the twisted parts together to make each wing. Lay your first set of wings on a flat surface with the twisted parts facing each other. Overlap the twisted parts and fan the loops away from each other to create a wing shape. Tightly wrap a piece of duct tape around the overlapping twisted ends. Repeat this step for the second set of wings. If you can’t find duct tape, try electrical tape or florist’s tape instead."

    {
      "title": "Join the 2 sets of wings together with duct tape.",
      "content": "Join the 2 sets of wings together with duct tape. Set the wings down on a flat surface so they’re parallel to each other. Bring the taped twisted parts to touch. Connect each wing by wrapping the twisted ends together with duct tape. Don’t worry if the wings overlap, as this will be fixed shortly. Try to avoid getting tape on the inside of the wire loops by wrapping the duct tape around itself horizontally."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the top wings upwards and the bottom wings downwards.",
      "content": "Bend the top wings upwards and the bottom wings downwards. Adjust the wire loops to reach your desired shape. The more stretched out the loops are, the less the wings will overlap. Try bending the wire in different directions to achieve different shapes. For instance, create a triangular point at the end of each wing for a more angular look."

      "title": "Stretch a knee-high stocking over each wing and then secure it with tape.",
      "content": "Stretch a knee-high stocking over each wing and then secure it with tape. Slip a knee-high stocking over each wing. Pull the stockings toward the center of the wings until they’re stretched thin. Twist the ends, and wrap floral wire or duct tape around them to secure them in place. [3] X Research source ttps://lusaorganics.typepad.com/clean/2016/10/diy-fairy-wings-tutorial-.html Choose bright stockings for a vibrant cartoonish look. Opt for neutral colored stockings if you’re planning on painting your wings. Pick a black or dark colored stocking for an edgier fairy look. Can’t find knee-high stockings? Use tights instead—just cut them off at the thighs first."

      "content": "Trim off the excess stocking and readjust the wing shape if needed. Depending on how tightly you pulled the stocking, some extra material may be sticking out from under the tape. Use sharp scissors to cut the excess off as close to the tape as possible, and then readjust the wiring to your desired wing shape."

      "title": "Mist the wings with spray paint if you’d like.",
      "content": "Mist the wings with spray paint if you’d like. A light coating of spray paint can add extra color and whimsy to your fairy wings. Step outside or into a well-ventilated area, and place the wings on a piece of newspaper. Gently coat them with spray paint. Once the wings have dried, flip them over and repeat. [4] X Research source ttps://lusaorganics.typepad.com/clean/2016/10/diy-fairy-wings-tutorial-.html Try spraying each wing a different color for a multicolor effect. Spray the bottom of the wings heavily and use a lighter touch as you move to the top for an ombre look. Use regular spray paint or fabric spray paint for this project."

      "content": "Decorate the wings with glitter and/or rhinestones for more glamour. This step is optional but can add depth and extra flare to your fairy wings. Try drawing designs on the wings using glue and then sprinkling the glue with loose glitter , or stick large rhinestones on the edges of the wings with fabric glue or hot glue. Cover the tips and edges of the wings with glitter to mimic the iridescence of real fairy wings. Attach a pattern of rhinestones to the center of each wing to copy the polka dot pattern of butterfly wings. Let each glued section dry completely before moving on to the next step; otherwise, glitter or gems may run down your wings."

Fold 1 ribbon in half and place it behind the center of the wings, with the looped part sticking out by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Pull the 2 loose ends of the ribbon through the loop, then tug on them to tighten the knot. Repeat this process with the second ribbon. These ribbons will be the straps of your wings, so make sure they’re long enough to tie over your shoulders."

Stay slightly inside the line so that your pen marks won’t be seen on the finished wings. If you’ve traced your wings on a poster board, use scissors to cut them out instead. Ask a parent or guardian for help using a box cutter or craft blade, as they’re very sharp and can be difficult to work with."

Paint one side, wait for it to dry, and then paint the other side. If you like the color of your wings already, feel free to skip this step. Focus darker paint at the bottom of the wings and work up to a lighter color for a gradient effect. Pick a paint color that matches your costume or outfit to tie your fairy look together."

Look up pictures of butterfly wings to mimic nature’s designs, or follow your own intuition to make the wings of your dreams. Paint designs on both sides of your wings for a cohesive look—just make sure one side dries before moving on to the next."

Simply go over your painted designs with glitter glue or sprinkle a bit of loose glitter over a line of craft glue . Iridescent glitter is a great choice if you want to mimic a dragonfly’s sparkle. Try using multiple colors or glitter for a rainbow color scheme. Make sure the glue is 100% dry before moving your wings."

Fake flowers, rhinestones, and charms can be great additions to your wings. All you have to do is follow your imagination. Glue rhinestones or gems onto the wings for extra sparkle. Put paper doilies on the wings’s tips for a snow fairy look. Place fake leaves or vines on the wings’s edges to complete a nature fairy look."

Make sure the veins or swirls connect to the bottom corner of the wing, where it will come out of your back. [10] X Research source This will be your template for shaping the wire, so if you want your wings to be symmetrical, you only need to draw one wing shape. This style of fairy wing is meant to be worn with a corset or any other garment with a tight-fitting bodice."

Leave a long stem about the length of your hand sticking out of the bottom corner of the wing. Cut the excess wire off with wire cutters. [11] X Research source Use a piece of foil tape to hold the outline together, if needed. Opt for heavy duty wire that’s between 50 to 55 pounds (23 to 25 kg); otherwise your wings might get bent out of shape."

Use the same technique as you did for the outline: bend the wire to match your sketch and cut it using wire cutters. Secure the ends of the wires to the outline with more foil tape. [12] X Research source Curve the thinner wire in between the thicker wire to mimic the petal pattern of butterfly wings. Bend the wire into a swirl and attach it to the inner base of a wing for a fantastical cartoon design.

Spray the cellophane liberally with spray adhesive , and then immediately place the wing on top of it. [13] X Research source Pick a color of cellophane that matches your fairy’s look. For instance, a iridescent cellophane will mimic the wings of fairies like Tinkerbell and The Blue Fairy. Wear gloves to keep the cellophane from sticking to you. Weigh down the corners of the cellophane with extra crafting supplies or books to keep it from rolling in on itself."

Press down on the cellophane with your fingers, making sure to smooth it down around the outline and between the inner shapes. Finally, cut the wing out, leaving behind a 1 in (2.5 cm) border.

Press a dry iron (no steam) on top of the towel, and work the iron from one side of the wing to the other. [15] X Research source The cellophane will shrink with the heat and seal around the wire, so don’t be alarmed by a few crinkling sounds. The towel protects the iron from touching the bare wire and cellophane. If the lowest setting on your iron isn’t doing anything, try using the next lowest setting."
