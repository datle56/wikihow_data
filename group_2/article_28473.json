      "title": "Select your salt.",
      "content": "Select your salt. In a salt scrub, the salt is used as an exfoliant that scrubs away dead skin and leaves your skin soft and smooth. There are a number of different salt types you can use, including table salt, sea salt, Himalayan salt, Dead Sea salt, kosher salt, or Epsom salt. Sea salt and Epsom salt are some of the most common salts used in these scrubs. The type of salt you use isn't as important as the grind. For a salt scrub, choose finely ground salt over coarse salt, because fine salt is better at exfoliating. You can also combine different types of salts together in one scrub. You can also substitute white sugar, brown sugar, coffee, oatmeal, or ground nut shells for all or part of the salt called for in the recipe. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a carrier oil.",
      "content": "Choose a carrier oil. The carrier oil is the base that will keep the salt scrub together, but it will also moisturize your skin. You can use specialty oils or oil you have on hand in the pantry. To prevent slips in the shower, choose a thin- or medium-consistency oil that will be washed away easily: [2] X Research source Grape seed and jojoba oils are thin and have very faint aromas Sweet almond oil has a medium consistency and a mild aroma [3] X Expert Source Diana Yerkes Skincare Professional Expert Interview. 16 April 2019.

      "title": "Customize the scrub with fragrances.",
      "content": "Customize the scrub with fragrances. A salt scrub doesn’t need anything other than salt and an oil, but you can add fragrances and essential oils if you want to change the aroma of your scrub. You can pick fragrances that you like, that suit different seasons, or that are holiday-specific. Be sure they are suitable for use on the skin. Citrus oils like lemon, orange, and grapefruit are fresh, energizing, and great for spring- and summer-themed scrubs. Flower oils like ylang-ylang, rose, and geranium are sweet and summery. Peppermint and cinnamon are invigorating oils that are also great for Christmas and winter scrubs. Lavender, vanilla, chamomile, and frankincense can be very calming fragrances.

      "content": "Store leftover salt scrub. When you’ve finished with your salt scrub, put on the airtight lid. Store the scrub in a cool, dry location, such as a bathroom cupboard. Because salt is a preservative, the scrub could last anywhere from one to two years without going rancid. [6] X Research source Sugar is also a preservative, but a sugar-based scrub will only last for a few months."

To make this scrub, combine the salts, oil, and six drops of peppermint oil in a mixing bowl. Stir to combine, and then divide the mixture in half, pouring one half into a second mixing bowl. [10] X Research source Use the red food coloring to color one batch red. Stir to distribute the coloring evenly throughout the mixture. Use a spoon to add a layer of the red scrub to the bottom of a glass jar. Pack the layer down. Spoon a layer of white over top of the red. Continue alternating like this until the jar is full or you run out of salt scrub. Other colorants you can use to dye salt scrubs include FD&C water-based liquid dyes for vibrant colors, or pearlescent mica powders for shimmery and pale colors. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Wet your skin. Draw a bath or run a shower. Hop in for a few minutes and get your skin nice and wet. This will make it easier to spread the salt scrub over your skin. To scrub just your feet or hands, fill a bucket or bowl with water and soak your feet or hands for a few minutes. You can also use a salt scrub on your face, but be very gentle, and avoid your eyes. Fill a sink with some water and use your hands or a face cloth to wet your face."

[13] X Research source Over-exfoliating can lead to dry, red, itchy, and sensitive skin. For oily skin, use a salt scrub two or three times per week. For dry skin, only use a salt scrub once weekly, or as needed to remove dry skin."
