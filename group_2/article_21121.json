      "title": "Arrange the grill pan on your stove.",
      "content": "Arrange the grill pan on your stove. Take a heavy grill pan or skillet and set it on a burner. If you're using a large grill pan that takes up more than 1 burner, place it across 2 burners that are the same size. This will ensure that the grill pan heats evenly. [1] X Research source Cast-iron grill pans are good for stovetop grilling because they hold heat well and give your food classic grill marks. If you don't have a grill pan, you can use a regular pan or skillet, but your food won't have the grill marks."

      "title": "Heat the grill pan on medium-high for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Heat the grill pan on medium-high for 5 minutes. Turn the burners under the grill pan on to medium-high heat. Leave the pan to heat for at least 5 minutes before you put food on it. Preheating the pan ensures that the entire surface of the pan is hot. [2] X Research source If you don't heat the pan long enough, the food might overcook in some spots."

      "title": "Wipe the grill with oil to prevent food from sticking.",
      "content": "Wipe the grill with oil to prevent food from sticking. Bunch up a paper towel into a loose ball and grab it with a pair of tongs. Dip the paper towel into a little canola or vegetable oil. Then rub the paper towel across the surface of the preheated grill pan. [3] X Research source Holding the paper towel with the tongs will prevent your fingers from getting burned as you grease the pan."

    {
      "title": "Dry the food you want to grill and brush it with a little oil.",
      "content": "Dry the food you want to grill and brush it with a little oil. To create the best sear on the grill, pat the food dry and then brush it with a little olive oil. For most savory foods, sprinkle salt and pepper onto it according to your taste. [4] X Research source If you marinated the food, brush away herbs or garlic that could burn in the grill pan."

    {
      "title": "Place the food into the pan and cook it until it's as done as you like.",
      "content": "Place the food into the pan and cook it until it's as done as you like. Lay the food you want to cook into the preheated pan and grill it until it's about half done. Then use tongs to turn the food over and finish grilling it until it's as cooked as you want. Remember to follow food safety recommendations when cooking meat to a food-safe temperature. [5] X Research source If you're placing several things in the grill pan, such as sausages, leave 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between them. If you'd like to melt cheese on hamburgers, lay the cheese on the patties and place an overturned bowl over the food. This will act like a lid that helps the cheese melt."

      "title": "Clean the grill pan",
      "content": "Clean the grill pan once you're finished cooking. Once the pan has cooled enough to handle, take a grill brush and scrub the pan under hot water. Keep scrubbing until you're removed any burned bits or oily areas. Rinse the pan and dry it completely with a clean kitchen towel. If you haven't built up a seasoning on the pan, rub the oiled paper towel that you used earlier over the grill pan. [6] X Research source If you don't have a scrubbing brush, bunch up a piece of aluminum foil and use it to scrub the pan."

      "content": "Grill chicken breasts for 10 to 12 minutes. Place 2 or 3 whole chicken breasts onto the preheated grill pan or skillet and leave them to cook for 5 or 6 minutes without moving or turning them. Then use tongs to flip the breasts over and grill them for another 5 to 6 minutes. Once they reach 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer, set them on a cutting board to rest for a few minutes before you serve them. [7] X Research source Marinate the chicken according to what cuisine you're cooking. For example, marinate the chicken in a spicy chipotle or Italian marinade."

      "content": "Cook hamburgers on the grill pan for 8 to 10 minutes. Preheat the grill pan and arrange your hamburger patties in the pan. Leave the burgers to cook for about 4 minutes without moving them. Then use a spatula to flip them over and grill them for another 4 to 6 minutes. [8] X Research source If you're making cheeseburgers, lay a slice of cheese over each patty about 1 minute before they're done cooking. Place an overturned bowl over the patties to help the cheese melt."

      "content": "Cook steak on the grill pan until it's as done as you like. Lay your choice of steak onto a preheated grill pan and leave for 3 to 4 minutes. It should sear and become flavorful on 1 side. Then use tongs to carefully flip the steak over and cook it for 3 more minutes if you want the steak to be medium-rare. Then transfer the steak to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before you serve it. [9] X Research source For medium or well-done steak, add 2 to 3 minutes of cooking time for each side of the steak."

      "title": "Toss vegetables into the grill pan and cook them until they soften.",
      "content": "Toss vegetables into the grill pan and cook them until they soften. You can grill almost any vegetable on the stove top as long as they're lightly oiled so they won't stick to the grill pan. Cut the vegetables into even pieces or spear them onto a skewer. Cook the vegetables in the preheated grill pan until they soften and char a little. The amount of time this takes will depend on the type of vegetable and how ripe it is. [10] X Research source For example, to grill bell pepper halves, cook them for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. To grill asparagus, cook them for 5 to 10 minutes and mix them occasionally so they cook evenly."

      "content": "Grill fruit for an intense caramelized flavor. Since fruit is naturally high in sugar, it becomes golden and sticky sweet once you throw it on the griddle. Leave your choice of fruit in large pieces and heat them for 3 to 5 minutes or until they soften and turn golden. Try grilling: Pineapple spears Banana halves Pear or peach halves"
