      "content": "Fill the iron with fresh tap water. In almost all cases, fresh water from your tap is fine for ironing. Fill the iron up before getting started. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Some older advice said to use distilled water, but this isn’t necessary and might even damage the iron. The one exception is if the tap water in your area is particularly hard, meaning it has a lot of dissolved minerals in it. In this case, mix the tap water with half distilled water.

      "title": "Select a high heat setting for cotton shirts.",
      "content": "Select a high heat setting for cotton shirts. Most dress shirts are made with cotton, so a high heat setting is best. This will give you a nice, crisp finish. Always check the care tag to confirm the material that the shirt is made from. The care tag may also give the ideal temperature setting for the iron. Polyester, wool, and silk shirts can’t handle high heats, so make sure you set the heat lower if you have shirts made from these materials. Don't go any higher than the low or medium setting on your iron."

      "content": "Set the iron to its highest steam setting. You’ll need plenty of steam for a good finish, so don’t be shy. Crank up the steam setting to high. This will smooth out your dress shirts nicely. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source"

      "title": "Spritz all your shirts with a spray bottle before ironing.",
      "content": "Spritz all your shirts with a spray bottle before ironing. Damp shirts tend to smooth out better, and a little extra moisture helps really get rid of those wrinkles. Fill a spray bottle with clean tap water and spritz down all the spots you’re ironing first. This should give you a smoother finish. [4] X Research source You can skip this step if your clothes are still damp from washing."

      "content": "Pop the shirt collar and flatten it onto the ironing board. Take the shirt and flip the collar up. Press the back of the shirt down onto the ironing board in any spot so the front of the collar faces up. Flatten the collar out so it’s nice and even. [5] X Research source Some dress shirts have buttons holding the collar down, so make sure you undo these first. Remember to unbutton the shirt too."

      "content": "Slide the iron across the collar. Press the iron down against one side of the collar. Then apply gentle pressure and slide the iron smoothly from one side to the other to work out any wrinkles. [6] X Research source You can make a few more passes if the collar still looks wrinkled, but 1 or 2 is usually enough. Some say that you’ll get a better finish if you iron the front or back of the collar first. [7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source There’s disagreement, so you can experiment to see if you notice a difference."

Flatten out the collar again, then pass over it with the iron. This way, both sides of your collar are crisp and smooth. If you’re having trouble getting any of the wrinkles out, try spritzing the collar with the spray bottle a bit more."

Continue working in this pattern until the side of the shirt is smooth. [9] X Research source Be careful not to hit any of the buttons with the iron or you could rip them off. If the space in between the buttons is wrinkly, then carefully press the thin point of the iron into these spots."

When you’re done on the first side, flatten out the other side of the shirt onto the ironing board and tuck the neck over the pointed part of the board. Smooth out this side with the iron using the same motion as you used on the first side. On most dress shirts, the pocket is on the side without the buttons.
