      "content": "There‚Äôs no hammer and sickle emoji, but there is a Unicode character. The hammer and sickle symbol (‚ò≠) was approved in 1993 as part of Unicode 1.1 (for reference, Unicode assigns a specific code number to symbols and characters so they appear the same across different digital platforms and languages). [1] X Research source So while there is no colorful emoji, there is still a black-and-white symbol you can use online: On Windows, hold Alt and press 262D On Mac or mobile, copy and paste the symbol: ‚ò≠ Unicode number: U+262D [2] X Research source HTML code: ‚ò≠ CSS code: \\262D"

      "content": "Some use ‚öíÔ∏è (hammer and pick) or üõ†Ô∏è (hammer and wrench) instead. Both of these emojis symbolize industrial work or labor (like the hammer and sickle) and resemble the crossed design of the ‚ò≠ symbol. Since there‚Äôs no sickle, though, the specific connection to Communism or the Soviet Union isn‚Äôt as strong. The ‚öíÔ∏è or üõ†Ô∏è emojis are sometimes paired with üö© (red flag) to resemble the Soviet Union flag, which was red with a golden hammer and sickle on it."

      "content": "The ‚ò≠ symbol can signal support for Communism or the working class. While the ‚ò≠ symbol originally had a very specific meaning and history (more on that later), today, it‚Äôs more of a broad symbol representing general Communist ideals like a classless society, even distribution of wealth and property, or the well-being and power of the working class. For example, if someone included ‚ò≠ in their username on social media, it would indicate they have a pro-Communist or pro-worker point of view, even if they‚Äôre not technically Communist themselves. You might also see the ‚ò≠ symbol in posts about the struggle of working, the economy, or different ideologies: ‚ÄúWhoever thought a 40-hour work week was fine was insane! ‚ò≠‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing some reading and that Karl Marx guy might‚Äôve been onto something ‚ò≠ üëÄ‚Äù"

      "content": "Or, the ‚ò≠ symbol could also mean someone‚Äôs just fed up with capitalism. In the USA especially, young people‚Äôs image of capitalism (the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù of Communism) has deteriorated so much that capitalism and socialism are now equally popular among Millennials and Gen Z. This isn‚Äôt totally surprising as stagnant wages and wealth inequality have become big political issues for young people. Unlike past generations, young people seem more comfortable with the government checking the power of big business (which leans away from capitalism and toward socialism or Communism). [3] X Research source So, someone might include a ‚ò≠ symbol in their username or posts to show they think the economy is unfair to the working class or to advocate for more equitable economic policies. This doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre pro-Communism exactly. Instead, it‚Äôs a rejection of current capitalist policies that are perceived as ‚Äúoppressive‚Äù or just not working. It‚Äôs a semi-ironic usage, kind of how you might jokingly greet a coworker as ‚Äúcomrade‚Äù to show that neither of you wants to be at work, but you‚Äôre going to get through it together."

      "content": "The ‚ò≠ symbol was included with many other political and religious symbols. It belongs to the ‚ÄúMiscellaneous Characters‚Äù section of Unicode under the ‚ÄúReligious and political symbols‚Äù subblock. [4] X Research source This section contains other recognizable characters that represent different ideologies and beliefs (some of which are now official emojis) like ‚òÆÔ∏è (peace sign), ‚òØÔ∏è (yin-yang symbol), ‚ò´ (Farsi symbol), ‚ò¨ (Adi Shakti), ‚ò® (Cross of Lorraine), and more. [5] X Research source The ‚ò≠ symbol was likely included in an effort to represent a broad variety of beliefs and affiliations and to standardize a symbol that was prominent in global politics at the time. The ‚ò≠ Unicode character was introduced just 2 years after the fall of the Soviet Union (the most powerful Communist nation at the time) in 1991. Even though Communism was mostly in decline at this time, it was still very much in the public zeitgeist."

      "content": "There is some controversy over the hammer and sickle‚Äôs inclusion. Some believe that the hammer and sickle represents the atrocities committed by Joseph Stalin when he ruled the Soviet Union, making it immoral to include in Unicode (like how the swastika is now a taboo symbol after it became associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis). However, others argue that since multiple countries remain Communist and the symbol‚Äôs original meaning was meant to be hopeful, it‚Äôs OK to keep the Unicode character."

      "content": "The crossed hammer and sickle represents the union of industrial and agricultural workers. The hammer represents the working class that‚Äôs engaged in industrial production, while the sickle (a curved blade used as an agricultural tool) represents farmers and agrarians who tend the land. The symbol means that when unified, the working class can seize power from the bourgeoisie (the smaller class that owns the most wealth and means of production). [6] X Research source"

After the Russian Revolution and the country‚Äôs withdrawal from World War I in 1917, the new Soviet Union drafted its constitution and adopted a new flag. Various other designs were considered, and the original hammer and sickle emblem featured a sword as well (but this was vetoed by Vladimir Lenin in order to maintain a peaceful image after the war). [7] X Research source The background of the flag is red, while the hammer and sickle are a golden yellow. The flag also featured a red star above the point of the sickle, symbolizing the dream of spreading Communism and freeing workers all over the world."

      "content": "Today, it‚Äôs a global symbol of Communism and the USSR‚Äôs legacy. The Soviet Union fell in 1991, but not before inspiring (and in many cases, forcing) other countries to adopt Communism. For example, the symbol is included on the flags of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Communist Party of Vietnam, both of which are Communist countries (it doesn‚Äôt appear on either country‚Äôs national flag, but the red and yellow color scheme of both is reminiscent of the Soviet Union‚Äôs flag). [8] X Research source In Europe, the symbol appears all over buildings and monuments in Russia and former Soviet republics. Many former Soviet states associate it with the totalitarianism and crimes against humanity of the Soviet Union and even encouraged the European Union to ban the symbol in 2010."

      "title": "Communism",
      "content": "Communism Communism is a political and economic system that idealizes a classless society where the means of production (mines, factories, farms, etc.) are controlled and owned by the public. The system is not profit-based, wealth is distributed among citizens equally or according to need, and there is no private or government property. [9] X Research source Most Communist principles come from Karl Marx‚Äôs The Communist Manifesto in 1848, which is also where socialism and Marxism comes from. Communism is seen as a specific or elevated form of socialism, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. There‚Äôs nothing about Communism that specifically advocates for totalitarianism, but the two are often associated due to the regimes of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin."

      "title": "Socialism",
      "content": "Socialism In the socialist view, freedom and equality are only available to those who own the means of production. So, socialism advocates for communal property and production, typically controlled by the state or government, to create a more equal society. Since everyone owns the means of production, everyone is free. [10] X Research source Communism is seen as the idealized or ultimate form of socialism, but there are less extreme forms of socialism too. For example, democratic socialism advocates for the democratic control of both the economy and society to meet the needs of all people instead of a rich few. The government doesn‚Äôt have to own everything, but workers and consumers should have power in industries and companies that affect them."

      "title": "Capitalism",
      "content": "Capitalism In capitalism, private individuals or companies own and control property and production according to their own interests, and supply-and-demand sets the prices in free markets to serve the best interest of society. Unlike socialist systems, which seek to split wealth equally, capitalism is motivated by making a profit: assets are owned, labor is purchased, and capital gains accrue to private owners. [11] X Research source Whereas socialism is about the collective good, capitalism emphasizes that what‚Äôs good for the individual is good for all."
