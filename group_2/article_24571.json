When they spot another Jeep in the wild, they grab a rubber duck and put it somewhere on the Jeep where the owner will see it. Oftentimes there’s a note attached explaining the purpose of the squeaky, spontaneous gesture. The unsuspecting Jeep driver discovers the duck, their day is brightened, and they might pass it along to another Jeep to keep the cycle going! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Create custom notes for your ducks. While discovering a rubber duck on your car with no explanation attached might be kind of fun (or maybe a bit ominous?), it’s much more fun for people if they know why they’re getting a rubber duck in the first place. Plus, by leaving a note that explains the game, you empower the stranger to pass on the duck and keep the ball rolling. Write directly on the duck itself, or attach a tag or slip of paper using a rubber band or elastic. [5] X Research source At a minimum, include something along the lines of “Duck duck Jeep” or “Your Jeep has been ducked.” Many veteran Jeep duckers also include a note prompting people to upload a picture of their duck to social media using the hashtags #duckingjeeps and #duckduckjeep."
