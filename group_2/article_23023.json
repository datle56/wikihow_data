      "content": "Drink 5 to 7 bottles of water each day. On average, if you're a man, aim to drink around 125 oz (3.7 L) of water every day, or 91 oz (2.7) per day if you're a woman, according to The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. A standard single-use plastic water bottle holds 16.9 oz (0.49 L) of water, so this means 7 bottles of water each day for men, and 5 bottles of water each day for women. This is equivalent to: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source About 11 to 15 8-oz (0.24 L) water bottles or glasses of water About 7 to 10 12-oz (0.35 L) water bottles About 5 to 8 16-oz (0.47 L) water bottles About 3 to 4 32-oz (0.95 L) water bottles About 2 to 3 40-oz (1.2 L) water bottles To reduce the amount of single-use plastic you use, purchase a reusable water bottle made from materials like BPA-free plastic, glass, stainless steel, or aluminum."

      "content": "Multiply your weight in pounds by ⅔ to calculate your water intake goal in ounces. Weigh yourself in pounds, then multiply that number by ⅔ (which is equal to 0.67). The resulting number is how many ounces to drink each day. In general, the more you weigh, the more water you’ll need to consume daily. [2] X Research source For example, if you weigh 130 pounds, aim to drink around 87 oz (2.6 L) of water each day. This is equal to about 5.5 16-oz (0.47 L) water bottles each day."

      "content": "Consume 30 to 40 oz (0.88 to 1.2 L) of water for every kilogram of body weight. If you measure your weight in kilograms, multiply that number by 30 and 40 to calculate the range of water you need to drink each day in milliliters. For example, if you weigh 50 kg, drink anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 mL (1.5-2 L or 50.7-67.6 oz.) of water each day. That would be equal to around 3 to 4 16-oz (0.47 L) bottles of water each day. Where you fall within this range depends on factors like your activity level, other health conditions, and environment."

Help yourself by carrying a water bottle around with you as a friendly reminder to stay hydrated and drink throughout the day.

When you’re not getting enough water, your urine will be a bright or dark yellow. Pale yellow or clear urine is a sign that you’re properly hydrated.

Add apples, lemons, limes, strawberries, cucumbers, or mangos to infuse flavor into your standard water. Another option is to try naturally-flavored sparkling waters to add a fun texture and flavor to your drink.

Avoid caffeinated drinks, like soda and coffee, and alcohol. These are diuretics that increase urination, meaning that you’ll end up needing to drink more water to make up for the loss."
