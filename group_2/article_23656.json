      "title": "Show your emotions when appropriate.",
      "content": "Show your emotions when appropriate. Have you ever heard someone’s voice quiver when they are experiencing strong emotions during a speech? This can be an effective technique in some situations, such as when you are giving a speech or acting in a play. Allow the timber, or emotional quality of your voice, to show when you are expressing strong feelings. For example, if you are saying something that makes you feel sad, then you might allow your voice to tremble if it comes naturally. However, do not try to force it."

Record each attempt and compare them. Many people are uncomfortable hearing themselves on tape. This sounds different that the voice that resonates in your head, but is closer to the voice other people hear."

You might even allow your voice to register the emotion of sadness more dramatically by speaking with a bit of a trembling voice. Consider the appropriate emotion for each of your character’s lines to determine how your voice should sound when you speak them."

You know you need unique New York.” Give your tongue a workout by repeating, “Red leather, yellow leather” over and over."
