The Leviathan is known for lying and manipulating the truth in order to break covenants with others and with God. There are several references to the Leviathan spirit in the Bible: In Isaiah 27:1, “In that day, the Lord with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and Leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.” In Job 3:8, “Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.” In Job 41:1, \"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or press down his tongue with a cord?” In Psalms 74:14, “You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.” In Psalms 104:26, “There the ships go, and Leviathan, whom you formed to play there.”"
