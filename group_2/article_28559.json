      "content": "Fold a square sheet of paper in half diagonally, twice. Take one corner of the sturdy square paper , and fold it to meet the opposite corner to make a triangle. Then, fold the triangle in half to make a smaller triangle. [1] X Research source If you’re using a rectangular piece of paper, position it vertically and fold the top left corner down to meet the right edge of the paper, then cut off the excess paper peeking out from the bottom to make a square sheet of paper ."

      "title": "Cut three slits in the triangle.",
      "content": "Cut three slits in the triangle. Position the scissors along the large fold, parallel to the longest edge of the triangle. Cut almost all the way to the other edge, leaving about 1 in (2.5 cm) of space. Then, move the scissors toward the point of the triangle, and make a parallel cut that also stops about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the other edge. Repeat this cut once more, to make a final, smaller cut. Then unfold the paper completely. [2] X Research source For a more intricate snowflake, make 1-2 more evenly spaced cuts."

      "content": "Roll and tape the first 2 innermost corners together to form a tube. Position your unfolded square so that it resembles a diamond. Then, take the middle corners nearest the center fold, and overlap them. Tape these two pieces together. [3] X Research source Alternatively, secure the corners together with glue for a cleaner look. Just be sure to hold them together with your fingers until the glue dries."

      "content": "Flip the paper, and join the next 2 corners. Turn the paper over so that the tube you just made faces the table. Take the next two paper strips and pull them together and tape together as before, securing the strips on the opposite side of the snowflake as the first pair. Your 3D snowflake is starting to take shape! [4] X Research source"

Repeat with each pair of strips until they’ve all been joined, turning the paper over between each pair. You now have the first point of your snowflake. Set it aside for later. [5] X Research source"

Then do the same for the remaining 3 pieces. Now you have 2 large pieces consisting of 3 points or \"arms\" each. [7] X Research source For smaller snowflakes, it may be easier to use double-sided tape or white glue in place of staples."

Now all 6 points of your snowflake are joined, but we’re not done just yet. Staple the outer sections where the arms touch to make the snowflake sturdier. Ta-dah! Your 3D paper snowflake is complete.

Starting at the long, straight edge of the paper, draw an arc that follows the rounded edge of the petal, and stops about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) away from the long edge. Make a similar line beneath it, so that both lines resemble an incomplete rainbow. Then, use scissors to cut along both lines. [11] X Research source"

To fold a piece of paper into thirds , first bend it so that the opposite edges touch, and press a finger into the bend to make a partial fold, or “crimp.” Then unfold the paper and fold the opposite edges toward the center. For this snowflake, make the edges overlap slightly, then use a glue stick to glue 1 edge onto the other to make a tall rectangle. [15] X Research source"

Starting from the bottom of one long edge, make large, triangular cuts out of 3 of the rectangle’s sides, sort of like you would when making a regular paper snowflake. Improvise and get creative, but make your cuts relatively simple, and avoid cutting into the large fold at the bottom of the rectangle. [17] X Research source If you’re unsure of how to cut, trace a christmas tree design into the rectangle and use that as a template for your paper snowflake pattern. This piece of paper will serve as the first part of your snowflake, and you’ll use it as a template for the rest of the pieces."
