For example, your school uniform - wear a jacket or something that makes you stand out or even something like a badge to represent the music you listen to.

      "content": "Be yourself. Rely on the talents and attributes that you have naturally. If you're a funny person, use that to your advantage. If you're a big sports fan and you know that your crush is as well, all the better. Share those common interests and use them to your advantage. [3] X Research source Don't trick your crush into thinking you're something else when you're not. If you do, it will all change and they will see your true colors in time and may regret being with you."

You need to know this person not only well enough so that they know you exist but so that you're both comfortable in each other's presence and can talk without feeling shy or embarrassed. Don't rush this part of things––it's better to take your time to cultivate the friendship than to rush and find that your crush isn't all you had hoped. [4] X Research source Carry conversations with your crush every now and then. Build these up to daily chats, hellos and acknowledgments as much as possible. You can have chats in person or even just on Facebook or other social media sites. Although your crush might like you too, don't make it look like you are easygoing by replying immediately on online chats––play a little hard to get! If your crush doesn't reply straight away then they might be talking to someone else who is currently more important to them; don't push it."

They may even end up being the source of letting your crush know about your interest but at the very least, let them be supportive and help you to find ways to spend more time with your crush. If you have been talking to your crush on Facebook/Twitter/in person, just make sure that you don't tell your friends personal things that your crush talks to you about as they might not trust you and won't tell you stuff you want to know if this is found out. Your crush may tell you things they’re too embarrassed or shy to say to anyone else, so guard that secrecy well."

      "content": "Check that your crush isn't already dating or has the hots for someone else. Things might get a bit messy between you and the other person if this is the case or you may just embarrass yourself big time. Equally, check that your crush hasn't just had a break up as they might just want you to feel good by saying anything or might be stringing you along as a form of rebound revenge. Do not tell them you like someone else romantically. This could push them away, and if you tell them your feelings they might think of you as unfaithful having talked about someone else not long before."
