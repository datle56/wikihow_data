      "content": "Wear an outfit that makes you feel sexy. This could be a form-fitting dress, leggings and a sports bra, lingerie, high heels, or anything else that makes you feel sexy and confident. Just make sure it emphasizes your best features and lets you move around comfortably. [1] X Research source If you decide to combine your lap dance with a strip tease, find something you can get in and out of easily, such as a babydoll dress or nightie. When it comes to buying well-fitting lingerie, make sure you choose the right bra that fits well. A black lace lingerie set with a garter belt and stockings looks super flattering, and can be a great way to cover up areas you feel self-conscious about! [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a sexy playlist that riles you up. Choose 1 to 3 songs that are sexy enough to set the mood, but upbeat enough for you to dance to. [3] X Research source A typical lap dance lasts between 6 to 8 minutes, but if you’re doing it right, your partner will probably want to cut it short! Here are some some sexy songs that are perfect for a lap dance: “Pour It Up” by Rihanna “Cherry Pie” by Warrant “Not Enough Time” by INXS “Say it Right” by Nelly Furtado “So Alive” by Love and Rockets “All That Matters” by Justin Bieber “2 On” by Tinashe and ScHoolboy Q “Motivation” by Kelly Rowland and Lil Wayne “Sexyback” by Justin Timberlake and Timbaland “Cream” by Prince and The New Power Generation “One of the Girls” by The Weeknd, JENNIE, and Lily-Rose Depp"

      "content": "Dim the lights to set the tone. Lap dances are sexier if you're not performing under harsh light. [4] X Research source Turn down the lights in your home, throw a scarf or cloth over your brighter lamps, and light some candles for a soft, warm glow. The lights should be bright enough so your partner can see you working your body, but not so bright that they can see every little freckle on your face. If possible, install dimmer switches on your regular lights so you can change the ambience of the room with just a quick adjustment. Dimmer light is flattering, sexy, and really sets the tone!"

      "title": "Sit your partner in a sturdy and comfortable chair.",
      "content": "Sit your partner in a sturdy and comfortable chair. Pick a chair with thick, sturdy legs and a high and reliable back. Make sure the chair can hold the weight of both you and your partner, and is comfortable enough so your partner won’t have to shift around while you dance. Choose a chair without armrests, since the arms can get in the way of your dance. Tell your partner to sit in a comfortable position, with their legs slightly spread open."

      "content": "Start the music and strut into the room. Enter the room like a professional who's done a lap dance a million times and knows they're great at it. Walk with one foot in front of the other, with your back straight and your shoulders high. Start moving your hips up and down, and slowly gliding your hands along your body to give your partner a taste of what's to come. Remember, you can take your time and slowly ease into your performance—think of song one as a warm up! To be extra seductive, remove an article of clothing before you get closer to your partner. Giving a lap dance may feel extremely nerve-wracking if it’s your first time. Take a few deep breaths before starting, and remind yourself how much your partner wants you. If you’re still feeling nervous, practice performing your lap dance in front of a mirror first to see what makes you look and feel good. Try dancing with different songs and outfits, and watch lap dance videos online for inspiration."
