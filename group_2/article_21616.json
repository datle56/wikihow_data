      "title": "Hand fans gained popularity in Europe in the 16th century.",
      "content": "Hand fans gained popularity in Europe in the 16th century. Around the 1500s, hand fans became a staple among women in royal courts across Europe. Fans weren’t just a fashion statement or used to stay cool—they were seen as feminine and flirtatious tools that allowed women to express themselves and communicate. For instance, women used their fans to draw an admirer’s attention, encourage their advances, or playfully tease them. [12] X Research source While hand fans were only available to the nobility, they communicated status within these upper social circles. How well a woman could wave and brandish her fan, as well as how stylish her fan was, signaled her class and elegance. The hand fan started to fall out of popularity in the early 1800s. Fans became easier to produce, allowing middle-class women to take up the trend. Since the fans were no longer a sign of privilege, noble women ditched them."

However, the first written record of the language was published in 1827 by the Parisian fan maker Duvelleroy. While fans were falling out of favor with the upper class at this time, the publication re-popularized the fans among the nobility. [13] X Research source In fact, Duvelleroy became the official fan maker for Queen Victoria in England. [14] X Research source It’s unclear if the language of the fan was actually a real language . Many scholars believe Duvelleroy made up the language for their publication, which was a way for them to make fans exciting again and increase their sales (and it worked!)."
