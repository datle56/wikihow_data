    {
      "title": "Select a base layout.",
      "content": "Select a base layout. Search the Internet for base ideas and designs that you may use. Pick one and try to use it to see how well it works out. Some good base design choices include well balanced resource and defense buildings to defend well against attacks. Loot is also kept safe as well as the town hall. Go to websites such as the Clash of Clans wiki, forums, or other websites, and find ideas from there."

    {
      "title": "Use compartments.",
      "content": "Use compartments. Surround a building with upgraded walls. Add another building after those walls and surround that building with walls as well. Adding multiple buildings and surrounding them all at once in a large compartment is also a good idea. Place any extra walls you have around walls against the most important defenses, resources, etc. This will ensure the best defense so that you do not lose all your loot when you get attacked. At some town hall levels, you will not be able to fit some buildings because you do not have enough walls. Remove any extra walls in between compartments and just merging the buildings together into one large compartment. Otherwise, only place your most important buildings inside compartments, and be sure to protect your town hall as well if you are not farming."

      "title": "Rearrange your base into a diamond layout.",
      "content": "Rearrange your base into a diamond layout. Add compartments, and place your resources and town hall in the middle, surrounding them with walls. Add defenses all around the resources and town hall, adding walls to protect those as well. Balance out your collectors and mines as well as other buildings until it matches up to look like a diamond. Builder huts can be placed at the corners of the entire grass field so that enemies will take more time to attack them and lose. If you have unlocked Dark Elixir, you might want to think of dropping trophies and placing your Dark Elixir in the middle instead, since starting at town hall 7, Dark Elixir is scarce, and people will always try to steal it. Place traps such as giant bombs and flying troop traps around the dark elixir, but traps can also be used in sneaky places, such as in a small space where you didn't add a wall, or all around an important building."

    {
      "title": "Use the Army Camp base design.",
      "content": "Use the Army Camp base design. Rearrange your base into a diamond shape, but leave out all the army camps you have. Place one army camp at each of the four corners of the base. Surround them with walls, but be sure that there is at least a whole line of space between the building and the walls when you surround the front of the camp. When troops attack your base and they should go for the army camp as the last building to win the attack, the extra space causes the troop to be farther out of range, with causes the troop to go off into another building, moving farther and farther away so that it is harder to win. With ground troops, this base can be effective."

    {
      "title": "Have a star shaped base.",
      "content": "Have a star shaped base. This type of base sort of looks like square compartments as well as other shaped compartments to look like a star that has several points. Start with a triangle or square compartment and work your way using other shaped compartments all around that one compartment. Place your town hall or resources right in the middle for best protection."

    {
      "title": "Choose a base to design of your own if none of these work for you.",
      "content": "Choose a base to design of your own if none of these work for you. You can always make your own base if none of these designs work out for your base. Include strong defenses and walls, as well as some traps to prevent enemies from coming through. Use any of the tricks that were shown above, such as the double layered wall trick, or the spaced walls. Make sure your base is as effective enough to defend against a decent amount of attacks."

      "title": "Raid for gold and elixir frequently.",
      "content": "Raid for gold and elixir frequently. Buildings in your base may start to cost more than 500,000 to 1 million gold or elixir, starting at town hall 6. Upgrade your resource buildings as soon as possible in order to gain more loot at a time - your defense buildings should be next. Save as much gold and elixir as you can. Use up all your resources before you log off so no one will steal it. Train troops in your army camps that do not require a lot of elixir for a costly combination. Use the Barch Strategy. Train up some archers and barbarians, enough to take out a small high level village. It is also inexpensive and also gets trained quickly. Spells can be taken into battle as well, but they may be a bit too expensive. Find a base with plenty of resources and spread your archers around the closest resource buildings. Attack a village with very nearby resource buildings and vaults that are full. If it has at least 90,000 loot, it is a worthy base to attack. Make sure you can get to the loot easily. Send in your barbarians for back up and wait until your troops collect as much of the loot as possible. It doesn't matter if you win or not - as long as you get all the resources, you're okay."

      "title": "Upgrade your mines and collectors first.",
      "content": "Upgrade your mines and collectors first. If you upgrade your buildings as soon as possible, you will be able to collect more loot each time you go on. Do not upgrade your vaults yet - you will be holding too much loot. Level up your vaults once your most expensive buildings have been finished upgrading. Use any extra loot on upgrading walls or resetting traps/defenses, until there is no more loot you can spend."

    {
      "title": "Upgrade your small defenses next.",
      "content": "Upgrade your small defenses next. Level up most of your archer towers and cannons first since they are pretty low damage defenses, and can be easy to upgrade. Upgrade all your archer towers at once, then your cannons so that your archer towers can do more damage to ground and flying troops. Upgrade your bombs and other traps since they do not cost much."

    {
      "title": "Start on your bigger defenses.",
      "content": "Start on your bigger defenses. Raid a lot and do Clan wars in your Clan in order to get a large amount of loot for these buildings. X-bows, Inferno towers, and other large defenses cost a huge amount of resources to upgrade. Collect your treasury bonus only when necessary in order to save it as well as the Clan war bonus. Consider buying a shield. If you have extra loot, but are so close to having enough to upgrade a large building, do not spend it. If you leave it, you will get attacked, and your loot may get stolen. Buy at least a village guard in order to give you just enough time to get the small amount of loot you need to finish upgrading a large building. Use any extra time from the shield or village guard to collect more loot."

      "title": "Work on your offensive buildings.",
      "content": "Work on your offensive buildings. Upgrade your Clan Castle first. The Clan castle costs more than a million gold starting at town hall 5. Use village guards to protect your loot and attack during these two hours so that you can gain more gold. Upgrade your Army Camps as well in order to hold more troops to attack. Village guards allow you to attack freely as much as you want. Buy a village guard for 10 gems each day whenever you are about to attack nonstop gaining resources quickly."

      "content": "Finish up any extra buildings that need upgrading. Upgrade your laboratory, spell factory, etc. Level up all your buildings to the max level until you have the strongest base you can have. Upgrade your town hall after and start to work on upgrading your defenses to become even more stronger."
