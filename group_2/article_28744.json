      "content": "Find a rectangular cardboard box that you or a child can sit inside. Before you select a box to use, make sure the person you’re making the car for can fit inside it. If you’re making a car for a toddler or a small child, most large moving boxes will be sufficient. [1] X Research source You can find large cardboard boxes for purchase at most home improvement stores. Try to hold onto any leftover cardboard boxes that you come across."

Stop cutting when you reach the front third of the box. Then, make the same cut on the other side of the box. [5] X Research source By the end of this step, the back two-thirds the top should be separated from the sides of the box. Have an adult help you make the cuts with a box cutter."

Use acrylic paints and a paint brush or spray paint . Cover the box’s entire surface in an even coat of paint. Allow the coat of paint to dry, and add additional paint for a deeper color. [8] X Research source Place the cardboard box on spread-out newspapers or a large sheet of cardboard so you don’t accidentally get paint on the floor.

You can use paint, cardboard pieces, and other craft items to create the look you want. [12] X Research source To make headlights, for example, you can cut small circles out of another piece of cardboard, paint them yellow, and then glue them onto the front of the car. Or you can use the bottom part of a paper cup. You can use small, rectangular cardboard strips covered in duct tape or ice pop sticks spray-painted silver to make a grill. Using different colored markers to add lights and other details is another option."
