The game you decide to hunt will influence the methods you employ while hunting, the kind of weapon or trap with which you hunt, and where will be best for you to hunt. Some ideas on what to hunt: Small animals, like rabbit, hare, squirrel, pheasant, crow, waterfowl, etc. Big animals, like deer, sheep, moose, antelope, bear, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, etc."

You won't need an elephant gun to hunt a pheasant, but there are likely a few different guns paired with birdshot that can be used for pheasant hunting.

Ask among your family members or inquire with workers at your local sporting goods store for someone who could answer some questions you have about hunting. You might say: \"I don't have a lot of hunting experience, but I really like nature, and I could benefit from the nutrients in venison. Could you tell me a little bit more about deer hunting?\""

      "content": "Investigate state and local restrictions and regulations. Depending on where you live, how rural the country is, and the local culture, there can be significant differences in the legal definitions of various kinds of game and the acceptable weapons you can use to hunt. Most locations have a Department of Natural Resources, Fish and Wildlife Department or similar organization that regulates hunting in the area. A quick online search should help you find the relevant agency charged with wildlife management."

      "title": "Look into hunting tactics for your game.",
      "content": "Look into hunting tactics for your game. The right hunting tactic will give you even more enjoyment from the sport by offering you the most reasonable chance for success on your hunt. Some common hunting tactics include: Deer hunting may be done from ground blinds, tree stands, stalking, or by driving prey from brush or cover with a group. Some areas even allow pursuing deer with hounds. Upland birds are often hunted with dogs like pointers or setters, which can actually follow the scent of these game birds. Then, these hunting dogs will point out the prey for the hunter to flush and shoot. [2] X Research source Migratory birds are often hunted from blinds, so a successful bird hunter will need to find a feeding area or watering area to hunt. Harvested grain fields, waterways, or other places may offer successful hunts for these birds. Small game, like rabbits and squirrels, may be hunted using dogs. Beagles are a favorite for rabbits, and some breeds are easy to train for treeing squirrels (or raccoon or opossums)."

Many states and areas require you to take a mandatory course in hunter's safety before you can be issued a hunting license, especially when hunting with a gun. Be sure you comply with all regulations, or else you could be fined or suffer other legal consequences, like incarceration. [3] X Research source"

While you are hunting, an accident might occur that may require medical attention, or you might have to spend the night in the elements waiting for help to arrive. Don't be caught unprepared.

Hunting on public land is legal, so long as it is not in violation of state, federal or regional restriction, you have the proper licenses, and you are following state, federal or other applicable hunting regulations."

      "content": "Decide the ammunition appropriate for your animal. You will need enough knock down power for a quick and clean kill, but not so much as to do extensive damage to the animal's meat. Here are some examples: Quail, dove, and other small birds can be killed with shotguns using shot sizes between size six and nine in field loads, using gauges from 20 ga. to 12 ga. Turkeys, geese, grouse, ducks, pheasants, etc require larger shot sizes, and preferably larger gauge guns. A 12 ga. or even 10 ga. shooting number two or number four shot is a good choice. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Rabbits and squirrels can be hunted with rim fire rifles using hollow point bullets, high powered air rifles shooting at least 750 fps, or shotguns similar to those used for quail and dove. [8] X Research source Deer, antelope, and sheep can be killed with center fire rifles, bows, or muzzle loading rifles. Center fire cartridges should be at least .243 caliber with no smaller than 100 grain soft pointed bullets. Muzzle loading rifles should be at least .40 caliber, and bows should be capable of shooting a broad head arrow capable of delivering a clean kill. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Larger game, like elk, wild boar, moose, or bear, can be shot and killed with larger calibers, such as .30 caliber guns shooting 150 or higher grain soft pointed bullets. Dangerous game hunting requires a gun capable of bringing down charging animals. [11] X Research source"

This will also give you the advantage if you hit your prey but have to track it. Take note of any swamps, loose rocks, fallen trees, or any other obstacles that might impede your route to your hunting location. Be aware of natural animal runs through your hunting area. These are frequently the paths your chosen game will travel, and if you have to track your prey, knowing these will be helpful.

If you are hunting on the private property of a friend or neighbor, you must be sure you have the landowner's permission and your hunting license before setting out to hunt.

Once you have identified a meat animal that is safe for you to shoot, strive to get the animal down as quickly and painlessly as possible. You should avoid shooting a game animal that is too far away, moving too quickly for you to properly sight, or is in a position where a miss could result in injury to other hunters or property.

      "content": "Be prepared to track and dispatch a wounded animal. If you do not make a clean kill on what you plan to eat, wait a decent amount of time before following and tracking it down because even wounded animals can run for miles if they suspect that they are being chased. However, it is ultimately your responsibility to make every effort to find the wounded animal and humanely end its suffering.

If you decide on hunting with a friend or friends, be sure they are also attired in an appropriate amount of blaze orange and that they stay in sight while hunting. Check your gear before returning home; you don't want to bring potentially harmful wild animals into your home by accident. Do not indulge in alcohol or use drugs while hunting, as this may compromise your judgement and lead to injury. Test all your equipment before going out on your hunt.
