      "content": "Pick a shot glass. Most glasses hold 1.25 to 1.5 fl oz (37 to 44 mL) of fluid. Use any shot glasses that you may have around the house, or pick some up at a local store where alcohol is sold. Clear glasses will best showcase the visual effect of this drink. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour one ounce of coffee liqueur into the glass. This dark liqueur resembles the dark body of a Guinness, so it goes in first. If your shot glass is larger or smaller than 1.5 fl oz (44 mL), you can use a bit more or less; you'll want the coffee liqueur to make up about 2/3 of the drink."

    {
      "title": "Pour 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) of Irish cream.",
      "content": "Pour 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) of Irish cream. Pour the Irish cream gently so that it sits on top of the coffee liqueur, making up the remaining 1/3 of the drink. This lighter liqueur will resemble the foamy head of a Guinness. Holding a spoon over the top of the coffee liqueur and pouring the Irish cream over it may help it layer more evenly.

      "title": "Try it as a jello shot.",
      "content": "Try it as a jello shot. You'll need 1 packet of plain gelatin, 8 fl oz (240 mL) boiling water, 4 fl oz (120 mL) of cold coffee, 4 fl oz (120 mL) of coffee liqueur, 1 packet vanilla pudding, 4 fl oz (120 mL) of cold milk and 4 fl oz (120 mL) of Irish cream. You'll also need some small plastic cups for your shots. [3] X Research source In a bowl, add one 3 oz (85 g) packet of plain gelatin and 4 fl oz (120 mL) of boiling water. Then, stir in 4 fl oz (120 mL) of cold coffee and 4 fl oz (120 mL) of cold coffee liqueur. This will form the dark coffee base of the jello shot. Then, in a separate bowl, whisk together 1 packet of vanilla pudding, 4 fl oz (120 mL) of cold milk and 4 fl oz (120 mL) of Irish cream. This will form the cream top of the Baby Guinness. Place cups on a tray or platter. Spoon the dark coffee mixture in first to fill 2/3 of the cup. Top carefully with the cream mixture to fill the rest of the cup. Refrigerate for two hours, or until solid."

      "title": "Use a different colored liqueur base.",
      "content": "Use a different colored liqueur base. The dark colored liqueur makes the shooter look like a Guinness, but a lighter colored liqueur can make your shot look more like a pint of ale or lager. Try a sweet liqueur like Amaretto or Licor 43."

      "title": "Add Triple-Sec to make a B-52.",
      "content": "Add Triple-Sec to make a B-52. A B-52 is another layered shot that also uses coffee liqueur and Irish cream. The only difference is that coffee liqueur makes up the bottom 1/3 layer, Irish cream makes up the second 1/3 layer, and a final 1/3 layer of Triple-sec is added on top. [4] X Research source To make a flaming B-52 shot, use a high proof Triple-sec liquor, such as Cointreau. Light the shots right before serving them, but make sure that everyone blows out the flame before they drink and be very careful when serving flaming beverages!"
