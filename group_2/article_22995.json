      "content": "Every couple is different, but it usually takes 2-4 months to get into a committed relationship. This amount of time allows two people to get to know each other on a deeper level and see if they're compatible. [1] X Research source It's important to note, though, that the range of time can be anywhere from 6 weeks to a whole year. People usually start out by seeing each other casually. Then, they may agree to see each other exclusively without defining the relationship (though some relationships remain open). Once they realize they can trust each other and feel comfortable, they may decide to define their relationship and discuss their expectations in a committed relationship."

      "content": "Casually dating means you’re getting to know each other and may be seeing other people. During the casual dating phase (which typically lasts about 2-3 weeks), you may simply want to have fun. You might be going on semi-regular dates and hooking up, but commitment or monogamy isn't expected. Even if it might be a little awkward, it's still worth it to talk about your expectations for a casual arrangement to make sure that you're on the same page. It's important to let the person you're seeing know if you're sleeping with other people or want to wait a while before getting more serious. You might say, \"I love spending time with you, but I should let you know that I'm seeing other people right now, too\" or \"I'm not really looking for anything serious at the moment, but I'm having a great time getting to know you.\""

This phase usually lasts a few months (though it may last up to a year, depending on what you're looking for). During this time, you may start to consider if the two of you are seriously compatible. You'll likely start to get to know each other on a deeper level and open up about your past experiences, your values, and your goals in life. Here are some other signs that you're exclusively dating, but not in a committed relationship: You see each other on a regular basis (once to a few times a week) You're both only seeing each other You've met each other's friends You haven't defined the relationship"

Couples in committed relationships have talked about what they're looking for and established an arrangement that they both feel good about. They likely also envision a future together (whether that be remaining together for a long time, moving in together one day, or in some cases, starting a family). Before you commit to someone seriously, it's important to ask yourself these questions: [2] X Research source Do I see a future with them? Do I trust them? Do I feel comfortable being myself around them? Do they make me feel respected and appreciated? Reader Poll: We asked 658 wikiHow readers about what they wanted from their romantic life, and only 8% of people said they enjoyed periods of casual dating without building any lasting connections.

It's also important that you do it in person, as you might struggle to communicate clearly over text. Choose a time when the two of you are free to have a longer discussion, like when you're having dinner together, taking a secluded walk, or even just spending time at your house.

Think about what you're really looking for and how you might put your feelings into words. That way, you'll feel more confident and ready to bring up the subject with your partner when the time comes. If you're not sure how to put your feelings into words, try writing them down in a journal or talking over how you feel with a trusted friend."

This may sting, so it's best to go into the discussion without getting attached to a specific outcome. Instead, listen to what your partner has to say and remember that everyone moves at their own pace when it comes to relationships. If you're looking for different things, take some time to process before you decide what to do next. You might say, \"Thanks for being honest with me. I totally understand, but I need some time to think things over.\" If you'd really like to be in a committed relationship and this person isn't ready, it might be best to walk away. It's understandable to be disappointed or hurt, but remember that there are others out there who are looking for a committed relationship just like you."
