      "content": "Look for people who enjoy Nerf as much as you do. Have some friends or whoever you know over to your household or apartment or where you live. In order to do this, you'll need 2-14 people you know over to your place and you will assign them to their own position within the squad. You want to make sure that they agree with it and like it. Nobody likes a fight (unless it's a nerf fight)."

For each team member, select as follows: If they're best with the Spectrum or the Rebel Mech, they'll probably be in the speed category. If they're best with the Villainator or the Tomahawk, they'll probably be in the power category. If they're best with the DZ Pro Mk.II or the Aeon Pro, they'll probably be best in the stealth category. If they're best with the MK3 Pro or the Nexus Pro, they'll probably be best in the accuracy category."

They will need to get along with you and the others, it's best not to let total strangers into your squad. They will also need a leader, as their leader you will need to be focused, have a good voice for giving orders, and you will need to know how to use all the weapons in your Nerf arsenal, not just a few."

      "title": "Choose classes or roles.",
      "content": "Choose classes or roles. The following describes good classes or roles in Nerf combat: Commander. The Commander should use semi-automatic blasters (Stryfe, Spectrum or Rebel Mech), as they are lightweight and perfect blasters for combat, while sharing with the squad tactics and war plans. Assault. The Assault unit should use a Rebel Mech, Dart Zone Spectrum, Savage Spin, or the Tomahawk 60. These blasters are all perfect for the main task of hanging around the enemy base. Sniper. The Sniper unit should use a Conquest Pro, Dart Zone Nexus Pro, Dart Zone Max, Stryker, X-Shot Regenerator or Nerf Mega Centurion for the work he/she must do. They supply support for the team while taking out high value targets. Support Gunner. Has full firepower and can take on rough challenges, like getting past an invasion.The Support Gunner unit should use a Adventure Force (Dart Zone) V-Twin, Nerf Elite Hyperfire, Nerf Elite 2.0 Flipshots Flip-32 or a Matrixfire for giving allies covering fire and should carry grenades (if your game allows grenades). They must also be protective of the Commander, as a Sniper could be watching! Although optional, the Support Gunner can act as an ammo bearer/ammo mule and give other squad members ammunition if they are low on ammunition. Medic.(If the game-type includes revives, then this class is necessary) Also optional, the Medic should use primary pistols (Rebel Mech) or light rifles (Dart Zone Spectrum) while giving allies revive buffs to help with the war effort! Mission Control: This is also an optional class, even though it could be usefull. Mission Control should have contact with all players and coordinate attacks or make sure everything is going according to plan. If you plan to use drones and other gadgets, mission control will control them to scout the enemy. Even though this class will not go into the field, there is always a chance that the enemy finds your hideout. Mission control should have a Spectrum, Aeon Pro, Dart Zone Stormsquad, or Nerf Rival Kronos for protection. Scout: Needs to be very sneaky and fast. The Scout should carry a Nerf Modulus Recon MKII/MKIII. The Nerf Modulus MKII/MKIII is a perfect blaster because it doesn’t have slam-fire but that shouldn’t be an issue since scouts typically don’t directly engage in combat unless if they fight for information. Scouts are typically positioned in front of the main group to scout but they can also can be positioned along an unexpected route of an enemy attack to provide warning."

Once you have assembled your Nerf squad , give them specific duties such as, the snipers should be stationed near the trees or bushes and double as lookouts, the assault troops should have half their men on the front lines and the other half protecting the heavy machine gunners, the assassins or spies should be behind enemy lines or waiting in strategic positions to pounce on the enemy, etc."
