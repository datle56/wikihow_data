[1] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 27 May 2021. A slim fit and tapered leg are key for getting this look right. The pants will still have a casual, slouchy look, but they should fit more like a pair of trousers than the oversize sweats you wear when you’re home sick. Large, baggy, or oversize sweatpants generally aren't flattering. You want a cut that compliments your curves, not overwhelms them. The cuff should hit anywhere between mid-calf and just above the ankle. If they’re any longer, get them hemmed or (neatly) roll or cuff them."

Don’t limit yourself to the Pants made from lightweight fabrics won’t add bulk to your figure. For a more formal or glam look, try faux leather, suede, silk, or satin pants."

      "content": "Consider color, patterns, and fun embellishments. Classic black, gray, or white pants are the most versatile and can be dressed up or down. Black sweatpants are an especially good purchase, as they can easily pass for a nice pair of trousers with the right styling. But don’t limit yourself—you can find sweats in a rainbow of colors. Try subtle colors like peach or olive, or something bright and fun like teal or red. Look for fun details like zipper pockets, colored cuffs and waistbands, sequins, or a bow at the waist. Play with patterns like Ikat, floral, camo, or animal prints. [2] X Research source Avoid sweatpants with writing across the butt. That brings sweatpants back to the sloppy, sitting-on-the-couch level."

      "content": "Match the shoes to the outfit. You can do just about any shoe with fitted sweatpants as long as you match it to the outfit. Since the pants are cropped, your shoes are going to stand out and give you an opportunity to dress up your sweats or keep them casual. A classic black pump always looks fierce and can even work with more casual ensembles. Stilettos or heeled sandals are perfect for date-night or a girl’s night out. A fancier shoe is going to elevate your outfit. For more casual wear, try slip-on sneakers, Chuck Taylors, wedge sneakers, booties, or ballet flats. Avoid Ugg boots or flip-flops, they scream “shlubby” when worn with sweats."

      "content": "Accessorize, but keep it simple. You need to pay extra attention to the details to make sweatpants look great. Carefully select one or two accessories (like a floating lapel, a colorful shoe, or a pattered clutch) but don’t go overboard with big earrings, plus layers of necklaces, plus a hat and scarf. Carry a structured or high-end handbag to dress up your outfit. An oversize tote looks cute for running errands on the weekend. Round or oversize sunglasses will make your look super chic. A beanie will give your outfit a casual, athletic vibe. Add some glamour with a nice pair of drop earrings or a statement necklace. Try a large, eye-catching bracelet or watch and simple stud earrings."

Make sure your brows are on-point and your makeup is flawless. Make it clear that you're not shlubbing in your sweats--you're fashion-forward, and you put in the effort to pull it off. Instantly elevate your look with a bold red lip. Pull your hair up in a trendy topknot or a messy bun—just make sure it’s more chic than sloppy."

Remember that when people see sweatpants, they automatically think \"lazy,\" so fight that by mixing your sweats with high-fashion pieces. Wear your sweats as you would a nice pair of trousers. [3] X Research source Tuck in a long or flow shirt. A front-tuck or half-tuck will give your outfit structure—the loose fit of the sweatpants plus a loose shirt can look shapeless. Wear a white button-down (front-tucked) with pumps, sunglasses, a maxi-bag, and a long, sleek coat for a sophisticated look. A structured blazer and heel will make your pants look more like dress trousers than sweats.

Pair it with a button down (chambray or flannel) for a casual cool look. A leather moto jacket with a white t-shirt can stay casual with a bootie or slip-on sneakers, or a little more flirtatious with a black pump. Try a graphic-T, a denim jacket, and ballet flats to meet your girls for weekend brunch."

Wearing sweatpants outside of the house is already breaking some long-standing fashion rules, so feel free to experiment and wear what you think looks hot.

      "content": "Branch out with different fabrics and colors. An ultra-soft cotton will feel amazing and can look great, but you can also find sweatpants in lightweight leather, twill, or khaki. Black, white, or gray are the most versatile (the right pair of black or white sweats could be mistaken for trousers or slim jeans), but you might want to try a kelly green or blue to mix things up. Look for details like moto seams, belt loops, colored cuffs--these details will help separate your pants from looking like sloppy sweatpants."

[8] X Research source For a low-key look, layer a flight jacket over a t-shirt and accessorize with a beanie and boots. If you're wearing a t-shirt or a henley, make sure it is clean and fitted to contrast the loose pants. Solid colors, patterns, or vintage t's can all work."
