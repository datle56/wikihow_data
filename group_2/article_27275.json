Using sarcasm implies that the other person is stupid just for asking a reasonable question, and it's usually pretty easy to pull off every now and then. It's a funny and light way to make fun of someone. [1] X Research source Say the opposite of what you mean when someone asks you a specific question: \"Yeah, I aced that test. I'm a mathlete, you didn't know? My professorship at MIT comes through next week.\" Give obviously-wrong answers to questions. If someone asks, \"Where have you been?\" a good sarcastic answer might be, \"Me and Steve were up in the mountains skinning rabbits and trading the pelts for rocket supplies. The operation's really humming. Where have YOU been?\" Exaggerate your response . If someone says, \"You look like crap today\" come back with, \"Apologies, master. To the stocks with I. Shall I bring 'round the Pinto?\""

Shopping in the douche section again?\" \"You dress like my dentist. Except you're not rich and you do nothing for me.\" \"It smells like there are mice in your hair again.
