      "title": "Choose a high-waisted jean.",
      "content": "Choose a high-waisted jean. High-waisted jeans are hugely flattering for female bodies: they accentuate your lower-body curves, conceal any bumps and lumps and help keep your lower half covered when you bend over. [1] X Research source Look for a pair that cinches just about your hips. Check the zipper before purchasing. An ill fitting zipper will create a bump in your front, making your stomach look larger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure your skinny jeans are the correct length.",
      "content": "Make sure your skinny jeans are the correct length. On women, skinny jeans should hit just above the ankle bone. Jeans longer than this will make you look sloppy and jeans shorter than this will make your legs look stockier than they really are. [2] X Research source If you find a pair of jeans that fits perfectly but are too long, take them to a seamstress to get hemmed. Alterations will cost about $10, and depending on where you buy your jeans, can even be done in stores."

    {
      "title": "Don’t be afraid to size up.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid to size up. Skinny jeans should be tight, but not skin tight. Jeans should easily slide over your calves and thighs – if they don’t, choose a larger size. Practice squatting and bending in your jeans to make sure they give you enough room to move around in. [3] X Research source It’s better to go up a size than to buy a pair of jeans that are too uncomfortable to wear. Jean sizes vary from store to store, so always try on a few different size options to see what works best."

      "title": "Use pockets to make your butt look great.",
      "content": "Use pockets to make your butt look great. Buy a pair of skinny jeans with pockets that are high and close together. Wearing jeans with high pockets creates an optical illusion that makes your bottom look higher and fuller. [4] X Research source If your back pockets look strained or if you can see the pocket lining, you need a bigger pair of jeans. Avoid pockets that are wide and saggy; they won’t do your backside any favors. If your jeans are too tight in the butt, it may cause camel toe. If you’re concerned about camel toe, opt for jeans with more room in the butt."

    {
      "title": "Choose standard skinny jeans.",
      "content": "Choose standard skinny jeans. Standard skinny jeans for men are usually made from 100% cotton and are fairly comfortable. They have a slightly wide ankle opening and a less dramatic taper. [5] X Research source Wear standard skinny jeans if you’re carrying some weight around your legs and mid-section. These jeans should sit slightly below the waist and be slim throughout the hip and thigh. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose spray-on skinny jeans.",
      "content": "Choose spray-on skinny jeans. Spray-on skinny jeans are constructed mostly from stretch elastane, are tapered all the way down and have a very narrow ankle opening. They are incredibly unforgiving and should only be worn by men who are very confident in their bodies. [7] X Research source Avoid wearing spray-on jeans if there is an extreme contrast between the size of your upper body and the size of your lower body. Avoid wearing spray-on jeans if you have a tall and skinny physique. They will only enhance how lanky you are."

    {
      "title": "Choose the correct length and rise.",
      "content": "Choose the correct length and rise. Men don’t have as much flexibility as women do when it comes to how high their jeans should sit. It is largely agreed upon that the only correct rise for men’s jeans is mid rise. [8] X Research source Your jeans should sit somewhere below your bellybutton, but above your pelvic bones. Make sure the jeans don’t sag near your crotch. Jeans should fall between the top of your shoe and your heel."

    {
      "title": "Mix up the proportions.",
      "content": "Mix up the proportions. Skinny jeans cling to your body, so to balance that out, pair them with a loose and flowing top. This will create an interesting visual balance, plus the top will afford you some coverage for your waistline and rear. Wear your jeans with an empire waisted blouse or flowing tunic. Do not pair your skinny jeans with a short or tight top. To add some more sophistication to your outfit, add a fitted blazer or jacket that cuts off just below your hips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a pair of heels.",
      "content": "Add a pair of heels. Heels are the ideal shoe to wear with skinny jeans; they make your legs look longer and leaner in your jeans, plus, they lift your behind, which makes it look perkier. Avoid wearing flats with skinny jeans. They will make you look wider than you actually are. If you don’t feel comfortable walking in stilettos, trying swapping them out in favor of a wedge heel."

    {
      "title": "Pair your skinny jeans with booties for winter.",
      "content": "Pair your skinny jeans with booties for winter. Skinny jeans can be worn year round, but heels are not always the most cold-weather friendly shoe option. When the weather gets colder, swap your heels out for a pair of ankle booties. [9] X Research source Add a chunky sweater and a tailored coat to your outfit to look like you just walked off a ski slope. Go for a classically edgy look with a white t-shirt and a leather jacket."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pair standard skinny jeans with tailored pieces.",
      "content": "Pair standard skinny jeans with tailored pieces. Standard skinny jeans are perfect to wear with almost anything – they go great with t-shirts, button downs and polos. But standard skinny jeans look best when paired with tailored pieces, like a nice jacket. [10] X Research source Add layers to your skinny jean look – wear a nice-fitting sweater under your jacket and add a pair of loafers to finish the look. For a more casual weekend look, wear an unbuttoned plaid shirt over a plain tee and complete the look with a pair of clunky boots."

      "title": "Wear trendy pieces with your spray-on jeans.",
      "content": "Wear trendy pieces with your spray-on jeans. Spray-on skinny jeans are very of-the-moment, and as such, they work well with similarly trendy pieces. Avoid pairing your spray-on jeans with anything classic, like polo shirts or tailored jackets. [11] X Research source Wear your spray-on jeans with a t-shirt and an open bomber jacket. Complete the look with a pair of slip on sneakers. Play around with length by wearing an oversized coat over a fitted sweater."

      "title": "Transition your skinny jeans from day to night.",
      "content": "Transition your skinny jeans from day to night. Skinny jeans are incredibly versatile, and you can easily wear them to work and then out for the evening, with only a few simple changes. Start your day off in a pair of skinny jeans, sneakers and a button down shirt. To make the outfit more fun for evening, throw on a form-fitting blazer that is snug around the shoulders and flares out towards the middle of your body. Swap out the sneakers for an ankle boot."

    {
      "title": "Choose a darker wash.",
      "content": "Choose a darker wash. Everyone knows that black is slimming, but the same holds true for dark-colored denim. The darker the wash of the jeans, the more flattering the jeans will look on your body. An added benefit to wearing a dark wash is that the jean will easily transition from day to night. Just add a nice shirt and a pair of heels."

      "title": "If you’re curvy, avoid jeans with thigh details.",
      "content": "If you’re curvy, avoid jeans with thigh details. If you’re trying to make your thighs appear longer and leaner, the best thing you can do is pick a simple jean. Lots of jeans incorporate extra trends – distressing, bleaching, strategically placed rips, etc. These details will only draw more attention to your thighs and make them appear larger than they actually are. If you insist on getting jeans with detailing, look for detailing that falls on or below the knee. To streamline your lower half even more, avoid rear pockets with buttons on them in favor of more streamlined pockets. If you have a flat butt, buying jeans with detailing on the back pockets will make your butt look bigger and fuller."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a stretch jean.",
      "content": "Choose a stretch jean. Most jean retailers offer a skinny jean option in a “stretch” fit. These jeans are made with Lycra and they have more give than normal skinny jeans. Stretch jeans are generally more forgiving than non-stretch jeans, which makes them a great choice for curvier body types. Stretch jeans are also a great option if you’ve put on a couple pounds, are dealing with period bloat, or are preparing to eat a large meal."
