While there are many benefits to jailbreaking a PS4, there are also some risks and downsides that you need to be aware of. They are as follows: No online gaming. After jailbreaking your PS4, your PS4 will be stuck on the firmware version that is compatible with the jailbreak. This will limit your access to PlayStation Network. You will not be able to play online multiplayer games after jailbreaking your PS4. You may not be able to play new games. You may need to find an unofficial (Home Brew) copy of the latest games in order to play them. There is a chance of bricking your PS4. Since you are modifying the console's firmware, there is always a chance you may corrupt the firmware and render your console unable to boot up or function. Your warranty will be voided. If you still have any sort of warranty with your PS4, it will be voided after jailbreaking your PS4. You will not be able to receive official support from Sony. You may be banned from PlayStation Network. If you try to sign in to the PlayStation Network from a jailbroken console, your account, and may be banned from the PlayStation Network. This would prevent you from access PSN features on other consoles. There are security risks. Jailbreaking removes many security features put in place by Sony.
