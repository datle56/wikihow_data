If you don't have a picture of the focus of your fanpage immediately available, download one before setting up your Instagram account so that you can add it to your profile during the setup process.

If the focus of your fanpage inspires a hashtag, be sure to use the hashtag in as many posts as possible before the hashtag's relevance dies."
