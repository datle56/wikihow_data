Add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of water, then stir it in with a spoon. Keep stirring until the water is completely mixed in and the texture is consistent.

Make sure that the saline solution contains both boric acid and sodium borate; otherwise, the glue won't turn into slime. Once you stir in the saline solution with a spoon, set the mixture aside.

Stir together with a spoon until the baking soda dissolves, then set the mixture aside so that the water can cool down. [3] X Research source Be sure to use baking soda and not baking powder! They're not the same thing."

Just take the glob out of the water and knead it between your fingers for a few minutes until it thickens up and starts to feel like slime.

Use a measuring cup to measure out 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of clear school glue and pour it into a medium-sized bowl. Then, measure out 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of water and pour it over the glue in the bowl. Stir the 2 ingredients with a spoon until they're fully mixed together. [6] X Research source Most bottles of school glue contain 4 ounces (120 mL), which equals 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL). If your glue says 4 ounces on the packaging, you can just empty out the whole bottle into the bowl! If you want more slime, you can double the recipe and use 1 cup (240 mL) of clear glue and 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Do not use white school glue! Using clear PVA glue is the key to making this slime clear."

Your slime will still be see-through if you add food coloring, but it won't be crystal clear. If you want this, stir in 1-3 drops of blue food coloring with a spoon. If you don't have blue food coloring on hand, then try 1-3 drops of liquid watercolor paint instead. Don't use acrylic paint, because you'll end up with slime that isn't see-through."

Mix them together until the Borax completely dissolves. [7] X Research source Be sure to use warm water! If you use room temperature water, the Borax won't dissolve. If you're doubling the recipe, use 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water and 1/2 teaspoon (2.8 g) of Borax powder. Keep in mind that Borax can cause skin, eye, and lung irritation.

Keep stirring the mixture until it starts to leave the sides of the bowl. [8] X Research source Don't worry if there's still Borax water left in the bowl. As long as the glue clumps together, you're good to go. Don't whisk or whip the slime with the spoon as you stir it, or you'll get air bubbles, which can ruin the crystal clear look you're going for."

A plastic container with a tight-fitting lid is the best storage option to keep it from drying out, but a plastic freezer bag will also work. Store the slime at room temperature. Make sure that your hands are clean before you play with the slime to keep it looking clear. If you store it properly in an airtight container, this type of slime should last at least 1 week, if not longer."

For example, you could add blue food coloring to yellow shampoo to make green slime. A little bit goes a long way, so 1-2 drops is all you need.

If it starts to lose it's texture, you could try revitalizing it by stirring it back up again, then putting it back into the fridge for 2 days. If the slime starts to get too runny while you're playing with it, try putting it back into the fridge or freezer for a few hours, and see if that helps."
