You may not be able to fully engage sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch with every activity, but try to get multiple senses involved whenever possible. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, taking a hike on a spring day can engage multiple senses—seeing and smelling the budding flowers, hearing animals scurrying about, feeling the water droplets from an unexpected spring shower, and so on. Cooking and baking are also good multi-sensory activities."

Mnemonic devices are simple memory techniques that use patterns, images, and other tools to help make remembering something much easier. Try the following: [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Association. Connect a name or other fact to an easy-to-remember mental image. For example, picture 16 stovepipe hats that are sick in bed to remember that Abraham Lincoln was from Illinois (\"ill\") and was the 16th U.S. president. Chunking. Break up larger pieces of information into smaller, more manageable pieces. For instance, break up your student ID number (20011492609) into “chunks” that you can associate with other things—like your uncle’s favorite movie (“2001”), Christopher Columbus (“1492”), and your house number as a kid (“609”). Acronyms and acrostics. Famous examples include “Roy G. Biv” to remember the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) and “Every good boy does fine” to remember the lines on the treble music staff (EGBDF)."

You may be more likely to find your mind wandering or to experience “brain fog” if your body is even slightly dehydrated or short on nutrients. When you feel out-of-focus, take a quick break. Drink a glass of water and enjoy a nutritious snack, then see if you can focus more effectively. [9] X Research source Opt for a healthy snack like a handful of nuts and dried fruit or some carrot and celery sticks. Unhealthy snacks don’t give your body the nutrients it craves.

[17] X Research source Walking can also release tension and promote relaxation, which certainly might help improve creativity. Instead of shutting yourself in your room until you come up with that next great idea, try taking a stroll around the neighborhood.
