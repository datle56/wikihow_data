      "content": "Slowly bring the ingredients to a boil over medium heat while stirring them. Don't use high heat. The sugar will boil too quickly if you do, and start to caramelize. Stir the ingredients often so that you don't scorch the bottom of the pot. As the mixture heats up, it'll go from a cloudy color to clear. When it boils, it will start to form foamy bubbles at top. A silicone spatula will make clean up a lot easier than a wooden, plastic, or metal one."

      "content": "Heat the candy to 300°F (148.89°C), then remove it from heat. The candy must reach 300°F (148.89°C). This is known as the \"hard crack\" phase. If you do not get the candy hot enough, it will not set properly. Your candy will end up sticky no matter how long you let it sit or cool. [3] X Research source It will take about an hour for the candy to reach the right temperature. The temperature will stop rising for a moment somewhere between 210 and 240°F (98.89 and 115.56°C). This is because the water is evaporating. Once the water has evaporated, the temperature will begin rising again. Keep the temperature between 300 and 310°F (148.89 and 154.45°C). Do not allow it to reach 320°F (160°C) or your sugar glass will caramelize and turn brown. If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the candy by dropping a tiny amount into a glass of cold water. The candy has reached the \"hard crack\" phase if it hardens into threads. [4] X Research source"

If you used tin foil or parchment paper, pop the candy out of the baking sheet. Then, peel the foil or paper off of the candy. If your candy does not come away easily, do this: Take a knife and heat it up under hot water. Cut along the edge where the glass meets the edge of the pan. Use the knife to carefully loosen the candy from the baking sheet. Flip the baking sheet over, then slowly lift the sheet away from the sugar glass that is resting on your hand."

The more drops you add, the darker your sea glass will be. The color you use is up to you, but most sea glass is green or blue. You can also leave your sea glass clear; it will become more white once you add the powdered sugar. Use only one flavor and color per batch. Consider matching your flavoring to the color. For example, you can use blueberry flavoring for blue sea glass, mint flavoring for green glass, and vanilla flavoring for white/clear glass. You can buy the coloring and flavoring in the baking section of an arts and crafts store. You may also find them in a store that sells baking and cooking supplies."

[6] X Research source Use icing to draw a frame around the window. You can also use icing to draw a # or + over the window to create a lattice. To create a stained glass look: use icing to glue different colored shards of hardened sugar glass behind a window opening. If your gingerbread house does not have window holes: put some square-shaped cookie cutters onto a sheet of parchment paper. Fill them with melted sugar glass. Wait one hour for the candy to harden, then pop it out of the cookie cutter. Use icing to glue the squares to a gingerbread house wall. [7] X Research source"
