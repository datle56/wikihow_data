      "content": "Measure the length, width, and height of the ceiling and walls. Use a tape measure and take the length and width for the ceiling. Then take the length and height of each wall. [1] X Research source Mark all of these measurements down so you don’t forget them. Contractors often write their measurements directly on wall studs or drywall sheets so they always know the location of their measurements. Consider following this practice so you don't lose track."

      "title": "Calculate the square footage",
      "content": "Calculate the square footage of the area you're drywalling. This calculation tells you how many drywall sheets to buy. The formula for square feet (or meters) is length x width. Using this formula, calculate the square footage of each wall and the ceiling separately. So if your ceiling is 10 ft × 8 ft (3.0 m × 2.4 m), that’s 80 sq ft (7.4 m 2 ). [2] X Research source If you took your measurements in inches, simply divide the measurement by 12 to convert it to feet. For instance, if you measured 84 in (210 cm), that is 7 ft (2.1 m). Average drywall sheets are 8 ft (2.4 m) by 4 ft (1.2 m), or 32 square feet (3.0 m 2 ). After calculating the square footage of the ceiling and each wall, divide each number by 32. This will tell you how many drywall sheets you need for each section. So if your ceiling is 8 ft (2.4 m) by 10 ft (3.0 m), that’s 80 sq ft (7.4 m 2 ): 80/32 is 2.5, so buy 3 whole sheets for that section. Buy a few more sheets than you need to ensure you have enough if you make any mistakes."

      "title": "Remove all ceiling and wall fixtures if applicable.",
      "content": "Remove all ceiling and wall fixtures if applicable. Some ceilings have light or smoke detector sockets installed, and walls may have electrical outlets or switches. These fixtures will get in the way while you’re attaching the drywall. Use a screwdriver and carefully unscrew these fixtures. Store them safely so you can reinstall them later. [3] X Research source Turn off all light switches in the room to make sure electricity isn’t flowing to light fixtures or switches. To be extra safe, turn off the circuits for this room in your breaker board. Remember to tuck away all wires that are sticking out after you remove these fixtures. Tucking them behind the rafters in the ceiling or wall studs will keep them out of the way of any screws when you start installing the drywall."

      "title": "Measure and mark down the distance from the wall to all ceiling fixtures.",
      "content": "Measure and mark down the distance from the wall to all ceiling fixtures. This is so you can cut holes where light fixtures are. Use a grid pattern to get their exact location. Measure the distance from the closest wall to the center of the fixture. Then measure the distance from the next closest wall to the center as well. Write this measurement down so you remember after you install the drywall. [4] X Research source Measure the radius of the fixture as well. That way you’ll know how big of a hole to cut in the drywall. While you install the drywall, it’s best to cut the holes right after you hang the sheets. If you complete the installation and then make a mistake while cutting, you might have to redo the whole job."

      "content": "Drill a wood block 2 in (5.1 cm) below the ceiling. This is a trick for if you’re doing this job alone because you can rest the drywall on this block when you begin installing it. Take a wood block about the length of the wall you're working on. Press this block 2 in (5.1 cm) below the ceiling and then drill it to the wall studs. [5] X Research source Use a longer screw for this job than you use for drywall installation. If your wood is 2 in (5.1 cm) thick, use a 5 in (13 cm) screw. You’ll probably have to stand on a step stool or small ladder to do this, so be careful. If you don't have a wood block long enough, use a smaller piece and move it around as you need."

      "content": "Drill a 1 ft (0.30 m) block of wood to a ceiling rafter where you’re working. This is another trick for doing this job alone. Measure 4 feet (1.2 m) from the wall you're working near. At this point, use a 5 in (13 cm) screw and screw the wood block to the ceiling rafter. Leave a 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) gap between the rafter and the block so it stays loose. This should allow the block to rotate in all directions. [6] X Research source You can now spin this block around and let drywall sheets rest on it while you install them. You can install as many of these blocks as you need. Whenever you need some extra support, drill one down and rotate it so the drywall rests on the block. Simply remove them after you’re done. These blocks are especially useful for when you have to drill screws into the drywall and may need both hands."

      "title": "Start at the corner of the ceiling.",
      "content": "Start at the corner of the ceiling. The idea when hanging drywall is installing as many complete sheets as possible before cutting any sheets. Hang the first drywall sheet in the corner so you can cover as much of the ceiling as possible with complete sheets. As you proceed, move forward from this first sheet. [7] X Research source If you start in a different location, your measurements will be off and you will have to do more cutting than you would normally. This adds more work and time, and if you make mistakes when cutting you'll have to buy more drywall!"

      "content": "Rest the end of the drywall on the block on the wall while fitting it into place. Grab one end of the drywall sheet and start lifting it up to the ceiling. Lift the far edge up to the wooden block that you attached to the wall and rest it there. [8] X Research source You’ll need some strength to do this alone. Drywall sheets are about 50 lb (23 kg), and you’ll need to support this weight above your head for a few seconds."

      "title": "Push the drywall firmly onto the ceiling.",
      "content": "Push the drywall firmly onto the ceiling. While the drywall is supported by the wood block and your hands, start climbing the ladder and guide the drywall to the ceiling. Position sheet snugly into the corner of the ceiling. [9] X Research source This is much easier once you have one end resting on the wood block on the wall. That will support some of the drywall’s weight while you slide it into place. For extra support, drill more wood blocks to the ceiling and rotate them to hold the drywall."

      "content": "Drill 1 screw through the drywall into each rafter in the ceiling. Measure 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) in from the edge of the sheet, then drill through the drywall. This practice marks the rafters so you can drill the rest of your screws later on. While the end of the drywall rests on the wood block and you use one hand to hold the drywall onto the ceiling, use your free hand to hold your power drill. At the edge closest to you, fasten the drywall to the ceiling with 1 screw in each rafter. [10] X Research source It's important to keep your screws 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) away from any edges to avoid cracking the drywall. Avoid any of the ceiling fixtures that you made note of before. Use coarse-threaded screws for drywall installation. Screws come on many lengths. A good rule is to multiply the width of your drywall, usually 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm), by 1.5. This gives you 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm). Then add 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) and 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) together, giving you 1 1/4 inches (3.175 cm) for your screw length."

Drilling 4 more screws into each rafter, for a total of 5, gives your drywall enough support to stay secure. [11] X Research source The distance between these screws depends on whether you're fastening the drywall sheet lengthwise or width-wise. The width is 4 ft (1.2 m), so place your 5 screws 9 in (23 cm) apart if you placed the sheets width-wise. The length is 8 ft (2.4 m), so place your 5 screws 19 in (48 cm) apart if you placed your sheets length-wise. If you have trouble following the first screw in a straight line, use a yardstick to help. Push this onto the ceiling and draw a straight line back from the first screw. Then drill your other screws on this line. [12] X Research source"

Then use a drywall cutter to cut through the drywall and free those fixtures. [13] X Research source Cut these holes after placing each sheet, rather than saving it all for the end. That way if you make a mistake, you only have to replace one sheet."

This small gap will make sure the sheets aren’t too tight or too far apart. [14] X Research source At this point, don't cut any drywall sheets yet. Drill down as many complete panels as possible, making sure to keep the sheets straight and pressed together. Drill screws in a straight line from the screws in the first sheet.

Use a wood block long enough so you can rest a drywall sheet on it from any point along the wall. If you only have a short block, remove it and reinstall it as you work down the wall. [18] X Research source Keep this block straight. If it’s crooked, your drywall could be crooked too. Use a level tool if you're having trouble keeping the block straight."
