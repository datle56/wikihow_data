      "title": "Outline your design using puff paint.",
      "content": "Outline your design using puff paint. You may also find it labeled as puffy paint, dimensional paint, or 3D paint. You can typically find it in the fabric paint section of a fabric store or an arts and crafts store. If you have any inner shapes, like spots on a ladybug, trace around the inner shapes too using your outline color. [3] X Research source It might be a good idea to make a few practice strokes on a piece of scrap paper first. [4] X Research source This will allow you to get a feel for the puff paint and prevent it from gushing out. Puff paint is not the same as glitter glue. You can, however, use glittery puff paint, if you'd like."

      "title": "Fill in your designs.",
      "content": "Fill in your designs. Make several thick lines, then use the tip of your puff paint bottle to spread them around. [5] X Research source Don't skimp on the puff paint; make it as thick as you can. If it is too thin, it will be hard to peel off. [6] X Research source Make sure that all of the colors are touching, or your design will fall apart."

      "title": "Consider shaking on some glitter.",
      "content": "Consider shaking on some glitter. [7] X Research source This is not completely necessary, but it can make your window clings look prettier. Extra-fine glitter would work best for this, but you can use other types as well. Don't remove the excess glitter just yet."

      "title": "Wait for your design to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for your design to dry. It will take at least 48 hours for the paint to dry. You can test smaller pieces after 24 hours. [8] X Research source Most puff paint will look darker and slightly more translucent once it dries. Carefully peek under your design. If the puff paint still looks \"milky\" from behind, it is not ready. If you added glitter, shake the glitter off after the paint dries. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw your design. Get out a sheet of paper and draw a simple design using a dark-colored pen. If you don't know how to draw, find a simple outline online and print it out. You can also tear a page out of a coloring book."

[12] X Research source Plastic wrap may also work; be sure to tape it to your work surface, over your design. As a last resort, you can also try wax paper. Avoid parchment paper. It will absorb the glue and make the window clings difficult to remove later. [13] X Research source"

Stir in some liquid or gel food coloring. [14] X Research source How much food coloring you use is up to you. The more you use, the darker and more vibrant the color will be. You can also use liquid watercolor instead of food coloring. [15] X Research source If you don't care about the window clings being translucent, you can add a few drops of acrylic paint instead. If you want to make more colors, repeat this step for each color. Stir in some glitter for a more sparkly effect."

[16] X Research source Avoid making it too thick, however, or it will run and not dry properly. [17] X Research source Make sure that the colors touch, or your window cling will fall apart. [18] X Research source For a neater finish, outline your design first using glitter glue or a glitter glue pen. Puff paint may also work."

It is not recommended that you munch on them, however; they likely don't taste very good."
