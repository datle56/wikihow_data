      "content": "Try to use the baguette the same day you buy or bake it. Because a French baguette is so thin and narrow, it will turn stale quickly. Plan on buying a baguette the same day you want to eat it. [1] X Research source If you purchase a warm baguette that has been placed in a paper or plastic bag, remove it so it doesn't trap the bread's moisture. This moisture will cause the bread to soften and become soggy."

      "content": "Wrap the baguette in aluminum foil. Tear off a large sheet of aluminum foil and lay the baguette on it lengthwise. Fold the long sides of the foil over the baguette and tuck the ends of the foil under. Crimp the aluminum foil so it's sealed shut. [2] X Research source If you're planning on freezing the baguette, you may need to cut the baguette in half crossways before wrapping it."

      "content": "Keep the wrapped baguette at room temperature for 1 day. Set the baguette wrapped in aluminum foil on the counter and try to use it within 1 day. Avoid refrigerating the baguette since the refrigerator will introduce moisture and cause the bread to harden faster. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Freeze a wrapped baguette for up to 3 months. If you don't plan on eating the baguette right away, wrap it in aluminum foil and stick it in the freezer. Label the baguette and remember to include the date, so you know to remove and eat the baguette within 3 months. [4] X Research source You can slice the baguette into individual pieces. Then wrap and freeze the slices instead of freezing the entire baguette."

      "content": "Wet the baguette and heat it in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Take the stale baguette and run tap water over the bottom of the bread. Then put the baguette directly into a 400 °F (204 °C) oven for 10 minutes. If you're using a frozen baguette, you'll need to heat it for closer to 15 minutes. [5] X Research source Wetting the baguette will add moisture to the bread. This will create steam in the hot oven which will make the baguette's crust crispy again."

      "content": "Slice slightly stale baguette and make toast . You'll need a sharp serrated knife to cut the stale baguette into thin slices. Put them into a toaster and heat the bread until they're slightly crispy. If you don't have a toaster, arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and place them under a broiler until they're browned. Turn them and toast the other sides. [6] X Research source If you don't feel like eating toast, grate the stale baguette or put pieces of the baguette into a food processor. Pulse or grate the bread to make breadcrumbs."

Spread them on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle them with olive oil. Then bake the croutons until they're crisp and golden brown. [7] X Research source Make a meal out of the croutons by tossing them with chopped tomatoes and cucumbers. Coat the salad with a simple olive oil and vinegar dressing to make the classic panzanella salad."

Then stuff a turkey with the mixture or spread it in a baking pan. Cook the stuffing or dressing until it's browned and firm to the touch.
