      "content": "Stock up on supplies and equip some good weapons. The journey to High Hrothgar is long and treacherous, so make sure you stock up on supplies. Grab some health potions as well as the best armor and weapon that you can afford. The stores in Whiterun can help prepare you for the climb. \"Warmaiden's\", located near the entrance of Whiterun, has two shopkeepers offering weapons and armor for sale. If you’re an archer, you can buy bows and arrows from Elrindir in the \"Drunken Huntsman\". For more spells and staffs, you can visit Farengar in Dragonsreach. \"Belethor's General Goods\" has a variety of items for sale each day. \"Arcadia’s Cauldron\" specializes in potions and elixirs."

      "content": "Get Lydia to join you. You'll encounter Lydia immediately after defeating the dragon outside of Whiterun. Having Lydia (or any other companion) with you for the climb will make things much easier. If she’s not already following you, you can find her in Dragonsreach (unless you've purchased Breezehome, in which case you can find her there). Talk to Lydia and request that she follow you."

      "title": "Activate the \"Way of the Voice\" quest.",
      "content": "Activate the \"Way of the Voice\" quest. You can start this quest by talking to Jarl Balgruuf after defeating the dragon in Whiterun. He will inform you of the Greybeards in High Hrothgar and mark the town of Ivarstead on your map. If you're pressed for time or don't want to make the long journey, you can fast-travel to Helgen (where the game's prologue occurred) and then make a quick walk east to reach Ivarstead. This can be good if you need to quickly get to Ivarstead, but you'll miss out on a lot of locations and opportunities to gain XP."

Talk to Klimmek, and he’ll warn you of all the dangers ahead of you. You can also take the optional quest to deliver supplies to the Greybeards. It's highly-recommended that you take the quest to deliver supplies, as you don't have to go out of your way and it earns you some easy gold."
