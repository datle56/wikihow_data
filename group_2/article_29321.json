      "title": "Buy a dimmer that corresponds with the number of switches.",
      "content": "Buy a dimmer that corresponds with the number of switches. When picking a compatible dimmer, you have single-pole and 3-way dimmers to choose from. If the switch you're replacing has one switch, go for a single-pole dimmer. If the switch has 2 switches, pick a 3-way dimmer. [1] X Research source A single-pole dimmer allows you to dim the lights with one switch (usually a dimming knob). A 3-way dimmer allows you to turn the light on and off with one switch while dimming the light with the other switch or dimming knob."

      "title": "Choose a dimmer that is compatible with your dimmable light bulbs.",
      "content": "Choose a dimmer that is compatible with your dimmable light bulbs. Dimmable LED , incandescent , and halogen bulbs work best with dimmer switches made for the specific lightbulb type. When choosing a dimmer switch, read the label and name of the switch to make sure that it's compatible with the light bulbs you intend to use. [2] X Research source For the dimmer switch to work properly, use a dimmable bulb. Installing an incompatible dimmer might cause the lights to flicker, stay in one lighting range, or not come on at all. Standard dimmer switches are not compatible with ceiling fan lights, as they can weaken the fan motor and cause it to overheat. Call a licensed electrician to install separate switches for the ceiling fan and the light bulb."

      "title": "Choose a dimmer that's compatible with the bulb wattage.",
      "content": "Choose a dimmer that's compatible with the bulb wattage. Dimmer switches come with a specific rating that describes the maximum amount of wattage they can accommodate. The standard ratings include 150, 300, 600, and 1,000. If you're trying to dim a single bulb, check that bulb's wattage to determine the type of dimmer you need. For example, a single 100-watt bulb would be compatible with a 150-watt dimmer switch. [3] X Research source When you're working with multiple light bulbs, add up the wattage of each bulb. Then, find a dimmer switch with a rating that is compatible with that amount. If you have 4 100-watt bulbs (400 watts in total), then a 300-watt dimmer switch would not be enough. Purchase a dimmer switch with a 600-watt maximum to ensure the switch works properly."

      "content": "Turn the power off using your home's electrical panel. For your safety, it's important to keep the power turned off during the entire installation process. Find your home's electrical panel, then flip the corresponding switch to turn it off. To ensure that the power is off, turn the light switch on and off to make sure it produces no light. Then, use a voltage tester to ensure there is no electrical current coming from the breaker. Electrical panels are usually located in the garage, basement, laundry room, or closet space of a home or apartment. [4] X Research source If you're not sure which breaker switch corresponds to the light switch, turn off each switch one by one and see which one shuts off the light. [5] X Research source Purchase a non-contact voltage tester online or at a home improvement store in your area. Apply the non-contact voltage tester to the breaker switch that controls the light switch to make sure there is no electrical current."

To wire a single-pole wall switch , connect the hot wire to the copper screw on the new switch by twisting it over the screw in a clockwise direction. If the switch is connected by push connector nuts, push the hot wire into the correct placement. Follow that by securing the neutral wire to the dimmer in the same fashion. [9] X Research source The hot wire is usually red or black. The neutral wire is usually white. For an additional reference, see if your dimmer switch came with wiring instructions and refer to those throughout the process."

If the light is still not working, call a licensed electrician to troubleshoot other possible issues. If you intend to make any adjustments to the wiring yourself, always remember to switch the breaker off again first."
