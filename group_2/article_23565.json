      "content": "Break addition and subtraction problems into parts. Treat each group of hundreds, tens, and ones as a separate problem. As math tutor Kevin Wang explains, this makes it easier and faster to add or subtract values. [1] X Expert Source Kevin Wang Math Tutor Expert Interview. 27 August 2024. For example: 712 + 281 → \"700 + 200,\" \"10 + 80,\" and \"2 + 1\" 700 + 200 = 9 00, then 10 + 80 = 9 0, then 2 + 1 = 3 900 + 90 + 3 = 993 . Thinking in \"hundreds\" or \"tens\" instead of single digits makes it easier to keep track when digits sum to more than ten. For example, for 37 + 45, think \"30 + 40 = 70\" and \"7 + 5 = 12\". Then add 70 + 12 to get 82."

      "content": "Change the problem to make round numbers . Round numbers are faster to work with. So, try rounding up each number to find a quick estimate. Keep note of the changes you’ve made, just in case you need an exact answer later. [2] X Research source Check out these examples: Addition: For 596 + 380 , realize that you can add 4 to 596 to round it to 600, then add 600 + 380 to get 980. Undo the rounding by subtracting 4 from 980 to get 976 . Subtraction: For 815 - 521 , break it up into 800 - 500, 10 - 20, and 5 - 1. To turn the awkward \"10 - 20\" into \"20 - 20\", add 10 to 815 to get 825. Now solve to get 304, then undo the rounding by subtracting 10 to get 294 . Multiplication: For 38 x 3 , you can add 2 to 38 to make the problem 40 x 3, which is 120. Since the 2 you added got multiplied by three, you need to undo the rounding by subtracting 2 x 3 = 6 at the end to get 120 - 6 = 114 ."

Look for numbers that add up to 10 or other round numbers that you can easily work with. [3] X Research source For example, 7 + 4 + 9 + 13 + 6 + 51 can be reorganized to (7 + 13) + (9 + 51) + (6 + 4) = 20 + 60 + 10 = 90."

      "content": "Multiply from left to right. On paper, most people multiply the ones place first, going from right to left. But in your head, it can be easier to go the other way: from left to right. [4] X Research source Take a look at these examples to see what we mean: For 453 x 4 , start with 400 x 4 = 1600, then 50 x 4 = 200, then 3 x 4 = 12. Add them all together to get 1812 . If both numbers have more than one digit, you can break them into parts. Each digit has to be multiplied by each other digit, so it can be tough to keep track of it all. 34 x 12 = (34 x 10) + (34 x 2), which you can break down further into (30 x 10) + (4 x 10) + (30 x 2) + (4 x 2) = 300 + 40 + 60 + 8 = 408 ."

      "content": "Simplify problems with numbers ending in zero. If the numbers end in zeroes, you can ignore them until the end—just add them on later! Here’s a more detailed breakdown: [5] X Research source Addition: If all numbers have zeroes at the end, you can ignore the zeroes they have in common and restore them at the end. 850 + 120 → 85 + 12 = 97, then restore the shared zero: 970 . Subtraction works the same way: 1000 - 700 → 10 - 7 = 3, then restore the two shared zeroes to get 300 . Notice that you can only remove the two zeroes the numbers have in common, and must keep the third zero in 1000. Multiplication: Ignore all the zeroes, then restore each one individually. 3000 x 50 → 3 x 5 = 15, then restore all four zeroes to get 150,000. Division: Remove all shared zeroes, and the answer will be the same. 60,000 ÷ 12,000 = 60 ÷ 12 = 5 . Don't add any zeroes back on."

      "title": "Combine numbers between 11 and 19.",
      "content": "Combine numbers between 11 and 19. This fast multiplication trick is best for solving problems for numbers 11 through 19. It may seem a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll be adding long equations in your head in no time! Here’s what you have to do: [6] X Research source Let’s start with the equation 13 x 15 . Subtract 10 from the second number, then add your answer to the first: 15 - 10 = 5, and 13 + 5 = 18. Multiply your answer by ten: 18 x 10 = 180. Next, subtract 10 from both sides and multiply the results: 3 x 5 = 15. Add your two answers together to get the final answer: 180 + 15 = 195 . Careful with smaller numbers! For 13 x 8, you start with \"8 - 10 = -2\", then \"13 + -2 = 11\". If it's hard to work with negative numbers in your head, try a different method for problems like this. For larger numbers, it’s easier to use a \"base number\" like 20 or 30 instead of 10. If you try this, make sure you use that number everywhere that 10 is used above. [7] X Research source For example, for 21 x 24, you start by adding 21 + 4 to get 25. Now multiply 25 by 20 (instead of 10) to get 500, and add 1 x 4 = 4 to get 504."

      "content": "Multiply two-digit numbers by 11 with addition. This is called the 11s trick, and it can be super handy. All you have to do is add the two digits together, then put the result in between the original digits. Here’s an example: [8] X Research source What is 72 x 11? Add the two digits together: 7 + 2 = 9. Put the answer in between the original digits: 72 x 11 = 792. If the sum is more than 10, place only the final digit and carry the one: 57 x 11 = 627, because 5 + 7 = 12. The 2 goes in the middle, and the 1 gets added to the 5 to make 6."

      "title": "Play around with percentage signs to make problems easier.",
      "content": "Play around with percentage signs to make problems easier. Some percentages are easier to calculate in your head than others. Because of this, it may be easier to swap which number in the problem has the percentage sign or play around with decimal signs. Here are some ways to quickly calculate percentages in your head: [9] X Research source Say you need to find 79% of 10. 79% of 10 is the same as 10% of 79. This is true of any two numbers. If you can't find the answer to a percentage problem, try switching it around. To find 10% of a number, move the decimal one place to the left (10% of 65 is 6.5). To find 1% of a number, move the decimal two places to the left (1% of 65 is 0.65). Use these rules for 10% and 1% to help you with more difficult percentages. For example, 5% is ½ of 10%, so 5% of 80 = (10% of 80) x ½ = 8 x ½ = 4. Break percentages into easier parts: 30% of 900 = (10% of 900) x 3 = 90 x 3 = 270."

      "title": "Memorize square charts.",
      "content": "Memorize square charts. Square charts give you a new way to multiply. Memorizing your multiplication tables from 1 to 9 makes single-digit multiplication automatic. But for larger numbers, instead of trying to memorize hundreds of answers, memorize just the squares instead (each number times itself). With a little extra work, you can use these squares to find the answer to other problems. We recommend memorizing the squares from 1 to 20. [10] X Research source To multiply two numbers, first find their average (the number exactly between them). For example, the average of 18 and 14 is 16. Square this answer. Once you’ve memorized the squares chart, you'll know that 16 x 16 is 256. Next, look at the difference between the original numbers and their average : 18 - 16 = 2. (Always use a positive number here.) Square this number as well: 2 x 2 = 4. To get your final answer, take the first square and subtract the second : 256 - 4 = 252."

Here’s how: To multiply by 5, instead multiply by 10 and then divide by 2. To multiply by 4, double the number and then double it again. For 8, 16, 32 (or even higher powers of 2), keep doubling. For example, 13 x 8 = 13 x 2 x 2 x 2, so double 13 three times: 13 → 26 → 52 → 104 ."

For example, if you read the equation 6 + 4 and know the answer immediately, you’ve done mental math! [11] X Research source There are different levels of mental math. Everyone does basic mental math day to day (counting money, figuring out sale prices, etc.), but some individuals challenge themselves to solve complex math problems mentally. Does mental math take long? It depends on the problem! Simple addition or subtraction problems can take seconds, while a lengthy multiplication or division problem may take longer to think through. What are the benefits? Being able to do mental math can help you in everyday situations, whether that’s quickly solving a problem on a test or calculating how much your groceries cost."
