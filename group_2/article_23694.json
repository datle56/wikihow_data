Spend some time on your favorite activities and let yourself enjoy them wholeheartedly. It's good for you. Make time to enjoy at least one thing every day. Even on a busy day, perhaps you can enjoy a cup of coffee or a nice warm shower.

      "content": "Experience tough emotions, deal with them, and let them fade. Being a positive person doesn't mean hiding from the negatives. Instead, take a moment to acknowledge your feeling and then think about what could help you feel better. It's okay to approach someone if you need practical help or just a listening ear. Try saying \"I'm going through something right now. Is now a good time to talk about it with you?\" Let out tough feelings (in a safe and respectful way, of course) and then ask yourself what would help you feel better right now. Remember, difficult feelings are a way of alerting us to problems that we need to resolve. They can show us opportunities for improvement. Investigating and working through these feelings can lead to very positive results."

Instead, focus on what they are saying, and when it is your turn to respond, take two seconds before you're answering. [11] X Research source For example, if someone is telling a story about hiking with their dog, do not think of a story of you hiking with your own doggie as they are speaking.

      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. When you are engaged in a conversation, ask questions that require an expanded response, instead of a one-word response. Make the question applicable to the ongoing conversation. For example, ask someone about a movie, when she found time to travel or what did actually happen in the situation. Open ended questions force people to extensively speak, which carries the conversation further. Ask questions about the person you are talking to. Everyone likes to talk about themselves, and the easiest way to become charismatic, is to be the person to which others can boast about themselves with. If you are meeting someone for the first time, ask them about their goals, their journey to their career choice or their significant other. If you know a person well enough to avoid those “ice-breaker” questions, ask about the trip they recently took or how their significant other is feeling."

Validating and reflecting back their feelings helps them feel like you're paying attention and caring about what they have to say. Instead of imposing your own feelings or view, make room for how they feel and let them know you're hearing them. If someone comes to you with a problem, focus on listening and validating before you try to offer solutions. This helps them feel that you understand what they're going through. Don't try to tell someone how to feel, such as saying \"cheer up!\" or \"calm down!\" This can have the opposite effect, since people may feel like they aren't being heard. Instead, listen and validate first. This can help them process their feelings and begin to move forward. [12] X Research source"

If you see a person not participating, try asking a question and going around in a circle to give everyone the opportunity to speak.

For example, you could thank someone for noticing your hard work and add that this work project couldn't have been done without the help of your colleagues. This kind of response shows that you are proud of your work, but not boastful. Walk the line between excessive humility and too little of it. Your goal should be to tell the truth respectfully. Don't pretend that you didn't contribute anything meaningful when you did, and don't oversell your work or ignore others' contributions. [16] X Research source By having appropriately humble responses and giving credit where credit is due, you begin to show and your character as a gracious and appreciate person. Reader Poll: We asked 641 wikiHow readers about what communication skills most attract them to someone, and only 5% named assertiveness as the most appealing trait.
