[1] X Research source If your WHOOP 4.0 is left in water for too long or past a certain pressure, it will be damaged. The WHOOP sensor is tested to the standard of IP68 (Ingress Protection code). This code measures a device's ability to resist liquid and dust. IP68 is the next-to-best water and dust resistance rating, second to IP69-rated devices. The difference is that IP69 devices also offer protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water jets.
