      "content": "Éros (ἔρως) Éros describes the physical love and sexual desire of a romantic relationship. It’s also linked to ideas like lust and pleasure that can result in a loss of control due to primal urges. The Greek word is the root of the modern word “erotic,” and it’s associated with Éros, the Greek god of carnal non-platonic love and fertility. [3] X Research source Examples of éros: The characters of Romeo and Juliet in Shakespeare’s play are examples of 2 lovers who are experiencing éros.

      "title": "Philia (φιλία)",
      "content": "Philia (φιλία) Philia is associated with the non-physical love found in a true friendship. It still focuses on affectionate love between friends, along with acts of kindness and goodwill. The Greek philosopher Plato believed in the idea of love without physical attraction, which is where the term “platonic” comes from. [6] X Research source Philia is associated with the Greek daimon or supernatural being named Philotes, who embodied both friendship and affection. Examples of philia: You can experience philia with your good friends, favorite work colleagues, or family members you’re close to. Philia is also present in a mentor-mentee relationship because it involves respect and love between two people. How to celebrate philia: Honor the concept of philia by being there for your friends. Practice active listening, show them support, and cherish all the good memories you share. Xenia falls under philia, because it speaks to a “guest friendship” or “hospitality.” The idea includes treating guests in your home (whether strangers or not) as good friends by sheltering them, feeding them, and showing hospitality.

      "title": "Storge (στοργή)",
      "content": "Storge (στοργή) Storge is focused on love between family members, especially the love shared between a parent and child. Though storge and philia are sometimes thought of as similar types of love , storge is considered to be a more unconditional type of love than philia. It comes from the Proto-European “-sterg,” meaning “to cover or protect.” Storage can also refer to a love for one’s country. [8] X Research source Examples of storge: Storge includes kind acts between family members like doing chores for your parents, taking your child to their extracurricular activities, or calling your grandparents to see how they’re doing. How to celebrate storge: Send a care package to a family member, call up your sibling when you haven’t spoken to them in a while, or make a family keepsake album to give out at a family reunion."

In Greek mythology, Mania is the personification of madness, insanity, and frenzy. [9] X Research source The word “mania” is also the root for the modern idea of being “manic.” [10] X Research source Examples of mania: If you’re experiencing mania, you might constantly check your significant other’s phone or social media accounts, show jealousy or insecurity if they’re not always in touch, or get angry whenever they spend time with other people. [11] X Research source How to celebrate mania: Unlike the other types of Greek love, mania is something you might want to avoid instead of celebrate. If you do experience mania, it’s best to keep it focused on harmless “loves” like your favorite musical artist, movie, or series."

How to celebrate ludus: Connect to your sense of ludus by keeping feelings you have about someone else light and fun.

A relationship that is built on pragma prioritizes shared interests, along with a sense of duty and what is best for the couple as a whole.

      "content": "Philautia (φιλαυτία) Philautia is the Greek concept of self-love. It connects to the idea that you aren’t able to love someone else until you can truly love yourself. It’s about finding the self-confidence to grow as a person in your relationships with others. An extreme version of philautia can be seen in the Greek myth about Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection. Philautia is composed of the Greek “philéō,” meaning \"I love\", and “autós,” meaning \"self.” [14] X Research source Examples of philautia: You can exhibit positive qualities of philautia by having a good self-image, feeling comfortable in your own skin, and taking pride in your accomplishments.

      "content": "Agápē appears in several verses of the New Testament. It describes the qualities of patience, kindness, and the ability to bear all things that agápē symbolizes. Within Christianity, it’s considered a good example of selflessness and sacrifice, often associated with biblical stories. Some Bible verses about agápē follow: [15] X Research source “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.” — John 13:34 “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” — 1 Corinthians 13 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” — John 3:16 “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” — Romans 5:8 “Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” — 1 John 4:8"

      "content": "Storge is mainly referenced as “astorgos,” or the lack of familial love. Storge itself doesn’t appear in the Bible, but concepts of love for one’s family do exist throughout. Also, “astorgos” and “philostorgos” both appear as examples of what happens when biblical figures lack affection and love for their family. [17] X Research source “Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.” — Romans 12:10 “They have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.”— Romans 1:31 “Without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good.” — 2 Timothy 3:3"

      "content": "Éros is a symbol of love and marriage in the Song of Solomon. Though marriage appears throughout the Song of Solomon, éros doesn’t appear directly in any biblical verse. The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) includes different forms of éros in the Book of Proverbs. The following biblical passages also talk about eros as it applies to marriage: [18] X Research source “Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.” — 1 Corinthians 7:5 “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.” — Hebrews 13:4"

      "title": "The New Testament of the Bible was written in Greek.",
      "content": "The New Testament of the Bible was written in Greek. It was written in Greek and not Aramaic or Hebrew, so the message of the Bible could better reach a far-reaching gentile (non-Jewish) audience. At that time, Greek was the most known spoken and written language in the Mediterranean world; today, learning ancient Greek is a task that could still prove very fulfilling. Some believe that Jesus Christ sometimes spoke Greek when he used the words agápē and phileo in the Bible. [19] X Research source"
