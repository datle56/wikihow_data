Add rosy cream blush and highlighter to create a healthy, flushed look. Finish up with 1-2 coats of mascara . [2] X Research source If you like wearing lip color, try a red matte lipstick or lip stain for a sexy pout . [3] X Research source If you prefer to skip lip color, apply a little lip gloss to draw attention to your lips. If you use a holographic lip gloss that is very sticky, apply it lightly. You can apply it throughout the day. If you are out all day, you can take it with you and apply it three times a day, like in the morning, midday, and night."
