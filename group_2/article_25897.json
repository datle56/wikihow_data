      "title": "Park your car on a flat surface before you start installing the seat.",
      "content": "Park your car on a flat surface before you start installing the seat. If you have an inclined driveway or live on a sloped road, drive your vehicle to a flatter location. If your car is parked at an incline, your car seat will automatically be sloped and angled improperly, which could be dangerous for your infant or young child, regardless of their age. [1] X Research source Babies lack the muscle strength to hold their heads up properly, so they need constant support and cushioning for their heads. If your car seat isn’t level, your baby could tip forward and have difficulty breathing. If your driveway or neighborhood isn’t flat, try visiting a nearby park, parking lot, or other area to level the base of your car seat."

      "content": "Arrange the seat base in the center of your car seat. Choose where you want your car seat to go, then place the base in the center of that seat. If you have a front-facing car seat, lean it against the vehicle’s backrest. If you have a rear-facing car seat, turn the item 180 degrees so it’s angled towards the back of the front passenger or driver’s seat. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. government agency responsible for writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Go to source Double-check your user manual for specific instructions on how to position your car seat model. If you have a front-facing car seat, consider placing it behind the driver’s seat. [3] X Research source If your seat is rear-facing, try putting it behind the front passenger seat. [4] X Research source Above all else, consult your user’s manual to see if there’s a recommended placement for your seat."

      "content": "Check your car seat base to see if it’s reclined at the right angle. Check the outer border of your seat base to find a thin, curved or rectangular leveling tool. This type of device is attached to all car seats, and lets you know if your seat is too inclined or reclined. If you can’t find this device on your own car seat base, please consult your user manual for help. [6] X Research source Some seat have a color dial that indicates the proper angle of the base. Other products may have arrows pointing to the correct recline angle, some other label that indicates the correct angle for your seat, and many products will have a ball style level indicator to achieve the proper angle. [7] X Research source Don’t worry if your seat isn’t reclined correctly at first; once you level and position the seat, your seat should be in a more stable position."

      "title": "Anchor the seat’s backing tether over the car’s neck rest for much easier access.",
      "content": "Anchor the seat’s backing tether over the car’s neck rest for much easier access. Find a thick strap with a hook or buckle that’s attached to the backrest of the car seat. If possible, thread this tether strap beneath your vehicle’s neck rest. If your car’s neck rests aren’t adjustable, strap the tether over the neck rest instead of under it. Behind this neck rest, look for a bracket or anchor point on the ledge behind the passenger seats. To secure the tether into place, attach the hook or buckle to this anchor point. [8] X Research source Seat tethers work best in sedans or other 5-seat vehicles."

      "content": "Attach your seat’s anchor hooks to the anchor point of the car. Search along the back of your portable car seat to find 2 thick, hooked straps dangling from each side. While holding 1 of these hooks, use your hands to pry between the backrest and seat cushion of your vehicle’s seat. Feel around in this gap until you find a rectangular bracket, or lower anchor. Open the clip and loop it onto the lower anchor point of the larger seat. Once you’ve completed this step, attach the other anchor hook to the second anchor point beneath the seat in your vehicle. [9] X Research source Anchor hooks only support a certain amount of weight. Check your car seat’s user manual to see how much weight the individual seat can hold. If you’re transporting a larger, non-infantile child, you might be able to use the seat belt instead of the anchor hooks. Some manuals may recommend that you secure the anchor hooks before installing the seat itself. Be sure to double-check this before installing the actual seat. Check your car seat label and vehicle owner’s manual for specific lower anchor weight limits."

Next, grip the seat belt with 1 hand, then pull the belt forward to loosen it. After this, you can release the belt, letting it tighten completely against the vehicle’s car seat.

Check your car seat’s instruction guide to see if your seat needs additional support when placed in the actual vehicle. While some rear-facing seats accommodate for the gap between the car seat and the vehicle itself, your seat might need a little extra support. If the user manual calls for it, try to stack about 1-3 pool noodles or a rolled-up towel along the seam of the passenger seat, if this feature is not supported. [12] X Research source Some car seat brands like Chicco or Diono forbid the use of pool noodles or towels with their seats, while other brands like Clek allow towels and/or blankets only."
