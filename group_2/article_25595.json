If you have a special title, like Mr., Mrs., Dr., or General, make sure to include that too. [1] X Research source For example, you might write “General John Doe” or “John Doe.” A return address is your home address or the place where you’re sending the letter from.

      "content": "Add an attention line if the letter is for an individual at a company. Say you’re sending an envelope to a business’s head office. There are multiple people in an office, so you need to specify who the letter is for. Use the abbreviation “ATTN:” along with the person’s name under the business or company's name. For instance, if the envelope is being sent to a company named Big Corporation X but is for a Bob Smith, you’d write “ATTN: Bob Smith” under the first line of the mailing address or company name. This helps ensure that your letter winds up in the correct person’s hands instead of getting lost in a company’s mail room."

[8] X Research source For instance, say you want to send a letter to your aunt, who is staying with your grandma for a few months. Write your aunt's name on the first line and your grandma's name on the second line after “c/o.” If you’re applying for a job, address the envelope to the head of the hiring committee, but include the name of the administrative assistant handling applications after “c/o”: “c/o John Smith.”"

For example, the final line in the mailing address may be, “McEwen, TN 37101.” Some people prefer using a ZIP+4 code when sending letters to avoid possible errors in delivery, as the extra 4 numbers identify specific geographic regions like city blocks. To find a ZIP+4 code, use the USPS’s ZIP code finder .

[11] X Research source Replace the state with “AA” (Armed Forces of the Americas), “AE” (Armed Forces of Europe), or “AP” (Armed Forces of the Pacific), and use a ZIP+4 code. [12] X Research source For instance, the first line may read, “PFC Harry Dobson,” with the second line being, “45th ENG 2nd PLT - B CO,” and the third, “APO AE 34566-2367.” Use USPS’s APO/FPO/DPO Restrictions tool to search for military ZIP codes."
