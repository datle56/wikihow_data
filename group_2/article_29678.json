Some hardware stores may even cut the PVC pipe you’ll need for this project to length as a free service or for a minor fee. [1] X Research source You need a 3 in (7.6 cm) wide PVC pipe that's 14 inches (36 cm) long and a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) PVC pipe that is 4 feet (1.2 m) long. Only use schedule 40-80 PVC pipe. Schedule refers to the thickness of the pipe's walls. Pipe thinner than schedule 40 will be unsafe and could burst under high pressure. [2] X Research source This build will create a potato gun that fires 1.5 in (3.8 cm) baby potatoes. If you want to craft a huge potato cannon that fires russets and Yukon golds, go up at 1–1.5 in (2.5–3.8 cm) for each PVC pipe you use (i.e. use a 3 in (7.6 cm) barrel instead of a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) barrel)."

Use a felt tipped marker to mark the PVC at the following lengths so they’re ready to be cut: [3] X Research source 3 in (7.6 cm) wide PVC marked at least 14 inches (36 cm) in length. This will be your ignition chamber. 1.5 in (3.8 cm) wide PVC marked at least 4 feet (1.2 m) in length. This is going to be the barrel."

      "content": "Cut the PVC pipes along the marks you made using a hacksaw . Clamp the pipes down to a work bench or have someone hold the pipe on a flat surface as you saw. The cuts don’t need to be perfect. Use a hacksaw to trim your PVC to size. Once you’re finished, remove plastic burrs by rubbing the cut edges with a medium-grit sandpaper . [4] X Research source If you don’t have a hacksaw, you can use a PVC pipe cutter , handsaw, or miter saw. If you don’t have sandpaper, you can clean up the burrs at the cut edges using a utility knife."

Spread PVC glue around the outside of your main chamber at one end using the applicator on the glue or cement lid. Twist a 3 in (7.6 cm) PVC female adapter over the area you glued. Then, screw a PVC plug into the adapter. [6] X Research source When you glue the PVC pieces together, hold them together firmly for at least 60 seconds so the glue bonds. Twist each glue joint a quarter-turn as you are pushing it together. This will encourage a better seal. Whenever you apply PVC glue or cement, use a clean towel to wipe away any excess glue. The section you’re assembling will be the very back of the launcher."

      "content": "Wait 24 hours for the PVC cement to harden and cure. If you use your potato launcher before the PVC glue has enough time to harden, the launcher may fall apart when you pull the ignition. Explosive force in the combustion chamber puts stress on the PVC, so the glue must be completely and totally dry. [10] X Research source You can keep working and add the spark generator or ignition in 2-3 hours, just don’t fire the gun right away."

      "title": "Drill holes in the combustion chamber for your ignition.",
      "content": "Drill holes in the combustion chamber for your ignition. You can use a spark generator or a BBQ ignition switch for the ignition mechanism. Basically, these devices create an electrical arc when you press a button. Use a drill and pilot bits to drive holes into the back 1/3 of your 3 in (7.6 cm) chamber near the plug. The holes must be large enough to fit the sparking components of your generator, but not so big they slide around inside the chamber. [11] X Research source You can buy a spark generator or BBQ ignition online or at a local hardware store. Most generators may have two prongs, or a single double-pronged extension. Many generators require spark-emitting prongs to be within 2 ⁄ 5 inch (1.0 cm) of each other. Alternative: If you don’t want to mess around with an electrical switch, drill a hole in the chamber big enough for a long lighter. You can manually light each shot this way if you prefer."

Use electrical tape to pin the cable in the opening so it hangs in the center of the chamber. Then, hook the leads from the spark generator up to the trigger (if necessary). [12] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Do not use duct tape. Duct tape is conductive and may catch on fire. Only use electrical tape for this. You can use electrical putty instead of electrical tape if you prefer. Connect positive leads (+) to positive terminals on the generator and negative leads ( - ) to the negative terminals if they aren’t already pre-wired. Once the leads and terminals are attached, prevent accidental shocks by covering any bare wiring or components with electrical tape. Check your spark generator by unscrewing the PVC plug from the female adapter. While looking inside the combustion chamber, press the generator trigger several times. If you see a spark, it works."

      "content": "Tape or glue the ignition switch to the outside of the chamber. You can place the switch itself wherever you’d like so long as it doesn’t pull on the wiring. Once you find a comfortable location for the trigger, tightly wrap it to the chamber with electrical tape or glue it in place. [13] X Research source Where you put the switch should be informed by how you plan on holding the potato gun. Most users either: Mount the gun on their dominant shoulder to make aiming easier. Hold the gun against their hip to minimize kickback. Take a knee and brace the gun against the ground or their knee."

You can also use a stick to push it further down. Then, unscrew the cap that’s plugging up the female adaptor at the back of the chamber. [14] X Research source If you keep dropping potatoes into the chamber, drive a small screw into the base of the barrel. This will keep potatoes from falling into the chamber."

Spray the hairspray into the chamber for about 4-7 seconds and your launcher is “loaded” and ready to go. Screw the plug quickly and take aim. [15] X Research source Too much propellant is as bad as not enough. If there’s not enough oxygen, ignition will not occur. Use trial and error to determine how much propellant is right for you."

This will force the potato out the barrel of the launcher. Now it’s time for target practice!

Improper or reckless usage could cause harm or property damage. You can seriously maim or injure someone with your potato gun. It’s just as dangerous as a real weapon, so don’t treat it like a toy.
