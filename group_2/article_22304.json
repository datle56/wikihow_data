A pancreas-friendly diet should consist of plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans and lentils, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and lean meats. Eating small, frequent meals may also help speed your recovery. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Dark, leafy vegetables, blueberries, sweet potatoes, carrots, grapes, and walnuts are especially beneficial. Try to include animal-based omega-3 fats, like salmon, into your diet. [2] X Research source Garlic and probiotic-rich foods, such as yogurt, can help reduce inflammation and aid digestion. Eating a Mediterranean diet is a great way to help speed your pancreas’ recovery. Try to eat 6-8 small meals that are high in protein a day instead of 3 large meals.
