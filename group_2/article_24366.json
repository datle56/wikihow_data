      "title": "Tell your parents about your boyfriend’s interests.",
      "content": "Tell your parents about your boyfriend’s interests. Your parents will also be meeting a new person, so give them a heads up by telling them a little bit about your boyfriend. You don’t have to go into too much detail, but letting them know what he does for work and a little bit about his lifestyle will give your parents an idea of what to talk to him about as well. [4] X Research source If your boyfriend has any interests that line up with your parents’, make sure to mention those.

      "title": "Help your boyfriend pick out a nice outfit.",
      "content": "Help your boyfriend pick out a nice outfit. If your parents are formal or traditional, tell your boyfriend to wear a button down shirt and some nice pants. If they are more laid back, you can tell your boyfriend to wear jeans and a nice t-shirt. Ask him to dress based on what you think your parents will appreciate. [5] X Research source Don’t tell him to dress up too much - a full suit is probably too formal for a casual dinner. Try saying, “I know you want to make a good impression on my parents. Maybe you could wear one of your nice shirts to dinner, since I think they’d appreciate that.” Reader Poll: We asked 1307 wikiHow readers how they usually dress for a first meeting with their partner's parents, and only 6% of them said they like to wear something that makes a statement . [Take Poll] This may be too bold for most people, who prefer to wear something that’s put together, comfortable, and represents them in the best way possible."

      "content": "Reassure your boyfriend that everything will be okay. Encourage him to not feel nervous, worried, or freaked out. Explain that your parents are excited to meet him, that they've heard a lot of good things about him and that they're lovely people whom he'll like. [6] X Research source Try to be understanding if your boyfriend is super nervous. It’s always scary to meet new people, especially if they are people that your partner loves and respects. Calm your boyfriend down by saying things like, “My parents just want to get to know who I’m dating,” and, “I’ve told them a lot of great things about you, so they’re excited to meet you!”"

      "content": "Introduce him to your parents one on one, rather than at a family event. Meeting your significant other’s parents is a nerve wracking task on its own. Try to schedule a time to meet when there won’t be a ton of other people around, like a family event or party. A one on one meeting will give your boyfriend and your parents a better chance to talk and get to know each other. [7] X Research source This will probably also help lessen your boyfriend’s anxiety about meeting your parents, if he has any."

Offer to bring side dishes or drinks to a meal that they cook. Introducing your boyfriend at your parents’ house will feel more one on one than a public place. [8] X Research source Float the idea to your parents by saying, “I’d love to get together at your guys’ house so that we can all get to know each other. We can bring some drinks if you don’t mind cooking!” Try not to make a big deal out of the meeting. Instead of hosting a big, high-pressure family dinner, keep the meet-up fairly relaxed.

      "content": "Do an activity together so that you have something to focus on. If you want to take the pressure off of the conversation, try going out and doing an activity with your parents and your boyfriend, like bowling or mini golf. This gives the outing a goal and will create a bond between all of you as you work toward a similar goal. [11] X Research source Doing an activity together also gives your meeting a timeline and lets you leave once the activity is done."

Zack and I love to hike together.” ”Mom, have you read any good books lately? I just finished a great one, and I’d love to tell you about it.” ”Zack loves to work on computers.

      "title": "Let your parents ask your boyfriend questions.",
      "content": "Let your parents ask your boyfriend questions. It can be hard to let your parents interrogate your boyfriend, but the goal is to let everyone get to know each other. Let your parents ask your boyfriend about what he does and what his goals are in life. Only step in and change the subject if your parents start asking inappropriate questions that make your boyfriend uncomfortable. [14] X Research source Questions like, “What do you do for fun?” and, “What did you go to school for?” are totally acceptable questions. Things like, “How many people have you dated before?” can make your boyfriend uncomfortable, and should be avoided. Use phrases like, “I don’t think he should have to answer that, Mom.
