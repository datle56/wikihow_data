      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. To make a SpongeBob cake, you start with three basic rectangular cakes. You then layer the cakes to create the main shape, and use fondant to decorate the cake and make the defining SpongeBob characteristics. To make the cakes, you'll need your ingredients and some kitchen supplies, including: An oven preheated to 350 F (177 C) Large and small bowl Hand mixer Sifter 3 rectangular cake pans, 7 by 11 inches (18 by 28 cm) each, greased 3 wire cooling racks"

      "title": "Cream the butter and sugar.",
      "content": "Cream the butter and sugar. Place the butter in a large mixing bowl and beat it on medium speed with the hand mixer for one to two minutes. Add the sugar and continue beating for another seven minutes. You can use a stand mixer if you don’t have a hand mixer, or a whisk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the eggs.",
      "content": "Add the eggs. Crack one egg into a small bowl, and remove any pieces of shell if they fall in. Then add the egg to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat the mixture on medium speed until fully incorporated. Repeat for the remaining eggs, adding each individually. It’s always a good idea to crack eggs into a separate bowl first, because that way pieces of shell don’t get lost in your batter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the flour and milk.",
      "content": "Add the flour and milk. Sift half the flour into the bowl with the eggs, butter, and sugar. Beat the mixture on medium speed until all the ingredients are just incorporated. Then add half the milk, and continue beating to bring the ingredients together. Sift and beat in the remaining flour, followed by the rest of the milk. To make your own self-rising flour, add 1½ teaspoons (6 g) of baking powder and ¼ teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt per cup of all-purpose flour. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the vanilla.",
      "content": "Add the vanilla. Beat the mixture for one more minute, or until all the ingredients are combined. Stop as soon as all the lumps are gone and everything is fully mixed. Overmixing the batter will develop the gluten in the flour, and this will result in a cake that’s tough and dense."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the batter and bake the cakes.",
      "content": "Pour the batter and bake the cakes. Divide the batter equally among the three greased cake pans. Tap the cake pans against a flat surface to level the batter. Transfer the cakes to the preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. The cake is ready when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. [2] X Research source If you only have one rectangular cake pan, cook the three cakes in separate batches. You can also use 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-cm) cake pans if that’s the size you have. The cake will be slightly larger and a little shorter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cool the cakes.",
      "content": "Cool the cakes. When the cakes are ready, remove them from the oven and set them aside to cool for 10 minutes. Then turn the cakes out onto the wire cooling racks, and let them cool to room temperature, about one to two hours. [3] X Research source While you're waiting for the cakes to cool, you can make your frosting and fondant. If you try to frost the cake when it’s still hot, the frosting will melt."

    {
      "title": "Melt the marshmallows.",
      "content": "Melt the marshmallows. Make a double boiler by setting a large glass bowl into a medium saucepan filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Add the marshmallows and water to the bowl and heat the double boiler over medium heat. Stir regularly as the marshmallows melt, continuing until they're fully melted and smooth. You can also use a proper double boiler if you have one. Make sure the water isn't touching the bottom of the glass bowl. If an inch of water is too much, pour out some water, otherwise the marshmallows may burn."

    {
      "title": "Add the candy melts.",
      "content": "Add the candy melts. Once the marshmallows are fully melted, remove the double boiler from the heat. Place the bowl onto a heat-proof surface or mat. Pour in the candy melts while the marshmallow is still warm, and stir until they're completely melted and incorporated. The candy melts will make the fondant firmer and more elastic, and will prevent it from drying out too quickly."

      "title": "Make the dough.",
      "content": "Make the dough. Combine the sugar and marshmallow mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until all the sugar has been incorporated. Then turn the dough out onto a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar. Knead the mixture until it comes together as a soft, sticky dough. When you're first mixing the sugar and marshmallows, you can use a stand or hand mixer fitted with a dough hook instead of stirring it by hand."

    {
      "title": "Rest the dough.",
      "content": "Rest the dough. Cover the dough in a thin layer of vegetable shortening. Wrap the dough tightly in a layer of plastic wrap. Place the dough into a sealable plastic bag, push out all the air, and seal the bag. Then transfer the dough to the fridge and let it rest for at least four hours. Let the dough rest for as long as possible, ideally overnight."

      "title": "Divide the fondant.",
      "content": "Divide the fondant. After the dough has had time to relax, remove it from the fridge and allow it to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour. Then, with a sharp knife, divide the fondant into five sections: Cut the fondant in half and set one half aside for the yellow body. Divide the other half of the dough into three equal portions. Set two of those aside for the brown and white accents. With the remaining portion of dough, divide that in half again. This will be for the red and blue accents."

      "title": "Color the fondant.",
      "content": "Color the fondant. Place the largest portion of fondant onto a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar. Add 10 drops of yellow gel food coloring and knead the color into the dough to distribute it evenly. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired shade of yellow. Repeat with the smaller sections of dough and the remaining colors, adding food coloring in five-drop increments. Be sure to wipe down the counter between colors to avoid cross-contamination. For the white portion of dough, simply leave it the color of the original fondant."

      "title": "Color the frosting.",
      "content": "Color the frosting. Most of the frosting will be used to layer the cakes and to act as a glue for the fondant, but you also need some black frosting for different accents on the cake. Remove one-quarter of the frosting and place it into a separate bowl. Add five drops of black food coloring to the small portion of frosting, and beat to distribute the color. Add more color as necessary to achieve a black frosting."

      "title": "Frost the cakes.",
      "content": "Frost the cakes. When you’ve assembled the three layers of cake, spread a layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake. Smooth out the surface of the frosting so the fondant will have an even surface to stick to. Place the cake into the fridge and let the frosting rest for about 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the cake from the fridge and orient it so the rectangle is lengthwise (vertical) in front of you on your work surface."

      "content": "Make the yellow SpongeBob body. Turn the yellow fondant out onto a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar. Use a rolling pin to roll the fondant out into a rectangle that’s one-eighth inch (0.3 cm) thick. Carefully pick up the fondant and lay it over the top three-quarters of the cake. Starting at the center of the cake, gently press the fondant down, molding it to the top and sides of the cake. When you get to the base of the cake, use a pizza cutter to trim off the excess. Then press the edges of the fondant into the base of the cake. Set the remaining yellow fondant aside for the nose and cheeks."

      "content": "Make the brown pants. Roll out the brown fondant in the same way that you did the yellow. Use a pizza cutter to trim the top edge off the fondant in a straight line. This will be the waistline on SpongeBob’s pants. Pick up the fondant and lay it over the bottom 2 inches (5 cm) of the cake. Gently press the fondant down, molding it to the top and sides of the cake. Trim the excess from around the base and set it aside."

Make sure the rectangle is at least 10 inches (25 cm) long by two inches (5 cm) wide. Use a pizza cutter to cut a 2-inch (5-cm) lengthwise strip from the white fondant. Leave the rest of the fondant rolled out. Lay the white strip onto the cake in between the brown and yellow fondant. Don’t worry if the white overlaps the yellow. Press the white fondant down into the cake gently, and press it into either side of the cake. Trim off the excess and set it aside."
