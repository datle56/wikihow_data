      "content": "Consider growing cannabis in soil before growing hydroponic pot. Growing plants hydroponically is a bit more complicated than growing them in soil. You’ll need to purchase special equipment, and you’ll have to optimize your hydroponic garden for nutrients, light, and ventilation. If you’re new to growing weed, consider growing it the old-fashioned way first, then switch to hydroponic gardening. [1] X Research source If you can’t grow pot in soil for whatever reason, you can still grow it first hydroponically. Consider growing other plants hydroponically before doing so with marijuana. This will help you become comfortable with hydroponic gardening. For instance, try growing hydroponic tomatoes , or create your own hydroponic mushroom garden ."

      "content": "Choose a closet or small room for growing, then paint the walls white. The white paint makes the walls more reflective. This increases photosynthesis, which helps your plants grow. You can also cover the walls with metal foil, though this is not as reflective as clean white paint."

Hang the lights from a bar, like the kind found in a closet, or clamp them onto something nearby that is the right height. [2] X Research source Use clamp lamps for simplicity. These come with built-in CFL sockets and don’t require extra wiring or electrical work. Their housing also helps reflect as much light as possible. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Give your plants at least 7,000 lumens/ft 2 (75,000/m 2 ) of light. The brightness of light is measured in lumens per square foot (or square meter). The ideal brightness for a standard grow operation is 7,000-10,000 lumens per ft 2 (75,000-107,000 lumens per m 2 ). To figure out how many lumens per square foot you're working with, simply divide the total lumens by the total square feet. Say you're working with two 300-watt CFLs—each with 40,000 lumens—in a 3' x 3' x 2' area. Your total lumens is 80,000 and your total footage is 18'. 80,000 ÷ 18 ≈ 4,400 lumens per square foot. To convert to square meters, multiply the number of lumens per square foot by 10.7. The absolute minimum needed to grow average-sized plants is around 3,000 lumens per square foot (32,000 lumens per square meter). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your growing room between 73 °F (23 °C) and 80 °F (27 °C). This prevents your plants from overheating. Avoid burning or overheating your plants with your light source. Having sufficient light helps your marijuana grow tall, healthy, and potent. The maximum allowable temperature is 90 °F (32 °C). If the temperature gets too low, add a small heater to generate additional heat. If the temperature gets too high, add a fan to ventilate the space."

      "content": "Add fans to ventilate your growing room. Proper ventilation is absolutely necessary for vibrant plants. If your grow room is in a closet, for example, there's not much more that you can do other than an oscillating fan . In a box, however, adding a duct system is efficient for many home growers. To make a duct system, use a squirrel cage fan (it looks like a hamster wheel) attached to 6 in (15 cm) ducts to mitigate rising temperatures and pungent odors. Include an extra oscillating fan to help strengthen the stalks of the marijuana plants as they grow."

Once the seedling has started sprouting a significant root system, you transfer it into the coco coir. You can purchase rock wool blocks and coco coir online, or from your local gardening supply store."

To lower the water’s pH, add a squirt of vinegar. To raise the pH, add a pinch of baking soda. You can purchase liquid hydroponic nutrients online, or visit a gardening center. [6] X Research source Start by giving your plants nutrients at quarter strength, then gradually increase to full strength over 1-2 weeks. Excess nutrients may hurt your plant. This system is a type of “passive” hydroponic farming. Unlike “active” hydroponic systems, it doesn’t require special equipment for pumping water to give nutrients to your plants. Passive hydroponic systems are easy to set up and maintain, but building an active hydroponic system may produce larger crop yields."

      "content": "Keep the coco coir moist with pH-balanced, nutrient-filled water. Do this whenever the coco noir starts to feel dry to the touch. The plants will absorb water more quickly as they grow. Therefore, you may only need to water them every couple of days when they're small, and once a day towards the end of the plant's flowering cycle, when they’re fully grown. Ensure that at least a little extra run-off water comes out the bottom of the container whenever you water your plants to ensure that unused nutrients don't build up in your medium. Coco coir is very forgiving if you accidentally over or under-water your plant, but make sure to adjust your watering schedule accordingly if you notice your plant's leaves are wilting or drooping."

If growing in a closet, keep your plants in the vegetative stage until they're 6-18 inches (15-45 cm) tall. Your marijuana has two major growth phases after it's a seedling—the vegetative and flowering stages. During the vegetative stage, your marijuana plants are only worried about growing and getting big. Keep your plants in the vegetative stage by giving them 18-24 hours of light a day. This simulates summer, when the days are long. The height of the plant is often the main factor when determining how long to keep your marijuana plants in the vegetative stage. Your plant can double its height in the flowering stage, so make sure to keep the plant in the vegetative stage until it's about half its desired final height."

Female plants grow white hairs, while males grow grape-like balls that eventually become pollen sacs. Discard the male plants. Males pollinate females, causing females to start diverting energy from THC production into seed growth. To maximize the amount of bud you get, remove any male plants so they don't pollinate your females."

Don’t add the nutrient mixture anymore, or you may actually be able to taste the nutrients in your final buds. Toward the end of your plant's flowering cycle, you may notice that some of the oldest leaves start turning yellow and falling off. This is totally normal and is a sign that your plant is taking nitrogen out of the leaves and putting them into the buds/flowers. This signals that your plants are almost ready to be harvested. Stop giving your plants nutrients with their water for the last 1-2 weeks to ensure the best possible taste of your final bud."

Alternatively, you can wait until the trichomes (also known as crystals or resin glands) are either all white/milky or half white and half amber. Harvesting earlier produces marijuana that induces a thoughtful, “in-your-head” high. Harvesting later provides a heavier, more relaxing marijuana experience."

Moisture may cause mold, so make sure your buds are completely dried before curing them."
