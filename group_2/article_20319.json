      "content": "Practice what you will say ahead of time. Telling a friend that that he or she smells bad without hurting their feelings can be awkward, and you will need to be very tactful. Think about what you want to say to your friend, and then practice saying it to yourself or, better yet, to a trusted friend. Have the friend then tell you how your comments sounded, and if you should rephrase anything."

      "content": "Be sensitive. Sometimes, body odors can stem from personal or medical issues. Certain diseases or medications, for instance, can cause a person to smell in particular ways. Likewise, depression might cause a person to skip showers or washing his or her clothes. Since a cause such as one of these might be behind your friend’s odor, don’t phrase the problem as his or her fault. Family financial problems can also mean a person cannot afford hot water to shower or wash their clothes, or deodorant. Instead, just focus on being honest and helpful."

      "content": "Understand that body odors are individual and often culturally determined. Each person has a unique smell, which others may find agreeable or disagreeable. A person’s smell comes from a combination of biological and environmental factors, and different cultures may not react the same way to the same smell. Keep in mind that a person’s odor that you find offensive might seem perfectly fine to others. If you talk to your friend and he or she doesn’t understand why you or others find his or her odor offensive, respect your friend's feelings and don’t get angry. Just explain things so that your friend can understand."

      "content": "Decide when to talk to your friend. Since letting a friend know that he or she smells bad may be a difficult talk, you won’t just want to spring it on him or her at any old time. Choose the right moment carefully: It might be best to talk to your friend at the end of the day. [1] X Research source That way, he or she will have time to go home and be more prepared for the next day. On the other hand, you might talk to your friend at the beginning of the day, so that the problem is taken care of early. This can work especially well if you can offer a quick solution to help your friend, like deodorant or body spray."

      "title": "Talk to your friend in private.",
      "content": "Talk to your friend in private. This helps make it less embarrassing, and your friend should appreciate that you weren’t trying to call him or her out in front of others. If you can’t talk to your friend in complete privacy, at least pull him or her aside where others can’t hear, and don’t draw attention to yourselves. You might consider sending an anonymous email to your friend about the problem, if you really aren’t able to talk to him or her. However, this might not work well; your friend might think the email is a prank, for instance, or he or she might feel anxious about who sent it. The best option is usually just to talk face-to-face with your friend."

You should also let your friend know that you won’t tell others about the problem, and keep your word."

Try something like: “Your hair looks great today! But you know, there’s something else I’ve noticed. I wonder if your deodorant’s not working right….” You can also try the “positive sandwich” method, where you say something nice first, then break the bad news, then end by saying something encouraging again. After telling your friend about the odor problem, say something like “it should be really easy to take care of,” or offer another compliment."

[3] X Research source Subtle hints like saying “Wow, something smells bad!” around your friend, or leaving deodorant on his or her desk might occasionally work, but more than likely they will be overlooked. Just get to the point and be kind about it, without making jokes or seeming like you’re picking on your friend. Sometimes saying less is more. You don’t have to give a long explanation or beat around the bush. Just be clear to your friend about the problem and he or she should get it. You could start off by saying \"I just want to give you a heads up...\" or \"You may not know this...\" [4] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

If you can suggest a possible cause of your friend’s odor—even if it’s a white lie—it might help him or her feel like you’re being helpful rather than just critical.

Try saying something like: “Wow, that pizza must have been heavy on the garlic, because I can kind of smell it on you.

Offer to check how your friend smells in the future, since it can be hard to tell on one’s own. Let your friend know again that you won’t tell others, and stick to your word."
