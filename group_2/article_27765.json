    {
      "title": "Explore his body.",
      "content": "Explore his body. Once you really start kissing, you should move your hands around your man's body. Touch his shoulders, his chest, his waist, his neck, his arms, and any part of his body above the belt. And hey, as you get more comfortable, there's nothing wrong with putting your hands near his groin area to turn him on -- if you have a more intimate relationship. The important thing is to always be giving his body attention with your hands. You don't have to be frantic about it. Slowly explore his body with your hands as you move closer to him. Just remember: if all you and your boyfriend have done is kiss and you're not comfortable with doing more, then you don't have to run your hands all over his body or let him touch you everywhere. This may make him think that you're ready for something more."

      "title": "Gently bite or suck on his lips.",
      "content": "Gently bite or suck on his lips. If you're feeling adventurous and are comfortable enough with each other, then gently bite your boyfriend or suck on his lips. Remember to bite him very gently at first, and then gradually bite a little harder -- nothing will kill the mood faster than making your man bleed from the lip. Not every guy likes this move, so don't be discouraged if it turns out that this doesn't work for your man. But if he loves it, then he'll really love it."

    {
      "title": "Whisper in his ear.",
      "content": "Whisper in his ear. Words are not overrated. Whispering in your boyfriend's ear in the middle of a makeout session will give him a pleasant tingling sensation near his ear and neck, and feeling your hot breath on his ear will make him want you even more. Besides, whispering is just plain sexy -- as long as you know what to say. Keep it simple. Just say something like, \"I want you,\" \"You're such a good kisser,\" or \"You're so sexy\" will do the trick. If he does something that drives you wild, you can say, \"I love it when you...\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Kiss his neck and earlobe.",
      "content": "Kiss his neck and earlobe. It's important to mix things up and not to just kiss, kiss, kiss on the lips. After you've kissed for a few minutes, make your way down to your boyfriend's earlobes and neck. Gently kiss his ears and neck, and if he responds well, you can nibble on them a bit too. If you can master biting just enough to leave a sensation, then your boyfriend will go wild if you can really nibble on his ears and neck. You can also kiss his neck and lick it a tiny bit, and then blow on it to make your man shiver."

    {
      "title": "Play with his hair.",
      "content": "Play with his hair. The head is one of the most sensitive parts of the body, so don't ignore it. Run your hands through your boyfriend's hair, gently caress his strands, and continue to play with his hair as you're kissing or when you're taking breaks. Locking eyes while you play with his hair works great, too. Just gently caress his strands as you sift through them with your hands. Basically, you should always find something to do with your hands instead of keeping them on your lap, so if you need a break from exploring his body, touch his hair, and vice versa."

    {
      "title": "Straddle him.",
      "content": "Straddle him. Guys love it when you take control and straddle them in the middle of a makeout session. Before you do this, you should make sure that things are already hot and heavy, and that you're touching each other and sitting in a comfortable place, like a couch, or standing near a chair, so that you can comfortably straddle him without breaking up the action too much. [1] X Research source Straddle him while you're kissing and put your arms around his neck. This is not recommended for a first makeout -- you should definitely be comfortable with your boyfriend and your expectations of him before you try this!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Suck on his finger.",
      "content": "Suck on his finger. If you and your boyfriend are really comfortable with each other, then don't be afraid to suck on his finger while you lock eyes, just for a second or two. This innuendo will be all you need to really turn your boyfriend on, and to show that you're having fun and comfortable enough with yourself to try something new and a little adventurous. [2] X Research source Don't overdo this move. Just once per makeout session will suffice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep mixing things up.",
      "content": "Keep mixing things up. Whatever you're doing, just remember to mix it up from time to time. Don't keep straddling your boyfriend, kissing his neck, whispering in his ear, or doing whatever it is you like to do. You'll need to switch things up, from the position of your body, to the style of your kisses. You can kiss him just on the lips, French kiss him, kiss him while gently nibbling his lip, kiss other parts of his body, or do all of the above, as long as you keep things fresh. Don't get stuck just French kissing without moving your arms or changing positions. That can get old fast."

    {
      "title": "Let him know how much you liked it.",
      "content": "Let him know how much you liked it. Don't be afraid to smile afterwards and show him that you enjoyed the make-out session. Gently kiss him on the lips, stroke his hair, or just tell him how much you like him afterwards, so he feels confident and knows that you really like hooking up with him. You don't have to be too modest, or pretend the makeout didn't happen. In fact, it's hot to acknowledge it. Give him a playful smile and say, \"That was fun.\""

      "title": "Find a comfortable, safe, suitable place.",
      "content": "Find a comfortable, safe, suitable place. Seriously. You won't be in the mood if you're in the parking lot of a Wendy's. Go down to a dark basement with only the glow of the television lighting your bodies or find a hidden cove in a park, where the thought of getting caught gets you in the mood even more. Even the back of a car will do in a pinch. Really, going wherever you need to go to to feel like making out will do the trick. You should both also be feeling comfortable. No stress, no pressure, no where to go, and ready to hook up."

    {
      "title": "Soften your lips.",
      "content": "Soften your lips. To make your boyfriend love making out with you even more, soften your lips with balm, or just lick them. You can even do this fifteen minutes before you start to make out, so he is more excited and pays more attention to your lips. Just don't lay on the gloss too thick or he'll taste it when he's kissing you. If you're putting on thick or scented lip gloss, do it at least an hour or two before you plan to make out."

      "title": "Flirt",
      "content": "Flirt . Let your boyfriend know that you're in the mood. Show him that you are enjoying the date and having fun. Be playful , but bring him closer to you. Tease him by lightly pushing him, squeezing his shoulder, touching his leg or arm, making cute jokes, or just by playing with your hair and making him want you even more. You can't just transition from hanging out to kissing -- you'll need to flirt a bit to get him in the mood first. Compliment your man a little while you're flirting. Let him know he looks good. Eye contact is another way of flirting. If you are turning away or looking down, the guy is not going to feel that you are really in the moment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull him closer to you.",
      "content": "Pull him closer to you. Let him know that he doesn't have all of the control. He'll be wowed that you took the initiative instead of waiting for him to make the first move. This will be a huge relief to most guys, who like to take a break from trying to take control of a situation. Grab him, give him a cute smile, and pull him closer until you've locked eyes and are touching bodies. Maintain eye contact as you pull him closer to you -- along with control."

    {
      "title": "Tease",
      "content": "Tease him. Don't give it up too easily. Move in almost all the way and then let him meet you the last 10% of the go around. Pausing the action for just a second will make him stop, take stock of how excited he is, and want you even more. Then, wait for him to pull you closer and start with a soft, gentle kiss without getting too sloppy. As you get more comfortable, use a little tongue, until you're full-on French kissing. Don't jam your tongue into his mouth right away. At first, move just the tip of your tongue into his mouth, until you've both moved your tongues into each other's mouths and are gently moving them in a circular motion, or with one on top of the other."
