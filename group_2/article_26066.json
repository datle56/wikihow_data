      "title": "Full Lips",
      "content": "Full Lips Full lips are the biggest and most prominent lip shape you can have: they’re large, wide set, and have a plump and pouty look to them. This lip type is equally full on the top and bottom, leaving a well-rounded and smooch-worthy impression! Full lips are one of the most desirable types according to modern beauty standards, but you can still accentuate their fullness for maximum impact. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pro Tips to Enhance Full Lips: Ritzman recommends applying “a lip liner that matches your lipstick to define the edges. Then, apply a bold lipstick to emphasize the fullness.” If you want some added dimension, “highlight the center of the lips with a lighter shade of lipstick or gloss.” Celebrities with Full Lips: Angelina Jolie, Kerry Washington, Scarlett Johansson."

      "title": "Round Lips",
      "content": "Round Lips Round lips are relatively easy to spot because they look like a perfect circle. If your lips are about an equal distance from side to side and top to bottom, then you probably have round lips! Round lips can be smaller or larger, but they’ll always have that distinctive “O-shape.” [2] X Research source The shape of a round lip is highly desirable, but they can sometimes lack dimension, which is why we’ve provided some expert tips to add more definition to your round lips. Pro Tips to Enhance Round Lips: “Outline the lips with a liner to create a more defined shape,” instructs Ritzman. Then, “use matte lipsticks to prevent the lips from looking too full, and finish with a bit of highlighter on the Cupid’s bow to enhance the shape.” Celebrities with Round Lips: Drew Barrymore, Adele, Dascha Polanco."

    {
      "title": "Wide Lips",
      "content": "Wide Lips Wide lips have a contrast between their length and fullness, which sets them apart from round lips (think oval instead of circle or rectangle instead of square). If you have wide lips, the distance between the tip of your Cupid’s bow and the underside of your bottom lip will be significantly shorter than the distance between the corners of your mouth. While there’s nothing wrong with wide lips and a big smile, there are some makeup tricks you can use to balance them out a bit and increase their fullness. Pro Tips to Enhance Wide Lips: According to Ritzman, the best way to enhance wide lips is to “overline the top and bottom of your lips but avoid the corners. [Use] nude shades with matte textures [to help] balance the lips with your facial features.” Celebrities with Wide Lips: Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Barbara Palvin."

      "title": "Fuller Upper Lip",
      "content": "Fuller Upper Lip Most people have a top or bottom lip that’s a bit fuller than the other one. If the top lip is slightly heavier than the bottom lip, it’ll likely feel pretty prominent on the face and feature a generous cupid’s bow. When doing your makeup, you can either accentuate your Cupid’s bow to really play up the fullness of your upper lip, or try some makeup tips to make your lips look more balanced. Pro Tips to Enhance Fuller Upper Lips: Balance out your lips by “using a darker shade on the upper lip and a lighter shade on the lower lip to create balance,” advises Ritzman. For a more prominent look, “apply white lip liner to the center of the lower lip.” Celebrities with Full Upper Lips: Cara Delevigne, Liv Tyler, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fuller Lower Lip",
      "content": "Fuller Lower Lip If your top lip is significantly smaller or thinner than your bottom lip, this is called having a heavy lower lip. If this lip shape sounds like you, you’re probably known for having a considerably pouty appearance! A full lower lip can be really stunning on its own, but you can also try to enhance the top lip for a more proportionate look. [3] X Research source Pro Tips to Enhance Fuller Lower Lips: Ritzman recommends “lining the natural lip line of the bottom lip, [but lining] slightly above the top lip’s line. Then, highlight the Cupid’s bow for added emphasis on the upper lip.” Celebrities with Full Lower Lips: Adriana Lima, Rihanna, Salma Hayek."

      "title": "Narrow or Thin Lips",
      "content": "Narrow or Thin Lips Thin or narrow lips typically have slim top and bottom lips. Your lips probably aren’t the first feature on your face that most people notice—but that doesn’t mean they don’t look great! You may have a less-defined lip line, along with an air of elegance and refinement. [4] X Research source While current beauty standards usually advertise fuller lips, there’s nothing wrong with having smaller lips—that said, there are some tricks you can use to make your lips look bigger if you prefer a fuller look. Pro Tips to Enhance Narrow or Thin Lips: If you want to make your narrow or thin lips look larger, “overline the lips slightly with a lip liner, just outside your natural lip line,” advises Ritzman. “Use lighter shades of lipstick to make your lips appear fuller, and apply gloss to the center of the lips for a plumping effect.” Celebrities with Narrow or Thin Lips: Kate Middleton, Gwyneth Paltrow, Karlie Kloss."

      "title": "Downturned Lips",
      "content": "Downturned Lips Downturned lips feature a downward slant towards the corners of the mouth. This lip shape can be genetic, but some people also develop a downturned lip shape as they age and the sides of their mouth lose elasticity. [5] X Research source While downturned lips can definitely give off a sensual, pouty expression, you can also make them look more up-turned with some makeup hacks. Pro Tips to Enhance Downturned Lips: “Use a lip liner to slightly uplift the corners of the mouth,” says Ritzman, “and apply lipstick with an upward motion to enhance the uplifted look. Then, highlight the center of the upper lip to draw attention away from the corners.” Celebrities with Downturned Lips: Natalie Portman, Emma Stone, Rose Leslie."

      "title": "Heart-Shaped Lips",
      "content": "Heart-Shaped Lips A defined Cupid’s bow is what gives the heart-shaped lips their distinctive cutesy shape. A prominent V-shaped Cupid’s bow resembles the top of a classic cartoony love heart. Then, because heart-shaped lips are generally fuller than they are wide and diminish in volume as you move to the corners of the lip, the final effect is a naturally pursed, pouty, heart-shaped lip. [6] X Research source Pro Tips to Enhance Heart-Shaped Lips: Ritzman suggests “emphasizing the Cupid’s bow with a highlighter, then using a darker shade on the top lip and a lighter shade on the bottom to balance the proportions.” To finish off the pout, “apply gloss to the bottom lip for a fuller look.” Celebrities with Heart-Shaped Lips: Taylor Swift, Amanda Seyfried, Gal Gadot."

    {
      "title": "Bow-Shaped Lips",
      "content": "Bow-Shaped Lips Rather than the heart-shaped lip’s deep-V, a bow-shaped lip features a delicate, U-shaped ridge in the center. Their Cupid’s bow looks like, well, a bow! This aptly named and archery-inspired shape is typically fuller in the middle than at the sides, similar to the heart-shaped lip type. Pro Tips to Enhance Bow-Shaped Lips: To enhance the coveted bow-shaped lip, Ritzman recommends “highlighting the natural curves with a lip liner and using a lip brush to apply lipstick precisely. Finally, add a bit of gloss to the center of both lips to accentuate the shape.” Celebrities with Bow-Shaped Lips: Marilyn Monroe, Katy Perry, Madelyn Cline."

      "content": "Examine your key lip shape features in a mirror. If you’re not sure what your lip shape is, grab a mirror and look closely at your lips. Note any defining features or characteristics, like a particularly full bottom lip or a well-defined Cupid’s bow. It may help to ask yourself the following questions to narrow down which pout-worthy lip type you have: Is your top or bottom lip more prominent than the other? If your top and bottom lips are not equal in shape or size, then you have a fuller upper or fuller lower lip shape. Are your lips wider than they are full? If the distance between the corners of your mouth is longer or more prominent than the length and dimension between your top and bottom lips, then you likely have wide lips. If your lips are equally full and wide, you have round lips. Does your Cupid’s bow have a defined heart or bow shape? If your Cupid’s bow has a defined V-shape at the center of your top lip, you have heart-shaped lips. If you have a wave- or U-like shape at the center of the top lip, you have bow-shaped lips. Do the corners of your mouth point downwards? If the corners of your lips point downwards (when you’re not smiling), you have a downturned lip shape."

Every pair of lips is unique, but comparing your lips to a visual representation of the most generic lip shapes may help you find yours. Take a look at a lip shape chart and see which lips look most like yours. If you’re not sure, ask a close friend or loved one who may be more objective (and spend more time looking at your lips!). Keep in mind that, while your lips may most resemble one particular lip shape, your unique lips can be a combination of multiple types and features. For example, you could have thin lips that are also downturned or round lips that also have a bow shape."

If you want to try out a different lip shape for a special night out (or your everyday look!), Ritzman affirms that all you need is makeup: “Accentuating your lips can be achieved through makeup techniques and products, giving you fuller, more defined lips without the need for surgery.” So, if you’re wanting to get great lips but aren’t sure where to start, try these makeup tips to achieve the most sought-after lip shapes: Natural lips: Enhance your natural shape with a nude lip liner traced just along the outline of your lips. Heart-shaped lips: Get this romantic and pouty shape by defining your Cupid’s bow with a lip liner, then applying a sexy red or flirty pink lipstick that’s concentrated at the center of your lips. [7] X Research source Russian lips: Achieve these doll-like lips with a pronounced Cupid’s bow by using dark liner on the outer corners and lighter liner toward the center. Recreate this same gradient with lipstick to achieve a full and even look. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Puffy lips: If you want to look like an influencer with trendy pillow lips, combine a matte lipstick with lip liner in the exact same shade.

      "content": "Identify your face shape and which lip shape best complements it. Even when you get a non-surgical or surgical enhancement to your lips, you still need to do some thinking about what lip shape will best complement your facial features. Lip filler isn’t one size fits all! Start by determining your face shape if you don’t know it already, then read below to find out which lip injection shape works best with your face: [10] X Research source Oval faces are well-balanced and defined by a slight taper. They can handle a variety of lip shapes and sizes. Round faces are wide across the cheekbones, so they benefit from lip shapes that elongate their face, e.g., a more pronounced Cupid’s bow or fuller center. Square faces feature a wide jawline and forehead, which can be softened with lip filler that adds volume to the center of the lips to create a rounded appearance. Heart-shaped faces combine a wide forehead with a narrow jaw, and they typically have a well-defined Cupid’s bow. Look for an injection shape that balances the lower lip with the upper lip. Diamond faces have a narrow forehead and jawline and may benefit from lip injections that add volume to the sides of their lips. Keep in mind that your other facial features and proportions may affect how lip filler looks on you, so don’t choose your lips based solely on your face shape."

However, while some studies suggest that lip exercises can increase blood flow to the lips and build up the surrounding muscles, there’s almost no evidence to prove that these exercises can change your lip shape. But you can still try them out and see if they work for you! Start with one of the most common lip exercises—the smile and kiss: [21] X Research source Close your mouth and smile with your lips pressed gently together. Hold the smile for five seconds. Then, pucker your lips (as if going for a kiss!). Imagine that you’re trying to touch the corners of your mouth with your puckered lips, and continue this action in the most exaggerated way possible. Relax for five seconds, then repeat this exercise 10 times. Perform the entire set at least once daily."
