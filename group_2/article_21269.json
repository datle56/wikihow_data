      "title": "Start eggplant seeds indoors 6-9 weeks before the last frost is expected.",
      "content": "Start eggplant seeds indoors 6-9 weeks before the last frost is expected. Eggplants need warmth, so it is best to start them indoors and transplant them once the weather is warm enough. Aim to germinate the seeds 6-9 weeks before the last frost of the year is predicted. Eggplants should not be re-planted outdoors until the temperature is at least 70 °F (21 °C). [1] X Research source If you don't wish to plan ahead this way, you can purchase eggplant seedlings directly from a gardening center or nursery."

      "title": "Soak the seeds overnight before germinating them.",
      "content": "Soak the seeds overnight before germinating them. Eggplant seeds have a better chance of growing if they are soaked thoroughly before planting. Place the seeds in a small container and completely cover them with water. Let the seeds sit overnight, then drain the water. [2] X Research source Eggplant seedlings grow best in 72- and 128-cell trays, which have large seed containers that accommodate root growth.

      "content": "Fill seed trays with a fine, loose growing medium. For the best results, germinate eggplant seeds in a soil-less growing medium. Fill seed trays 3/4 full with the growing medium of your choice. Vermiculite, perlite, coconut husk, and compost are all good options. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant the seeds 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) deep and moisten the medium. Using your fingers, push 1-2 eggplant seeds into the growing medium in each individual seed container. Make sure that the seeds are about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) under the surface of the growing medium. Cover over the seeds and mist or sprinkle water onto the surface. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the seeds germinate for 5-14 days.",
      "content": "Let the seeds germinate for 5-14 days. Eggplants seeds will grow as soon as 5 days or in as long as 2 weeks, depending on the temperature they are kept at. Warmer temperatures will spur a quicker germination period. Try to maintain a temperature of at least 65 °F (18 °C) for your eggplant seeds while they are germinating."

      "content": "Transplant the seedlings into pots when they reach 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall. When the seedlings are large enough they should be given their own individual pots. Fill small pots with the same growing medium you used to start the seeds and dig small holes to insert the seedlings. Gently remove each seedling from the growing tray and replant them in their new pots. [6] X Research source The potted seedlings should be kept indoors until the outdoor temperature reaches at least 70 °F (21 °C)."

      "content": "Choose a spot in your garden that gets full sunlight. Eggplants require very high temperatures to grow and thrive in a garden. Ideally, choose a spot that gets sun for more than 6 hours per day to plant your eggplants. If this is not possible, plant eggplants in a spot that get only partial shade. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a test to see if your soil is well-drained. Eggplant grows best in healthy, well-drained soil. Find out what condition your soil is in by digging a hole that is approximately 12–18 inches (30–46 cm) deep and 12–18 inches (30–46 cm) wide, then fill the hole with water. If the water pools and takes longer than an hour to soak in, your soil is poorly-drained. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Fix poorly drained soil by adding an organic soil amendment. Use a gardening rake to loosen the top 8 in (20 cm) of your soil. Pour a 2 in (5.1 cm) layer of organic soil amendment on top of the soil. Use the rake to mix it into the soil evenly. Purchase organic soil amendment materials, such as sand, vermiculite, perlite, or compost, at a local garden center or hardware store."

      "content": "Plant seedlings 24–30 inches (61–76 cm) apart, root-deep. Eggplants do best when they have room to spread and grow. Dig holes slightly larger than your seedlings' roots, spaced 24–30 inches (61–76 cm) in all directions. Gently place the seedlings in the holes and fill the space around their roots with soil.

      "content": "Place mulch material around the base of your plants. Mulching will help prevent the growth of weeds and keep your plants warm. Straw, compost, and grass clipping are good choices for natural mulch materials. Scatter them around the base of your eggplant seedlings in a thick layer. [10] X Research source Be sure to use grass clipping from untreated lawns, as chemicals and fertilizers may harm your plants. Layer at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of mulch to protect your plants."

      "content": "Stake your plants to hold them up as they grow. Use bamboo sticks or other suitable stakes to hold up your plants. Insert the stakes into the soil about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from each seedling. As the plants grow, they will lean onto the stakes and won't disturb any surrounding plants. [11] X Research source Insert the stakes right away after transplanting your seedlings to avoid disturbing the soil later on."

      "title": "Water eggplants thoroughly once a week.",
      "content": "Water eggplants thoroughly once a week. To thrive, eggplant need at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. Aim for one weekly, intensive watering rather that multiple, short watering sessions. Frequent watering promotes shallow roots, which can compromise the durability of your eggplants."

Check the upper and lower leaves of your eggplants for these bugs and remove them by hand. Destroy the bugs to keep them from returning or reproducing. [12] X Research source If you are overwhelmed with flea beetles during the growing season, destroy your plants and cultivate the soil in the spring to destroy any larvae that may remain there."

Row covers are long pieces of mesh material that cover plants and offer them protection. Lay row covers over your eggplants and fold over the edges on each side. Use a rubber mallet to hammer garden pegs through the folded edges of the material to secure it. [13] X Research source Lift the row covers to water your eggplants, and remove them completely when it's time to harvest. Purchase row covers at garden centers or online."

At the 16 week mark, start checking your eggplant crops to see if they are ready for harvesting. When the skin is shiny, cut off eggplants near the stem with sharp pruning shears. [14] X Research source Eggplants will keep for 2 weeks if you refrigerate them."
