      "title": "Stack and fold 2 sheets of standard paper in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Stack and fold 2 sheets of standard paper in half lengthwise. Take 2 sheets of standard 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) white printer paper and place them on top of each other so the edges are lined up. Fold the stack of papers in half lengthwise and use your fingers to make a strong crease. [1] X Research source Make sure the edges stay even when you fold the papers. Using 2 sheets will make the spearhead sturdy enough to keep its shape. You could also use 2 sheets of cardstock or construction paper to make the spear even sturdier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the paper in half again to make a strong crease.",
      "content": "Fold the paper in half again to make a strong crease. Take the paper and make another fold in the same lengthwise direction. Use your hands to press down on the fold and make a strong crease. Then, open up the fold to reveal the crease in the center. [2] X Research source Only unfold the paper once. Don’t undo the first fold you made."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the top 2 corners down and align them with the crease.",
      "content": "Bring the top 2 corners down and align them with the crease. Take 1 of the top corners of the paper and fold it down toward the crease in the center. Line up the edge of the fold so it’s parallel to the crease. Then, fold the other corner down the same way so the 2 corners form a triangle at the top of the paper. [3] X Research source The end of the paper will resemble an arrow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Align the bottom corners of the triangle with the crease.",
      "content": "Align the bottom corners of the triangle with the crease. Look at the triangle formed at the top of the folded paper and find the 2 bottom corners on the outer edges. Fold them in towards the center so the edges are parallel with the crease. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom corners to the crease leaving 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom corners to the crease leaving 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space. Bring in the bottom 2 corners similarly to the way you folded the top 2 corners of the paper. Leave a small space between the edge of the folds and the crease. [5] X Research source The small space will create a pocket to hold your spear shaft."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the outer edges and fold them into the crease.",
      "content": "Take the outer edges and fold them into the crease. Bring in the outer edge of 1 side of the spearhead and line it up with the center crease. Then, fold in the other edge to the center crease as well. [6] X Research source The paper will look just like a spearhead. Make sure you fold both sides of the paper in evenly by lining them up with the center crease."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply clear tape over the crease and tip of the spear to hold it together.",
      "content": "Apply clear tape over the crease and tip of the spear to hold it together. Take a strip of clear tape and apply it over the crease in the center to keep it from unfolding. Then, take another strip of tape and wrap it around the tip of the spear to give it some support. [7] X Research source If you don’t have clear clear tape, you can use duct tape or any other kind of tape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll a sheet of paper up along the long edge to form a tube.",
      "content": "Roll a sheet of paper up along the long edge to form a tube. Take another sheet of standard 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) paper and lay it flat on a table or desk. Start rolling it tightly along the long edge and keep rolling it up until you form a tube. [8] X Research source The tighter you can roll the tube, the sturdier the spear shaft will be. You could also use thicker cardstock or construction paper to make the spear shaft even stronger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap clear tape around the upper, middle, and lower sections of the tube.",
      "content": "Wrap clear tape around the upper, middle, and lower sections of the tube. Keep the tube gently pinched in the center so it doesn’t unravel. Wrap a strip of tape around the center as well as the upper and lower portions to keep the tube held together. [9] X Research source Place the tape about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) from each end of the tube."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the tube into the opening at the bottom of the spearhead.",
      "content": "Slide the tube into the opening at the bottom of the spearhead. Gently squeeze the bottom of the spearhead to open up the pocket in the fold. Slide the spear shaft all of the way into the spearhead to connect them. [10] X Research source Push the tube as far as it will go into the spearhead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap tape around where the spearhead meets the shaft.",
      "content": "Wrap tape around where the spearhead meets the shaft. Take a strip of clear tape and wrap it around where the shaft and the spearhead meet to secure keep them connected. Add as much tape as you need to keep the shaft securely attached. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Paint the spearhead and shaft if you want to add some color.",
      "content": "Paint the spearhead and shaft if you want to add some color. Use a small paintbrush to paint the spearhead with a gray or metallic acrylic paint and the shaft with a brown, wooden paint color if you want to make it look more realistic. You could also paint your paper spear a wacky color such as red and yellow. Paint the spear however you want!"
