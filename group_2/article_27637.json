[2] X Research source Try to put out as many valuable, high-demand items as you are willing to let go. Good items to sell include CDs, DVDs, books, musical instruments, collectable toys, electronic equipment (computers, tablets, televisions, speakers, etc.), smartphones, video games, jewellery, clothing, shoes, and unused gift cards. Make sure your items are in decent condition. People look for bargains, but they don't want somebody else's dirty, dusty stuff. Set reasonable prices. People expect things to be cheap at garage sales. While $2-3 are the average price for old books, toys, and souvenirs, $25-50 are fair for electronics or jewellery."
