[4] X Expert Source Adrian Klaphaak, CPCC Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 December 2018. These are the beliefs that shape how you think about yourself, others, and the world around you. They are fundamental to your way of approaching life. Taking some time to identify your values will help you decide whether aspects of your life are strengths or weaknesses to you, regardless of what others may feel about them. Think about a few people you respect. What do you admire about them? What traits do they possess that you value? How do you see these in your own life? Imagine you could change one thing about your community. What would it be? Why? What do you think that shows about what's most important to you? Remember a moment in your life where you felt very satisfied or fulfilled. What was that moment? What happened? Who were you with? Why did you feel that way? Imagine that your house is on fire (but all pets and people are safe) and you can save just 3 objects. What would you save, and why?"

[5] X Research source For example, perhaps you value Ambition and Competition, but you feel stuck at a dead-end job where you're never challenged or given an opportunity to prove yourself. You might feel that you have a weakness in this area because your life isn't currently aligned with what's very important to you. Or perhaps you are a new mother who really wants to go back to your job as a teacher because you value Intellectual Status. You might feel that \"being a good mom\" is a weakness because your value (of achieving Intellectual Status) appears to conflict with another value (Family-Orientedness). In this case, you can figure out how to balance your values so that you honor both. Wanting to go back to your job doesn't mean you don't also want to enjoy your new child."

For example, multiple people in your life told you that you handle things well under pressure, are good in a crisis, and can help manage other people in stressful situations.

If you took control and acted as a leader, you probably feel that courage and being able to handle these situations is a strength.

Or do you tend to absorb, think, and then react in those situations? Remember that any strength you might have developed can sometimes have tradeoffs. If you spend most of your life alone reading and writing, for example, you might not be as apt at small talk as other people, but you will probably have a knack for finding the plot of a book and discussing deep topics with others. You also may have grown up with younger siblings, which means you may be compassionate, patient, and good at diffusing situations. It’s important to keep in mind that the world needs many different people with different types of strengths and interests in order to be as diverse as it is. You don’t necessarily need to be good at everything, just at what you consider important for yourself. The person who rattles off a brilliant comeback or who solves a problem quickly may have quick-wittedness as a strength, and perhaps focus on fine detail as a weakness.

In reality, people really aren’t weak, even though we might really feel or think this way at times. However, most people feel that they could be stronger in certain areas in their lives, their skill sets, and other areas. Since they feel they are not as strong in those areas, it’s common to assign the opposite to describe when we feel we need to work on an area to feel stronger and competent. Instead of focusing on \"weakness,\" which has a negative feel to it, think about your areas for growth or improvement -- this keeps you focused on the future and what you can do to get better. Weaknesses could be conceived as something about yourself that you either have the power to improve, insofar as they are at all related to your desires, or are perhaps simply not relevant to your desires or goals in life whatsoever.

Instead, focus primarily on your strengths and try to cultivate these whenever possible. This can be a better approach then identifying personal weaknesses. Since what people typically refer to as weaknesses are often simply related to a lack of interest or desire to improve, it might be best for you to focus most on your personal strengths and desires and go from there. Be generous when you are acknowledging your strengths, because you most likely have plenty, even in areas where you feel “weak.” Then zero in on areas where you feel you can be more efficient. For example, if you want to work on becoming more assertive , first start with what assertiveness skills you feel you’re already doing. Maybe you have trouble saying no, but instead you have the ability to state your intentions in a way where your intention is understood and you can spare the feelings of the person. [19] X Research source Think about aspects of your personality that you consider strengths. Being kind, generous, open-minded, or a good listener are extremely important strengths that relate to your overall abilities that might get overlooked. Be conscious of these and take pride in them. Another way to think about strengths is to consider them talents, or innate abilities and desires that fit with your sense of self and vision for the future.

      "content": "Provide examples when talking about a strength. It's all well and good to say that you have amazing people skills, but it's another thing to show it. Illustrate what your strengths look like in real life by providing examples, either from your personal interactions or from your work history. For example: \"I am an excellent communicator. I care about the words that I use, and about avoiding ambiguity when I communicate. I'm not afraid to follow up with someone who's senior to me when I don't understand them. I take the time to imagine how different people might interpret questions or statements differently.\" You can also demonstrate your strengths and skill set by sharing what went well in the past and where you have succeeded in your efforts. If you have won any awards or acknowledgements, you can mention them too."
