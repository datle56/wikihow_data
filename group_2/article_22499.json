      "content": "Donate money or supplies to an organization that helps people. Making a donation is one of the easiest and most effective ways to help others—according to experts at award-winning humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief , “the best way to fix a problem is by funding local organizations.” However, money isn’t the only thing that you can donate to have a charitable impact—you may even have some unused items sitting around your home that could go to someone in need. Here are some ideas of what you could donate to help out others: Donate money to a vetted organization that supports a cause you care about. Donate unneeded furniture and clothing to a shelter for people experiencing homelessness or a charitable organization like Goodwill . Donate food items (like unopened spices, canned soups, and canned tuna) to a food bank like Feeding America , a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending hunger in the U.S. Donate toys to local shelters, food banks, childcare centers, or organizations like Toys for Tots . Donate school supplies, furniture, and technological items to schools, either directly or through a platform like Donors Choose . Donate your birthday and holiday gifts by asking your loved ones to redirect them to charity. Feeding America offers birthday fundraiser opportunities to help you turn your personal celebration into community good. Donate your car to a nonprofit or charity like Vehicles for Veterans . Donate your hair to Locks of Love . Donate your blood, if you can, to an organization like the Red Cross . Thoroughly research an organization with the help of legitimate websites like the Better Business Bureau , Charity Watch , or the Federal Trade Commission before donating. As Direct Relief explains, “you work hard for your money and ought to feel confident that—when you’re feeling generous—your money is doing as much good as it possibly can.”"

      "content": "Participate in local or online fundraising efforts. If you don’t have the money or goods to donate yourself, assist in fundraising resources from the people who do. Offer to help with fundraising for a local organization or business, or set up your own fundraiser for a cause you care about. You can also spread the word about online fundraisers by sharing posts on social media. So, the next time you see a GoFundMe or other virtual donation opportunity, just click “Share!” “If you have any kind of specialized skill set,” consider organizing a fundraiser around that skill, suggests Direct Relief. If you play video games, for example, “live-streaming has really emerged as an incredible way for people to come together with very little overhead and raise a lot for a cause.” If you have an AirBnB, continues Direct Relief, you can “host families and evacuees.” Or, if you own a business, you can “create registries with lists of needed items,” invite your customers to purchase them, and then give the purchased items to those in need. If you have children, encourage them to set up their own fundraising efforts! Describing some of the successful fundraisers that they’ve seen children host, Direct Relief shares how “they’ve had kids create lemonade stands, bake sales, or donate their Christmas money. Kids find some pretty incredible ways to support causes, and it reinvigorates everyone’s belief.”"

      "content": "Volunteer at a local food pantry or other charity organization. One of the best ways to make an impact in your local community is to volunteer with an initiative, organization, or charity that operates in your area. Consider volunteering to organize donated goods at a food pantry , work in a soup kitchen , or help out at a homeless shelter. [1] X Research source You can volunteer with these organizations year-round or join up in the aftermath of a specific event. For instance, if a town is affected by a hurricane, they often need volunteers to pack and deliver donated supplies or help rebuild houses. You can also support local initiatives that address the root causes of issues that lead to poverty, homelessness, domestic violence, and more. For instance, you could campaign door-to-door for a local environmental organization or advocate for an educational program that serves underprivileged youth."

You can also opt for a heartfelt, handwritten card , which can be just as touching and meaningful as a gift package.

All of us experience moments in life where we need a little bit more support, and it’s sometimes difficult to know when the people in your life are feeling lonely, isolated, or unappreciated. In order to help out those in need of some company or emotional support, check in periodically on your friends, neighbors, and family members—especially those who are elderly, live alone, or are experiencing grief. Even if they don’t explicitly need something from you, you’ll still likely brighten their day! [6] X Research source If you check in on someone and they do express a need for emotional support , the best thing to do is to empathetically and actively listen to what they’re going through. Hear them out without judgment and express that you’re there for whatever they need. Moving forward, consider ways that you could actively but unobtrusively help them . For instance, maybe you set up a weekly nature walk or movie date to make them feel more connected. If they seem harried or overwhelmed, offer to run their errands for them or babysit their child. If you know someone who’s experiencing severe mental health struggles—such as depression or suicidal ideation, check in on them often and do everything you can to make sure they’re getting the help they need. Encourage them to visit a therapist, if they can, or to call a crisis hotline. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

[8] X Research source To help combat these issues, continue volunteering for or donating to initiatives that support healthcare access and mental health support, like Planned Parenthood or the National Hotline for Mental Health Crises and Suicide Prevention .

Even the smallest acts of kindness and goodwill can help out people as they go about their day-to-day lives. Go out of your way to treat people with kindness and patience— be polite to service staff, smile at people passing by, and be empathetic toward those that may be having a tougher day than you. Stop when you see someone who seems to need assistance and intervene when you see something that doesn’t seem right to you—like a kid or dog sitting in a hot car."

There’s nothing wrong with deciding to help out others in a reactive way—for instance, donating money in response to a current emergency like a natural disaster , epidemic, or political conflict . However, it’s equally (if not more) important to consistently and proactively practice the skills and seek out the opportunities to help others . For example, consider getting trained in CPR and first aid skills so that you’ll be ready to help out others when needed. [10] X Research source"

It can be difficult to know exactly how to begin actively helping others, especially if you want to get directly involved in your local community. “It’s important that you think about what matters to you,” according to Direct Relief, so start by considering your own passions : what issues and circumstances are you most passionate about helping with? If you’re more passionate about the work you’re doing, your motivation and impact are likely to be stronger and more meaningful—as developmental psychologist Dr. Leslie Bosch affirms, “You’ll get out of it what you put into it.” Then, reach out to community leaders, friends, and family members who may have ideas for how you can help. Tell them about the ways in which you’d like to begin helping others and see if they have any suggestions or connections. Remember that helping others doesn’t need to include novel ideas or grand gestures. Start with the simple things like holding the door for someone or offering a genuine compliment ."

      "content": "A range of systemic issues and disparities can cause people to be in need. Countless people all over the world struggle with daily and ongoing hardships, often due to systemic and infrastructural issues that lead to a lack of access to human needs and rights. While it’s important to help people when they’re in need, it’s also important to address the root causes of that need so that fewer people will encounter that situation in the future. Here are just a few of the common issues that lead to people needing support: Extreme Poverty: Nearly 700 million people live on less than $2.15 a day, which is the official definition of extreme poverty . These people are often unable to access basic necessities like food, clean water, and shelter. Without having these basic needs met, those in extreme poverty often lack adequate nutrition, education, and health services, making it nearly impossible to escape the cycle of poverty . [12] X Research source Lack of Mental Health Support: 1 in 4 people are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and those experiencing poverty are more heavily affected than others. Due to stigma and lack of access when it comes to mental health care, many cannot and do not get the support they need and experience long-term consequences like lower earning potential and increased social isolation. [13] X Trustworthy Source World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization Go to source Housing Instability: Homelessness (or houselessness) is a major issue worldwide with the rising cost of housing, lack of affordable housing, widespread financial instability, and unchallenged discrimination and domestic abuse. Homeless shelters are often at capacity or without the resources to accommodate more people, and these individuals will struggle to find employment or access education without access to stable housing. [14] X Research source Health Disparities: Adequate and affordable healthcare is still out of reach for many people across the globe—even in some of the world’s wealthiest countries. Limited access to healthcare services, nutritious food, and clean water makes it more likely for an individual to contract diseases, and the fact that individuals without healthcare access are typically from low-income communities means that they may remain entrenched in a cycle of need.

It’s generous and unselfish to support others even when it’s inconvenient for you or takes away from your own time, energy, or resources. However, said help should only be somewhat inconvenient or reasonably take away from your own time and resources. Helping others shouldn’t put you in the position of someone in need.
