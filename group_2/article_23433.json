      "title": "Be aware of your risk.",
      "content": "Be aware of your risk. Although anyone can get ringworm, certain people are more prone to developing the infection. You are more likely to develop ringworm if you: Are younger than 15 years of age Reside in a humid, damp, or crowded place Come into close contact with a person or animal infected with ringworm Share clothing, bedding, or towels with a person who has ringworm Take part in sports that include skin-to-skin contact such as wrestling Wear tight clothing Have a weakened immune system"

      "title": "Watch for a scaly patches.",
      "content": "Watch for a scaly patches. In most cases, ringworm starts as a flat and scaly patch of skin. As the infection progresses, the scaly patch may grow in size. Be aware that ringworm of the scalp often starts as a small sore that looks like a pimple. Keep an eye on the spot to see how it develops. [2] X Research source Notice patches by running your fingers over the skin to see if it feels scaly. Your skin patch may also be slightly matte in color from the scales. Watch the patch to see if it develops further or gets itchy, which may indicate ringworm. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching any skin you suspect may be infected with ringworm. This can keep it from spreading to other parts of your body."

    {
      "title": "Look at the patch border.",
      "content": "Look at the patch border. Scaly skin may have a raised border that expands outward as the infection spreads on your skin. The patch will form a roughly circular ring, hence the name ringworm. Be aware that the basic contours of the scaly or infected patch will be circular, but may also appear to be wavy like the outline of a snake or worm. You may also have several rings that interconnect with one another. See if you have any patchy and itchy areas in your groin or on your feet that are not circular in shape. These areas may both be signs of a fungal infection more commonly known as jock itch and athlete’s foot. [3] X Research source Check the color of the border and see if it is a darker red than the inside of the patch. This is often a good indication of a ringworm infection."

    {
      "title": "Examine the inside of the patch.",
      "content": "Examine the inside of the patch. The external and internal areas of most ringworm infections have different textures or appearances. Check the internal area of the patch for the following signs, which can indicate ringworm: Blisters Oozing [4] X Research source Scattered red bumps Scales of skin A clear appearance Bald spots or broken hair on the scalp [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a topical antifungal lotion or cream.",
      "content": "Use a topical antifungal lotion or cream. Mild cases of ringworm often respond to the application of an antifungal lotion. These preparations can relieve symptoms such as itching and kill the infection. Get a topical antifungal treatment such as clotrimazole or terbinafine at a local pharmacy or medical supply store. Follow the packaging instructions or any by your doctor to treat the infection. These treatments work by making the cell wall of the fungus unstable and causes membrane leakage. This essentially \"kills\" the infection."

      "content": "Kill ringworm with honey. Rubbing honey on to ringworm may get rid of ringworm or prevent it from recurring on your skin. It also can help relieve any inflammation associated with ringworm. Apply some warmed honey directly to your ringworm or spread a layer on a bandage and put it over the infection.

[14] X Research source Mix a solution of tea tree oil and water, using equal parts water and oil. Use this mixture for up to a week on the infection. Put a dab of lavender oil on the infection every day. Lavender oil treatments can take a bit longer — up to a month — to kill ringworm."

This is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis and your doctor can develop a sensible treatment plan to combat and prevent your ringworm. Undergo a physical exam in which your doctor will look for symptoms of ringworm. They may ask for your health history and factors such as exposure to ringworm. Ask your doctor any questions you have about ringworm or how you may have contracted it. Remember skin-to-skin contact, contact with bed linens, or an infected animal or person can spread this infection. Ensure that if anyone else in your home has the infection that they are treated as well to avoid getting reinfected after it clears."
