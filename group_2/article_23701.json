      "title": "Eat foods rich in tyrosine.",
      "content": "Eat foods rich in tyrosine. In order to make dopamine, your body needs tyrosine, which is an amino acid. When it enters your body, the amino acid travels to your brain. Once there, the neurons responsible for releasing dopamine transform it into dopamine with the help of other enzymes. The foods highest in tyrosine include cheese, fish, meat, seeds, grains, dairy, beans, and soy. As long as you're getting enough protein in your diet, you should be getting enough tyrosine. To determine how much protein you need, multiple your weight in pounds by 0.36 grams. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), you need 54 grams of protein. As an example, 0.5 cups (120 mL) of cottage cheese has 14 grams of protein, while a serving of chicken the size of your palm has about 19 grams of protein.

      "title": "Consume your daily dose of phenylalanine, which comes from protein-rich foods.",
      "content": "Consume your daily dose of phenylalanine, which comes from protein-rich foods. Tyrosine can be produced in part from phenylalanine, so eating foods rich in this amino acid can ensure you're getting enough tyrosine. In turn, that may increase dopamine. Meats, cheeses, and wheat germ are rich in this food. Artificial sweeteners also contain this amino acid. [3] X Research source You should consume at least 5 grams of phenylalanine a day, but you can eat up to 8 grams per day. As an example, 3 ounces (85 g) of many cheeses have about 1 gram of phenylalanine in them."

      "content": "Get your daily jolt of caffeine. Caffeine is one of the main ways to increase the body's use of dopamine, but use it with caution. While it doesn't increase your production of dopamine, it likely works by making more receptors available to use the dopamine your body produces. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try taking or drinking up to 300 milligrams per day. An average cup of coffee has about 100 milligrams. Keep in mind that caffeine can cause depression and fatigue once it's out of your system, which usually occurs about 6 hours after you consume it. Try not to rely too much on a caffeine boost. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Also remember that caffeine can prevent you from falling asleep, so avoid drinking it 6 hours before bed."

      "title": "Set goals and reward yourself for achieving them.",
      "content": "Set goals and reward yourself for achieving them. When you are approaching a reward, such as the achievement of a goal, your body releases dopamine. Once you set a goal, plan out small, concrete steps you can take. Each time you achieve a part of your goal by taking a step, your brain may reward you with dopamine. [6] X Research source For example, say your goal is you want to learn how to paint. You could set small goals like get supplies, set up a workstation, and practice painting 30 minutes every day."

      "title": "Spend more time in sunlight to increase your dopamine sensitivity.",
      "content": "Spend more time in sunlight to increase your dopamine sensitivity. Sunlight likely plays a role in how many dopamine receptors are available to \"catch\" the dopamine. In other words, while it doesn't increase dopamine per se, it increases the amount your system is making use of, offering similar benefits. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Spending as little as 5 to 10 minutes in the sun can help. Try taking a walk at your lunch break to get a little sunshine in."

      "title": "Practice meditation when you want to release dopamine.",
      "content": "Practice meditation when you want to release dopamine. True meditation relaxes you completely, to the point that you have less of a desire to act. In turn, your body may release dopamine in response, as a way of encouraging action. Try practicing meditation 2-3 times a day. [8] X Research source Even simple meditation like deep breathing can increase your dopamine levels. For deep breathing, try focusing on just your breathing. Breathe in to the count of 4, and then hold for 4 counts. Breathe out to the count 4. Repeat this action, focusing solely on your breathing. You can try a meditation app such as Insight Timer, Calm, or Headspace. You can follow either a guided or non-guided meditation."

      "title": "Practice gratitude and thankfulness.",
      "content": "Practice gratitude and thankfulness. Gratitude is linked to the release of dopamine in your brain. The more thankful you are, the more likely your brain is to release dopamine. Just being thankful for a good meal or something a friend just did and expressing it is a way to release dopamine. [9] X Research source You can also try keeping a gratitude journal, where you write down 5 things you're thankful for each day."

      "title": "Take levodopa to increase dopamine in the brain.",
      "content": "Take levodopa to increase dopamine in the brain. Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine, meaning it can be transformed into dopamine in the brain. Taking levodopa increases the amount of dopamine your body produces. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may be prescribed this medication by your doctor if you have a disease like Parkinson's or restless leg syndrome. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, impairment of voluntary movement, and dizziness. It can also cause hallucinations and confusion in some people."

      "title": "Discuss a dopamine agonist to increase dopamine receptors.",
      "content": "Discuss a dopamine agonist to increase dopamine receptors. While levodopa increases the amount of dopamine your body makes, dopamine agonists actually up the number of receptors to \"catch\" the dopamine. You can take this medication in place of or in addition to levodopa. [11] X Research source The 2 most commonly prescribed dopamine agonists are pramipexole and ropinirole. The main side effect of these medications is daytime sleepiness, which may even cause you to fall asleep against your will. This medication is also used for diseases like Parkinson's and restless leg syndrome."

      "title": "Try velvet bean as a supplement.",
      "content": "Try velvet bean as a supplement. The velvet bean naturally contains levodopa. Like stronger prescription medications, that means it may increase dopamine in your brain. Look for a supplement that contains extract of Mucuna pruriens with 15% L-dopa or levodopa. Take 300 milligrams 2 times a day of this extract. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Always talk to your doctor before beginning any supplement, especially one so similar to a prescription medication."

      "title": "Consider golden root as a supplement.",
      "content": "Consider golden root as a supplement. Golden root, also known as Rhodiola rosea , may increase dopamine activity in the brain. Try starting on 200 mg of a supplement with Rhodiola rosea extract. Look for one that has 2-3% rosavin and 0.8-1% salidroside. Take this supplement once a day. You can take as much as 600 milligrams in one day. Talk to your doctor before starting this supplement. Take it 30 minutes before you eat early in the day. It can cause insomnia if you take it too late in the day."
