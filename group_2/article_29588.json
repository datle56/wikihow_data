      "content": "Cut open an empty paper towel tube from top-to-bottom. Find an empty paper towel tube and remove any bits of paper that may still be clinging to it. Cut a straight slit going from top-to-bottom with scissors so that you can open the tube into a flat sheet. [1] X Research source If you want a smaller pencil case, you can use an empty toilet paper tube instead. You will only be able to keep small items in it, like erasers or crayons, however."

      "content": "Hot glue a 10 to 11 in (25 to 28 cm) non-separating zipper to the opening. Coat the left cut edge of the paper towel tube with hot glue. Press the left side of a 10 to 11 in (25 to 28 cm) non-separating zipper into the glue. Repeat the process for the right cut edge and the right side of the zipper. [2] X Research source Choose a zipper color that matches or contrasts with your fabric. The zipper tape should be touching the cardboard, and the zipper teeth should be between the cut edges. You want to be able to open and close the tube with the zipper. If the zipper is too long, cut it from the top, then cover the cut ends with hot glue so that the zipper head doesn't slide off."

      "content": "Trace the ends of the paper towel tube onto your desired fabric. Place your fabric face-down on a flat surface, then stand your paper towel tube on top. Trace around your tube with a pen or pencil, then repeat the process for the other end of the tube. [3] X Research source Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the circles so that you can add the seams later. Canvas fabric will work the best, but you can use cotton too. You can use solid-colored or patterned fabric. If you use light-colored cotton fabric, be aware that the paper towel tube may show through it."

      "content": "Cut the circles out with 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowances. This simply means that you cut the circles with a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) wide border all around. If you need to, sketch a new cutting line around the circles first, then cut the circles out. [4] X Research source You won't be sewing the case, but you still need the seam allowances in order to glue the circles down."

They are important, because they will make it easier to glue the circles onto the tube. They will also help reduce bulk. [5] X Research source Don't cut past the original circle lines that you drew, otherwise you will end up with holes in your case."

Coat the top rim of your tube with hot glue, then press it against the back of your first circle; make sure to align it with the pen or pencil marks. Next, coat the top edge of the tube with more hot glue, then press the circle's slit seams into the glue. [6] X Research source Repeat this step for the other end of the tube with the other circle. Use a low-temp hot glue gun for this step. This way, the glue won't burn you through the fabric. Make sure that the front (right side) of the fabric is facing out, and the back (wrong side) is facing into the tube."

Measure the length and circumference of your paper towel tube first, then add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to each measurement. Draw the rectangle on your fabric, then cut it out. Use the same type of fabric as you did for the ends of the tube. You can use a different color and pattern, however. If you want to, you can even make the rectangle a little wider than your tube’s circumference; this will give you more room for error later on."

Fold the narrow side edges down by 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm), then hot glue them down. Repeat the process for the long edges as well. [7] X Research source if you want, you can iron the edges first in order to have crisper seams. Do this before you hot glue them. Consider leaving 1 of the long edges unfolded and unglued. This way, you can adjust it when you wrap the fabric around the tube."

When you get to the other side of the zipper tape, coat the other folded long edge of the fabric with more hot glue, then press it down. [8] X Research source Make sure that the back (wrong side) of the fabric is facing the tube when you glue it down. The narrow side edges of the fabric should be aligned with the top and bottom edges of the tube. If you left the other long edge unfolded, be sure to fold it before you glue it down. You may need to fold it more than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) to ensure a good fit."

There are lots of different types of Ziploc bags, but the type that work the best for pencil cases are the 1-quart (0.95 L) bags made from thicker plastic. It would be even better if the bag has a slider on the top. This will make it more zipper-like and easier to use. [9] X Research source Avoid using a regular, sandwich-sized bag, as it may not be big enough for your pens and pencils."

[10] X Research source For a more durable bag, overlap the strips by about 1 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.32 to 1.27 cm). [11] X Research source Make sure that the strips are centered.

Use a ruler and a permanent marker going across the bag, 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the bottom edge of the last strip of tape. Cut along this line, then discard the bottom portion. It does not have to be exactly 1 inch (2.5 cm). It can be a little less than 1 inch (2.5 cm), but it shouldn’t be more."

Lay it across the bottom of your bag, so that the bottom edge is hanging off by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Flip the bag over, and fold the excess onto the back. This will seal the bottom. If you see any gaps, lay a strip of duct tape across the front and back of the bag, aligning the bottom edges. If there is any excess duct tape hanging over the side edges, cut it off."

Next, repeat the process for the bottom edge of the bag. This will make the side seams stronger and give you a nice, 1 in (2.5 cm) border all around. [14] X Research source If you used patterned duct tape for the body of the bag, consider using a solid color for the trim. If you used solid-colored duct tape for the body, you can use a contrasting color for the trim, or a nice pattern instead. For a fancier bag, you can decorate it with shapes cut from duct tape."

Next, cut 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) wide strips of duct tape, and use them to secure the remaining 3 edges of the rectangle to the front of your bag. [15] X Research source Make the rectangle about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) longer and wider than your ID card. Cut the rectangle from another plastic Ziploc bag.

Otherwise, place a sheet of binder paper on top of your pouch. Align the bottom edge of your bag with the edge of the binder paper. Use a permanent marker to mark the holes, then punch the holes out with a hole puncher. If your pencil case is too short to fit all 3 holes, make just 2 holes."

You can use the same color of fabric for all 4 pieces, or you can use different colors for the outside and lining. [16] X Research source For example, you can cut 2 dark blue pieces for the outside and 2 light blue pieces for the inside. You can also use patterned or solid-colored fabric.

Secure the long edges with sewing pins. [17] X Research source The zipper can be the same color as your fabric, or it can be a contrasting color. Use a dress or garment zipper, not a separating zipper. You will end up with the zipper sandwiched between 2 pieces of fabric. The right sides of the fabric should be facing in, and the wrong sides should be facing out."

Be sure to backstitch when you start and finish sewing. You can match the thread color to either the outer fabric, lining, or zipper tape. If you do not have a zipper foot, sew halfway across the edge, stop, move the zipper to the other end of the tape, and finish sewing. A backstitch is where you reverse the sewing machine for a few stitches. It prevents the thread from unraveling."

Next, sew around the lining. Start at the zipper and finish at the bottom for the left and right side. Leave a 3 in (7.6 cm) gap along the bottom edge of the lining. [19] X Research source Remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing, and the remove the pins. Change the thread and bobbin color as needed in order to match it to the outer and lining fabric. The 3 in (7.6 cm) gap is important, because you'll need it in order to turn the bag right-side-out."
