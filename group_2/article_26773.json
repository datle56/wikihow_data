You’ll need three pieces of string for this type of ankle bracelet. You can find the string at craft stores. When picking out the colors, be sure to choose a set that either means something to the person you’re making the ankle bracelet for or simply goes well together.

      "content": "Start your staircase. With your strings anchored, knot at the side, grab hold of two strings. Hold these straight and wrap your third string around these two and pull it into a knot. You’ll be able to see the knot on the side of the string. Using this same thread, repeat this step 10-15 times. [2] X Research source Be sure to hold your two center strings as straight and tight as possible. This will make tying the knots easier because it will keep them out of the way of your staircase."

    {
      "title": "Switch colors.",
      "content": "Switch colors. It’s just that easy—pick your next color string after you’ve reached the length you want for the first one. Hold the other two straight and use your new color to tie a knot around them. Repeat this for 10-15 knots. Continue this staircase for the length of your ankle. If you notice that a knot isn’t sitting correctly, you can easily undo it. However, this gets more and more difficult because your staircase gets tighter as you go; so pay attention and catch the mistake early."

A lobster clasp is the best for an ankle bracelet and is easily tied onto each side.
