      "content": "Rinse the mint under cool water and dry it with a towel. Whether you harvest your own mint or get it from the store, place it in a colander and run the mint under a thin stream of cool water to clean it. Gently shake the colander to remove excess water and place the leaves on a clean towel. Then, use another clean towel to pat the mint dry. [1] X Research source Alternatively, place the mint in a salad spinner and give it a few spins to dry it off. Always clean herbs before you use or store them, as they can contain trace amounts of dirt, bacteria, or pesticide residue."

      "content": "Moisten 2 to 3 paper towel sheets. Tear off 2 to 3 sheets of paper towel and fold them in half to form a thick sheet. Then, run the paper towels under cold water and wring out the excess moisture so the paper towels are damp, but not soaking wet. [2] X Research source Use quilted paper towels for the best results, as these towels hold up better to wetting and wrapping. Excess moisture can cause your herbs to rot quickly. Just make sure the paper towels are lightly moist and not overly wet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the mint leaves on the paper towels in an even layer.",
      "content": "Place the mint leaves on the paper towels in an even layer. Use your fingers to pluck the individual mint leaves from the stems if your mint is still in bunches. Then, lay the paper towels flat on your counter and arrange the leaves on the towel in even rows. [4] X Research source If you have a large amount of mint, dampen more paper towels to ensure all of the leaves are spread evenly."

      "title": "Roll the paper towels with the mint inside.",
      "content": "Roll the paper towels with the mint inside. Start at one of the short ends of the paper towel and gently roll it up to the other end. Just roll the towel semi-loosely so the leaves don’t get damaged as you work. Rolling up the mint presses it against the damp paper towels on all sides, providing them with the moisture they need to stay fresh while preventing excess air exposure. [5] X Research source In other words, roll the paper towel width-wise instead of length-wise so you have a shorter, wider roll."

      "title": "Place the mint in a bag or container and set it in the fridge.",
      "content": "Place the mint in a bag or container and set it in the fridge. Slide the wrapped mint bundle into a plastic bag or an airtight storage container. Then, stash the container in the refrigerator. Just take it out and unwrap the towel whenever you need mint leaves. For instance, you might make a refreshing mojito or whip up some tabouli. [6] X Research source Keeps for: 2 to 3 weeks. If you’re storing mint in a plastic bag, keep the bag unsealed to limit moisture buildup. If you don’t have a bag or container, simply wrap the bundle in an extra layer of dry paper towels and stick it in your fridge’s produce drawer. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the clean mint stems at a 45° angle.",
      "content": "Cut the clean mint stems at a 45° angle. Use a pair of scissors to snip off the ends of the mint stems at a slight angle. This helps the herbs soak up more water, keeping them healthy and fresh for longer. Only snip off a small amount of the stem so the sprigs stand upright in a glass. [8] X Research source Rinse your mint bunches under a cool stream of water and dry them off with a towel before storing them."

      "title": "Fill a glass ⅓ full with water and add in the mint sprigs.",
      "content": "Fill a glass ⅓ full with water and add in the mint sprigs. Get out a small glass, jar, or vase and fill it about ⅓ full with water. Then, insert the mint bundle stem first into the container so the trimmed ends are submerged, just like a bouquet of flowers. This gives the mint a constant supply of water to stay fresh. [9] X Research source For even more pristine preservation, use distilled or mineral water."

      "title": "Cover the glass with a bag and place it in your refrigerator.",
      "content": "Cover the glass with a bag and place it in your refrigerator. Drape an empty plastic bag or grocery bag over the top of the mint bundle; this limits air exposure which can cause the herbs to wilt. Simply remove the plastic bag and snip off the mint leaves whenever you need them for drinks, meals, or desserts! [10] X Research source Keeps for: 3 weeks. It’s normal for the mint to droop a little over time. If the bag isn’t staying in place, secure it with a rubber band Change the water in the glass when it looks dirty or cloudy. Alternatively, store the glass of mint at room temperature on your counter. It typically lasts for 1 week."

Then, use your hand or a sharp knife to remove the mint leaves from their stems. Just set them on a dry, clean towel to soak up any excess moisture. [11] X Research source This method is great if you have lots of leftover mint you can’t use immediately, or you simply want to preserve your mint for future uses."

Then, slowly drizzle water into each slot, leaving a little bit of space at the top for the cubes to expand as they solidify. [12] X Research source Don’t worry if the leaves float to the top of the ice cube slot—as long as they don’t poke out of the tray, you’re fine! If you don’t have an ice cube tray, use silicone molds. Feel free to chop the leaves into finer pieces if you’re preserving them for sauces and dishes. If you're using the mint ice cubes for drinks, add a spritz of lemon juice or a sprinkle of cane sugar or honey for some extra flavor."

Then, pop the cubes into a plastic freezer bag and place them back in the freezer. When you’re ready to use the mint, just set a few cubes in a mesh strainer to thaw. Or, blend them in a smoothie or add them to a glass of lemonade or tea for a zesty, herbal flavor! [13] X Research source Keeps for: for 6 months. After thawing the mint leaves, press them lightly between some paper towels to squeeze out excess moisture."
