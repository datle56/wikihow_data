      "content": "Identify performers with a look that you like. Rockstars have developed divergent fashion styles to match the diversity of rock genres like Indie Rock, Glam, Punk, Hip Hop, Metal, Electronic, etc. Explore your options and note fashion choices that are common in a specific genre of rock music that interests you. Fashion journalists periodically compile useful lists of particularly stylish rockstars. [1] X Research source For women, decide whether you want a look that is feminine or more gender-neutral. You can wear a dress with combat boots, or you could pair a ripped top with jeans. Choose a rockstar look that reflects your personality. For men, decide how simple you want to keep it. You can combine a band T-shirt, skinny jeans, and Converse sneakers. Alternately, you can choose a tailored suit for a more foppish rockstar look. Consider which look matches your personality best. No matter what style you choose, maintain a consistent aesthetic over time."

      "content": "Read for inspiration. Music publications like rollingstone.com and nme.com, and fashion magazines like gq.com and esquire.com periodically cover the overlap between fashion and music. You can keep up with trends in music fashion by staying current with these publications. You are not confined to the style of one sub-genre. You can use the specific style of one group to help you connect with like-minded people, but you do not need to limit yourself. If you stay too close to one established style, you may come across as less original and edgy than you intend."

      "content": "Consider your budget. This may be an expensive project if you will be changing your entire wardrobe. Decide how much money you can afford to spend and make sure that you can realize your preferred style within that limit. Fashion and lifestyle publications often provide pointers. [2] X Research source Leather jackets, tailored suits, and designer jeans are all expensive. When you are on a tight budget, only buy these items if they complement the rockstar clothes that you already have. Inexpensive leather bracelets and belts can add some edginess to your clothes, but they will not help stretch your budget if they do not last. Stay away from cheap leather products that are likely to deteriorate quickly. [3] X Research source If you are in a band, proper equipment should be your first priority. Not only will it elevate your performance, it will be a major part of your rockstar image while on stage."

      "content": "Identify what you already have. You probably own some items that you can use with your new style. Not only will this make your transformation cheaper and easier, your well-worn clothes will add authenticity to your rockstar look. Sort clothes into sections. Note what percentage of your clothes are darks, whites, or bright colors. Dark colors and blacks are common for rockstar style. If you have a large percentage of bright colors, look to pair them with darks for balance. Repurpose clothes. If you have plaid shirts, wear them loosely with a white T-shirt and a pair of jeans. This will give you a simple, versatile grunge rock look. Take a new look at old clothes. Tattered and torn clothes are popular in rockstar fashion."

      "content": "Shop at thrift stores. Unless you are emulating a glam rock star style, you are most likely to look like an authentic rockstar by keeping it cheap. At a thrift store, you can find various styles at inexpensive prices. You also will have a one-of-a-kind look that others will not be able to imitate. Buying items second-hand can allow you to find quality pieces that you might not be able to afford otherwise. Unclaimed dry cleaning can occasionally be bought cheaply, though dry cleaners are more likely to donate unclaimed clothes to charities. Nevertheless, laws regulating unclaimed property vary by state so you may find a dry cleaner that will sell you unique items at discounted prices."

A fun print, like cheetah or snake, can be a great option for your shoes."

      "title": "Pick a haircut that fits your style.",
      "content": "Pick a haircut that fits your style. A good hairstyle for a rockstar may be either subtle or extreme. Shaggy hair is common as it fits the image of a disinterested rebel. If you want a more extreme look, consider a mohawk or a buzz cut. Fashion and style publications occasionally compile useful lists of rockstar hairstyles. [4] X Research source Bring in a picture or show your new rockstar image to a trusted stylist who can help you decide on the right style. If you are a touring musician, consider a style that will not need regular cuts to maintain. Since you may be on the road for long periods, you may have difficulty scheduling appointments with trusted stylists. Get imaginative with hair dye, wash in colors, and styling products. Rockstar style often involves projecting confidence while looking unusual. Look for pictures of styles that you like and find out which product is used for that style: hair gel, paste, pomade, mousse, cream, or hairspray all have different effects. [5] X Research source Ask friends with distinctive hairstyles to suggest their preferred hair products and brands."

      "content": "Apply makeup to complete your look. Look at the rockstars that you have used as models to see how they use makeup. It can be used it sparingly or to create an over-the-top look. Once you find a style that you want to try, you can find tutorials on Youtube. Don't be afraid to try a new style: you can always clean it off and try a different look. Heavy black eye liner is popular for metal and goth styles. Additional color or blush is common among rockstars cultivating a dandy or foppish image. Glam and art rock performers use makeup to create color schemes, shapes, and patterns that exaggerate, transform, or obscure facial features. David Bowie, The Sweet, and Alice Cooper are prominent examples."
