      "title": "Measure your head with paper.",
      "content": "Measure your head with paper. To make a paper bunny ears hat, the first thing to do is prepare the piece of paper that will be your headband. Wrap a piece of A4 or A3 paper around your forehead at the height you want to wear it. [1] X Research source In the middle of your forehead is a good place. If you have too high it could fall off easily, but if you have it too low it might slip down over your eyes. When you are happy with it, mark with a pen or pencil where two sides of the paper meet in front of your forehead."

      "title": "Cut out the paper to fit.",
      "content": "Cut out the paper to fit. It's a good idea to leave a little excess, so cut the paper an inch further out than where you made the mark. Cut all the way up the paper and then wrap it around your head again to test the size. Once you are happy with the fit, you can slim down your paper headband by cutting horizontally across the paper. Then stick the two ends of the paper together with glue or tape. You might need someone else to help you stick it together to make sure it fits properly. The slimmer you cut the band, the less visible it will be. But it will also be more susceptible to tearing."

      "title": "Cut out two bunny ears.",
      "content": "Cut out two bunny ears. Now you have the headband you need the actual bunny ears. Just cut out two nice bunny ear shapes of equal size. You can do this by using a template or putting two pieces of paper on top of each other and cutting them together. Once you are happy with the size of your ears, colour them in or decorate them however you like. A traditional bunny ear would be white on the outside with a pink centre."

      "title": "Cut pipe cleaners to the same height as the ears.",
      "content": "Cut pipe cleaners to the same height as the ears. You can add pipe cleaners to the back of your ears to help you control them. You can keep them nice and upright and give them a little bend at the top. Just cut out two pieces of pipe cleaner, one for each ear, to approximately the same height as your bunny ears. [2] X Research source Secure a pipe cleaner to the back of each of your bunny ears with tape or glue."

    {
      "title": "Stick the ears to the headband.",
      "content": "Stick the ears to the headband. Now all you need to do is to stick the bunny ears to the headband and you are ready to wear them. You can stick them to either the inside or the outside of the band, depending on which you think looks better. Use glue, tape or a stapler to fix in the bunny ears. Sticking them to the inside will mean that you won't see the very bottom part of the ears. If you use glue, make sure you let it dry before putting it on your head."

    {
      "title": "Get a hairband.",
      "content": "Get a hairband. Another way to make paper bunny ears which will be a bit sturdier than the version with a paper headband is just to use a normal headband or hairband that you wear. Find one you don't mind using to make your bunny ears."

    {
      "title": "Draw out your bunny ears.",
      "content": "Draw out your bunny ears. Get two pieces of A4 paper, one for each ear, and fold the paper in half horizontally. Now, starting at the fold in the paper, draw a bunny ear shape. Repeat this on the other sheet of paper in the same way, ensuring that the fold in the paper is where the base of the ear is. You can decorate or colour in your ears now. If you use any glitter or glue make sure you leave it to dry before moving on to the next steps. For bigger bunny ears use A3 paper."

    {
      "title": "Cut out the bunny ears.",
      "content": "Cut out the bunny ears. Now you can cut out the ears. Keeping the paper folded in half, carefully cut along the outside of the ears, making sure you don't cut along the fold at the bottom of the paper. This is what keeps the front and back of your ears together. When you have cut out both ears you should have two pieces of paper. Each one will have a normal bunny ear shape and an upside ear shape, which join at where the paper was folded."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the bunny ears to the headband.",
      "content": "Attach the bunny ears to the headband. Wrap each ear around the headband so that the base of the ear, where the paper was folded, goes underneath the headband. You should now see how the folded paper has become the front and back of the ears. Glue the two sides of the bunny ears together to fix them to your headband. You can also glue the base of the ears to the headband to make them more secure."

      "title": "Get hold of a paper plate.",
      "content": "Get hold of a paper plate. You can make a very simple bunny ears hat with just a paper plate, some pens, and some scissors. First you need to find a paper plate. You might have some of these in the kitchen, but they are easily available in stores."

    {
      "title": "Draw the ears.",
      "content": "Draw the ears. When you have your plate, place it upside down on the floor. Starting from the inside edge of the crinkled rim, draw two ears in pen. You should be drawing into the middle part of the plate. The ears should stop about an inch inside the crinkled rim on the opposite side of the plate to where you started drawing. [3] X Research source When you are happy with the basic outline, you can decorate or colour them in. Try drawing a section inside the ears and colouring it pink."

    {
      "title": "Cut out the ears.",
      "content": "Cut out the ears. Now you need to carefully cut around the outside of the ears. Be sure not to cut the part where the base of the ears joins the rim of the plate. Then cut along the inside of the crinkled rim of the plate, so that just the ears are left attached to the rim. [4] X Research source Fold up your bunny ears so they are pointing up. Now slip on your new bunny ears hat."

      "title": "Get a sturdy headband.",
      "content": "Get a sturdy headband. If you decide you want to make bunny ears that are bit stronger than paper ones, you can make some from fabric or felt. For this method you will need a good sturdy headband or hairband to attach the ears to. Something like an Alice band would be a good choice."

      "title": "Draw your bunny ears shape onto some felt or fabric.",
      "content": "Draw your bunny ears shape onto some felt or fabric. Place your hair band onto the felt and draw the shape of your ears directly onto the felt. You can choose whatever shape or colour you like."

      "title": "Twist wire to shape.",
      "content": "Twist wire to shape. Now take a piece of 20 gauge wire and attach one end of it to your headband, and bend it into the shape of the ear you have just drawn. You should leave enough clearance, about an inch, outside the wire for you to apply glue. When the wire is bent into shape, trim it and wrap the other end around your headband. [5] X Research source Repeat this process for the other ear. You should have two basic wire bunny ears attached to the headband."

      "title": "Cut out your bunny ears.",
      "content": "Cut out your bunny ears. Carefully cut along the outside edge of your drawn ears on the felt or fabric. You need a front and a back for each ear, so after you cut each one out, use it as a template to cut out its reverse side. [6] X Research source You should be left with four pieces of fabric, two pairs. You can cut out smaller pieces of fabric of a different colour to stick on as the inner ear. Or you can decorate them however you like."

      "title": "Cover the wire ears with fabric.",
      "content": "Cover the wire ears with fabric. Now lay down one of each ear piece and put the wire ear frames on top of it. It should fit easily, but you may have to bend the wire a little here and there. Then glue this bottom ear to the other piece of fabric you have cut out for each ear so that the wire is hidden inside. [7] X Research source It's a good idea to apply glue to the part on the inside of the wire first and stick it down. Then glue around the edges to secure it. Leave the glue to dry, and then you should have bunny ears that you can bend to shape."
