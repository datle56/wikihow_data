      "title": "Using Pantene every day may lead to dry and damaged hair over time.",
      "content": "Using Pantene every day may lead to dry and damaged hair over time. Although Pantene promises soft and shiny strands, many of their products contain harsh ingredients like sulfates, parabens, silicones, and fragrance. These ingredients are especially damaging for people with sensitive scalps or textured hair. However, Pantene does offer several “cleaner” product ranges that are formulated for specific hair types. [1] X Research source For example, Pantene’s popular Pro-V collection contains parabens that are known to irritate the scalp. [2] X Research source Most drugstore shampoos and conditioners contain the same harsh ingredients, so it’s not exclusive to Pantene. If your shampoo isn’t labeled “sulfate-free,” there’s a high chance that it contains sulfates. [3] X Research source If you have normal hair type (and a non-sensitive scalp), you’re probably safe to use Pantene’s regular hair care lines, but look for better options on the market if you want to improve the overall health of your hair."

      "title": "Sulfates",
      "content": "Sulfates This ingredient acts as the cleaning agent in most shampoos. It helps create a rich lather and removes any dirt, oil, and dry skin from your scalp. However, it can dry out your skin, damage the texture of your hair, and even trigger an allergic reaction. [4] X Research source Pantene’s Pro-V range contains some of the harshest sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) & sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Parabens",
      "content": "Parabens In hair care products, parabens are often used as a preservative to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria. Formaldehyde is a paraben found in many Pantene products that may irritate the scalp if you have sensitive skin, and possibly cause health issues, such as hormone disruption. [6] X Research source Several studies link parabens to an increased risk of breast cancer, so it is a possible carcinogenic.

    {
      "title": "Silicones",
      "content": "Silicones Although silicone leaves your strands looking soft and silky, it can build up and damage your hair over time. It works by sealing the hair cuticle in a layer that prevents moisture from penetrating the hair shaft. This can make the hair dry and brittle, and it may also weigh down your hair and flatten curls. [8] X Research source To prevent product build up, use a clarifying shampoo once a week to clear your pores and hair follicles.

    {
      "title": "Fragrances",
      "content": "Fragrances While Pantene makes your hair smell fruity and floral, the ingredients in the scent can strip and irritate your scalp. Fragrances in shampoo are often synthetic ingredients that are derived from toxic petrochemicals. Manufacturers aren’t required to list the specific ingredients that make up the fragrance, which means there might be a mix of damaging chemicals in your shampoo. [10] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, stick to hair care products that are labeled \"fragrance-free\" to avoid irritation. To find non-toxic products, type in your specific shampoo or conditioner into EWG's Skin Deep search engine. It provides a breakdown of all the harmful ingredients in your products, including their potential health risks."

      "title": "Pantene conditioners can leave your hair softer and more nourished.",
      "content": "Pantene conditioners can leave your hair softer and more nourished. Unlike their shampoos, many Pantene conditioners do not contain harsh sulfates that strip your hair. Most of their conditioners do contain silicone, however, to help nourish and hydrate your hair. Although silicones can weigh down your hair over time, you can minimize product build up by concentrating the conditioner on the ends of your hair and using a clarifying shampoo at least once a week.

      "title": "The best shampoo is specifically formulated for your hair type.",
      "content": "The best shampoo is specifically formulated for your hair type. When it comes to shampoo selection , consider your hair type and texture before choosing a product. Read the product description of your shampoo to see if it’s designed for your hair, then look at the ingredient list to see if it includes any harsh chemicals. If you have curly hair, for instance, look for moisturizing ingredients like argan oil, glycerin, or fatty alcohols. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you have a sensitive scalp, choose sulfate-free shampoos in Pantene’s Nutrient Blends line. If you have curly or textured hair, try a moisturizing shampoo from their Truly or Gold collections. If you have thin or straight hair, pick a silicone- or sulfate-free shampoo from their Generation Beauty line. If you have normal hair, you can stick with Pantene Pro-V, but make sure you rinse out the product thoroughly and use a clarifying shampoo at least once a week."

      "title": "Hair-Burning Controversy",
      "content": "Hair-Burning Controversy In 2016, a Maryland hairdresser posted on Facebook that Pantene Moisture Renewal shampoo and conditioner caused his client’s hair to catch fire while he was color-treating it. He claimed that his client used Pantene for over a year, and it led to a “build up of parabens, plastic, and silicones” that reacted negatively with bleach. [13] X Research source The post went viral, but cosmetic chemists have since debunked this claim. While Pantene contains silicones that coat the hair, the only negative effect of product build up is not being able to penetrate the hair with dye. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Hair Loss Controversy",
      "content": "Hair Loss Controversy Many online users have claimed that Pantene can lead to hair loss or thinning, due to ingredients like sulfates and formaldehyde. While studies show that sulfates can result in dry or fragile hair, there isn’t direct evidence that it contributes to hair loss. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Many drugstore shampoos and conditioners contain the same ingredients as Pantene products, and preservatives like formaldehyde are relatively safe in low concentrations.
