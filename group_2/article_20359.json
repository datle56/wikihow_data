Most people don't have their first boyfriend or girlfriend until after elementary school, [4] X Research source so the first thing you need to do is check and see if the girl you like even wants a relationship. Talk about other people you know who have boyfriends or girlfriends, because it will give you a reason to ask if she wants one. Ask her if she's ever thought about having a romantic partner, but don't tell her it's because you want to be her partner. That might scare her off. If she says she doesn't want a relationship, ask her why not. If she asks if you want a girlfriend, tell her that you wouldn't mind having one, but that you're not desperate to."

Talk about funny things that happened at school, or watch a funny TV show you both like. Talk about things you have in common.

I've noticed that we always have a really good time when we spend time together, so I'd like to spend more time with you.
