Or if you need to double a recipe that calls for 3/4 cup of flour, how much flour will you need? (1.5 cups).

      "content": "Doing math in your head can help you remember key concepts. Some problems, like geometry or calculus, require a pencil and paper to get started; however, math basics like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are ones you can do in your head. If you come across an easy problem, do it in your mind first before resorting to a calculator. If you’re worried about your mental math skills, you can always double check your answer on your phone or computer."

      "content": "Practice makes perfect, and math is no exception. Set a study schedule for yourself and try to review your math problems for 15 to 20 minutes per day (or more if a test is coming up). Your skills will build up over time with not much effort on your part!

Write out important concepts and formulas on note cards so that you can easily refer to them while doing problems and use them for study guides before exams. Study in a quiet place. Distractions, whether aural or visual, will detract both from your ability to pay attention and to retain information. Study when you’re alert and rested. Don’t try to force yourself to study late at night or when you’re sleep-deprived."

      "content": "Writing it all out can help you spot mistakes. As you work through a problem, use a pencil to write out what you did and how you did it. Some teachers require you to show your work anyway, so it shouldn’t be too much of a hassle. [4] X Research source Showing your work can also help you check your answers on homework and test problems. Don’t solve math problems with a pen! Use a pencil so you can erase and correct mistakes if they happen."

      "content": "Word problems are usually tougher than straight math problems. If you’re struggling with picturing the problem on the page, grab a pencil and get to drawing. You don’t have to be an artist—make a few circles to represent pies or some stick figures to stand in for people. Use your visuals to help you solve the problem as you work through it. [5] X Research source For example, a problem might say, “If you have 4 pieces of candy split evenly into 2 bags, how many pieces of candy are in each bag?” You could draw 2 squares to represent the bags, then fill in 4 circles split between them to represent the candy."

      "content": "You can find tons of example problems online. If you’re going over a concept, look it up and try 2 to 3 problems on your own. Check the answers to figure out if you got them right, and study the concept again if you didn’t. [6] X Research source Your teacher might also be able to give you some extra example problems if you ask for them. Using example problems is a great way to practice for a test. Identify which skills and concepts you’ll need to solve the problem. This will give you an overall sense of what you’ll need to do to find the solution.
