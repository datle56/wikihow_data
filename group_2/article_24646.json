      "content": "One ball changing hands Pick one ball and just toss it from one hand to another. Don't toss too high or too far -- keep it right in front of you. Then toss it back to the other hand. Do this until it becomes comfortable or until you feel silly doing it. Return the ball to the other hand in the same fashion, toss it up into the air. Resist the urge to simply pass it across to your \"good\" hand. Tossing it back up into the air gives you that split-second you will soon need for the third ball."

      "title": "Two Ball Exchange",
      "content": "Two Ball Exchange Hold one ball in each hand. Begin by tossing as before (you want to toss first from your dominant hand). Just after the first ball has peaked, reach up slightly to get it while tossing the other. The second toss (up-going) travels just the the inside of the down-coming balls path. Right after tossing the second ball you should catch the first. Do not toss too hard; keep them about eye-high. You will find that you are simply exchanging the one in the air for the one in your hand. This is the basic trick to juggling, it is called \"The Jug\". The good news is - if you can do two, you can do three (you just don't know it yet). Keep practicing exchanging the one in the air for the one in your hand. One, two, catch, catch, stop. One, two, catch, catch, stop."
