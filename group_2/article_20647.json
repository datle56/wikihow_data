      "title": "Paxil changes your brain chemistry to impact your mood.",
      "content": "Paxil changes your brain chemistry to impact your mood. It's a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)—a medication that delivers serotonin to nerves in your brain. Your brain cells quickly get used to the medication and they physically change. However, when you suddenly stop taking Paxil, the levels of medication drop and can trigger withdrawal problems. [1] X Research source By gradually tapering off your dosage, you give your brain a chance to adjust to less of the medication so withdrawal symptoms aren't as severe."

      "content": "Get rest if you're feeling fatigued or drowsy. You'll probably feel tired in the first few weeks of tapering off Paxil, so give yourself time to rest during the day. Plan on a nap as well as some physical activity so you don't feel sluggish all day. The good news is that this common side effect seems to ease up pretty quickly. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you feel really drowsy, don't drive or operate dangerous machinery. If you're experiencing the opposite problem—having a hard time falling asleep—try taking your dose early in the morning and avoid caffeine. Your doctor can also prescribe a mild sleep aid while you're tapering off of Paxil."

      "content": "Switch to smaller, more frequent meals if you have nausea. Your stomach may feel irritated as you switch to a lower dose of Paxil. Instead of eating your usual 2 or 3 big meals, eat 4 or 5 small meals so it's easier for you to digest. You can also relieve sudden nausea by sucking on sugar-free hard candy or ginger.

If you feel unbalanced or woozy, stand up slowly after you've been sitting and walk with supports—use handrails or a cane if you're really dizzy. Staying hydrated can also help, but skip the caffeine or alcohol.

      "content": "It's better to taper off Paxil slowly to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms. If you stop taking Paxil without reducing the dose first, you'll experience unpleasant withdrawal side effects like irritability, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, nightmares, headaches, or skin sensitivity. You may even have more severe symptoms like suicidal thoughts, which is why it's really important to work with your doctor or psychiatrist to gradually cut back on your dose. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Alliance on Mental Illness Grassroots mental health-focused organization providing resources, support, and education for those affected by mental illness Go to source Keep in mind that any mental health issues that you're managing like anxiety disorder, PTSD, panic attacks, or depression, will probably rebound while you're getting off of Paxil. This is another reason it's so important to gradually taper off your dose."

      "content": "Talk to your psychiatrist before you stop taking Paxil cold turkey. Your doctor or psychiatrist will explain the risks of going off Paxil cold turkey, but they'll probably still want to monitor you if you're determined to stop right away. Either way, they need to know that you're not taking Paxil so they can give you the best care in the future.

      "content": "Create a personalized plan with the help of a psychiatrist. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, your psychiatrist will probably have you gradually reduce the amount of Paxil you take. Since they know your current dosage and history of depression, they can give you specific guidance about how much to take every week. Someone with severe depression will usually need to taper more slowly and be monitored more closely. [8] X Expert Source Padam Bhatia, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. It's also really important to talk with your doctor about why you want to stop taking Paxil. They'll want to be sure that you're able to manage your depression or anxiety without the medication."

      "content": "Reduce your dosage by 10 mg a day at weekly intervals. If you can't get a personalized plan, taper off your use of Paxil slowly. Plan to reduce your dosage by 10 mg a day and stay at this level for 1 week. Then, cut back another 10 mg a day for the following week. Keep reducing the amount until you're taking 20 mg a day. [9] X Research source For instance, if you're currently taking 40 mg a day, reduce the amount to 30 mg and take this amount for 1 full week. Then, take 20 mg a day for the following week. It's totally fine to adjust your tapering rate if you're experiencing side effects. You may stay at a reduced level for more than a week or cut back by 5 mg instead of 10 mg. Recent studies have highlighted the lack of official tapering dosages and they've called for more research and guidelines.

Once you get to 20 mg, or a lower amount if you started with a smaller dosage, continue to take Paxil at that dose for 1 week. Then, stop taking it altogether. [11] X Research source For instance, if you had been taking 10 mg a day, you'll be able to get off Paxil faster, but you still need to reduce the amount gradually. Go down to 5 mg a day for 1 week.

      "content": "You can use a pill-cutter to cut immediate-release Paxil in half. Since you're adjusting your medication dose, you want to be accurate. Set a pill in the center of your pill cutter and line up the line on the pill with the blade of the cutter. Then, firmly press down to make an even, clean cut. [12] X Research source For example, if you have a 10-mg pill, cutting it in half will give you two 5-mg pills. Avoid cutting extended-release Paxil in half since too much of the medication could flood your system at once. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you aren't sure if your pills are immediate or extended-release, ask your doctor or pharmacist. You may be able to switch to liquid Paxil—this can be easier to measure so you're accurately reducing your dosage every week. Talk with your doctor about writing a small prescription for you."

Your doctor is there to support you and you can find other people in the process of getting off of Paxil, too. Search online for a support group or check local community centers for anti-depressant support groups. Being able to talk with others who are going through the same experiences can really help. [15] X Research source If there isn't a local support group, consider establishing one yourself. Contact local mental health support centers and ask about setting up an anti-depressant withdrawal group. Don't be afraid to let your family and close friends know that you're getting off of Paxil and might need extra support and encouragement."
