      "content": "Take time to grieve and process your feelings. Feeling lonely, sad, and even angry toward your family situation can stir up a lot of negative emotions. That’s okay and even healthy, but it’s important to acknowledge those thoughts and feelings so you can (eventually) reframe them into something more positive. Take some time to wallow if you need to—Dicken mentions that although “there’s a lot of fear around feeling those difficult feelings like grief and sadness…it can be highly beneficial…to take that time to grieve and heal.” [1] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. Once you’re ready to process your feelings , make a neutral statement about your family situation, like “I don’t feel like I have a good family.” Then, ask yourself what this means about you, such as “I’m alone” or “I’m unsupported.” Interrogate this previous statement and expand on it if possible, e.g., “Being alone means no one wants to be a part of my life.” Continue this process until you reach the core feeling behind your statements, like “I’m unlovable” or “I’m a bad person.” Uncovering these negative core beliefs can be really emotionally draining, so take your time, be patient, and look after your emotional health as you go through this process. Remember that these core beliefs often come from negative childhood experiences, but that doesn’t mean that they’re true. Once you’ve found your negative core belief, reframe it as a healthier statement. For instance, “I’m unlovable” might become “I’m beginning to reflect on my struggles to connect with my family and my feelings about their actions and behaviors.” Keep this statement in mind for when negative thoughts creep back in."

Feeling like you have no real family can actually affect your mental and physical health since it can cause feelings of stress and pain. Take the time to look after your physical, mental, and emotional health—and pamper yourself! Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night, indulge in a sweet treat from time to time, take a bath after a long day, and light aromatic candles around your home. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source Sit outside in nature whenever you can, and do some form of joyful movement (like dancing or yoga) at least a few times a week. Repeat positive mantras when you wake up each morning, like “Today is going to be a good day” or “You will do great today.” Journaling these affirmations or posting them on your mirror can also be helpful if you don’t like repeating them aloud. Learn to meditate and practice mindful breathing exercises to help relax your body and mind."

      "content": "Redefine what family and close relationships mean to you. Family doesn’t have to be blood, so if you don’t feel like your biological family has your best interests at heart, it may be time to look at other types of close relationships that will make you feel supported and loved. Take some time to consider in what ways you’d like to connect with others and what socialization needs you have. Ask yourself questions like, “what kind of behaviors make me feel loved and cared for?,” “when do I feel the most socially fulfilled?,” and “what kinds of relationships do I want to have in my life?” Once you’ve taken the time to consider your social and relational needs, set out to intentionally cultivate relationships like reconnecting with a former friend, participating in a class, or joining an online forum."

      "content": "Explore new hobbies, activities, and opportunities. If you’re in school, join a few clubs and extracurricular activities to spend some positive time away from home. If you’re out of school, look online for groups of people in your area who get together to pursue common interests or hobbies, like a book club or intramural sports team. Or take a class to learn something new, like a yoga class or community college course. [3] X Research source If you’re religious, look for a group organized by your local church, mosque, synagogue, or temple. Learning new skills and hobbies and spending time with new people can give you a distraction for your family but also boost your confidence and help you to build a life outside of your home situation. [4] X Research source If you don’t think your family will support your new adventures, don’t tell them if you don’t have to. Try to keep this one thing for yourself so you can experience it without judgment or negativity. If you still live with your family, you might need to get a part-time job to cover the cost of some of these opportunities. You can also try to explain your situation to the activity organizers and see if they can help you with financial aid."

      "content": "Join a volunteer program within your community. Volunteering will give you something positive to do with your time, and you may even find a new passion like cooking or painting. Sometimes, volunteering to help others can also put your problems into perspective and see that other people are experiencing the same challenges that you are. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source To find volunteer opportunities in your area, search online and then contact the agencies directly for additional information. Be aware that volunteering with certain groups, such as persons affected by family violence, may hit too close to home for you at this point. Instead, look for a volunteering activity that will uplift your mood while also allowing you to help out."

      "content": "Put time and effort into creating a supportive social circle. Make new friends and deepen your relationships with the people that you already have in your life. Look for friends who share your common interests and who will support you in achieving your life goals. To meet new friends, go to community events, join clubs, and commit to saying yes to any social gathering that you get invited to. [6] X Research source If you can’t make it to something you’ve been invited to, make sure to reschedule the activity immediately or invite that person to something in the near future. Plan nights out with your friends and make time for small-group activities like meeting a friend for coffee or going for a walk together. These activities are quieter and more focused on conversation, so they can help build and strengthen relationships by promoting sharing and helping you assess if this is someone you can trust. When you feel comfortable, confide in your friends about your family history and any wariness you have about getting close to people. While it might feel challenging at first, opening up to friends you trust is a good way to open yourself up to support and advice. “Be open to new friendships and people who really feel like more where you are now,” advises Dicken, “and just be optimistic that those people exist. By doing the things you love, you will meet those people.” [7] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020."

      "content": "Stay busy around the holidays. Special events and dates, such as anniversaries and holidays, can be very difficult and emotional if you are separated from your family either by distance or emotion. Take on extra shifts at work or maintain a full schedule of social activities. Being busy will remind you that you are a productive person with a good life. [8] X Research source If your coworkers or friends learn that you will be alone over the holidays, they might invite you to spend time with their family. Carefully consider your emotions before you accept this offer, as it may trigger negative feelings for you, such as jealousy. If you live with your family, you might arrange to spend part of the holiday at a friend’s house enjoying their celebration. Make these plans well in advance, and if getting to your friend requires a bit of traveling and you can afford to do that, even better."

      "content": "Recognize that some days will be tough. Whenever you are dealing with personal conflicts, certain days will be better than others. Try to assess your state of mind on a weekly, not daily, basis. Don’t beat yourself up if you feel down one day. Honor your sadness that day by journaling about it, allowing yourself to cry, or talking to a trusted friend. Sadness is a part of the healing process. Then, try to find a way to make the next day extra special. Go to your favorite restaurant, for example. It may also be helpful to tell your friends if/when you have a bad day. They may spring into action to lift you out of your funk and provide a positive distraction. Make sure to return this favor when you have the opportunity to do so. If you are in school, keep a close eye on your participation grades (and grades in general) during bad periods with your family. If you tend to focus on yourself and get quieter, make a point to speak up and get those points."

If you are worried about what kind of family life you might create as a parent, lessen your fears and educate yourself by enrolling in a childcare or parenting class. The instructors will show you that a negative family cycle does not have to repeat itself. They will also give you the tools to understand what parental actions are beneficial and which are harmful. [9] X Research source You can find a parenting class by contacting your local hospital. They will likely offer classes on a variety of parental topics.

Post this list somewhere visible, like on the wall in your room, and celebrate each time that a line is marked off. A personal goal might be to hit the gym at least three times a week. Or, perhaps you want to watch one movie each week and revel in your downtime. Break your goals down into steps that are small and achievable so that they are more likely to happen. Smaller goals will reinforce your progress and keep you motivated."

If you live away, try to visit your family less often. Space out your phone calls or text responses more and more. Create physical distance from your family by no longer visiting or inviting them over. You only have so much energy to give, and stepping away from the negative people in your life provides you with more energy to spend on the positive ones. [10] X Research source If your relatives question your increasing distance, you might say, “I’ve just been really busy lately,” and leave it at that. Keep in mind that when people are used to getting a certain response from you and suddenly they don't, it is typical for them to try harder before they give up. Be prepared for some pushback when you try to distance yourself."

If you must maintain a relationship with someone, you might consider setting up plans yourself. That way, they occur on your terms, where you're comfortable, and last only for small lengths of time. If your family members ask you to do something harmful to your well-being in any way, just say, “No.” Don’t feel the need to provide an explanation as your time is your own to spend. [11] X Research source Of course, if you live with your parents, you are more subject to their rules and requests. So, pick and choose which moments are most important to say \"no.\""

If you’ve been surrounded by dysfunction and negativity for your entire life, you may need to take a bit of time to observe and understand positive and supportive ways of treating people. Pick up some reading material on healthy interpersonal relationships . Be patient with yourself and expect to make a few errors on your way. For example, you may want to figure out when it is appropriate to say “thank you” for something and how to express that sentiment best. Do you write out a full card or simply send a brief test message? You will need to experiment to find out what is comfortable for you. If you are a young adult, look around you to find other people who you can respect and follow. They can be someone who you already spend a lot of time around, such as a teacher. Or, they can be a person who you do not know personally, such as a professional athlete. Try to learn more about your role model, including why they make particular decisions. For example, if your favorite football player is always volunteering, follow that example."

You can meet with a counselor as little or as often as you like. You can attend solo or with your partner. [12] X Research source Discussing your family history with a counselor will show you that it is not your fault that you have negative or problematic relatives.

You can also ask your therapist or primary care physician for help finding a support group. Not only can a support group give you a place to feel supported by people who understand what you’re going through, but you may end up making a found family from the people you meet in that group! Certain groups also deal with specific situations, such as survivors of families with sexual or substance abuse."

      "content": "You may have experienced an unhealthy family system growing up. In most cases, the feeling of not having a good family stems from an abusive or toxic childhood environment. Whether your caregivers directly hurt you or didn’t provide you with proper care and nurturing, these experiences can make you feel unsafe and unhappy around your family. [13] X Research source “Most of our problems later in life,” explains Israel, “are trauma-based. You compensate for your reaction to traumas that occurred when you were young. Maybe…you felt unloved [or that] you were unlovable…A lot of times, we spend the rest of our lives compensating for those things that were traumatic earlier in life.” [14] X Expert Source Ira Israel Licensed Counselor and Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 26 July 2022. Having family trauma in the past can easily shape the life you build for yourself as an adult. How you’re feeling now may be more about your childhood experiences than anything that’s happening at the present moment. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t find ways to overcome your past trauma and live a good life in the present."
