      "content": "Stand under cool water in the shower for 10 to 20 minutes. If you've just gotten out of the tanning bed, it may take a few minutes or hours to realize you've spent too long in there. As soon as you feel your skin throbbing or notice any redness, hop in the shower and let cool water run over your body for 10 to 20 minutes. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Use low water pressure because too much can be painful on burned skin. Don't use ice-cold water—a little below room temperature is ideal. Water that's too cold can shock your skin. Take a cool shower every few hours for pain relief. If you don't have access to a shower or if you're short on time, wet a washcloth with cool water and lay it over the most burned areas."

      "content": "Pour full-fat or whole milk into cool bath water to ease swelling. Run a cool bath (room temperature to cold) and add 2 cups (470 mL) of full-fat or whole milk. Stir the water and milk around with your hand or foot until it looks cloudy. Hop in and relax for 20 to 30 minutes. As a plus, your skin will feel silky smooth!

As an alternative, use goat's milk or buttermilk for an extra-creamy soak."

      "title": "Apply aloe vera gel all over your body or to the affected areas.",
      "content": "Apply aloe vera gel all over your body or to the affected areas. Use at least a quarter-sized amount of aloe vera gel on each part of your body that's burned. Be gentle when you rub it in because too much pressure can irritate your skin. It'll leave your skin feeling cool and tingly. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can buy aloe vera gel at any drugstore or extract it from the aloe barbadensis plant if you have one. Aloe vera gel works on burns because it has anti-inflammatory properties, promotes blood circulation to the area, and prevents bacteria. Avoid aloe vera products or lotions that have \"caine\" in the name or on the label (like benzocaine or lidocaine). These numbing agents can irritate your skin and may cause allergic reactions."

      "content": "Apply a lotion containing vitamin E or vitamin E oil to treat peeling skin. If your skin is peeling, don't be frugal with vitamin E lotion or oil. Slather it on after getting out of the shower or bathtub and patting your skin dry. You can buy vitamin E oil at any drugstore or beauty supply store. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Look for lotions at the drugstore that advertise vitamin E on the front or have it listed in the top 5 ingredients on the back of the bottle so you know there's a lot of vitamin E in it. Lotions containing vitamin E can decrease redness and swelling caused by the burn."

      "content": "Slather cold oatmeal onto your skin to relieve itching and stinging. Combine 2 cups (256 grams) of dry oats with 3 cups (710 mL) of water and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Stir it every minute or so once it starts steaming. When the oats have absorbed most of the water, remove it from the stove and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the mixture to cool completely. Scoop the mixture into your palm and slather it onto your skin. Leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes and then hop in the shower to rinse it off. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you're worried about oats clogging your shower drain, wet a kitchen towel with cool water and gently wipe the oats off your skin. Then hop in the shower. You may want to put a towel down on the floor so you don't make too much of a mess when you're applying it. You can also buy pre-made packets of colloidal oatmeal to pour into your bathwater. Oats contain anti-inflammatory properties that can help heal dry, itchy, or swollen skin faster."

      "content": "Take an over-the-counter painkiller to relieve swelling and pain. Take 1 to 2 tablets of aspirin or ibuprofen so you can go about your day a little more comfortably. If you're taking prescription medication or other NSAIDs, talk to your doctor before you take any over-the-counter painkiller. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Aspirin is only recommended for adults over 18 because it can cause a potentially fatal condition called Reye's syndrome in teens and children. Children and teens ages 6 to 18 can take acetaminophen instead. Don't take ibuprofen if you have ever had a stomach ulcer, liver disease, or heart failure because it can worsen these conditions.

      "content": "Stay out of the sun as much as possible or wear sunscreen as needed. Stay indoors as much as you can until the burn has healed—the last thing your skin needs is more sunlight! If you can't avoid going out in the sun, be sure to wear SPF 15 or higher. Use a quarter-sized amount of sunscreen on each exposed area (like your arms, neck, chest, and legs) 15 minutes before leaving the house. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For the most protection, use a sunscreen that shields your skin from both UVA and UVB rays. It's important to apply it 15 minutes before going out in the sun so the lotion has time to sink into your skin."

      "content": "Avoid sweating until your sunburn has healed completely. Skip going for a run or going to the gym until you don't notice any redness, inflammation, or stinging. If you need some exercise endorphins, go for an easy walk in the shade or on the treadmill. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source The salt in sweat can irritate your skin and clog the pores on and around the burned area, causing blisters and prolonging the healing time. If it hurts to move your limbs at all, take a few days off from your workout routine. Pulling and stretching the skin not only hurts, but it'll prolong the healing process."

      "title": "Resist the urge to pick at blisters or peeling skin.",
      "content": "Resist the urge to pick at blisters or peeling skin. If you have blisters from your burn, leave them alone. Blisters form natural cushions that help your skin heal, so popping or picking at them can delay the healing process or even put you at risk of an infection. Similarly, it's best not to mess with any skin that's peeling on its own. [11] X Research source If you like, you can put a light moisturizer, such as 100% aloe gel, on the blisters. Just avoid using anything too heavy, like petroleum jelly, since this will trap sweat and heat against your skin."

Hydration speeds up the healing process, so aim to drink at least 11 cups (2,600 mL) a day if you're a woman and 15 cups (3,500 mL) if you're a man.

Remove the bag and sip on the tea 3 to 5 times a day. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also soak a small washcloth in cooled green tea and apply it to your skin to reduce the stinging sensation of a sunburn. Green tea also contains polyphenols that can help stop the progression of skin cancer. Green tea contains 30 to 50 mg of caffeine per bag. If you're sensitive to caffeine, drink decaf green tea instead."

      "content": "Get 400 to 800 IU (10 to 20 mcg) of vitamin D every day. Make an effort to eat foods rich in vitamin D every day for its anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing properties. Fatty fish (tuna, mackerel, salmon), beef liver, cod liver oil, cheese, egg yolks, mushrooms, and fortified milks and cereals are all great sources of vitamin D.
