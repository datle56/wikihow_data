      "content": "Be specific. Make sure to include all the pertinent information relating to your card in your listing.

Whether or not your card is shadowless or holographic. The condition of your card. Is your card used, in good condition or even in mint condition? The set number of your card. For example, the Charizard card would be “base set 4/102”."

For extremely rare cards, you should start the bidding at the price you want for them."

There will be a number that reads like a fraction at the bottom right corner of every card that tells you what number the card is in its set. Next to that number, there should be a tiny shape that tells you how rare the card is. A circle indicates that the card is common and likely not worth much money. A diamond indicates that the card is uncommon. A star indicates that the card is rare. If there is no shape or a different illustration, then the card is part of a promotional set. Promotional cards can be more or less rare depending on what promotion they are a part of. [4] X Research source"

If your card has shiny reflective foil around the picture, then you have a “holographic” card. If the holographic design is on the entire front of the card, then the card is a “reverse-holographic” card and is even more valuable. If there is a copyright of “95,96,98,99” at the bottom of your card and there is no shadow at the edge of the picture, then you have a rare shadowless card."

If you come across an extremely rare card that you suspect is in perfect condition, you can send it to the PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) at psa.com to verify its worth. Having proof that you're card is in great condition will dramatically increase its value. Only send cards you believe are in mint condition. The process can be expensive. The PSA scale ranges from ten for a card in mint condition to one for a card in poor condition. Even the tiniest smudge or scratch can drop a card from mint condition to one in good condition, dropping it in value substantially.

The fossil set has sixty-two cards. The team rocket set has eighty-three cards. You can also group your cards in sets of holographic, shadowless or rare cards."
