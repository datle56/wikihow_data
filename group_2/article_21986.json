      "title": "Locate and identify yarrow.",
      "content": "Locate and identify yarrow. You can find yarrow in a variety of soils. It thrives in lawns, meadows, riverbeds, and fields. Look for stalks that reach 1 to 3 feet (0.3 to 0.9 m) high with fern-like blossoms. During the summer, the heads of yarrow will flower into white or yellow blooms. Each yarrow head will have a few clusters of flowers. [1] X Research source Yarrow looks similar to Queen Anne's lace, but yarrow flowers don't spread as widely as the flowers of Queen Anne's lace. Yarrow also lacks the center spot that Queen Anne's lace has."

      "title": "Plan to harvest yarrow when it blooms in the summer.",
      "content": "Plan to harvest yarrow when it blooms in the summer. Pay attention to when the stalks of yarrow put on buds and wait a few weeks for the buds to open. Most yarrow plants in the northern part of the U.S. bloom between July and September while southern yarrow blooms between late-April and June. If you're unsure when the yarrow in your area will bloom, watch for the buds. They should bloom within a few weeks."

      "title": "Check the yarrow flowers before you harvest.",
      "content": "Check the yarrow flowers before you harvest. Once the white flowers have completely opened on the yarrow plants, pluck off a few leaves with your fingers. Rub the leaves in the palms of your hand and then smell. If you smell a rich, spicy fragrance, the yarrow is ready to harvest. [2] X Research source If you can't smell anything, wait a few days and then check again."

      "title": "Gather the yarrow late in the morning.",
      "content": "Gather the yarrow late in the morning. Wait for the morning dew to dry so the plant isn't wet. It can also help to harvest on a sunny day since the moisture will evaporate faster. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear gloves to protect your hands from contact dermatitis. Although it's rare, some people develop an allergic reaction from handling the yarrow plant, especially when harvesting large quantities. To prevent skin irritation and redness, wear a pair of gardening gloves to harvest the yarrow. [4] X Research source It's also a good idea to wash your hands after harvesting and handling the yarrow."

      "content": "Use pruning shears to cut the yarrow 2 in (5 cm) above the ground. If you want to cut a single stalk or 2, take clean pruning shears and cut the yarrow stalk 2 in (5 cm) above the soil. If you'd like to harvest several stalks, gather them together in the palm of 1 of your hands. Use the pruning shears in your other hand to cut the yarrow near the ground. [5] X Research source You can harvest up to 10 stalks at a time by gathering them together. Use the leaves, flowers, stems, and roots of the plant."
