      "title": "Look at the drains in your basement.",
      "content": "Look at the drains in your basement. Sinks, floor drains, laundry tubs, or wash basins can dry out if they aren’t used regularly. The water under the trap will eventually evaporate with disuse. Without water, sewer gas will leak out of the drains, which will spread throughout your basement over time. You can correct this problem by pouring water and cooking oil into the drains. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Check out the toilets.",
      "content": "Check out the toilets. If you haven’t used your basement toilet for several weeks or months, the water in the trap may have evaporated. As it is with the drains, sewer gas can rise up and leak out of the toilet. The solution to this problem is simple, though. You just need to flush the toilet replace the evaporated water.

      "title": "Smell the fabrics in your basement.",
      "content": "Smell the fabrics in your basement. Due to the increased humidity in basements, fabrics often absorb a lot of moisture. The fabrics may begin to smell if they aren’t cleaned often enough. Walk around and smell any fabrics in your basement. This could mean furniture, clothing, blankets, etc. If the fabric smells musty, it will need to be cleaned or thrown out. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look behind walls and into crawl spaces.",
      "content": "Look behind walls and into crawl spaces. Check behind your basement walls and in your basement's crawl spaces. Look for black mold and any dead (or alive) pests. Even if you don’t find a source, there may still be a musty smell from the humidity. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the ceiling tile and small nooks.",
      "content": "Check the ceiling tile and small nooks. Look at the ceiling tile for any signs of mold. Look in the grout of the ceiling tile as well for discoloration. While you are checking, look into any nooks and grannies of your basement for mold or dampness. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Inspect the pipes for leaks.",
      "content": "Inspect the pipes for leaks. Leaks are a common culprit for basement odors. Walk around your basement and check out all of the pipes. Look at the joints to see if water is dripping or appears to have been leaking. Leaks can often be hard to detect, so call in a professional if you are unsure. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pour water or cooking oil into drains.",
      "content": "Pour water or cooking oil into drains. Getting rid of the sewer smell emitting from drains can usually be taken care of by pouring a pitcher of water down the drains. After you add the water, pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cooking oil down the drain. The cooking oil will act as a seal to prevent the water from evaporating quickly. [7] X Research source Pouring vinegar down the drain can also help eliminate any unpleasant smells. [8] X Research source Kadi Dulude. Cleaning Expert."

      "content": "Remove all mildewed and moldy objects. When you've discovered the source of the musty smell in objects, you have 2 choices: try to clean out the mildew and mold smell from everything infected by it, or simply to throw away whatever has the smell embedded within. If you are unsure whether or not the object can be saved, try to clean it. If the smell is still there, it is probably time to throw it out. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Store books and papers in airtight containers. Cleaning out the musty smell from books and papers can be very difficult. If you keep them, the smell will permeate the basement again, undoing much of your work in cleaning it. If you don't want to throw them away, you'll need to keep them in an airtight container or find a new location to store them. You can find airtight containers at most storage stores. [10] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of space, another option would be to rent a small storage unit."

      "content": "Air out the furniture. If the musty smell is embedded into objects like furniture and rugs, you'll need to take them outside when the weather is dry. Ideally, when the sun is out and humidity is low. Allow them to be aired out and sun-dried for a few hours and, if possible, give them a few good hits with a broom to free dust and other particles that might carry the smell as well.

      "content": "Clean fabrics. If the furniture and rugs are still smelly, scrub them down with a fabric cleaner, which can be bought at many supermarkets. If you have clothes, towels, or blankets that smell, soak them in an all-fabric bleach for 30 minutes. Or, put them into the washing machine on a normal cycle. [12] X Research source Sometimes, even airing out and cleaning will not kill the smell. In this case, it might be easier and more convenient to just start over by purchasing new carpeting and furniture for your basement."

      "content": "Clean with borax. Borax is a natural mineral cleaner that kills fungus. That is why it is a perfect cleaner for basements. To use, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of borax and 1 gallon (3.8 L) into a bucket. Then, use a brush to scrub the walls and floors with the solution. Follow the cleaning by rinsing with water to remove borax residue. [13] X Research source"

Use a brush to scrub any visible stains. The bleach will remove the color from the stain and sanitize the area. [14] X Research source If you have windows in the basement, open them up while using bleach. Or, bring a fan into the basement. Wear protective gloves and a face mask before using bleach. Wearing old clothing or putting on an apron is a good idea as well if you don’t want to ruin your clothes."
