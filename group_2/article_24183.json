The location differs from one laptop or computer model to the next. The fingerprint scanner is usually near the keyboard. It may be located on the palm rest area below the keyboard, or integrated into the Power button or the touchpad. You can also check the sides of your computer to see if you can find a fingerprint scanner. Some Mac computers have a fingerprint scanner built into the Magic Mouse."
