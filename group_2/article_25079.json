      "content": "Leave these out around your home to catch spiders when they’re active. These work great if you’ve seen spiders around but you’ve lost sight of them. Place the traps sticky-side up along your walls or where you’ve seen spiders in your home in the past. Put out multiple traps at a time so you’re more likely to catch more spiders. Once a brown recluse steps onto the trap, it will get stuck and die on the glue. Check your glue traps every week to see if there are any spiders. If they are, just put on a pair of gloves and throw the trap away. Just be sure to set out a new trap in its place. Place your glue traps away from pets and young children."

      "content": "Spiders will get exposed to the pesticides and eventually die. Brown recluses tend to get into your home through cracks or crevices, and they walk along the edges of your wall rather than out in the open. Get an aerosol spray pesticide from the store and look around your home to see for any spots where spiders could get in. Apply the pesticide thoroughly over the area so spiders come into contact with it and die. Some pesticides may be unsafe around children and pets. Always read the warning label on the packaging. Spiders may be able to avoid residual pesticides because of their long legs holding them off the ground, so it may not be the most effective."

      "content": "The force of the vacuum kills the spider and cleans any webs. Rather than getting too close to a brown recluse, extend the hose attachment on a vacuum and catch the spider. Run the vacuum over the area where you found the spider to clean up any other webs or eggs that could be nearby. The brown recluse will die as soon as it’s vacuumed up, so you don’t have to worry about it staying alive if you don’t empty the bag."

[7] X Research source Brown recluses can crawl pretty fast, so they may run away if you miss. If you are bitten by a brown recluse , seek medical attention as soon as you can."

      "content": "Control and prevent prey insects so the spiders have nothing to hunt. Brown recluses typically eat cockroaches and crickets, and spiders won’t stick around if they can’t find food. At night, turn off any outdoor lights to avoid attracting any insects. Put away food instead of leaving it out to keep pests away too. [11] X Research source You can also spray pesticides made for cockroaches or put out bait traps to kill them. [12] X Research source Brown recluses can survive up to a few months without eating, so this only works to prevent new spiders from coming in. Diatomaceous earth is a great natural powder you can spread to kill pests as well, though it won’t be effective on brown recluses. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Brown recluses hide in dark, cluttered areas, so deep clean your home. Brown recluses don’t like to be disturbed, so they stay where there isn’t a lot of traffic, such as cluttered closets, bookshelves, and areas underneath beds. Take some time to go through really messy areas in your home and organize everything neatly. Try to keep your home nice and clean so spiders have fewer places to go. [14] X Research source If you ever take out clothes or blankets that you haven’t used in a long time, shake them out just in case there are any brown recluses hiding in the folds. Store trash cans, woodpiles, lawn trimmings, or any other vegetation away from your home if you see brown recluses outside."

      "content": "Bins seal completely so brown recluses can’t hide in your things. Brown recluses love to hide in shoes, clothes, and any tight dark space, so they could get into your things if they’re closed up in cardboard boxes. Instead, get some plastic tote bins or bags and tightly seal your things inside. This works especially well if you’re storing things in a garage, basement, or attic where brown recluse spiders have easier access."
