      "content": "Get 1 sheet of A4 construction paper. A4 is the standard size of paper and measures 8.3 in × 11.7 in (21 cm × 30 cm). Choose your preferred color of construction paper to make the paper roses with. [1] X Research source The number of paper roses that you can make per sheet of paper depends on the size of each rose. In this example, 1 sheet of A4 paper is large enough to make 1 paper rose. You don’t have to use construction paper. Cardstock, scrapbooking paper, music sheets, and old book pages can all also be used. [2] X Research source Popular paper colors for roses are pink, red, white, yellow, orange, and blue.

      "title": "Cut 1 4 in (10 cm) circle out of the construction paper.",
      "content": "Cut 1 4 in (10 cm) circle out of the construction paper. Use a compass or trace something such as a round plastic lid onto the paper. Use a pencil so that you can easily change any mistakes. Once you have drawn the circle, use scissors to cut it out of the construction paper. [4] X Research source For each rose that you want to make, cut out 1 circle. A circle that is 4 in (10 cm) in diameter is just an approximate size. Use smaller or larger circles to adjust the size of your paper rose. [5] X Research source If you are wanting to make smaller roses, trace around a circular coffee mug. [6] X Research source For an uneven variation, try using a utility knife and doing it by hand."

      "content": "Draw a spiral within the circle. Use a pencil to draw a spiral that begins along the edge of the circle and ends in the center. Start the spiral narrow and make it become wider towards the center. The center of the spiral needs to be approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. [7] X Research source Alternatively, you don’t need to draw a spiral on the circle if you feel confident in cutting one without having a guideline. You can draw a spiral with slightly wavy edges rather than straight if you prefer. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll the paper tightly in the spiral shape. Begin at the narrow end of the spiral and roll the paper towards the center. At the beginning of the spiral where it is very narrow, you may need to fold the paper in rather than roll it. This is the center of the rose. [10] X Research source Roll the paper tightly so that it doesn’t easily unravel."

Simply press the center of the spiral firmly over the bottom of the base of the rolled paper. The rolled paper will rest on the flat surface. [11] X Research source The flat base is the bottom of the rose."

      "content": "Let the rose uncoil to your preferred size. Slowly release the pressure that you are using to hold the rose together. This makes the rose gradually uncoil and become larger. Stop letting the rose unravel when it is the size that you want. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Glue the base to the bottom of the rose.",
      "content": "Glue the base to the bottom of the rose. Once the rose is your desired size, place a dollop of hot glue in the center of the flat base. Then push the spiral rose against the base to hold it together. You may have to hold the rose in place for around 1 minute while you are waiting for the hot glue to dry . [13] X Research source Be careful, since you can burn your skin if you get hot glue on it! Once the glue is dry, the rose is complete and ready to use. Alternatively, you can use craft glue rather than hot glue, however, this will take a much longer time to dry. If you’ve never used a glue gun , simply plug it in and slide the glue stick through the back. Push the trigger a few times and wait for the hot glue to come out of the nozzle."

Then cut out the 4 squares using scissors. [14] X Research source You need 4 squares to make 1 paper rose. Make more squares if you want to create more paper roses at the same time. Cardstock is the best to use for this type of paper rose because it is strong enough to hold all of the layers and glue together."

Leave the first rose pattern as it is. Remove 1 petal from the second pattern, 2 petals from the third pattern, and 3 petals from the fourth pattern. [22] X Research source This means that the first pattern has all 6 petals, the second has 5 petals remaining, the third has 4 petals remaining, and the fourth has only 3 petals remaining. [23] X Research source The petals that you have cut out that you need to keep are the group of 2 petals and the 1 single petal. The rest can be discarded. [24] X Research source"

Make such that the ring in the center of the 6 petal rose is completely covered. This is the base of the rose. [26] X Research source The size of the circular piece of paper depends on the amount of paper that you cut out to create the petal shapes. Approximately 2 in (5.1 cm) will work in most cases. Measure the size of the ring first if you are unsure."

Then place the 4-petal rose into the center of the 5-petal rose and so on until you reach the final 1 petal rose layer. The end result forms a rose shape. [27] X Research source To attach the layers, place the glue around the base of the rose. Then press the layer of petals onto the base to help it stick together. Repeat this process for each layer of petals. Use either a hot glue gun or craft glue to attach each layer. Let the rose dry once it is complete. [28] X Research source"
