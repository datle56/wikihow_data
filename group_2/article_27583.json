      "title": "Combine equal parts Benadryl and Maalox.",
      "content": "Combine equal parts Benadryl and Maalox. You can make your own simple magic mouthwash by mixing the liquid forms of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (often sold as Benadryl) and aluminum or magnesium hydroxide (Maalox or Mylanta). Stir together equal amounts of each medication—for example, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) each. [1] X Research source Benadryl is an anticholinergic and antihistamine, which can help reduce inflammation and pain. The Maalox coats the inside of your mouth and protects the sores as they heal. You can get Benadryl and Maalox or Mylanta in your drug store or the pharmacy section of the grocery store. Unlike the prescription version of magic mouthwash, the “lite” version doesn’t have any numbing agents in it. However, it can still soothe your sores and help them heal faster."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about magic mouthwash if you have mouth sores. A prescription is the easiest way to get magic mouthwash. If you have sores in your mouth, ask your doctor for a prescription that’s tailored to your needs. If they think it’s right for you, you can pick it up from your local pharmacy and start using it right away. Magic mouthwash formulas vary, but most of them contain a mixture of antibiotics, antifungals, steroids or antihistamines, and some sort of numbing agent (such as lidocaine).

      "content": "Get the ingredients from your doctor to mix your own. In some cases, your doctor may give you special instructions to make your own magic mouthwash from ingredients you can purchase separately. You might need a prescription for some of the ingredients, such as viscous lidocaine. Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully to make sure you mix it correctly and use the right amount of each ingredient. For instance, your doctor might recommend mixing 1 to 3 parts Maalox with 1 part viscous lidocaine. One advantage of mixing your own mouthwash is that it is usually less expensive than the pre-mixed prescription version."

You might also have problems with drowsiness or changes in your sense of taste. The side effects are usually mild, and they’ll go away after you stop using magic mouthwash. However, don’t hesitate to call your doctor if something is worrying you. You’re more likely to notice side effects if you swallow your magic mouthwash instead of spitting it out. If you accidentally swallow a large amount of magic mouthwash, call your doctor or a poison control center. Keep the bottle on hand so you can tell them what ingredients are in your mouthwash."
