This is a hard area to detect, but with some practice you can stop eating at just the right time. Satisfied is a lack of hunger, a slight disinterest in your meal and a feeling that the food you've eaten will hold you for a few hours. Full feels like a slight to large stretching sensation in your stomach, the thought that those last few bites were too much or you've had second portions. Eat your meal slowly. Taking your time with your meal will help your brain and stomach communicate that you're satisfied and help you stop before you're full.
