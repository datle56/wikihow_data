      "title": "Clean up",
      "content": "Clean up more often. If you're not the tidy one in the relationship, an easy way to impress your girlfriend is to be better about cleaning up around the house. Start by just cleaning up after yourself: clean up your dishes immediately after meals, get that laundry off the floor, and so on. Then, move on to general jobs such as cleaning the bathroom every week or vacuuming. Any decent guy will do this already. [1] X Research source Cleaning up after her is a given, of course. Saving her the time will only impress your girlfriend if you are usually a lazy slob. By cleaning like this, you will surprise your girlfriend by showing her your responsible side. Hopefully she already knows you have one. This applies even if you don't live together. You still spend time in each other's houses and taking responsibility - especially in a house that isn't yours - will really impress her."

      "content": "Take her out on a great date . [2] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. Take her somewhere that is beyond the standard dinner and movie. This will show her that you're creative and serious about her. Try to go somewhere you've never been or eat food you've never tried. Remember that expensive doesn't always mean good. A midnight picnic with hot home made soup and warm rolls and a beautiful starry night is inexpensive and romantic. [3] X Research source You can try going on a geocaching date for something adventurous. [4] X Research source See if there's an Ethiopian restaurant in your area. Ethiopian food is very different from Western food but still has some Western aspects; a great opportunity to try something new without dooming yourself to a miserable meal. Do things together; it does not have to be expensive. Even an evening walk together, or a bike ride, or a car ride to get ice cream can be showing you care for her and want to spend time together."

      "content": "Experience and learn what she is interested in. When you take a real interest in the things that she cares about, you'll see just how happy she is. Educate yourself on her favorite hobbies, movies, music, or charitable cause. Read up using the internet as a resource and then follow it up with some real life experience. Ask if you can join her in one of these interests and make it a date! If you don't know what her interests are, that could be half your problem right there! Talk to her about what she is interested in--most women are more than happy to talk about this. Speak to her best friend, her mother, brother or sister if possible to find out more about your girlfriend's interests, hobbies and childhood passion. You might find out she always wanted a rocking horse as a little girl, you could take her to a toy museum for a fun date, buy her a print of a rocking horse, or just a card or even offer to go pony trekking. Finding out little details and building gifts or activities around them will impress."

      "title": "Show some ambition and confidence.",
      "content": "Show some ambition and confidence. Women are attracted to guys that are willing to pursue their dreams and demand more from life --and fight to get it! Women are attracted to men that care enough about life to have a good job, or at least the goal to have a good job, rather than be a couch potato that they have to support. If you tend to be a little too complacent in life, try starting from scratch and pursue something that ignites your passion for life. Try a big life goal: a new career or go back to school, for example. Ambition can also be with an interest with goals. For instance, taking up a martial art , or learning to play guitar , or run a marathon . Ambition can also be helping others, such as volunteering for an animal shelter, tutoring seniors on using computers, or building trails at a local park. Reader Poll: We asked 1673 wikiHow readers, and only 3% thought that talking about your own achievements was a good way to make yourself seem more confident. [Take Poll] In fact, sometimes it can actually have the opposite effectâ€”try listening to her more instead!"

      "content": "Ask for and take her advice. Women are often trained by society to believe that no one will ever really want or take their opinion, even if they don't really realize it. When you ask for her advice on something, you'll be subtly telling her that you think she's wise and capable. Of course, actually using her advice is a crucial part of communicating that you're serious in your respect towards her. For example, if your buddy has been having trouble with his girlfriend and asked you for advice, get her opinion on the situation. If you've been having problems with your boss, talk to her and see if she has any ideas about how you can fix the situation."

When you are with her, make sure that your attention is primarily on her. Avoid taking unnecessary phone calls and texts. Do not flirt with other women or dress to appeal to women other than her.

      "content": "Practice true chivalry . True chivalry is when you show her true respect. Do things like open doors for her because it's the nice thing to do. Defend her because she shouldn't have to defend herself to others. Take her side against your friends when they're being jerks. And do all of this without putting pressure on her or having expectations. A good guy does these things because they're the right thing to do, not because he expects to get laid later. [6] X Research source Women expect guys to expect physical rewards for good behavior. Proving that idea wrong by letting her come to you will surprise her and make her happy."

      "content": "Don't smack talk other people. Don't be rude to other people or insult them behind their back. When you do this, you send the message to her that you might be doing the same to her. She'll be especially impressed when you act like the adult and be the bigger person when other people are being jerks to you or when your friends are being really immature."

      "content": "Be helpful and respectful to vulnerable people. When we show respect to even the most vulnerable people around us, that says a lot about our character. It's easy to make fun of or be mean to homeless people, mentally ill people, door-to-door salesmen, and waiters...and so many people often are. If you want to clearly send her the message that you're a good guy, be nice to these people and help them when you can. Be a good tipper. Traditional tip amount in the US is 20%, which is often calculated by simply doubling the tax."

Learn how to play with kids but remember: a lot of the time they just want to play the same \"pretend\" games that you did when you were young. Channel your inner pirate and you'll be having fun with them before you know it."

Bid backhanded compliments and compliments that actually piss her off goodbye: you're going to become the king of the compliment. Focus on complimenting honestly and in the moment. Avoid compliments that could be for just about any girl or other cookie cutter compliments (\"you have beautiful eyes\", for example). Be specific, try to shoot for traits she values in herself, and try to only compliment things she has control over. [8] X Research source For example, if you compliment her figure (which she has minimal control over and may someday lose), she'll become neurotic about what you think of any weight she gains because she thinks it's the only thing you value in her. Instead compliment her intelligence, her humor, her kindness, or her determination."

Cooking her a great meal, especially when you don't normally cook, not only reduces her stress but it will be one incredible unexpected surprise. You can find lots of cooking articles here on wikiHow that can show you step by step what to do (for the kitchen inept). Breakfast in bed often impresses. Make crepes with Nutella and bananas to really make her think you've gone gourmet. Try avocado pasta if you want a dinner option instead. This is easy to make, takes less than an hour to prepare, and can easily look gourmet when garnished with sun-dried tomatoes and fresh Parmesan."
