The iron golem drops iron into hoppers connected to a chest. [1] X Research source Note: These amounts are an estimate for a small farm. Collect more materials as needed if you want to make a bigger farm. Another Note: This farm technique will only work for the Java Edition of Minecraft. The Bedrock version requires 10 villagers and different iron golem spawning conditions. 250 solid, non-flammable blocks 130 walls 10 stairs 12 signs 11 water buckets 1 lava bucket 3 beds 3 torches 9 hoppers 2 chests 2 workstations (any workstation will work) 1 trap door (optional, helps with trapping the zombie) 1 name tag (optional, prevents zombie from despawning)"
