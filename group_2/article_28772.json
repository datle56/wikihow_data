      "content": "Use dark and light-colored boards about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Choose 2 different colors of wood to create the alternating pattern of a chessboard. Go with 1 darker and 1 lighter board, each measuring the same thickness. [1] X Research source For example, you could use maple and mahogany boards, or pine and cedar. Visit your local hardware or home improvement store to find quality wooden boards you can use for your chessboard."

      "content": "Measure and cut 4 18 in (46 cm) strips with a circular saw. Take a ruler or tape measure and a pencil to mark your cut lines so the strips are measured evenly. Use a circular saw to carefully cut the strips out of the boards. [2] X Research source Be super cautious using the circular saw to cut your strips. Follow your guidelines and don’t rush it. The width of the boards isn’t really important because you’ll cut them down to size shortly."

      "content": "Mark cut lines and rip the strips down to 2 in (5.1 cm) wide sticks. Use your ruler or tape measure and pencil to mark your cut lines on the strips. Cut them down to even sticks using your circular saw so you end up with 8 total strips—4 dark and 4 light colored ones. [3] X Research source The smaller sticks can be trickier to cut with a circular saw, so use extra caution so you don’t risk injuring yourself. Pro tip: you can ask one of the staff members at a hardware store if they’re able to cut your boards into to 2 in (5.1 cm) wide sticks to save you the trouble!"

      "content": "Arrange the strips in an alternating pattern and apply wood glue. Lay the strips down on a flat surface like a desk or work table. Arrange them in alternating dark and light colors and line them up evenly. Take your wood glue and add a line along the outer edge of each of the strips. Spread the glue around the edge to create an even layer. Then, press the strips together to form an even square. [4] X Research source If there’s any excess glue that oozes out between the strips, wipe it up with a cloth before it has a chance to dry."

      "content": "Clamp the edges of the board with bar clamps and let the glue dry. Take your bar clamps and attach them to the outer edges of the board. Tighten them until the wooden strips are firmly fastened together, but not so tight that it causes the wood to buckle or warp. Check the packaging of the glue for specific drying times and allow it to fully dry and harden. [5] X Research source Some wood glue may recommend that you leave it clamped for a full 24 hours to allow it to dry completely. [6] X Research source"

Once the glue is dry, take your ruler or tape measure and pencil and make guidelines across the alternating pattern. Use your circular saw to make the cuts perpendicular to the original strips so you have even strips with alternating light and dark squares. [7] X Research source"

Line them up evenly to create the classic checkerboard pattern. Spread a line of wood glue to the outer edges of the strips and spread it around to form a thin, even layer. Press the strips together and make sure they’re still lined up evenly. [8] X Research source You’re almost there! Doesn’t it look good? Wipe up any excess glue with a cloth before it has a chance to dry."

      "content": "Clamp the board together and let the glue dry. Take your bar clamps and attach them to the outer edges of the board just like you did with the strips before you cut them. Allow the glue to fully dry according to the recommended time on the packaging. [9] X Research source It’s super important that the glue fully dries and hardens so it’s strong enough to keep your board connected. If you want to add a border to the edge of your chessboard, measure the length of the sides of your board and cut 4 strips from 3 ⁄ 4 by 1 inch (1.9 by 2.5 cm) wood. Spread an even, thin layer of wood glue to the edge of the strips and clamp them into place until the glue dries. [10] X Research source"

Once the glue is fully dry, take sandpaper or an electric sander and start sanding the surface with 80-grit sandpaper. Work your way up to a fine 120-grit sandpaper and go over the surface of your board evenly to polish it smooth. [11] X Research source You can sand the board by hand with sandpaper, but an electric sander is much quicker and easier."

Choose a wood finish that you like and wipe a thin layer over the surface of your board to seal the wood and add to the final look of it. Allow the wood finish to fully dry according to the directions on the packaging and your board is all finished! [12] X Research source Look for wood finish at your local hardware store or home improvement store."

Use square paper so to make measurements easier and more exact. [13] X Research source If you don’t have square paper, trim the paper so it measures 20 by 20 centimetres (7.9 by 7.9 in). You can also use construction paper if you want a sturdier board."

Make sure the lines are evenly spaced apart from each other so you can use them for your board. Draw the lines on both sheets of paper as well. A regulation chessboard has squares that are between 2 to 2.5 inches (5 and 6.5 centimeters), so measure your lines so they match an official board. [14] X Research source"
