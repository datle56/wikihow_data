Make a list of the symptoms that you notice. Frequent, prolonged, and/or seemingly unprovoked sadness Lost interest or pleasure in things that were once enjoyed Significant loss of appetite and/or weight Overeating and/or weight gain Disrupted sleep patterns (either unable to sleep or sleeping too much) Fatigue and/or loss of energy Increased agitation or decreased movement noticeable by others Feelings of worthlessness and/or excessive guilt Difficulty concentrating or feeling uncertain Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, attempting suicide or having a plan for suicide These symptoms may last for 2 weeks or more. They may stop and come back again. These are called “recurrent episodes.” In this case, the symptoms are more than just a “bad day.” They are a severe change in mood that affects the way someone functions in everyday life. If your friend has had a death in the family or another traumatic event, she may exhibit depressive symptoms and not be clinically depressed. Reader Poll: We asked 349 wikiHow readers, and 51% of them agreed that the symptoms of depression they find the most challenging to deal with are intense feelings of sadness and despair .

Counseling psychologists or counselors: Counseling psychology is a field of therapy that focuses on helping skills and helping people overcome difficult times in their lives. This type of therapy can be short or long-term and is often problem-specific and goal-directed. Look for licensed professional counselors (LPCs) or national certified counselors recognized by the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC). Clinical psychologists: These are trained to administer tests to confirm a diagnosis and therefore, tend to focus more psychopathology, or the study of behavioral or mental disorders. [4] X Research source Psychiatrists: These may use psychotherapy and scales or tests in their practice, but are typically seen when medication is an option the patient wants to explore.

Names of some of the most widely used antidepressants can be found by searching for antidepressants online. [10] X Research source If an antidepressant alone isn’t working, your therapist might recommend an antipsychotic. There are 3 antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone) and an antidepressant/antipsychotic combination therapy (fluoxetine/olanzapine) approved to be used along with a standard antidepressant for treating depression when an antidepressant alone is not working. A psychiatrist may suggest trying a few different medications until one seems to work. Some antidepressants backfire on some people. It’s important that you and your loved one monitor how the medication affects them. Take special note of any negative or unwelcome change in mood immediately.

If you have too many personal issues of your own to sort out, you may not be fully able to help your friend. Don't use your friend's problems as a means to avoid your own. Recognize when your efforts to help the other person are keeping you from enjoying your life or taking care of the things that matter the most to you.
