      "content": "Assess whether you have the type of garage door that can have an opener attached. Most newer garage doors with multiple horizontal sections should be compatible with an opener. Older types, such as those that are one solid piece, may need to be replaced before you can install an opener. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a garage door opener.",
      "content": "Choose a garage door opener. There are two basic types of garage door openers, chain driven and belt driven. Both operate in roughly the same way but just use a slightly different part for operation. A belt driven garage door opener can be a bit quieter during operation. Consider this when making the choice of what opener to buy."

      "title": "Prepare your garage door for opener installation.",
      "content": "Prepare your garage door for opener installation. Make sure your garage door is well lubricated and operating properly. The weight of a garage door is supported by the door springs, cables, and pulleys, not the opener. If you can't raise and lower the door normally by hand, do not install the opener until the door is repaired. Remove all ropes or cords attached to the garage door so you won't get tangled in them during installation. Deactivate or remove all existing garage door locks, so they won't accidentally engage and either damage the opener or cause personal injury."

      "title": "Make sure there is an electrical plug in the immediate area of the opener motor.",
      "content": "Make sure there is an electrical plug in the immediate area of the opener motor. They are usually mounted in the ceiling, facing down. You will need to install one, or have one installed by a licensed electrician, if you do not have one already. If you need to install permanent electrical wiring, always disconnect the power at the main breaker box before attempting to wire connections. Always connect the power cord of the garage door opener to a properly grounded outlet to avoid electrical shock."

      "content": "Begin by putting together the main assembly. Your opener should have come with a list of detailed installation instructions, so follow those to begin assembly. First put the rail together. This should come in several pieces that fit easily together. [2] X Research source Attach them together as directed in your installation instructions. Then you will need to slide the carriage (also known as a trolley) over the rail. This is the piece of the opener that will move along the rail, pulling the door open. Attach the rail to the motor compartment. This is the largest piece of the opener and it will be positioned furthest from the garage door. Install the pulley at end of rail, opposite the motor compartment. Then feed the belt or chain through the end of the rail, around the pulley, then around the other end (at the motor). Finally you will attach the end of the belt or chain to the carriage. The end of the chain or belt should have a screw attached to it, so that you can easily attach it to the carriage. This screw will also allow you to adjust the tension of the chain or belt. [3] X Research source"

The instructions your garage door opener came with should have detailed specifications for the blocking. No matter what the size and spacing of the blocking is, be sure that you are attaching it to joists (solid wood) in the ceiling, not just to sheetrock."

The distance from the top of the garage door should be specified in the opener's direction and in most cases you will want it centered on the door.

      "content": "Insert a lightbulb into the socket in the garage door opener compartment, if it has one. The manual or the inside of the compartment should suggest an appropriate wattage for the lightbulb but it's a good idea to buy a lightbulb that is rated for \"rough service\" because of the vibrations it will need to withstand. [5] X Research source The light will turn on whenever the door is opened but may be able to be operated manually as well. Many garage door openers use the light to signal programming changes that are occurring. Be sure to install the lightbulb in your opener so that you can program your garage door successfully."
