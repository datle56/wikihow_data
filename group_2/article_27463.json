      "title": "Add the water, salt, and butter into a pot.",
      "content": "Add the water, salt, and butter into a pot. Set a 1 US qt (0.95 L) pot on the stove and pour 1 c (240 mL) of water into it. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of salt and 1 1/2 tablespoons (21 g) of butter or margarine. [1] X Research source These ingredients make 3 servings. Consult the ingredients chart on your instant potatoes package to determine how much of each ingredient to use for a larger or smaller serving. For a more flavorful dish, substitute water for an equal amount of vegetable or chicken stock."

      "content": "Turn off the heat and stir in 0.5 cups (120 mL) of milk. Once the water is boiling, take the pot off the burner and pour in the milk. If you don't want to use milk, substitute it with an equal amount of chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water. Alternatively, substitute the milk with an equal amount of sour cream, Greek yogurt, or buttermilk for a little extra tang."

      "content": "Stir in the instant potato mix and let it stand for 1 minute. Measure and pour 1 cup (60 g) of instant potato flakes into the pot. With a fork or a wooden spoon, stir the instant potatoes until they’re just mixed, about 10-20 seconds, so they absorb the liquid. Let the mixture rest for about 1 minute to fully hydrate and expand.

    {
      "title": "Fluff the instant mashed potatoes with a fork and serve them.",
      "content": "Fluff the instant mashed potatoes with a fork and serve them. Use a fork to gently stir the mashed potatoes a bit more, adding volume and texture. Then serve the mashed potatoes immediately, while they’re still warm. [4] X Research source Store leftover instant mashed potatoes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, and reheat them later to enjoy as leftovers."

      "content": "Combine the water, milk, salt, and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Pour 1 c (240 mL) of water and 0.5 c (120 mL) of milk into a large microwave-safe bowl. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of salt and 1 1/2 tablespoons (21 g) of butter or margarine. [5] X Research source Substitute the milk with chicken stock, vegetable stock, or extra water for a dairy-free option. These measurements make 3 servings of mashed potatoes. Check the measurements chart on the package for amounts for additional or fewer servings."

      "content": "Stir in 1 cup (60 g) of instant potato mix and serve. Use oven mitts to carefully take the hot bowl out of the microwave. Take the lid off of the bowl and use a fork to stir in the mashed potato flakes until they’re thoroughly incorporated and fluffy. Serve them while they're still hot. [7] X Research source Transfer any leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to 5 days. If your mashed potatoes are a bit too runny, thicken them with a dash of cornstarch or potato starch."

      "title": "Add 1/2 teaspoon (1.5 g) of garlic powder for a savory twist.",
      "content": "Add 1/2 teaspoon (1.5 g) of garlic powder for a savory twist. For a richer flavor, add a dash of garlic powder to the water before you heat it. Avoid using fresh, minced garlic, since it may cook unevenly and won't dissolve as well as powdered garlic. [8] X Research source Alternatively, roast a couple of garlic cloves and mash them into the potatoes. The roast garlic will more easily incorporate than raw, minced garlic."

      "content": "Stir a little sour cream into the instant mashed potatoes. Once the instant mashed potatoes have finished cooking on the stove or in the microwave, stir in 1/3 cup (230 g) of sour cream. It will give the instant mashed potatoes a rich, creamy flavor and texture. [9] X Research source Alternatively, use the same amount of plain yogurt or a few spoonfuls of cream cheese."

    {
      "title": "Replace the water with heavy cream or whole milk.",
      "content": "Replace the water with heavy cream or whole milk. Instead of heating water, use half and half or whole or evaporated milk. These will give a creamier taste and smoother texture, since the fat will help bind the instant potato flakes. [10] X Research source"
