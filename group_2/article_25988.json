      "title": "Locate and open your fireplace’s control panel.",
      "content": "Locate and open your fireplace’s control panel. Most modern gas fireplaces come with a specialized control panel that manages the fixture’s pilot light. For aesthetic purposes, you’ll typically find this panel hidden behind the fireplace’s front screen, which you can open or remove to gain access. [2] X Research source On most gas fireplace models, you can remove the screen by simply tugging it off the device."

      "title": "Turn the control knob to the off position for at least 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Turn the control knob to the off position for at least 5 minutes. Look for a knob on your control panel with the words On , Off , and Pilot on it. If the knob is not in the off position, turn it so that it is. Then, let your fireplace sit for at least 5 minutes, allowing any excess or lingering gas to clear out. If you smell a faint amount of gas, open your windows and doors to ventilate the area. If you smell a large amount of gas, leave the house immediately and call your natural gas provider or propane dealer. If you can’t get a hold of either, call your local fire department."

      "title": "Twist the shutoff valve until it is parallel with the gas line if necessary.",
      "content": "Twist the shutoff valve until it is parallel with the gas line if necessary. Most fireplace manufactures attach a shutoff valve to the device’s gas line, giving you greater control over your natural gas or propane output. If your fixture comes with 1 of these valves, make sure to move it until the handle sits parallel to the gas line, allowing fuel to enter the fireplace. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the control knob down and hit the ignition switch.",
      "content": "Press the control knob down and hit the ignition switch. To ignite the pilot light, press your finger into the center of the control knob and hold it in place. Then, hit the fireplace’s ignition switch, which is typically a red button located near the control knob. Tap the switch until the pilot light ignites. [5] X Research source If the pilot light fails to ignite after multiple attempts, restart the entire process and try again. If it continues to fail, check for any common ignition problems or call a professional for help."

    {
      "title": "Hold the control knob down for at least 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the control knob down for at least 30 seconds. To keep the flame alive, you’ll need to hold the control knob down for a minimum of 30 seconds, possibly even longer. This will give the thermocouple, a safety device that stops the gas flow if the pilot light shuts off, a chance to heat up and register that the pilot is back on. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Move the control knob to the “on” position.",
      "content": "Move the control knob to the “on” position. With the pilot light ignited, turn your fireplace’s control knob from the pilot position to the on position. This will make sure the pilot light stays on indefinitely, allowing you to activate the fireplace whenever you wish using the device’s wall switch or remote control. When you’re finished, remember to replace the fireplace’s front screen if you had to remove it. [7] X Research source Be aware that, while a power outage should not affect your fireplace’s pilot light, it may deactivate any switches regulating the gas output."

      "title": "Remove your fireplace’s outer cover.",
      "content": "Remove your fireplace’s outer cover. For both safety and aesthetic reasons, gas fireplaces come with a front cover separating the fire chamber from the rest of the room. To ignite the pilot light, you’ll need to open or completely remove this cover. These panels are typically made of glass, so lay yours in a safe area to prevent unnecessary damage. [9] X Research source In most cases, you can remove a gas fireplace cover by simply pulling it off the device."

      "title": "Put a fireplace key into the device’s gas valve knob.",
      "content": "Put a fireplace key into the device’s gas valve knob. To ignite your device’s pilot light, you’ll need to insert a fireplace key into the gas valve knob located to the left or right of the fireplace. Once you insert the key, do not turn it until after preparing your lighter, otherwise you may release a dangerous amount of gas into the room. [10] X Research source Some fireplaces may have this key permanently installed in the wall. If you do not have a key, you can purchase a replacement at most home improvement stores. Make sure to check your user manual to see what kind of key the fireplace takes."

      "title": "Hold a long lighter up to the burner and ignite it.",
      "content": "Hold a long lighter up to the burner and ignite it. Before turning the gas valve knob, grab a lighter with a long enough head that you can insert it into the fireplace while keeping your hands away from the fire pit completely. Then, place the head of the lighter next to the device’s burner and pull the lighter’s fuel trigger. Be prepared to move your hands back quickly if the pilot light ignites unexpectedly. [11] X Research source For safety, put on heat resistant gloves before operating the lighter. If you do not have a long enough lighter to safely ignite the fireplace, insert a lit match next to the burner instead. Depending on how far away the gas valve knob is, you may need to have a friend hold the lighter or operate the key."

    {
      "title": "Turn the gas key.",
      "content": "Turn the gas key. With the lighter activated, move the gas valve knob about half a turn counter-clockwise. This will release gas into the fireplace, causing the pilot light to ignite. Be prepared to move back quickly in case the fire ignites stray gas particles and flares out into the immediate surrounding area. [12] X Research source If you smell a small amount of gas, remove the lighter and open your windows and doors to air the room out. If you smell a lot of gas, remove the lighter and exit the house immediately. Then, contact your propane dealer or natural gas provider. If neither are available, contact your local fire department."

      "content": "Replace your thermocouple if the pilot light won’t stay lit. If your pilot light ignites when you activate it but goes out soon after, you may have a defunct thermocouple that needs to be changed out. To do so, disconnect the thermocouple from the burner and remove it with a wrench. Find a matching device at a hardware store, then attach it to your fireplace by following the included instructions. To find your thermocouple, look for a small rod located next to the pilot light burner."
