      "content": "Count calories. Losing five pounds in five weeks can be fairly simple — especially when you count calories. To lose about one pound a week, aim to cut out 500 calories daily from your diet. This generally results in about a one pound weight loss per week. Do not cut out too many calories or eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. This may result in nutrient deficiencies as it can be difficult to consume enough vital nutrients on very low calorie diets."
