You need to make buttons, trap doors, some colored wool, etc. Consider switching to Creative Mode. In Creative Mode, you won't earn any achievements or trophies, but you'll have all the resources you need already in the crafting menu. You won't have to gather materials or worry about dying and losing everything you've gathered."

You can gather wool from sheep using sheers, or by killing them. If you can't find black, or gray sheep, find squid. Squid live in water. Kill the squid and see if the squid dropped some ink. Once you have some ink, head back to the crafting table, put one white wool in the middle slot of the bottom row, then place the ink on top of it. If you can't get gray wool, put the black wool in the same bottom spot, and put bonemeal on top. Then gather the black wool."

Below is a list of some items you may want to add to your kitchen and where you can find them: Iron: Iron can be used to craft buttons, cauldrons (for a sink), buckets, and steel doors. Iron ore is mined in caves using a stone pickaxe and then smelted into Iron bars using a furnace. Sand: Sand is found in and alongside rivers and lakes and mined using a shovel. It can be used to craft sandstone, which can be used for counters and floors. It can also be smelted in a furnace to create glass, which can be used for windows. Granite: Granite is a reddish stone found in caves. It can be mined with a pickaxe. You can use a crafting table to craft polished granite from 4 granite blocks. Clay: Clay can be found by mining clay blocks using a shovel in rivers and lakes. It can be used to craft clay blocks and bricks which make great walls and counters. Nether Quartz Block: Nether quartz blocks can be crafted from nether quartz. You get nether quartz by smelting a nether quartz block mined in the nether in a furnace.
