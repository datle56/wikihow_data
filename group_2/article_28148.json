      "content": "Cut the elastic into two even lengths. You'll want cut them longer than they'll be in the end, because you'll be making them adjustable with the buckles. To make sure you don't cut your elastic lengths too short, measure yourself first. Hold one end of your measuring tape to one side of your waist. Have someone pull the tape across your shoulder and back down to the same place on your waist on your backside. Add 6\" to 12\" to this measurement to make the suspenders adjustable. This should be how long your elastic straps should be cut."
