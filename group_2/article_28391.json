      "content": "Wash your hair about 2-3 times a week. Keeping your hair clean is a must, but washing it too frequently may actually be thinning your hair. [1] X Research source Each wash rinses out oils and nutrients produced by your scalp. Over time, this can cause your hair to become brittle and break, so try to wash your hair as infrequently as possible. [2] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. If you have very fine hair or you exercise (or sweat) a lot, you might need to wash your hair daily. Otherwise, skipping a day or two is perfectly fine. Use conditioner every time you wash your hair to restore moisture. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for a sulfate-free shampoo. Most shampoos and conditioners contain harsh detergents, called sulfates, that can dry out your hair and cause breakage. [4] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. When you're choosing a shampoo, you can stay away from sulfates by avoiding products with the ingredients sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, or ammonium lauryl sulfate. These ingredients are sometimes abbreviated SLS or ALS. [5] X Research source Look for a shampoo that's made with natural ingredients like echinacea, coconut milk, or argan, marula, and jojoba oils. Look for one that's formulated to your hair type, whether that's dry, oily, curly, or damaged. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray your hair with dry shampoo when it looks oily. If your hair gets too oily, it can actually look thinner, which is one of the drawbacks of washing your hair less often. To prevent this, invest in a dry shampoo. Shake the dry shampoo can and hold it 8–10 in (20–25 cm) away from your head, then spray it onto your roots in short bursts. [7] X Research source Just like when you look for a regular shampoo, you should choose a dry shampoo that's formulated for your hair type. If you have very dark hair, look for a dark-tinted dry shampoo so it doesn't leave a chalky white film on your hair."

      "content": "Avoid extensive use of hot tools on your hair. When possible, avoid using a blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron. These tools can burn the ends of your hair, causing split-ends and breakage. [8] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. This, in turn, makes your hair look thinner. If you do want to use heat to style your hair, spray on a heat protectant first, and limit the use of hot tools to about once a week. [9] X Research source Let your hair air-dry when possible, and save styling tools for special occasions. If you don't like the way your hair naturally dries, apply frizz-fighting products to wet hair so that hair dries smoothly. Use the lowest possible temperature setting for your hair type. For example, thin hair may only need a temperature of about 200 °F (93 °C) while thick hair may require a temperature of 350 °F (177 °C). [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Brush your hair starting at the ends and working your way up. Brushing your hair regularly is great for the overall health of your mane, but it can be damaging if done incorrectly. When you're detangling your hair, use a wide-tooth plastic comb to brush out your hair, instead of a bristled brush. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up the hair shaft. Once your hair is detangled, brush from roots to tips with a bristled brush to distribute the natural oils from your scalp through the ends of your hair. Avoid brushing your hair while it’s wet, as this is when your hair is most fragile and prone to breakage. Try to brush your hair once a day to spread out the oils and stimulate the scalp.

Keratin is also found in eggs, which is why this mask is excellent for strengthening your strands. Mix 1-2 eggs (depending on the length of your hair) with about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of fresh aloe vera gel. Completely coat your locks and allow it to soak in for 10-15 minutes. When the time's up, rinse the mask out with warm water.

Massaging the scalp stimulates the hair follicles, helping them to produce hair. Combine these by warming 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 cup (59–118 mL) of your favorite oil to a comfortable temperature, then massage it into your scalp. You can additionally let it set in your hair for 30 to 60 minutes before rinsing it out, or you can just leave it in your hair without rinsing if desired. [15] X Research source To gently warm the oil without risking a burn, place the oil container in a bowl of hot water for about 3 minutes."

      "content": "Minimize your stress . It’s not just an idiom when people blame thinning hair on increased stress levels. If you're noticing your hair thinning, your stress levels could be to blame, and you might not even be aware of it. Taking steps to minimize your stress could create a significant change in your hair's health. Take some time to think about what stresses you out the most, then decide whether to remove the stressor or to learn new coping techniques. [18] X Research source You can't always eliminate stress, but you can change how you deal with it. When you feel stressed out, try practicing deep breathing exercises, go for a run, or try a relaxing activity like yoga or meditation. Practicing mindfulness, where you focus on what's physically around you in the moment rather than worrying about things you can't change, is also an effective technique for managing stress. In some cases, you might be able to make changes that remove the stress from your life. For instance, if you're constantly stressed out about your job, you might consider changing careers. If there's a person in your life who makes you feel stressed, it might be better for you to spend a little time away from them."

However, if your hair is already thin or damaged, extensions might not be your best option, as they can cause more damage. [24] X Research source If you have glue-in or sew-in extensions, they must be replaced every 3 months as your hair grows out. These extensions range in price from $100-$1,000 per set. Clip-in extensions should be taken out at the end of each day. They're much cheaper, but they also look less realistic."
