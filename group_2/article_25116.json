      "content": "If you see mud tubes along the tree trunk, the tree is infested. Subterranean termites are the only termites that attack trees and build mud tubes. They use the mud tubes as \"highways\" so they can travel up and down the tree. The tubes are about the width of the pencil. If you break the tubes open, you'll probably see live worker and soldier termites moving through them. Workers and soldiers are wingless and they have light brown bodies. [1] X Research source In most cases, the damage won't visible on the outside of the tree, so the presence of mud tubes is one of the best indicators. You can also knock on larger branches with your knuckles. If the branches sound hollow, the infestation is pretty advanced. Reproductive subterranean termites have wings and brownish-black bodies. You might see them swarming around the tree in the spring, summer, or fall."

      "content": "Spray the liquid in a 3 ft (91 cm) radius around the base. The active ingredient in this chemical insecticide is bifenthrin. It should kill termites within 24 hours of application, so it's a good choice for severe infestations. [2] X Research source It works by creating a poisonous barrier around the tree, so apply the liquid all over the root flares at the tree base and drench the surrounding soil. For extra protection, spray 2 ft (61 cm) up the trunk, around nearby trees, and along the perimeter of your yard. You can buy bifenthrin-based insecticides online. Read the instructions carefully and do exactly as they say. This is a strong chemical so wear safety googles, long sleeves, gloves, and a dust mask to apply it. If there’s a pond, stream, or well nearby, don’t use chemical termiticides (you’ll poison the water). [3] X Research source"

Look for the active ingredient fipronil. Instructions vary by product so read them carefully before treating the tree. In most cases, you or a licensed professional will drill holes into hollowed out areas in the tree, like infested branches and at the base, and inject the foam. The foam expands to fill the hollow area and kills termites on contact. [4] X Research source Non-repellent insecticidal foam is most effective for getting rid of the main nest at the base of the tree. [5] X Research source Wear safety googles, long sleeves, gloves, and a dust mask when applying chemical treatments. If you feel uncomfortable or don't have experience dealing with termites, hire a professional pest control service or licensed horticultural pest control company to take care of this.

      "content": "Stick the cylinder-shaped bait stations 1–2 ft (30–61 cm) from the base. Bait stations attract termites with their favorite snack: cellulose. The cellulose is treated with a slow-acting insecticide that the termites carry into their colony. 2-3 evenly-spaced bait stations should do the trick. Put 1 station close to the termite’s entry area at the base. [11] X Research source It can take a month (or longer) for bait stations to eradicate a colony, so this isn’t the fastest solution. If your infestation is severe, go with a faster-acting option (like liquid termiticide or foam). If you want to be extra thorough, you can use bait stations as a secondary line of defense after applying chemical treatments. Buy termite bait stations online or hire a professional to set them up for you.application. [12] X Expert Source Joshua Bloom Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020."

If you get the liquid, spray it directly on the affected areas. For the powder variety, mix it with water in a spray bottle before applying it. Focus the spray on the entry way, mud tubes, and any other areas were termites come and go. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Boric acid is still pretty strong; be sure to wear a mask and goggles when you're applying it. This isn’t as effective as chemical treatments, but it’s worth a try if you prefer a natural approach. To mix the powdered type, read the package instructions for specific measurements. Boric acid is non-toxic to birds and most wildlife (including aquatic life). Citrus trees can be a bit sensitive to it, though. You may want to try a different approach if you have a citrus tree infestation. [14] X Research source"

After identifying the infested branches, saw them off the tree and burn them immediately to kill the termites inside.

You can save the tree if the heartwood isn’t infested. If it is, you’ll need to chop down the tree and destroy it so the termites don't attack nearby trees or structures. Unless you have experience with tree removal, hire a professional for this job. You can figure out if the heartwood is infested by: Tapping on the trunk and branches with a rubber mallet. If it sounds hollow when you tap, there’s a good chance the heartwood is affected. [21] X Research source Drilling holes into the tree to inspect hollow-sounding areas. Use a flashlight to peek inside the hole. If the termites have eaten a lot of the dark central wood already, the tree may be too far gone. If you think you can save it, use these holes to inject a termite foam treatment into affected areas. [22] X Research source Peeling away the bark on the higher branches. If the bark comes off easily and you quickly reach heartwood, the branch is infested. Hiring an arborist to inspect the tree.
