    {
      "title": "Take two photos of your subject.",
      "content": "Take two photos of your subject. For 3D, the best subject is one that is completely still, such as landscapes. Start by taking one photo as you normally would. Now, keep the camera level and move it to the side before taking your second photo. One way to do this is to move your camera to the other side or take a step to the side. Do not move too far. The subject should appear identical in the photos besides the very small shift to the right or left."

      "content": "Open both images in photo editing software. Any software will do, as long as it allows you to edit layers and color channels. Photoshop is a common choice and GIMP is a comparable free option. Click on the photos or open them through the software’s file menu. They should open in separate windows."

Name it left or right so you remember which image it is, then press “ok” to convert it to a layer. You can also name the other image by double-clicking it."
