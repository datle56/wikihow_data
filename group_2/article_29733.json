      "content": "Decide on a broadcast method. Today there are a variety of ways you can broadcast a radio show, from online streaming, to traditional broadcasting, and satellite broadcasting. The following are some common broadcasting methods: [1] X Research source Internet streaming: Internet streaming and podcasting is the most accessible form of radio broadcasting. It does not require a broadcast license (though it may require a music license). You don't need fancy equipment. You really only need a computer and a microphone. It is also more accessible to audiences since anyone can listen on their smartphone, tablet, or computer. You can also distribute your show to a variety of internet platforms and streaming services. Traditional broadcasting: Traditional broadcast is when a radio show is broadcast over the air via AM or FM radio signals. This requires a broadcast license and access to professional radio broadcasting equipment and studio. Audiences need a radio receiver to tune in, although some radio shows are also broadcast online simultaneously. Most traditional radio broadcast shows are broadcasts to a local or regional audience, though more popular radio shows may be picked up for syndication and broadcasts from multiple radio stations across the country or world. Digital Audio Broadcast: Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) is similar to traditional broadcasting, except digital signals are broadcast instead of analog signals. This allows for better audio quality, although area coverage isn't as good in some areas. It can also transmit additional data, such as song and artists titles. Most traditional FM radio stations also broadcast in DAB. An updated version of DAB called DAB+ was launched in 2007 and has the potential to allow for more local radio stations. [2] X Research source Satelite: Satelite radio or XM radio is similar to traditional broadcasting, except that it is broadcast over satellite instead of AM or FM radio waves. This allows for better quality and for it to be broadcast to a wider national or international audience. Like traditional broadcasting, satellite radio requires a broadcast license. Audiences also need a satellite radio receiver to listen to satellite radio. Satelite radio is less accessible because it requires expensive equipment to transmit. Most satellite radio broadcasts also require a monthly subscription. This means that in order to broadcast a satellite radio show, you need to be part of an satellite radio network.

      "content": "Listen to other radio shows in your genre. Listen to a wide variety of other radio shows of the type that you’re interested in, whether it’s a talk show, documentary style, audio drama, or a music program. Take notice of the elements that other shows have to help guide what you want to do. Pay attention to the things that another radio show does that keep you engaged and listening. Does the host give fun facts about the music they’re going to play or just played? Are the interviews interesting and easy to follow? Try emulating these elements in your own show. Also take note of the things in a show that make it drag or make you dislike it. Are there too many pauses? Is the host’s voice too monotone or too fast? Think of how you can avoid these things in your own radio show. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide on the basic components of your show.",
      "content": "Decide on the basic components of your show. Think about and write down all the basic information about the radio show you want to create. Decide on the following key elements of your show: Title: Consider carefully the name you choose for your show, as it is the only thing that will stay the same in throughout broadcast. Consider a variety of different titles and be willing to change the title during the development process. Objective: What do you want to accomplish with your show? Is it to inform (informational programs, documentaries), to entertain (musical shows, radio theatre), to do a public service (interviews, reviews, special programs), etc? Decide what the main objective of your show is. Theme: What will you talk about? Decide on a theme or category for the type of content you produce. Is it a political talk show, a true-crime podcast, a comedy talk show, stories of the paranormal, an indie rock showcase? All of these are different themes and categories for a radio show. [5] X Research source Schedule: Decide on a length of time for each broadcast, how often it will air, and for how many weeks or months. Of course, this will be decided by a radio station if you broadcast through one. Audience: Who’s listening? Consider what age group, location, and other demographic categories you are hoping to have as key listeners. Show elements: What are the features of your broadcast? Are there interviews? Music? Live callers? Special guests? Also, think about unique elements that make your show stand out. What makes your show different from the competition? Advertising: If you need or want advertising to support your radio show, you’ll need to seek out sponsors, record advertisements, and decide how and when they’ll be placed within your show."

      "content": "Pick out songs for a music show. Select the songs you’ll play during a radio show that features music selections. Create a playlist or upload songs so that they’re ready to play during a live broadcast or to combine with spoken recordings for a pre-recorded show. In general, choose the highest quality studio recording of a song, unless you specify that you’ll be playing a live or unusual version. Remember to find the “clean” edits of songs that omit curse words if you’re broadcasting on live traditional radio. You may also need to find shortened “radio edits” for songs that are too long. If taping a show that you will edit and put online, you should also record and prepare “wraps,” which are the spoken segments that introduce or recap the music played. You’ll want to edit the music files slightly, with fades or seconds of silence, so the wraps fit in more seamlessly. Talk to radio promoters or publicists. According to social media specialist Isabelle Garson, publicists and radio promoters will often have promotional material from new and upcoming artists that you can play on-air."

      "title": "Gather material for a news or documentary show.",
      "content": "Gather material for a news or documentary show. Plan for an informative, educational, or entertainment radio show that uses primarily spoken audio. Arrange interviews, narration, investigative research, and any other elements necessary to put together a complete story or theme. Book guests for your show if you want to have guests. Conduct quality interviews by maintaining a casual, conversational style and asking your subject further questions to get more information or simply to find a piece of tape that is memorable or noteworthy for your overall story. [6] X Research source Note that if you’re conducting a live interview, as in one with someone live in the studio or calling in over the phone, you should do a pre-interview. This allows you to pose all the questions you will ask in the real interview so your subject is prepared for them and you know how they will answer. Write out an outline for the entire “story” you’re trying to build to make it easier to get the interviews you need, information you want, and “scenes” you’d like to create. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Write a script or outline. Write down what you will say during your show, whether it is narration to tell an overall story, questions to ask an interview subject, or wrap portions between songs in a set. Lay out a basic outline, or a more detailed word-for-word script. Even if your show’s dialogue is meant to be spontaneous or improvised, you should still jot down a general guideline for what to say, points to discuss if you draw a blank, and general lengths for each segment so you don’t talk too much and run over your time. If you’re hoping to have spontaneous dialogue or fill more time, consider having a co-host, guests, or accepting live callers. A co-host you can get along with provides easy banter and contributions so the pressure isn’t all on you, and live callers provide an element of unexpected content. [8] X Research source Book guests that are relevant to your show. If you plan on having guests on your show, reach out to guests that have relevant knowledge of the show’s topic, or guests that have an interest in the topic and an entertaining personality."

      "title": "Schedule your show's time beforehand.",
      "content": "Schedule your show's time beforehand. Don't \"wing it\" in the studio unless you're an experienced broadcaster. Scheduling (or \"blocking\") out the time you have available for your show is a must, especially if it's your first show. Having a plan beforehand allows you to keep the momentum of the show high and makes it harder for you to run out of things to talk about. During your first few shows, you'll inevitably discover that your schedule doesn't perfectly match with reality — some segments may take longer than you anticipated, while others take less time. Take note of these differences and adjust your schedule as needed. Let's say that we've just gotten our first 90-minute political talk radio show. Here's an example of a schedule we might have for our first show: (5 minutes) Theme song and introductions. (20 minutes) Guest interview: Author Jane Smith. (15 minutes) Discussion topic 1: Minimum Wage — too high or too low? (5 minutes) Ads. (10 minutes) Take calls. (15 minutes) Discussion topic 2: Gerrymandering — how big of problem is it in the modern age? (5 minutes) Ads. (10 minutes) Take calls. (5 minutes) Allow guest to plug upcoming events. Follow with farewell and outro music."

Talk to them about the type of show you want to have and ask about their process for new radio show hosts. Make sure to secure radio time on the same day and time each week or day to help build up a larger listenership of people who can expect to hear your show at a certain time. [9] X Research source If you’re looking to be a radio DJ and play music, contact stations that play the type of music you would want to play, i.e. alternative, country, rock, etc. The same goes for spoken audio shows: you will want to reach out to public talk radio stations about your news or documentary-style show. If you’re in high school or college, talk to your school’s radio station about hosting your own show and what’s required for you to do so."

Learn all of the functions of the technology you’ll use (like microphones, speakers, sound mixers, etc.) during live broadcasts so you feel confident operating them on the air. Ask if you can “shadow” another radio show host to get a better feel for how equipment, signals, and procedures go during a real broadcast to learn each step as they go. Or ask if you can do several “dry runs” or demos before going live yourself. This sort of training is typically required by stations anyway. Make sure you understand how to troubleshoot or solve problems with the equipment you use. Though there may be a technician around to assist you if something goes wrong during a broadcast, it’s always best to know how you can address the issue yourself to fix it right away."

Remember to follow guidelines for appropriate language on the radio, and consider what’s appropriate content for your target audience. Consult the FCC’s guidelines and your station’s own rules for what words are prohibited live on air. This should also inform what song lyrics you need to edit or not use if playing music. Note that while your intended audience may be adults commuting to work during your morning show, you may have listening children at that hour as well, for whom adult themes wouldn’t be appropriate. The FCC prohibits obscene content on the radio from 6 am to 10 pm. [12] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source If something goes wrong, like a live caller who’s using inappropriate language or topics, know the procedures in place with your studio and equipment on how to take yourself or a caller off the air and start playing music or another segment. Be aware of the policies of the radio station you work for. Some radio stations may have additional rules that aren’t covered by the FCC. Additionally, some smaller radio stations (i.e. college radio stations) aren’t bound by the rules of the FCC. They may have looser rules than a standard radio station, but they’ll still have their own rules regarding profanity and controversial topics."

Make sure to repeat the basic information about the radio station you’re broadcasting from, as well as your name and/or the name of your show. Remember that listeners could tune in at any time during your show segment, and want to identify what they’re listening to. A radio call sign is the string of four letters that designates the unique transmitting station. The frequency is the number that listeners dial on their radio to get the station’s broadcast. Usually both of these are used to announce and market the station. Consult the staff at your station for their guidelines on how often you should be reiterating the station’s information, as is may vary by station or show. In general, you should introduce the station and your show’s name at the beginning of every wrap portion between music or advertising. Even if you have a pre-recorded show or podcast, you may want to repeat your show’s name after any advertisements you may have included. While you aren’t “marketing” your show or a station as you would with live radio, you can still get the name of your show out there to help get more listeners talking about it on social media, blogs, etc."
