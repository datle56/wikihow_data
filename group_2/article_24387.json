      "content": "Sensing people process information using their 5 senses. If you have a preference for sensing, you’re focused on what you can see, hear, touch, smell, and taste; the meaning you take from information comes from your senses. When a friend tells you a juicy story or you’re learning about a topic in class, you’re concerned about knowing all the facts and details. You might prefer practical applications, such as using AI to automate mundane tasks, over abstract theories, like thinking about the ethics and implications of using AI. [1] X Research source For example, if you put a sensing person in a stranger’s living room and asked them about it, they might tell you that it was cold, the couch was comfy, and they saw a lot of books. If you have a sensing preference, you might agree with statements like: I’m focused on what’s happening right now over future possibilities. I look at facts and details over the big picture. I trust my senses and experiences over having a hunch about something. I like to work with my hands more than brainstorming ideas. I think through things step-by-step instead of making associations."

      "title": "Sensing people tend to be grounded, realistic, and present-focused.",
      "content": "Sensing people tend to be grounded, realistic, and present-focused. People with a sensing preference are interested in how things really are, not how they could be. They like finding practical solutions to problems that help people right now. If you’re a sensor, you probably like having daily routines and knowing what to expect at all times. [2] X Research source People with a sensing preference like to follow step-by-step procedures and concrete items when they tackle projects or learn new skills. Sensing people tend to identify with words like practical, detail-oriented, concrete, logical, and routine."

      "title": "Intuitive people process information using patterns and associations.",
      "content": "Intuitive people process information using patterns and associations. If you have an intuition preference, you read between the lines and create meaning from the information you receive. When a friend comes to you with a problem, you want a broad picture of what happened. You might ask them seemingly unrelated questions leading up to their problem to find patterns in their behavior and connect the dots to what happened. The “Whys” and “What ifs” are what fascinate you, which is why you tend to like abstract ideas and thinking. [3] X Research source For example, if you put an intuitive person in a stranger’s living room and asked them about it, they might speculate that the stranger is from the north, think they have a good taste in furniture, and say they had a feeling the stranger loved books. If you have an intuition preference, you might agree with statements like: I’m excited by future ideas and possibilities over present-day realities. I focus on broad strokes and the big picture over the details. I trust my gut and the connections I make over my senses. I like analyzing things more than working with my hands. I think abstractly and jump between ideas over following a linear process."

      "title": "Intuitive people tend to be innovative, imaginative, and future-focused.",
      "content": "Intuitive people tend to be innovative, imaginative, and future-focused. People with an intuitive preference see the big picture and how new ideas and ways of thinking can shape the future for the better. If an intuitive person is passionate about sustainability, they’re more focused on the effect of alternative energy sources on different communities than actually developing and installing them. They like to dig into a problem, analyze it, and come up with all the different possible ways to solve it. [4] X Research source People with an intuitive preference like to bounce around when they work and love change, so routine tasks and getting bogged down in the details can bore them. Words like abstract, conceptual, imaginative, speculative, and variety tend to resonate with intuitive people."

      "title": "Sensing and intuition are how people take in info according to the MBTI.",
      "content": "Sensing and intuition are how people take in info according to the MBTI. The MBTI, or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is a test that categories people into 1 of 16 personality types which are based on 4 dimensions: introversion (I) or extroversion (E), sensing (S) or intuition (N), thinking (T) or feeling (F), and judging (J) or perceiving (P). Both sensing and intuition relate to how you absorb and process information around you. Sensors rely on their 5 senses to take in information, while intuitives interpret patterns and possibilities. [5] X Research source No one just senses or uses their intuition; your categorization into either type is simply based on which way you tend to process information. So, one isn’t better than the other. To learn more about the MBTI personality test and find out what you are, take an MBTI test online or read about the different MBTI types ."

      "content": "As a sensor, give intuitive people the big picture and use analogies. Whether you’re teaching intuitive students, coworkers, or just talking with your friends, don’t overwhelm them with the details. Go over the general idea of your project, problem, or story and focus on what the implications are. If you have to explain something, use analogies to show what you mean instead of stating cold, hard facts. [6] X Research source For example, you might tell your friend about a big shake-up happening at work. You might briefly explain why it’s happening but focus on how that’s affecting your position and how it could change the future of the company."

      "title": "As an intuitive person, give sensors details and present them logically.",
      "content": "As an intuitive person, give sensors details and present them logically. When you’re telling a story to a sensing friend, leave nothing you saw, heard, or felt unsaid. Give them the play-by-play chronologically and tell them what it means for you or them right now. If you’re explaining a complex idea, tell a sensing person how it applies to the real world and let them learn about it hands-on. [7] X Research source For example, you might be in charge of teaching your coworker a new way to format documents. You might tell them that it’s important to learn because it makes your company more efficient. Then, you’d walk them through each formatting step and give them a chance to practice it with you."

      "content": "Develop your intuition by practicing grounding exercises. As a sensor, it’s important to balance yourself out by learning to trust your gut . Your intuition helps you be more aware of situations around you, recognize people’s intentions, and feel more certain about your decisions. [8] X Research source So, ground and center yourself with exercises like meditation and deep breathing to connect your mind with your surroundings. When you meditate , find a quiet, peaceful place to sit or lie down that is free from distractions like your phone or other people. Reader Poll: We asked 478 wikiHow readers and 68% of them agreed that the best way to make a decision is by carefully analyzing and researching first. [Take Poll] So, this approach may be a good first step toward making decisions more easily."

      "title": "Set long-term goals to prepare for the future.",
      "content": "Set long-term goals to prepare for the future. Sensing people primarily focus on the present, which sometimes means they forget to plan for the months and years ahead. Setting long-term goals helps you stay motivated and work towards achievements in your career and personal life. Just ask yourself what you want your life to look like in 5 years, write down your broad goal, and separate it into smaller, specific items to work on in the coming months. [9] X Research source For example, you might have a long-term goal to run marathons. From that, you might create goals to improve your cardio at the gym and then work yourself up to completing 5k, 10k, and half-marathon races."

      "title": "Learn to embrace change by trying new things.",
      "content": "Learn to embrace change by trying new things. While sensors enjoy their routines, it’s important to shake things up every once in a while and get out of your comfort zone . Trying new things helps you feel fulfilled, grow and develop in your personal life and career, and accept change when life inevitably throws you a curveball. And as a bonus, you might find new ways of doing things that work better for you. [10] X Research source For example, go to a local hole-in-the-wall restaurant that makes experimental meals instead of your favorite pizza joint. You might make a friend at the table next to you or get inspired to cook."

      "title": "Practice mindfulness to focus on the present.",
      "content": "Practice mindfulness to focus on the present. Intuitive people often have their heads in the clouds, which means they’re not always aware of what’s right in front of them. Learning to stay present helps you appreciate day-to-day realities and pick up on important details you might miss. To cultivate this mindset, practice mindfulness techniques like deep breathing, yoga, and going for walks outside. [11] X Research source It’s also great to do deep breathing when you’re feeling stressed. Just inhale slowly for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7, then exhale for 8 seconds."

      "title": "Pay attention to the details to achieve your goals.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the details to achieve your goals. Looking at the big picture is great for understanding a problem, but focusing on all the concrete facts helps you get things done. Whether you’re learning a new skill or completing a project for school or work, write down all the steps you need to take to accomplish your goal . Then, order them sequentially to stay focused and motivated. [12] X Research source For example, you might want to learn how to bake. Instead of jumping straight to soufflés, you might read a few beginner recipe books, make simple recipes like snickerdoodles, and work your way up to more complex desserts."

      "title": "Hone in on 1 thing at a time to make your ideas a reality.",
      "content": "Hone in on 1 thing at a time to make your ideas a reality. Intuitive people thrive on change, so they tend to jump from idea to idea. While it’s great to brainstorm and think creatively, your thoughts might not always translate to action. If you want to put your words into actions, slow down and focus on 1 thing. Reflect on the time and effort it takes to get your goal done, then make a detailed plan with deadlines to achieve it. [13] X Research source For instance, you might want to eliminate all of the pollution in your city. That might not be totally realistic, so instead focus on 1 thing you can do and change, like helping to pick up trash on the side of the road every month."
