      "content": "Eat lean protein. Proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids, which your body needs to produce white blood cells. When the body doesn't get enough protein, it produces fewer white blood cells. This means you can boost your lymphocyte production by eating the right amount of protein. [1] X Research source Great options for lean protein include chicken or turkey breasts without the skin, fish, shellfish, cottage cheese, egg whites, and beans. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source To find out how much protein you should eat, multiply your bodyweight in kilograms by .8. This provides you with the minimum grams of protein you should eat per day. Your body weight is the maximum grams of protein you should eat per day. You can convert your weight from pounds to kilograms by multiplying your weight by .45. Alternatively, you can use an online calculator."

      "content": "Avoid foods that are high in saturated and trans fat. Bad fats like saturated and trans fat thicken your lymphocytes, making them less effective. Reducing your saturated and trans fat consumption can improve your immune system. Additionally, you should choose mono- and poly-unsaturated fats over trans fats or saturated fats. [3] X Research source Replace saturated and trans fat with healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids, which can actually increase lymphocytes. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep your fat consumption to 30% of your calories, with just 5 to 10% of that being saturated fat. You can avoid trans fats by steering clear of hydrogenated oils, commercial baked goods, fried foods, fast food, non-dairy creamer, and margarine.

      "content": "Eat foods that contain beta carotene. Beta carotene supports your immune system by boosting your production of lymphocytes. As a bonus, it also helps protect your body from cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Most doctors recommend between 10,000 and 83,000 IUs per day. If you eat 5 or more servings of vegetables each day, you should reach this daily goal. Beta carotene is a fat-soluble vitamin, so you should eat it with at least 3 grams (0.11 oz) of fat to ensure absorption. For example, you could dip carrots in hummus or eat a salad with a low-fat dressing, such as olive oil mixed with balsamic vinegar. Beta carotene from food is processed differently than a supplement, so you won't get the same benefits. In supplement form, it may cause harm to some people, such as smokers. You can find beta carotene in sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, romaine lettuce, butternut squash, cantaloupe, and dried apricots."

Your body requires zinc to make lymphocytes, so make sure that you reach your recommended daily requirements. Men should aim to eat at least 11 mg of zinc per day, while women should eat at least 8 mg. Women who are pregnant should eat at least 11 mg of zinc per day, while lactating women should eat 12 mg.

      "content": "Take vitamin C. Vitamin C increases your body's production of white blood cells, including lymphocytes. While you can eat your vitamin C, it's also readily available as a supplement. Since your body does not make or store vitamin C, you should eat sources of the nutrient every day. When you take vitamin C, your body uses what it needs and excretes the rest. This means that you would need to take the vitamin C every day. Always talk to your doctor before taking any vitamins or supplements. Supplements can sometimes interfere with the absorption of other medications, vitamins, or minerals. Supplements can be expensive. If you are eating fruits and vegetables to get your vitamin C every day, you may not need a vitamin C supplement."

People who are generally healthy need less, while people who are less healthy may require more. Since vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin, you should take it with a meal that contains at least 3 grams (0.11 oz) of fat. If you want to eat your vitamin E, great options include sunflower seeds, almonds, spinach, safflower oil, beet greens, canned pumpkin, red peppers, asparagus, collard greens, mango, avocado, and peanut butter.
