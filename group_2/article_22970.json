      "title": "A Scorpio man will size you up before making the first move.",
      "content": "A Scorpio man will size you up before making the first move. Although passionate, he's rather shy. You may feel his gaze on you from across the room or notice him averting his gaze when he looks your way. If you haven't noticed this behavior yet, don't be afraid to lock eyes with him first. This is a great way to say, \"Hey, I'm interested in you. Let's chat!\""

      "title": "Passionate Scorpio will need to build up the courage to talk to you.",
      "content": "Passionate Scorpio will need to build up the courage to talk to you. He's got a lot going on in that pretty little head, and he's wary of who he shares himself with. If he suddenly turns quiet or timid when you're near, he likes you. Start a friendly conversation with him by asking, \"Hey, what classes are you taking this semester?\" or, \"Nice day, isn't it?\" There's no shame in taking the first step, and he'll appreciate you stepping up and introducing yourself (after all, he's probably been daydreaming about this moment!)

      "title": "A Scorpio man might chase you with a wink or charming smile.",
      "content": "A Scorpio man might chase you with a wink or charming smile. Although emotional, Scorpio likes to keep all those mushy-gushy feelings locked inside. But if he really likes you, he'll go against his very nature and be a little flirtatious, showing off that passionate side you desperately want to meet. Get out there and flirt back! Toss your hair over your shoulder, wink, or even go as far as a bend and snap—show him you notice him and like what you see."

      "title": "Emotional Scorpio will throw hints your way if he like you.",
      "content": "Emotional Scorpio will throw hints your way if he like you. Maybe he compliments your outfit, laughs at your jokes, or says, \"You're probably the smartest person here.\" Being a fixed water sign, Scorpio won't always be direct. How you react to his compliments is a little test to see if you can read between the lines—are you worth pursuing? Tell him you know exactly what he's saying by sending a flirty compliment his way. Try something like, \"I like your shirt. There's something sexy about a guy in pink,\" or, \"I literally can't stop looking at your smile.\""

      "title": "All-or-nothing Scorpio will be at your beck and call if he likes you.",
      "content": "All-or-nothing Scorpio will be at your beck and call if he likes you. He'll be eager to help you with just about anything—homework, cleaning up, you name it! If he's constantly asking you if you need anything, he's pursuing you. Give him things to do to help or, better yet, give him an adventure. Scorpio is all about living life to the fullest with the people they love, so ask him to help you build an escape room, plan a trip, or go on a hike—the more adventurous, the better!"

      "title": "If he likes you, Scorpio won't be afraid to physically show you.",
      "content": "If he likes you, Scorpio won't be afraid to physically show you. Ruled by the 8th House , he's extremely sensual, wanting to explore the physical and sexual transformations of love. Now, this doesn't mean he will chase you down the street and tackle you then and there, but he will find ways to stand next to you or graze shoulders. Lean into his touch to say, \"I like you too.\""

      "title": "Intense Scorpio will stop at nothing to capture your attention.",
      "content": "Intense Scorpio will stop at nothing to capture your attention. With Mars being one of his rulers, he's a passionate ball of energy. [1] X Research source If he's pursuing you, he'll become a bit of a showboat when you're near—making his voice louder, acting more \"manly,\" and trying to look his very best. You may even notice he's started dressing better. Acknowledge his efforts with a compliment or genuine smile. This will tell him the chase is working, and you're starting to look his way (as if you hadn't been already!)"

      "title": "A Scorpio man needs to get to know someone before making it official.",
      "content": "A Scorpio man needs to get to know someone before making it official. Because of this, he'll want to spend every waking moment with you. He might start asking you out every weekend or texting you after work to see if you're free. This is all part of his chase, wanting to show you what a life with him would be like and warning everyone else to back away. Scorpio's passion can get a bit overwhelming at times, but thankfully he's very aware of boundaries. Let him know when you are and aren't free and stick with it. He'll respect your space and love spending time with you."

      "title": "Tenacious Scorpio will appear everywhere if he likes you.",
      "content": "Tenacious Scorpio will appear everywhere if he likes you. He's got your schedule down to a T, from when you go to work to what classes you're in. This isn't to be creepy, as that's his last intention, but to \"bump into you.\" He's determined to win you on this chase, and part of that's making himself available. If this behavior is creeping you out, let him know. Stalking is no joke. If he continues to pursue you in an uncomfortable way after you've asked him to stop, contact someone you trust."

      "title": "Guarded Scorpio will only pursue someone truly trustworthy.",
      "content": "Guarded Scorpio will only pursue someone truly trustworthy. One of the final parts of his chase is to see how you react to his complex thoughts. There's a constant fear in the back of his mind that everyone's judging him, which is why he puts on the whole \"mysterious bad boy\" persona. But if he really likes you, he'll drop the act and show you his true self. [2] X Research source He won't commit to just anyone, so reveal your true self in return. The moment he can trust you, you're in it for the long haul."

      "content": "Public displays of affection are a big deal for a Scorpio man. He trusts you if he reaches for your hand where others can see. Believe it or not, he's the most sensual of all the zodiacs. The second his fingers wrap around yours, he's claiming you as his own. If he hasn't reached for your hand yet, don't panic! He's probably waiting for the perfect moment. Remain loyal and affectionate, and you'll soon see the wonders of winning this water sign."
