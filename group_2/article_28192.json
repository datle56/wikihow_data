For this recipe, you will need 2/3 cup of baking soda, 1 teaspoon fine sea salt, 1 to 2 teaspoons peppermint extract or other essential oil, and filtered water. [1] X Research source Sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as baking soda) polishes the teeth and eliminates bad breath eliminating acids and creating an alkaline pH. Another great advantage is that it is relatively inexpensive. [2] X Research source Salt acts as an abrasive that helps remove plaque. It also causes you to salivate, and saliva is nature’s method of protecting teeth. It also provides minerals that help protect your enamel, and this effect is increased when combined with baking soda. The essential oil is for taste. The water is for consistency."

      "content": "Mix together 2/3 cup baking soda and 1 teaspoon sea salt. Make sure that the sea salt is mixed thoroughly with the baking soda. When you look closely at the mixture, you should not see clumps of sea salt among the baking soda, but rather the salt should be dispersed so that it is difficult to pick out from the baking soda. This can be accomplished using a fork or whisk, which will help break up any clumps of salt. Leaving big clumps of sea salt can be harmful when brushing, so make sure to mix everything together until it is the same consistency."
