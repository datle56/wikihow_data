      "title": "Get a PVC pipe, coupler, cleanout, plug, and toilet flange.",
      "content": "Get a PVC pipe, coupler, cleanout, plug, and toilet flange. To make a poop tube from scratch, get a length of PVC piping at least 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter and 10–12 inches (25–30 cm) long. Then, get a PVC coupler that is roughly 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) in diameter and 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) in length. You’ll also need a 4 in (10 cm) PVC cleanout and plug. Finally, buy a PVC toilet flange that is 4.25 in (10.8 cm) in diameter. Purchase some PVC cement while you’re at the store to make things easy. [1] X Research source A PVC pipe is a length of white plastic that doesn’t have any threading on the ends. It is used in water and sewage lines and is typically joined to other pipes using a coupler or adapter. Despite its name, a PVC cleanout and plug is sold as one piece. It has a cap on the end of a threaded material and is usually used to close off plumbing pipes and water lines. The coupler may be labelled as 4 inches (10 cm), but it’s usually around 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) in diameter. Couplers are designed to join PVC pipes of the same size together, thus the difference in the diameter. The same goes for the toilet flange. The toilet flange is a length of PVC used to connect a toilet to a drain line. It has a thread on one end and a cap. Make sure that your toilet flange doesn’t have screw holes in it. The openings have to be embedded in a metal rim around it for this piece to work."

      "title": "Remove the metal collar on the toilet flange with a mallet.",
      "content": "Remove the metal collar on the toilet flange with a mallet. Set your toilet flange on a hard surface and grab a mallet. Brace the flange on the side with your non-dominant hand to keep it still. Strike the metal collar on the opposite side to knock it loose. Once the collar is separated from the PVC pipe, slide it off the end and discard it. [2] X Research source You can use a hammer or the back of a wrench to strike the collar off if you don’t have a mallet."

      "title": "Connect the longer tube to the flange with PVC cement.",
      "content": "Connect the longer tube to the flange with PVC cement. Turn the collar upside down in your hand so that the end where the rim used to be is in your palm. Open a bottle of PVC cement and use the built-in brush to coat the interior of the flange and the exterior side of the tube. Then, slide the long tube into the flange so that the 2 layers of cement meet. Push the pieces together so that the top of the flange and the top of the tube are flush. [3] X Research source The flange should be on the outside of the tube. This is the bottom of your tube. Twist the cap into the threading at the end of this piece to seal it. If you want to permanently shut this end, add PVC cement to the threading before twisting it closed. Many people prefer to leave an opening at both ends to make cleaning easier, though. Do not use PVC glue instead of PVC cement. While many people think that they’re the same thing, PVC cement actually binds PVC pieces together. Glue simply keeps them in place, which is usually good enough for a closed piping system but won’t work for a poop tube."

      "title": "Attach the coupler to the tube on the opposite end.",
      "content": "Attach the coupler to the tube on the opposite end. Take your coupler and pick it up in your non-dominant hand. Then, brush PVC cement along the interior of the coupler. Add cement to the exterior of your tube on the opposite side of the flange. Slide the coupler over the tube until the tube is in the middle of the coupler. [4] X Research source This is the top of your poop tube. There needs to be a little bit of space at the top for your cap, so don’t make these 2 pieces flush."

      "title": "Glue the coupler to the cleanout and plug to add your cap.",
      "content": "Glue the coupler to the cleanout and plug to add your cap. To finish, brush PVC cement around the interior section of your coupler that sticks up past the longer PVC pipe it is connected to. Then, add PVC cement to the exterior of the cleanout and plug, just beneath the rim of the cap where it sticks out. Slide the cleanout and plug inside of the coupler with the cap facing up and push the cleanout and plug down until it connects with the longer tube inside of the coupler. Wait at least 12 hours for the PVC cement to fully settle. When you want to open or close your tube, simply twist the cap off."

      "title": "Poop on a paper towel or inside of a plastic bag.",
      "content": "Poop on a paper towel or inside of a plastic bag. People rarely go directly into the poop tube. Instead, poop directly onto a paper product if you’re on the ground or a plastic bag if you’re rock climbing. To have a bowel movement on a paper product, lay it out flat on the ground and squat over it. To go into a plastic bag when you’re climbing, hold the handles of the plastic bag and spread it out underneath you. [5] X Research source Many people opt to use coffee filters. The advantage of coffee filters is that they have a built-in lip around the edges which makes them easy to fold up. The disadvantage is that they’re pretty thin and small when compared to other options. Some outdoor enthusiasts prefer paper towels. Paper towels are good because you can rip off as many pieces as you need. The downside is that paper towels are a little harder to carry and can blow away in the wind. If you’re using plastic bags, make sure that you inspect each bag for holes before packing them in your backpack."

      "title": "Fold your paper product over or close the plastic bag.",
      "content": "Fold your paper product over or close the plastic bag. If you’ve pooped on a paper product, lift each corner of the paper and bring it over the center of the paper. Pinch the corners together to lift the paper up. If you’ve taken your bowel movement over a plastic bag, raise the handles out in front of you and tie the handles together in a simple knot. If you want to ensure that your hands stay clean, pack some disposable rubber gloves in your hiking or climbing gear. Put them on before you use the poop tube and throw them in with your waste when you’re done."

      "title": "Stick the paper or plastic inside a sealable airtight bag.",
      "content": "Stick the paper or plastic inside a sealable airtight bag. Next, grab a large, sealable plastic bag—a heavy-duty freezer bag or food storage bag will work well. Open it and spread the opening out wide. Carefully drop your plastic bag or paper product into the bag. If you’re up in the air during a long climb, use your non-dominant hand to hold the airtight bag open in your lap while you guide the dirty plastic bag into it."

      "title": "Seal your bag and stick it inside of your poop tube.",
      "content": "Seal your bag and stick it inside of your poop tube. With your poop inside the airtight plastic bag, seal it while gently forcing air out through the top of the bag. Then, gently roll the plastic bag up and open your poop tube. Slide the bag into the poop tube on its side and close the cap tight to finish using your poop tube. Clean your poop tube thoroughly after every use. Once you’ve thrown away your used bags, clean the tube with warm water, soap, and a washcloth. Let the tube air dry outside and wash your hands with soap and water."
