      "content": "Prepare your credentials. In order to get a press pass you're going to need credentials, or records that prove you work for a media outlet. Use previous articles or coverage that relates to the event you're interested in. It will benefit the promoters to see your style of work and your demographic as it pertains to the event in question. [1] X Research source One of the best ways to prove your affiliation with a news source is to make contact using a work email address. On your work email address, make sure to include a signature that says your role for the company. For example: \"Gerald Straton / Photographer and Editor for L.A. Underground News\" An ID produced by either your newspaper or broadcasting outlet may be helpful as well."

      "content": "Make contact with the press office. Try to contact them as early as possible. Let them know who you are and who you work for. Often a press office will go by the name, public affairs office, or public relations. You may need to sell them on why they want access to an event, and how you would provide them with positive coverage. You’ll be required to offer information about your publication or blog's followers that will benefit from the coverage. Craft a simple but professional email pitch. You could begin with, “Hello, My name is ________ and I am an avid photojournalist from ________. I am reaching out with an interest in applying for a photo pass for the Switchfoot Fest this coming July.” [2] X Research source"
