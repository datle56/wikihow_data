For this project, you'll need: at least 10' of 5/8\" by 7/8\" vinyl tubing, an empty clear plastic bottle, a 1/2\" ball valve, three 1/2\" male hose adapters, and plumber's tape. You can always use more than 10' of 5/8\" by 7/8\" vinyl tubing if you need your siphon to be longer than 10'. These can all be found in a hardware store, usually the irrigation section. You'll also need scissors, a wrench, and a lighter."

      "content": "Drill a hole in the bottle. First, take off any labels on the plastic bottle. Wash it out if it had something besides water in it. Drill a 3/4\" hole in the cap of the bottle. The easiest way to do this is with the cap still on the bottle, tightly screwed."

Attach one end of this 3' to 4' tube to the male hose adapter connected to the bottle, and attach the other end to one of the male hose adapters on the ball valve. Attach one end of the remaining tubing to the last male hose adapter. [1] X Research source The function of the ball valve is to give you the ability to stop and start the siphoning without having to put your mouth back on the tube that's been in dirty water."

To siphon your homebrewed beer, or other beverage, from one container to another you need: a rubber sink stopper anywhere from 1 and 1/8th inch to 1 and 1/4 inch in diameter, 2 feet (0.61 m) of 1/4th inch tubing, three feet of 3/8th inch tubing, scissors, and a drill or a dremel. [2] X Research source You need to have a drill bit that's smaller than 1/4th of an inch. The rubber sink stopper needs to be the kind that's concave or hollow on the side that goes into the sink, not solid."

Place the sink stopper on the opening of the bottle you're siphoning into, and run the tube down to the bottom of the bottle. If the tube doesn't fit in the hole, you can drill it a little bit bigger, but be careful. Don't make it any bigger than necessary. You want the tube to fit in very snugly, and airtight."
