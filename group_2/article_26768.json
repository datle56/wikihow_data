      "content": "Gather your supplies. The main base of your wings will be composed of paper plates. You'll need a pack of plates or around 20 plates. It's a good idea to have a couple extra plates around in case you make a mistake. You can use whatever color you want. You can also use plastic plates. You'll additionally need: A marker or pencil Scissors Ribbon Glue (Hot glue gun or crafting glue)"

      "title": "Draw a crescent moon on the paper plates.",
      "content": "Draw a crescent moon on the paper plates. Starting at the center top edge of your first paper plate, draw a curved line down to the center bottom edge. The separated section should look like a crescent moon and should mostly be the ridged part of the plate. Repeat this drawing on 15 other plates."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a second crescent moon on each plate.",
      "content": "Draw a second crescent moon on each plate. The second crescent moon shape should be the exact mirror of the first. The second crescent moon should have the same beginning and end points. A football or eye shape should remain in between the two separated sections."

      "title": "Cut along the lines.",
      "content": "Cut along the lines. Cut out the crescent moon shapes and set them aside. These will be the feathers for you wings. The center section can be discarded."

    {
      "title": "Align the feathers.",
      "content": "Align the feathers. Line eight of the paper plate feathers along one side of a whole paper plate. You can judge where the feathers should be by looking, but they should be placed close together. The edge of the feathers should all be facing downwards. Look at the whole plate and imagine that it were a clock face with numbers. Starting from the left side, your first feather should be positioned around the 10 or 11 o'clock mark. The plate should be facing up, or the position you'd normally eat from. It helps to position everything before you begin gluing. The angle of the top feather should be aimed outward. The feathers that follow should gradually begin pointing down and in. The lowest feather should end around the 8 o'clock mark."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat for the opposite side.",
      "content": "Repeat for the opposite side. Complete the exact process with the remaining feathers. Starting on the right side, the top feather should be around 1 or 2 o'clock mark. The last feather should end around the 4 o'clock mark. Again, the angle of the top feather should be aimed slightly outward. The feathers that follow should gradually begin pointing down and in."

      "title": "Glue the feathers in place.",
      "content": "Glue the feathers in place. Once you feel satisfied with how the paper plate feathers look, you can glue them into place. It might be helpful to make small marks with a pen or pencil so that you can remember where the feathers start and end. Apply a dot of glue from a hot glue gun to the tip of each feather where it will be attached to the base. Press each feather to the inside of the whole paper plate. Make all visible glue marks on the inside of the plate."

      "title": "Attach a second plate.",
      "content": "Attach a second plate. Apply a thin line of glue in the center of the paper plate. The glue should be applied to the inside where the attached feather tips are exposed. Press a second plate over the first to secure the feathers."

      "content": "Cut two long pieces of ribbon. Each piece should be around 23 inches (58 cm), or however long they need to be to slip comfortably over the wearer's arms and shoulders. Use a gold ribbon or an ornate ribbon to add to the presentation."

      "content": "Gather your supplies. Scout thrift stores for used knitting needles. You'll need four to create the frame of the wings. This method will require you to go to a craft supplies store to purchase a bag of feathers and crafting wire (15-20 gauge). You'll also need the following: Spare white t-shirts Hot glue gun Ribbon Spare cardboard Scissors Craft glue"
    },

      "title": "Connect the knitting needles.",
      "content": "Connect the knitting needles. You'll need to connect two knitting needles together to make one wing's frame. Use a hot glue gun to connect two needles a little wider than 90 degrees. Do this same process to the other pair of knitting needles to create two wings. Allow the glue to dry and settle for about ten minutes before continuing. Make sure the frames are symmetrical before continuing."

      "title": "Wrap the frame in wire.",
      "content": "Wrap the frame in wire. Use two strands of wire to wrap around the frame. As you wrap the wire, create small loops on the frame. The loops only need to be about an inch. The wire and loops will be used to attach the cardboard frame. You should use the hot glue gun to attach the wire to the frame. If you're experiencing difficulties attaching the initial wire, begin gluing the wire as you wrap it. The glue and wires will eventually be covered up. There should be roughly eight loops per each needle. This will make about sixteen loops for each wing."

      "title": "Cut out cardboard pieces.",
      "content": "Cut out cardboard pieces. Cut out four triangles for each wing. The triangles don't need to be the same size. It's okay if there are spaces between the needles and the cardboard. The gaps will be covered by the t-shirt and feathers. Try to make your triangles obtuse and isosceles to add to the shape of the wings. Be sure that the four triangles you use for one wing match the four triangles for the other wing."

      "title": "Attach the cardboard.",
      "content": "Attach the cardboard. Lie out the cardboard triangles into a design you like before attaching to the wire. Use spare wire to connect the cardboard triangles to both each other and the knitting needles. They need to be attached, but it's okay if they dangle a bit. Eagle wings are good to base your design on. Look in particular at the eagle wings in the extended-folded position. Another design you can use is to look up angle wings online to see all the variations of angle wings. The cardboard pieces do not have to look perfect or even. They will ultimately be covered up!"

Test the size before attaching to a wing. Once you've found a proper fit, use a hot glue gun to attach the ribbons creating an arm strap. Attach the wings near the top of the wings, close to the wearer's shoulder blades. Repeat the exact process for the opposite wing. You can use a small strand of ribbon to connect the two ribbons together. This will secure the wings to your back and bring them look close together."

      "content": "Punch holes into the cardboard for arm bands. You may need to experiment with where the holes should be by holding the wings up to the back of the wearer. One hole should go roughly 2 inches (5 cm) below the top point of one wing. The second should extend down about 4 inches (10 cm) from the first hole created. The other two holes for the second wing should be in the same place."

    {
      "title": "Thread ribbon through the holes.",
      "content": "Thread ribbon through the holes. You will need four ribbons, but it's also doable using two. The first ribbon will create an arm strap, securing the ribbon to both holes of one wing. The second ribbon should connect both holes on the other wing and create a second arm strap. Tie the ribbons in place to ensure that there is enough room for the wearer's arm to go through. Two ribbons will secure the wings to your back. The third and fourth ribbons are used to secure the wings together. The third ribbon will connect the top holes of both wings and the final ribbon should connect the bottom holes of both wings. The last two ribbons will be considerably shorter than the arm straps. Tie the ribbons in place to make sure that the wings can be slipped over the wearer's shoulders. Make sure the cardboard can be seen from the wearer's front."
