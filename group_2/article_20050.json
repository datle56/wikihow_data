The next time you head out to the park or go for a walk, consider taking your pet dog with you. If you decide to bring your dog with you, make sure that your dog is friendly and socialized. The last thing you'd want is for a woman to notice you and your dog, approach you, and then be barked at. Hobbies, such as drawing or playing the guitar, can help draw attention to you. If you choose to play an instrument, however, make sure that you are doing it in a place where you will not be disruptive to other people. A park or beach would be a great place to play music and get some female attention without disturbing other people. Don't put on a performance or show-off, just play casually. It can also be as simple as an interesting hat (such as a fedora) or a funny T-shirt."

She might be in a hurry to get somewhere, or she may not feel uncomfortable talking to you just yet. If this happens, do not press her or push her to keep talking to you. Simply smile and end the conversation politely. For example: If you notice the woman looking uncomfortable or hurried, you could say something like: \"It was nice chatting with you. I'll let you get back to what you were doing.\" If the conversation has been friendly or going well, don't be afraid to ask the woman for her number, or offer her yours. She may just be in a hurry to get to an appointment and wish to speak with you later. You could say something like: \"It was nice getting to know you. I'd be up for chatting with you again some time soon. Why don't we keep in touch?\" Pressing a woman to talk when she does not wish to talk will make her feel uncomfortable and not want to talk to you any more.

If you aren't sure if you put on too much, try going into a small room or sniffing your shirt. If you can still smell the cologne strongly, then you put on too much. If you put on too much cologne, you may have to change your shirt. If you cannot change your shirt, consider wiping it off with a damp towel. Do this in a bathroom or a private room. Consider changing your cologne up to match the season and occasion. For example, you could wear something with a citrus undertone during the warm, summer months, and save the deep, spicy scents for the winter."
