    {
      "title": "Choose your shoes.",
      "content": "Choose your shoes. The first step of this project is to find the perfect pair of shoes. Since this is a craft project, you probably don't want to spend big bucks on a brand new pair that you'll be covering in glitter anyway. The best shoes for this project are an old, comfy pair. If you don't have anything suitable, look in Goodwill or other second hand stores for shoes in your size. The color doesn't matter in the slightest -- once the shoes are covered in glitter you won't be able to see the original color. Plain high-heeled pumps or ballet flats are the best style of shoe for this project, as they are easy to cover in glitter. Anything with laces or straps will involve more work, and the glitter will wear away much faster."

      "title": "Get the right glitter.",
      "content": "Get the right glitter. The type of glitter you choose will define your finished product. It is important that you choose a super fine glitter, rather than a chunky glitter. Many people recommend the Martha Stewart brand of glitter, but any super fine glitter will do. Super fine glitter will produce a much smoother, more even finish, whereas chunky glitter will result in a goopy, uneven mess. Any color glitter will work -- you can either do your shoes in one solid color, tape off patches of the shoes and use different colors on different parts, or mix different glitters together to produce a rainbow effect -- it's up to you! If you are making the glitter shoes to match a particular outfit, make sure to bring the outfit with you while craft shopping to get an exact color match."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a glue.",
      "content": "Pick a glue. Even more so than the shoes and the glitter, the type of glue you use will be the most important aspect of making successful glitter shoes. A good glue will dry smooth and even and keep the glitter firmly attached to your shoes. Mod Podge is the best glue for the job, as it is a glue, sealer and finish all in one! Choose either the matte or gloss finish, either will work just fine. If you can't get your hands on Mod Podge, all-purpose Elmer's Glue is a good alternative, in addition to Martha Stewart's glitter glue. If all else fails, a good fabric glue will do the trick."

      "title": "Gather additional supplies.",
      "content": "Gather additional supplies. Along with the above-mentioned essentials, you will need a number of additional tools in order to make your glitter shoes. Take an old newspaper that you can lay on your work space. This is absolutely necessary, unless you're okay with getting glitter everywhere . Grab a plastic cup or bowl for the glitter and glue, plus a plastic spoon or wooden stick to mix the two. Get a couple of fine-bristled paint-brushes -- one for applying the glitter-glue and one for applying the final top coat of glue. Find some masking tape or painter's tape which you can use to protect the soles of your shoes from becoming covered in glitter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean the shoes.",
      "content": "Clean the shoes. Before you begin, it's a good idea to make sure that the shoes are completely clean, as you don't want any dirt to get trapped beneath the glitter. This is especially important if you are using an old or second-hand pair of shoes. Clean thoroughly with a shoe brush or some paper towel and water, and allow to dry thoroughly before proceeding."

    {
      "title": "Cover the soles of the shoes in masking tape.",
      "content": "Cover the soles of the shoes in masking tape. Though it may be tempting to skip this step in order to save time, it is highly recommended that you cover the soles of your shoes in masking tape. No matter how careful you are, glittery glue will find its way onto the soles and once you start wearing the shoes you'll leave a trail of glitter wherever your go. Cover the soles of your shoes in strips of masking or painter's tape, trimming off the excess around the edges. If you're using high heels, remember to tape off the small section at the bottom of the heel! You may also want to stuff the insides of your shoes with newspaper or plastic bags to prevent the glitter glue from finding its way in there too."

    {
      "title": "Mix the glitter and glue.",
      "content": "Mix the glitter and glue. Now the fun begins! Pour the Mod Podge (or whatever glue you're using) into a plastic bowl or cup, then add the glitter and mix well. The mixture should be about two parts glue to one part glitter. The consistency should be pretty thick and paste-like. It's important to get the consistency right -- if the there's too much glue, you'll need to use a ton of layers to cover the shoes in glitter, if there's too much glitter, you'll get a clumpy finish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the first layer of glitter.",
      "content": "Apply the first layer of glitter. Dip one of the fine-bristled paintbrushes in the glittery glue and start applying the first layer to your shoes. Try not to make it too thick -- it's much better to do multiple light layers than a single thick layer. Don't panic if the glue looks white as you paint it on, it will turn clear as it dries. [1] X Research source Once you have covered both shoes in an even layer of glitter glue, set them aside to dry, somewhere where they won't be disturbed by curious pets or children! You should also cover the glue and glitter mixture with some plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a second and third layer of glitter.",
      "content": "Apply a second and third layer of glitter. Once the first coat of glitter is dry, you can apply a second, and then a third layer of glitter (waiting for the shoes to dry between coats). If you like, you can sprinkle a little additional loose glitter over the shoes while the glue is still wet. This will give the shoes some extra sparkle and a slight 3D effect! After the third layer of glitter glue the shoes should be covered evenly in glitter, with none of the original color peeking through. However, if there are any patches, you can do as many additional layers as needed to cover them up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the glitter.",
      "content": "Seal the glitter. Once the last layer has dried, you will need to apply a final coat of plain glue to seal in the glitter and prevent it from shedding. Pour some fresh Mod Podge into a clean plastic bowl or cup and use the second paintbrush to apply a light, even layer to the surface of the shoes. Alternatively, you can spritz the shoes with an acrylic or polyurethane spray. This will also effectively seal in the glitter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the shoes to dry.",
      "content": "Allow the shoes to dry. After the final coating of glue or spray, place the shoes in a well-ventilated space to dry out completely. Leaving them overnight should do the trick. Make sure that they will remain undisturbed, away from little hands or paws."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add any additional details.",
      "content": "Add any additional details. If you like, you can add some additional details to the shoes, such as sequins or bows or heart-shaped shoe clips, using hot glue. Just keep in mind that these shoes are pretty glam-tastic already, so you don't want to go overboard!"

    {
      "title": "Remove masking tape and wear.",
      "content": "Remove masking tape and wear. Now that your glitter shoes are complete, all that's left to do is remove the masking tape from the soles and give those babies a spin on the dance floor. Don't forget to click your heels!"
