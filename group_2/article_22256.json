      "title": "Identify the degree of your burn.",
      "content": "Identify the degree of your burn. Some burns are fine to treat at home, but others require the care of a medical professional. Immediately after you receive the burn, take a moment to assess the degree of your injury. It’s possible that your burn will worsen over the next 5 days, so keep a close eye on how it is healing. A small first-degree burn will redden, but not blister, your skin. You can expect to heal without scarring in under 10 days in most situations. A second-degree burn causes both redness and blistering. The pain level might be quite high and it’s often a good idea to seek out medical attention to prevent scarring or infection. A third-degree burn is a deep burn that penetrates multiple layers of skin. It requires emergency assistance."

      "title": "Run cool water over burns.",
      "content": "Run cool water over burns. This helps soothe the burn and start the healing process by minimizing the initial amount of injury to your skin. As soon as you can after the burn, hold the damaged skin under cool water or pour water over it. Try to keep your skin under the water for around 20 minutes or more. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This is beneficial whether the burn is first-degree, second-degree, or third-degree. However, don’t run cool water over severe burns that cover large areas of the body. This can make the person with the burns more susceptible to hypothermia and shock. Placing ice on a burn can actually cause additional damage to the skin. Instead, stick with running cold water over the area."

      "content": "Place a cool, clean cloth over a severe burn until emergency help arrives. This will help to keep the skin cool, so that it can start the healing process. It will also minimize the burn’s exposure to germs. Lift and shift the cloth around every so often to keep it from sticking to your skin.

      "title": "Seek emergency treatment for any third-degree burn.",
      "content": "Seek emergency treatment for any third-degree burn. This type of burn may appear white, yellow, or bright red, as the top layers of skin have been burnt away. Get the injured person to safety and then call for help immediately. If you are alone, call for help right away, as third-degree burns can lead to shock. Clothing can retain heat, so if the clothing is not stuck it should be removed as soon as possible. Material that may be adherent, such as nylon, should remain on.

      "content": "Seek emergency help if a burn covers a sensitive area of the body. No matter the severity of the burn, it’s a good idea to seek emergency medical care immediately if the burn is located in an especially sensitive area. These areas include: the face, hands, feet, groin, buttocks, and major joints. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "title": "Know when to see your doctor.",
      "content": "Know when to see your doctor. Part of healing fast is being proactive and knowing when you need extra help. Reach out to your doctor if you develop a fever or if your wound begins to emit a foul odor. These can be signs of an infection. You should also seek medical attention if your wound becomes more red, painful, swollen, or is draining large amounts of liquid. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source It’s especially necessary to seek medical attention if the liquid that’s draining out isn’t clear."

      "content": "Change the dressings as directed by your doctor. If you have a mild burn and self-applied dressings, you can check them every 2 days for soiling. If you have a more severe burn and doctor-applied dressings, then you’ll likely need to remove and replace them every 4-7 days. It’s important to keep your dressings as clean and dry as possible to speed up healing. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Take any antibiotics or steroids as prescribed. If your doctor prescribes medications, then they are concerned about the possibility of additional illness or infection. If your burn gets infected, it will set back the healing process. That’s why it’s so important to take the full course of any antibiotics or steroids given to you. [8] X Research source For example, your doctor might prescribe a common antibiotic, such as oxacillin, to counteract any infections. Or, they might give you steroid pills or a shot to shorten the total healing time."

However, your doctor may prescribe you a special lotion or suggest a particular brand that you may use to prevent scarring and lessen the itching. You’ll usually need to apply this lotion to your skin around 4 times a day. [9] X Research source Move your fingers in a circular motion when applying the lotion to increase coverage and absorbency."

      "content": "Wear any pressure garments as directed for severe burns. With minor burns, wearing loose garments can prevent further irritation to the healing skin. But, with second- and third-degree burns, the healing process may be sped up by wearing a pressure garment. This garment will even out the pressure against your skin and encourage it to heal smoothly, instead of with bumps. [10] X Research source Your physical or occupational therapist may order a special, fitted pressure garment for you."

      "content": "Apply vitamin E capsules topically after consulting with your doctor. You can buy gel vitamin E capsules from your local pharmacy. To apply the vitamin E topically, puncture the end with a sterile needle and then squeeze out the gel onto your burned skin. This can help the skin rebuild once new skin has started to form. As an alternative, simply swallow a capsule as is. Consider taking zinc and vitamin C along with the vitamin E, as this combination can promote quick wound healing.

      "content": "Apply honey to the wound. Get locally grown, organic honey. Use a spoon to coat the tips of your fingers with the honey. Then, go in small circles and rub the honey on to your injured skin. Repeat 2-3 times daily. The honey helps to block bad bacteria and minimize swelling, which promotes fast healing. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also rub some honey onto sterile gauze and then wrap your wound in it. This is a method that works best if you are concerned about infection, as it minimizes hand-to-burn contact.

      "content": "Maintain a nutritious diet. Burns cause your body to work through a number of calories very quickly. Basically, they create a metabolism boost over the healing period. Make sure to eat foods that are high in protein, such as eggs or peanut butter. [18] X Research source Avoid junk foods and ‘empty’ calories, like juices. A single burn can cause your metabolism to jump by 180%."

This hormone can hasten the healing process. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear loose clothing. Go with cotton blends that flow away from your skin, instead of sticking directly to it. Otherwise, your clothing could attach to your wound and cause additional damage when you pull it away. Keeping your clothes loose also lets air flow around the burn, which can accelerate scabbing and healing. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid picking at the burned area. Opening up the blisters or peeling away the damaged skin makes you even more vulnerable for a nasty infection.
