      "content": "Standard faux locs are heavier and more noticeable than invisible locs. Technically, invisible locs are a type of faux loc. With standard faux locs , the hair is crocheted in a way that is clearly visible. Invisible locs, on the other hand, are done with Marley or Cuban twist hair , which is more coarse-textured to mimic the natural loc look. Standard faux locs are also heavier and cause more tension on the hair. [14] X Research source Soft locs are another type of faux loc that invisible locs are often mistaken for. The main difference is that soft locs use a specific crochet technique with pre-formed locs that are noticeably wrapped around the hair. This creates a fuller, textured look whereas invisible locs aim for a discreet appearance."

If you have longer hair, put some of it in a bun on top of your head to keep it out of the way. This is another great gender-neutral hairstyle. If invisible locs aren’t your style, there are plenty of other loc styles for men ."
