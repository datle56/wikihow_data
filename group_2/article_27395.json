      "content": "Act confident . People are attracted to those who are confident and sure of themselves, so don’t feel bad about who you are. For example, it’s okay to be a little dorky if that’s part of your personality -- own it with confidence to attract the right guy. [1] X Research source Part of being confident is openly enjoying the things that you like without feeling self-conscious. Whether it’s dancing, playing video games, or reading a book, enjoy yourself and don’t worry about looking “cool.” Remember to keep your confidence in check, though. Don’t be argumentative with others about your opinions, tastes, or ideas, but feel free to state them without shame."

      "content": "Be kind . If a guy sees you being kind to others, he'll know you're someone he wants to be around. Show compassion and love to those around you, including your friends, family, and even strangers, to increase the chance of a guy liking you. Small gestures can show your kindness. Hold the door open for others, arrive on time when you have plans with others, ask your friends how their day is going, and smile at the people who you pass on the street. Being patient and understanding when dealing with others can also show your kindness. If your friend snaps at you because they’re having a bad day, accept their apology without making them feel bad."

      "content": "Be open to new things. You want your guy to feel like he can spend time with you and still do the things that he enjoys. People are usually drawn to others who are more agreeable, so be willing to try new things, such as different types of food or movies that you don’t usually watch. If the things he enjoys are a bit unusual, he may really appreciate someone who shows genuine interest in them. For example, if he keeps odd collections, ask about them rather than raising an eyebrow."

      "content": "Be positive . In general, people are attracted to those who have a positive outlook. Try to focus on the little things in life that can brighten even the worst day, such as an interesting conversation or your favorite meal. If you make an effort to be positive in your day-to-day life, others will be able to pick up on your positive energy. [2] X Research source It can take some work to become a more positive thinker. Try to catch negative thoughts and find a new way to look at the situation. For example, you may think, \"I'm running late for school. I’m going to get in big trouble!\" Instead, tell yourself something like, \"It's a good thing I’m not usually late, so this won’t be that big a deal.\" [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Give him his space. A guy wants to feel like he's free to be himself, which requires some alone time. Respect that space by having your own interests and activities outside of him. Make it clear to him you have your own group of friends, hobbies, and interests. If he sees you're more independent, he’s likely to want you more. For example, if he asks you to go out on a night that you have plans with friends, don’t cancel your original plans too eagerly. Your guy may worry that you’re too focused on him if you drop everything, so try making plans with him for the next night instead."

Avoid awkward small talk as much as possible. To keep a conversation going, ask good questions. For example, if he's telling you about a book that he's reading, you might say, \"I love that one too! What do you like best about it?\" You can always default to asking about things he likes. For example, if he's a movie buff, ask about his favorite films."

[4] X Research source While you want the guy to know you’re interested in him, don’t do anything that you’re not comfortable with. If touching him feels like too much at first, just try standing close until you feel more comfortable.

However, if you're very petite, wearing your hair down may overwhelm your figure. Try a half up, half down style instead. If you have shorter hair, keep it combed and clean when you go out.
