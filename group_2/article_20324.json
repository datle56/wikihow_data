Girls who have just been friends up to this point will not commonly think of another girl as a potential date. So start some small talk and give her some hints and some things to think about. Talk about school or business/work. Strike up a conversation, or work in a group, or on a project with her. She will look at you in different ways as she gets to know you better.

What you're trying to do is determine if she's bigoted or has a negative feeling about gays in general, or if she seems to be okay with everything. Be sure the joke is funny so you both can laugh over it if there's just a neutral response from her."
