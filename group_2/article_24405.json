      "content": "Budgets make it easier to achieve financial stability. Make a list of savings goals, estimated monthly expenses, and income after taxes. Use the 70/20/10 rule to make your budget and allocate money towards expenses, savings and investments. Use 70% of your paycheck for monthly expenses, put 20% in savings and investments, and use 10% to pay off debt or donate. [1] X Research source You can use a Google or Excel spreadsheet or a mobile budgeting app like Mint and EveryDollar to keep a log of your expenses and budget. Monthly expenses include food, rent, transportation, utilities, insurance — anything you need to survive. It also includes indulgences and fun things, like dining out, entertainment, and travel. Savings and investments can include stocks and bonds, real estate, business seed money, or even a separate fund for future purchases. If you have debts, use that 10% to steadily pay them off . While donating to a charitable cause is a worthy goal, take care of yourself first! You can give back once you're in a stable financial place."

      "content": "Saved money is a lifesaver when you have unexpected expenses. Auto repairs, medical bills, and unemployment can put you in financial trouble. When you have a \"rainy day fund,\" you can handle surprises with minimal stress! Start by opening a separate savings account with your bank, and deposit a small portion of each paycheck into it to slowly accumulate money. [2] X Research source Don’t sweat if you can’t afford to put 20% of your paycheck into savings each month. Do what you can, accept that surprise expenses happen, and aim to save at least 10% when possible. Every dollar counts! Remember: only dip into your rainy day fund for emergencies. It's there to protect you and give you peace of mind. It can be tempting to use a larger part of your paycheck for immediate fun purchases. To keep yourself accountable, try to set up automatic deposits to your savings account through your bank or employer."

      "content": "Specific, realistic goals can motivate you to change your life. Think about where you want to be in a month, 6 months, a year, or even 5 years. Make a list of simple, short-term goals you can accomplish now and another list of long-term goals to achieve over time . The more commitments you make and then keep, the more confident in your abilities you'll feel! Short-term goals can be as simple as updating your resumé, taking a walk after work each day, or cleaning out your closet. Long-term goals are typically more complex, like paying off all your school loans or getting promoted to a management position at work within a few years. Break long-term goals into smaller steps. Creating milestones makes the goal feel more reasonable and helps you see progress at every stage along the way. For example, if you have a long-term goal to write a book, you can start with the shorter-term goal of keeping a daily writing journal or writing 1,000 words every day at a scheduled time."
