      "content": "Look for open body language. When a girl likes you, she'll often face your direction. If a girl turns her torso toward you in an open manner, she likely feels confident talking with you. If she has a closed body position, namely crossed arms or legs, she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to show that she's uninterested. [1] X Research source If she's sitting with her legs crossed, watch her feet. If they are pointed toward you, it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you. [2] X Research source Generally speaking, a girl will stand closer to you and have more relaxed body language if she feels comfortable around you—for example, she'll have relaxed shoulders and won't cross her arms. But, everyone's personality and cultural upbringing are different, so don't take it as a sign she's not into you if this isn't the case.

      "content": "Pay attention to eye contact . If a girl likes you, she tends to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers. Either of these responses could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it often means that she's nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet, but she may still like you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, this could mean that she likes you. When a girl likes you, her pupils might dilate (though this may be hard to tell). Reader Poll: We asked 2139 wikiHow readers, and 71% agreed that dilating pupils during eye contact is the hardest signal to pick up on when you’re figuring out whether or not someone is into you. [Take Poll] So if you’re struggling to read that body language cue, you’re not alone!"

      "content": "Notice if she touches you or tries to get closer. When a girl likes you, she often tries to touch you, as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt. It allows a girl to size up how responsive you are. She may touch your arm when you say something funny, “accidentally” brush your shoulder or hands with hers, or gently place her hand on your knee. [4] X Research source Not all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch. In this case, don't assume that she doesn't like you just because she doesn't try to touch you. She may be too nervous to do so. If you like her, don't be shy––break the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds. She may also find other reasons to touch you, such as softly punching your arm. These \"one-of-the-mates\" moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too obvious to your friends and hers."

      "content": "Take context into account. The way you interpret a girl's body language varies depending on the context. For example, if you're talking one-on-one with a girl, her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting. However, if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you, she may really just be trying to help, not flirt. If you are having an intense conversation, a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact. This does not necessarily mean she likes you. It could just be a conversational practice of hers. However, if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking, or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her, she may be intrigued by you."

If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this probably means that she has told her friends about you and they're \"in the know.\" In some cases, a friend may actually be bold enough to come and tell you that her friend likes you. When she is having a conversation with her friends and you come over, they might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means that you were the subject of the recently ended conversation."

A girl who just wants to be friends may also try to engage in conversation with you.

She may directly ask you if you have a girlfriend or she may use a subtler approach. She might tease you by saying things like “I bet you went to see that movie with your girlfriend.” If you like her, use this as an opportunity to flirt back. You could say “I don’t have a girlfriend, but I have been meaning to see that movie...want to go with me Friday night?”"

For example, if you're outside and the girl you like starts saying \"I'm cold!\" that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweater. Doing so is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at doing something, like saying she doesn’t understand the homework. That is your chance to offer some assistance; be aware that she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to test your reaction in hopes that you will help out. If she doesn't fancy you but there is somebody she likes in the room, she may pout or show other signs of disappointment if you offer to help first. In this case, at least you'll know how she feels and will be able to move on."

Ask her occasionally for small things, like chewing gum or a pen, and notice how she reacts. If she's eager to help you and shows other signs of liking you, then she very well might. Don’t use this approach too much or tasks that seem too difficult, she may think you're lazy, testing her, or are even a bit of a nuisance. So don't overdo it; you don't want to risk her ceasing to like you if she actually does."

She may just get a thrill out of flirting, or she may not even notice that she’s flirting. The best way to tell is to notice how she acts around other people. If she treats you differently than she does others, be it by holding eye contact just a bit longer with you than with anybody else or by being gentler in her teasing with you, then she may like you."

As you talk, notice if she gives you any signs or hints that she likes you or if she uses vaguely romantic language. She could also show her interest in you by nodding frequently or repeating some of your phrases. To start a conversation, you can ask her an open-ended question about class, work, or pop culture. It could be something as simple as “what do you think about this band?” or “how’s your day going?” Don’t fret if the girl you like doesn’t initiate a conversation with you. If she likes you, she may be too shy or nervous to do so! Even if she seems like the most confident girl you know, she may have had a bad experience in the past or simply may not be ready to approach you yet but will be receptive if you start the conversation first. If you’re already friends, starting a conversation will be easy. In this case, the most effective way to tell if she likes you is to pick up on body language cues or to see if she treats you differently than she does her other friends."

      "title": "Be attentive.",
      "content": "Be attentive. If you like the girl, put your best foot forward by remembering a few small details about the things she tells you. Listen carefully to the things she says so that you will have them for future reference. For example, if she tells you the name of her favorite band, bring up one of the band’s songs during your next chat. She’ll be impressed that you took notice! If she wasn’t already interested in you romantically, she might start to reconsider once she sees how attentive you are. Talking also provides another opportunity to observe her body language, so watch for physical cues such as subtle touches."

This is a blunt move that can seem daunting, but if you like the girl and are fairly certain she might like you back, a bold approach which could open the door to you asking her out on a date with the certainty that she likes you back. You can let her know you’re interested in them by saying something like “I really like having you as a friend, but I’d love to be more than friends.” Don’t tell her you like her if you are just looking to satisfy your curiosity about her interest in you. This can be hurtful and can sever her trust in you."

      "content": "Avoid overanalyzing. Trying to figure out whether a girl likes you can be all-consuming and distracting. Overanalyzing her behavior may result in your becoming obsessed with simply \"winning her over\" rather than getting to know her as a person. Rather than investing tons of time in determining whether or not she likes you, take opportunities every now and then to spend time with her and her friends. Just make sure to make your intentions relatively clear (via subtle flirting), or else you may become permanently \"friend-zoned.\""
