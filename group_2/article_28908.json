      "content": "Cut a series of triangles into a long strip of fabric. Snip out a line of connected triangles from the strip. The total length of the strip should be 24 inches (61 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm). When you’re done, the felt should look like a miniature mountain range. Set this aside for later. [1] X Research source This strip will become the spikes of the dinosaur tail, so feel free to pick a bright, fun color! When flattened, the fabric will look like a row of diamonds. This will be fixed later on when the spikes are folded and glued together. Use fabric scissors for a quicker and smoother cut."

These straps should be perpendicular to the line of spikes. Make sure that the circular base is glued snugly over the waist straps and is covering the end of the tail. [8] X Research source You can tie the waist straps together to secure the tail when your child wears it."

Use a tape measure (preferably non-mechanical) and mark 12 inches (30 cm) above your starting point on the fold. This indicates the height of your dinosaur tail.

Rotary cutters can be found at most craft stores, and provide a more even and exact cut along the edge of your fabric.

You can make the spikes bigger or smaller, depending on how you want the tail to look at the end. You can also make individual triangular spikes. [11] X Research source"

Then, take the unstitched ends of the waist straps and pin them to the inside of the tail. Make sure that the straps are placed perpendicular to the spikes before sewing them into place. Check to see that the strap is long enough to wrap around a child’s waist. Pin the straps onto the tail and sew them into place.
