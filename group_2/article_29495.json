Bake them for as long as your recipe or instructions suggest. When they’re done, you should be able to insert a toothpick and pull it out without bringing any batter or crumbs out with it.

      "content": "Let the cakes cool in their pans for 5 minutes. If you remove the cakes too quickly, they may lose their shape or stick to the pan. Let them sit for 5 minutes before removing them from their pans. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer the cakes to a cooling rack. Cut around the outside of each cake with a butterknife to help keep them from sticking to the pan. Using potholders or hot pads, flip the pans upside down over a cooling rack so the cakes fall out. Freezing the cake for an hour can also help you cut it more easily."

      "content": "Use a glass to cut a circle out of the center of each cake. You can do this either by pressing down on the glass so that it cuts through the cake, or by holding the glass and using a knife to cut around it. Once you’ve removed the center, set it aside. You can save it to eat later or even frost like a cupcake. [3] X Research source"

Layer cakes often come out slightly different sizes, and once you put your 2 pieces together you may realize they are different heights. If this is the case, simply remove the top layer of the highest cake by gently cutting sideways with a bread knife. [5] X Research source"

You can use a Bundt cake recipe, but it’s also possible to use a layer cake recipe or cake mix -- just be aware that it may take considerably longer to bake than it would in a layer pan.

Insert 6-8 toothpicks in the top of the cake, then gently lay the foil over the toothpicks and fold the edges of the foil around the rim of your cake dish. The toothpicks will keep the foil from touching the frosting, and won’t leave visible holes in your cake. For added protection, stick some miniature marshmallows on the ends of the toothpicks before adding the foil. This will keep them from poking through the foil while the cake is being moved.
