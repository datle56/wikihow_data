Sometimes, it’s used as a symbol of love and commitment between partners, or just a strong connection between friends. Throw in a 🔗 emoji when you want to illustrate how tight you are with your pals or tell your beloved you’ll always be together .

      "content": "Among friends, the 🔗 emoji is a way to say “let’s link up.” Send 🔗 to make a clever play on words and ask your friends to get together . Use this for casual hangs or light commitments (you probably don’t want to use an emoji if you’re asking someone to attend a lecture, for example). “Hey! Let’s 🔗👆 for dinner tonight.” “Wanna 🔗 up on Saturday? The weather’s gonna be great! ☀️”"

      "content": "A “sneaky link” (“sneaky 🔗”) is someone you hook up with secretly. This meaning mostly comes up among teens or young adults on TikTok, and the “link” part of “sneaky link” can be swapped out for the 🔗 emoji. Send this when you’re talking about someone you’re secretly hooking up or having sex with. Or, try asking someone to “be your sneaky link” to get flirty over text or DMs —just make sure no one sees your message (it’s meant to be a secret, after all!).

If you get a 🔗 text or DM from your partner or a good friend about your strong connection, follow up with a kind or loving note to reciprocate the feeling.

If you aren’t, add a brief explanation why you can’t make it (if it’s something you can share). Them: “Let’s 🔗 up for lunch tomorrow!” You: “Sure! I’m free anytime after 11am” Them: “Beach today?

[5] X Research source Others emojis that sometimes get visually confused for 🔗 include: The 📎 (paperclip) emoji represents office supplies, paperwork, and office jobs. The 🖇️ (linked paperclips) emoji also symbolizes office work and paperwork. It can also represent partnership or love. The 🧷 (safety pin) emoji represents sewing, alternations, or clothes."
