Then, scroll down to Toolbar Elements and locate the Frame by Frame option. It is represented by a play icon with a bar to its left. Click and drag the icon to your desired location for it. Windows users can more quickly add this button to their display by clicking View and selecting Advanced Controls . The button will then appear at the bottom of their player interface. VLC Media Player on macOS does not include the \"Advanced Controls\" option. Consider placing the frame-by-frame icon in \"Line 2\" of the main toolbar, so you can easily access it during playback. Your VLC Media Player may already display this frame-by-frame icon by default in its toolbar. Keep an eye out for it before adding it manually."
