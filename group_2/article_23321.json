While most budgies’ beaks are a yellowish color, Heartfield says the cere is a certain color depending on the bird's sex.

[4] X Research source This color will lighten when the budgie is not in the breeding mood. [5] X Research source If you've identified your budgie as male and notice his cere turn brown, he may have a medical condition. [6] X Research source According to Heartfield, other signs that your budgie might be sick is if their poop changes “in consistency or color,” you see “discharge around the nose and eyes,” or you notice “lethargic behavior.” If you suspect your bird is sick, take them to your veterinarian.

      "content": "Understand the challenges of using color to identify the sex. In addition to changes in color based on breeding mood, a budgie's cere may change for a number of other reasons. Some budgies have genetic mutations that show color differently in males and females. Additionally, female budgies may have hormonal imbalances that cause them to display a light blue cere for a long time, or their environment may not be suitable for breeding. [11] X Research source For example, recessive pieds and INO (albino, lutino, and yellow face albino) variety males will have a pink cere as well as a few other mutations. Typically, male albino budgies will have a pink cere color. We explain how to sex different budgie varieties in the section below. Your budgie’s health can also affect their cere color. For instance, a male that’s sick might have a brown cere or it may appear dull. A sick female’s cere might appear very bright white."

      "title": "Look for a pink cere on males and a blue cere on females.",
      "content": "Look for a pink cere on males and a blue cere on females. Heartfield says, “It can be hard to tell gender in the young parakeets who have not hit sexual maturity yet, as the color hasn't always developed.” However, if your budgie is less than 4 months old, they will have immature cere colors respective to their sex. [12] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 16 August 2021. The cere will be pink or purple on a male and a white, pale blue, and pink mix on a female. [13] X Research source Female budgies often have white or pink around their nostrils. You typically see cere differences by the time your budgie is 3 weeks old. If your budgie is immature but older than 4 months old, the cere on males will slowly turn deep blue and females will stay white or pale blue before turning tan. If your budgie hasn't had its first molt, has dark button eyes, and has bars coming from its head to cere, then it's less than 4 months old. [14] X Research source According to Dr. Lederer, the best way to age a budgie is to look at their head and eyes: [15] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. Budgies less than 3 to 4 months old “have a completely stripey head.” As they get older, Dr. Lederer says “the stripes on [their] face and forehead are replaced with plain patches of color.” In budgies under 4 months old, “the entire eye will be black.” Between 4 and 8 or 9 months, “the iris will be a little paler.” Dr. Lederer says “very pale irises” mean a bird is “at least 8 months” old."

Immature albino budgies have the same colored cere regardless if they’re male or female, so wait to identify their sex once they’re 4 months or older.

Adult males have a solid pink cere while females develop a brown, crusty cere. [17] X Research source Like albino budgies, immature males and females have similarly colored ceres. So, it’s best to identify their sex once they’re older than 4 months. Lutino budgies have fully yellow feathers without any other markings or colors."

      "content": "Listen to your budgie. Males are known for being much noisier than female budgies. They will chirp or sing and the songs can be quite long. While female budgies make sounds too, they usually sound angry and less musical. However, females can be just as cheerful just as males may be grouchy. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that behavior should not be solely taken into consideration when determining sex. Both sexes can display the same behavior."

      "title": "Watch your budgie's behavior.",
      "content": "Watch your budgie's behavior. Male budgies frequently bob their heads up and down or tap their beaks against their cage. They'll appear playful and outgoing. Female budgies may seem more aggressive if they're in the mood to breed, subdued, or if they're fertile. [19] X Research source You may notice a male budgie tap against a female and regurgitate food to her. Don't worry. This is normal bonding behavior and will occur between same-sex pairs, too."

Just be aware that not all breeders are informed, especially if they’re colony breeding. You can also purchase inexpensive DNA kits that reveal the budgie's sex. Heartfield agrees that “the best way to tell the sex of most parrots,” like budgies, “is to do a DNA sexing through a company that provides the service.” [20] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Don't forget that you can ask your veterinarian to determine the sex of the budgie. This will be easier if the vet is familiar with treating birds."

      "content": "Can a female budgie have a blue cere? Adult female budgies can have a very light blue or a bluish-white cere when they’re not in the breeding mood. However, their cere is never a deep, royal blue like males. Young, immature female budgies often have ceres that are mixed with white, pale blue, and pink. When female budgies are ready to breed, their cere turns tan or brown and grows thick and crusty."

      "title": "At what age does a budgie’s cere change color?",
      "content": "At what age does a budgie’s cere change color? A budgie’s cere typically starts to change color when they’re around 3 weeks old. At this point, you can start to see differences in color between males and females. Males typically have pink or lilac ceres while females have white, pale blue, and pink ceres. As the budgies grow older, their mature cere color starts to develop. This usually happens around the 4-month mark. The male’s cere starts to darken to a deep blue while the female’s cere either lightens to a white/tan color or darkens to a brown color."
