      "content": "Classmates will be more open if you seem confident and approachable. Hold your head up and make eye contact with people as you pass. Even if you don't know someone, a kind smile shows that you're friendly. If they smile back, you could have the opportunity to strike up a conversation or get to know them better. [1] X Research source Put your phone away while you're in the hallway as well. If you look up and offer a smile as you pass, it shows that you're ready and willing to strike up a conversation."

Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer notes that \"sometimes, all it takes is a friendly introduction.

You might also look for someone who tends to keep to themselves in class. [2] X Research source For example, you might simply ask, \"Is this seat taken?\" or \"Can I sit with you?\" and then introduce yourself. Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer encourages you to \"seek out open seating areas where others might be looking for company as well. Cafeterias or communal spaces often have spots where students can join any table.\""

      "content": "Helping a classmate creates a great opportunity for friendship. You might help someone pick up the notebooks or textbooks they dropped or let a neighbor borrow a pencil. Being kind and considerate is a great way to stand out from the rest of the crowd. Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer notes that \"helping others fosters goodwill and strengthens social bonds.\" Other things you might do include offering part of your lunch to someone who forgot theirs or offering to deliver homework to a student who missed class. Don't forget about volunteering in your school or community! Tenzer adds that \"volunteering is not only a selfless way to give back to the community but also an excellent way to meet people... who share your values and interests.\""

Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer notes that \"a good sense of humor can be very appealing.\" But she cautions you to \"use humor wisely and avoid making jokes at the expense of others. Remember, people are usually attracted to kindness.\" Any funny quip or spur-of-the-moment joke will work.

Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer notes that \"offering a genuine compliment can be a great icebreaker.\" It's a pretty stress-free way to strike up a conversation too, especially if you're worried about putting yourself out there. For example, you might say, \"I love your Ocean City sweatshirt! Do you go to the shore often?\" You might also try complimenting someone on something they've said or done. For example, you might say, \"I really appreciated what you said in English class. I've never thought about that character that way.\""

      "content": "Start with a general, casual question about a broad topic. Asking about a classmate's favorite classes, favorite TV shows, or favorite hobbies is a great place to start. Then, ask a follow-up question based on their answer. If they say something you've never heard of, ask them why they like it or what it's about. [3] X Research source Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer encourages you to \"ask questions... that demonstrate your curiosity about their lives and experiences.\" Therapist Ebony Eubanks notes that while you don't necessarily need to be outgoing, if you're proactive and initiate conversations it shows that you're interested in making a connection."

      "content": "A quick comment or share could spark a new friendship. Did someone at your school post a video of a cool painting they're working on? Comment and let them know you love their technique. Or maybe a kid in your class shared a pic of themselves playing basketball over the weekend. If you love basketball too, you might ask where the best spots to play are. By putting yourself out there and being friendly, you could really hit it off with someone. [5] X Research source Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer notes that \"many schools have Facebook groups or other social media platforms where students can connect and make plans.\" There are also ways you can build and strengthen your connection to classmates online. Therapist Ebony Eubanks mentions playing different online games or \"watching movies together via FaceTime or Zoom... [and talking] as you're watching them, so you can make connections with them.\" Keep in mind that not everyone is going to respond or be interested, and that's okay! There could be a million different reasons why someone doesn't respond, so don't take it personally. There are always other people out there to connect with."

      "content": "After-school activities are chock full of potential friends. Look at your school's registry of clubs and sports to see if anything really sticks out to you. The great thing about a club or sports team is that you already have something in common and plenty to talk about. You're also getting the opportunity to do something fun. [6] X Research source School counselor Ashley Pritchard notes that you can also \"ask your school counselor for different clubs or sports... or have your counselor get you in touch with a coach or another student who they know who is involved in that. And then that's a good way to kind of meet somebody who has similar likes and interests.\" Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer adds that \"whether it's a drama club, a sports team, or a chess club, these groups provide opportunities to connect with people who share your passions.\" Your gym class is also a great place to meet new friends. Physical education teacher Paige Bowen notes that this is because \"a lot of times we pair off into partners or we make groups of 5 or 6 at a time. So it's trusting yourself and going ahead and jumping in and not being afraid and joining a group.\" Reader Poll: We asked 131 wikiHow readers, and 54% agreed that the most appealing activity or group to make friends in is a club or sports team related to your interests and passions .

      "content": "Friendship apps offer a low-pressure way for young adults to meet new people. Apps such as Bumble BFF and Friender focus on platonic relationships rather than dating and can help \"match\" you with people you're likely to vibe with. If you prefer to go out and about, apps such as \"Meetup\" or \"Nearify\" can help you find activities and events in your area that might align with your interests. [7] X Research source Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer also recommends that you \"use apps designed for meeting new people in your area.\" However, keep in mind that you must be 18 or older to join apps like Bumble BFF. If you’re under 18, be careful when connecting with people you don’t know online. Avoid sharing your personal information, phone number, or home address with anyone you don’t know personally or fully trust. If you do decide to meet up with someone from an app or website, have a parent or trusted adult join you for at least the first meeting."

      "content": "There's no need to change who you are just to fit in. For clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer, \"Authenticity is key to forming lasting friendships. Be true to yourself and let your genuine personality shine. People are more likely to connect with you when you're authentic.\" Do the things that you love and speak your mind. Classmates who have similar interests or feel the same way will feel comfortable reaching out to you. Students in school often gravitate towards specific social groups because of their interests, such as someone who's naturally athletic being a \"jock.\" If you stick to things you're genuinely interested in, you'll find the group where you belong. Tenzer adds that \"if you're struggling in this area, working on self-esteem is always a good first step.\""
