      "content": "Gently kiss around the piercing. While it may be tempting to kiss your partner roughly, this is a bad idea if they have a piercing. Make sure to be gentle around the area that's pierced because you could hurt them. Gently kiss the person around the piercing at first and test their level of comfort before kissing them more aggressively. New piercings are especially sensitive. If a piercing is new, tugging or excessive movement could make it more prone to infection.

      "content": "Communicate with the person you're kissing. Everyone is different, and some people are more sensitive than others around their piercing. Talk with the person that you are kissing and ask them if it hurts or if it's uncomfortable. If you can see the visible discomfort in their face, stop kissing altogether or be much more gentle. People that have had piercings for a long time may feel no pain when you tug, and may actually find it to be sensual. You can say something like \"Hey, does this hurt? Do you want me to kiss you softer?\""

      "content": "Talk to your partner about your comfort level. Sensitivity levels with new piercings vary.

      "content": "Wait for the piercing to heal before kissing. If you kiss someone with a fresh piercing, you are introducing foreign bacteria into their body that could result in an infection. Wait until the piercing heals before even considering it. Tongue piercings take 3 to 6 weeks to heal fully but vary from person to person. [6] X Research source A lip piercing typically takes anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks to fully heal. [7] X Research source Labret and Monroe piercings take 2 to 6 months to heal fully."

      "content": "Wash your mouth out with antiseptic after kissing. Use an antiseptic mouthwash like an alcohol free Listerine product or saline solution (do not use biotene, or and strong cleaners like rubbing alcohol) if you can't help but kiss someone. However, it's also important to note that you should stay away from overuse of mouthwash because it could result in an oral yeast infection. [8] X Research source If your tongue or mouth begins to turn white, keep mouthwash usage to a minimum. [9] X Research source You can ask your partner also to use an antiseptic mouthwash before kissing you to reduce the chance of infection."

      "content": "Contact a doctor if your piercing tears. If your piercing becomes dislodged or tears because of rough kissing, then visit a doctor to avoid infection. Often the piercing will have to be removed and then re-pierced once it's fully healed. Effectively caring for a torn piercing will reduce the chances of more severe infections or complications in the future."
