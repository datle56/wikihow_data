      "content": "Check for abnormal vaginal discharge. Healthy women have vaginal discharge, which can vary in color, amount, and consistency over the course of the menstrual cycle. Abnormal discharge, however, can indicate cervicitis or another problem, so make an appointment with your doctor. [1] X Research source Because vaginal discharge can vary so much, “abnormal” can mean a variety of things and can be defined differently by different women. That said, pay particular attention to any vaginal discharge with an unusual odor, color, or appearance."

      "content": "Watch for spotting between menstrual periods and after sex. Bleeding between your menstrual periods, or after sexual intercourse, could be a sign of cervicitis. Because the tissue is more delicate, an inflamed cervix bleeds more easily than a normal cervix. Call your doctor if you notice this symptom. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source You may notice, in particular, that you have spotting after sexual intercourse. This can also be a symptom of cervicitis. Spotting during sexual intercourse can be a symptom of other issues besides cervicitis so you should get it checked regardless. Vaginal bleeding can also be a sign of ectopic pregnancy—but only when combined with other symptoms like severe abdominal pain, shoulder pain, and lightheadedness. If you’re experiencing these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. Reader Poll: We asked 275 wikiHow readers and 59% of them agreed that they would immediately seek emergency medical care if they suspected an ectopic pregnancy. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Get a diagnosis from your doctor. There are two basic categories of cervicitis: infectious and non-infectious. Infectious cervicitis is much more common than non-infectious cervicitis. Your doctor will tell you which type you have. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Infectious cervicitis develops due to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. The association between these STIs and infectious cervicitis is so strong, in fact, that your doctor may start treating you for STIs immediately, even before the specific diagnosis is confirmed. Non-infectious cervicitis is much less common. Causes include foreign objects, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and cervical caps; allergic reactions to latex, which can develop after intercourse using latex condoms; and douches and other vaginal washes. Your doctor may also refer to “acute” or “chronic” cervicitis. In general, acute cervicitis is infectious; chronic cervicitis is non-infectious."

      "content": "Take prescribed medication. For infectious cervicitis, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to treat infections like chlamydia or gonorrhea. Antiviral medications may be prescribed to treat conditions like genital herpes. They may also recommend taking hormones like progesterone and estrogen or, in rare cases, glucocorticosteroids, to help with inflammation. [11] X Research source Side effects of these medications include nausea, upset stomach, and fatigue. Your doctor should outline the side effects of these medications before prescribing them to you."
