      "content": "Measure the windows so you know how many strands and hooks you need. Use a measuring tape to measure the length around your windows to determine how long the christmas lights need to be. You may need to buy several strands or rolls of lights to line your windows, especially if you are putting lights around multiple windows. You should also factor in how many hooks you will need per window. Usually about 6-8 hooks per a window is a good estimate. [7] X Research source Light hooks are important as they are specially made to keep the lights in place when you hang them. They are usually made of plastic and are white or transparent so they are less noticeable. You may want to tack on a few extra inches onto your measurements for the lights so you have more than enough. This can ensure you have the extra length needed to plug the lights into a power source."

Go for hooks made to hold Christmas lights in place, as they will have slots large enough to fit the lights and ensure they stay secure. Adhesive hooks are a good option, because they don't require you to drill or nail anything. [8] X Expert Source Gino Colucci Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 7 January 2021."
