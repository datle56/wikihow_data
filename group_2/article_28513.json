      "content": "Apply lemon juice to your skin with a cotton ball. While not scientifically proven, many believe that lemon juice can have skin lightening effects. To test this theory yourself, cut a lemon in half. Using only one half, squeeze the lemon juice into a bowl. Use a cotton ball to soak up the lemon juice and then rub it onto the area you wish to lighten. Leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes before washing it off. Use warm water to rinse, and always apply moisturizer afterwards. Repeat this 2 - 3 times per week.

Mix together 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of tomato juice, 1 tablespoon of cucumber juice, and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sandalwood paste into a paste.

      "title": "Use a lemon exfoliator.",
      "content": "Use a lemon exfoliator. An exfoliant will help lighten skin by using the natural lightening components of citric acid, as well as by sloughing off the top layer of dead skin cells. Mix together 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) brown sugar, 1 egg white, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Massage the exfoliant into your skin using gentle circular motions. Gently scrub or keep it on for 10-15 minutes, rinse with warm water, and moisturize. [3] X Research source Apply this mask sparingly. You should only apply it once a week to avoid drying out your skin. Lemons contain citric acid, which is a natural Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA). Exfoliation with AHAs help remove the top layer of skin to allow growth of new skin, which may help fade superficial discolored areas."

Prolonged use of skin lightening products can also lead to premature aging of skin because of increased sensitivity to UVA/UVB rays.

      "content": "Try chemical peels or microdermabrasion. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion treatments are sometimes recommended by dermatologists to achieve skin lightening. Both of these treatments work to peel or exfoliate away the outer, darker pigmented skin, revealing the fresher, lighter colored skin underneath. These treatments can also help with acne scars, brown spots, and other pigmentation problems.

The acid will burn away the outer, pigmented layers of skin, leaving lighter skin behind. [15] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. Microdermabrasion achieves the same results, but uses a different method. With microdermabrasion, a rotating wire brush is used to slough off the top layers of pigmented skin."
