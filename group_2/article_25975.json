As you light the candle and pass the unity cup, discuss what unity means to you, your family, and your people. You can even go around and ask everyone to talk about how they can practice unity. [7] X Research source In order, the remaining six principles are: self-determination (kujichagulia), collective work and responsibility (ujima), cooperative economics (ujamaa), purpose (nia), creativity (kuumba), and faith (“imani”).

Some people tell family stories in homage to the African oral tradition, while others discuss politics and activism. [8] X Research source Many extinguish candles at the close of the ceremony. If you choose to continue celebrations until the candles burn out, you should stay in the same room for fire safety reasons."

For the second through seventh days of Kwanzaa, light the candles from left to right, with the red ones being lit first. Each day, replace all the used candles and light all the previous candles before lighting that night’s candle. So on the third night of Kwanzaa, you would replace the two candles you’ve already used up, and then light them first before lighting the third one. Some families choose to alternate red and green candles, to symbolize hope even in the midst of struggle."
