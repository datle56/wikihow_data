It’s okay if the scooper is not exactly the same size as the podholder. The scooper is just going to act as a mold for part of your pod. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get coffee filters. Buy some high quality coffee filters to make your pods. If you can locate thicker ones that resemble the material that makes up store-bought pods, then those will work better. If you can’t find them, try to find the thickest filters possible. You don’t want your pod turning upside down inside your coffee maker. Avoid thin and flimsy coffee filters. Avoid large filters. Don’t make your own filters at home, as household materials might include chemicals not suited for consumption."

You won’t be using this as part of your pod, but rather, it’ll be used to shape your coffee filters. Consider: Small glasses. Empty vitamin bottle. An old coffee pod. Small glass jars.

You can choose between storebought pre-ground coffee or coffee beans. Feel free to combine flavors. Feel free to combine caffeinated and decaffeinated. If you choose beans, make sure you grind them very finely. Add extra spices and extracts, if you want."

      "content": "Consider your water. Expert coffee makers often comment upon how the quality of water helps determine the quality and taste of coffee. You should take this into account when getting ready to make your coffee pods. If the tap water in your home is has a strong smell or taste, consider the following: Use filtered water. Use bottled spring water. If you must use tap water, run the tap for a few seconds before gathering water for your coffee. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Complete a dry run. Before you get to podmaking, you should try everything out to see if it works without coffee. Take all of your supplies, including the scooper, the cylindrical object, and a filter, and see if they all fit together. This way, if you have some sort of equipment failure, there won’t be much of a mess to clean up. Place the scooper on a flat surface. Place the filter in the scooper. Place the cylindrical object into the filter. They should all fit snug."

Consider the following: 2 tablespoons for 6 ounces of water (one cup of coffee). 3 tablespoons for 9 ounces of water (a large cup of coffee). Use more or less if you’d like your coffee weaker or stronger. [5] X Research source"

The bottom of the jar will sit where the coffee grinds will sit. Make sure there are no large wrinkles or creases in the bottom of the filter. The jar is used to give form to your filter. Make sure your filter does not have any holes in it."

Carefully pick up the filter and jar and place them inside the scooping cup. Make sure there are no large wrinkles or creases when you place the filter in the cup. The coffee filter will be separating the jar from the steel cup. The sides of the filter will be up around the sides of the cylindrical object."

Make sure that your filter stays snugly in the steel cup and maintains its shape. When you are done, you should have the steel cup sitting on your surface and the filter sitting within it. The sides of the filter should look as if they are molded toward the cylindrical object that is no longer there."

If you don’t think your fold will close, track down stainless steel, uncoated, clips that are appropriate to use when cooking. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"
