Phrase your questions so they can't be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.\" If you simply ask, “Did you have a good day?” she’ll probably respond with, “Yeah.” Instead, ask, “What was an interesting thing that happened today?” Remember, the idea is to ask her things that lead naturally into conversation, not to pepper her with interview questions. Introduce a subject you can both relate to or talk about mutual interests and acquaintances. For example: “What did you think of the White Lotus finale?” “Did you read that new Timothée Chalamet interview?” “Have you talked to Megan recently? What’s she been up to?”"

Additionally, asking questions about her childhood can really help you learn what makes her tick.

      "content": "Avoid offering solutions unless she asks for them. Many men tell people about their problems because it’s a practical route toward solving those problems. On the other hand, many women want empathy rather than practical suggestions. When your girlfriend tells you about something she’s struggling with, your first instinct may be to offer solutions. Avoid this; if she wants advice, she will probably ask for it. Until then, a good working assumption is that she really just wants to feel understood. [12] X Research source Keegan advises against this, too, adding, “What [your girlfriend] wants is to feel listened to, heard, and understood— not having something explained to her or have you solve all her problems, which is what a lot of guys try to do. They hear her say something about the day, and then he immediately goes into solving mode.” [13] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019."

It provides reassurance that the way she feels is normal and understandable. [14] X Research source This isn’t appropriate in all situations (like, if her grandma passed away, don’t tell a story about your hamster dying). Keep it brief to avoid overshadowing her."

It can be easy to rely too heavily on gripes about frustrating situations when you do this, so try to make sure you are not just rattling off complaints. [15] X Research source Keep the conversation going by asking what made her laugh today. Tell her about something you saw or heard that reminded you of her. If you’re in a long-distance relationship and want to feel like you’re more involved in each other’s lives, jot down 5 things that happened to you that day, and then share them with her. Relationship expert Joshua Pompey encourages you to get down to the nitty gritty as means of deepening your connection: “You just want to avoid the small talk and everyday questions, and just get into what's going on in your life, or start out with a funny story.” For example, you can start the conversation with something like: [16] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 27 November 2019. “Wow, you won’t believe what my coworker just did…” “I saw the funniest thing on the train today…” “For lunch, I had…”"

Keegan says that planning dates is a way of keeping things fresh, stating, “A lot of men get lazy after they're already in a relationship.
