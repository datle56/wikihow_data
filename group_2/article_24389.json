If you have a physical SIM card (not an eSIM ), you can use a SIM tool (or an extended paperclip) to pop out the SIM card tray and remove the SIM card. Check the card for dirt and dust—if present, you can remove it by wiping it gently with a dry microfiber cloth. Reinsert the SIM to see if you are still getting an Invalid SIM error. If your eSIM is giving you an Invalid SIM, SIM Not Valid, or No SIM error, it's best to contact your mobile provider for help. [1] X Research source"

If you have another SIM card from the same carrier (you can ask someone to borrow theirs for a moment), try inserting it into your iPhone or iPad. If the other person's SIM works in your iPhone, there's likely a problem with your SIM card. If you can't access another SIM, head into your carrier's local store and ask if you can quickly use one of their SIM cards for testing."

If the same SIM card works in a different device but not in your iPhone, the issue is likely related to your iPhone or iPad—possibly a problem with the SIM card tray or some other hardware-related issue. If the SIM doesn't work in another device that supports the same mobile carrier, your SIM card has likely gone bad, and you'll need to get a new one from your carrier. If the SIM gives you the \"SIM Not Supported\" error in another device, that device is carrier-locked to another provider. You'll need to test with a different device."

If you've determined that your SIM card is broken, there's no need to do this—contact your carrier and let them know your SIM card failed and you'll need a new one. But if the issue is related to your iPhone, restoring it to its original factory settings is a good place to start before contacting Apple for support. First, you may be able to fix the SIM Invalid error by resetting just your network settings. Keep in mind that this will erase any saved Wi-Fi access points and passwords: Open Settings and select General . Tap Transfer or Reset (iPhone/iPad) . Tap Reset . Tap Reset Network Settings and follow the on-screen instructions. [2] X Research source If that didn't help, restore your iPhone to its original factory settings: Back up your device so you don't lose important data. You can do so by enabling iCloud Backup in Settings > your name > iCloud > iCloud Backup and then tapping Back Up Now . [3] X Research source Open Settings and select General . Tap Transfer or Reset iPhone . Tap Erase All Content and Settings . Follow the on-screen instructions to restore your iPhone to its original settings. Once restored, set up your iPhone as new—if the SIM card is working now, you're good to go!"
