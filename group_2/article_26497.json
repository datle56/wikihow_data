      "content": "Sprint. Sprinting, unlike distance running, involves running as fast as you can for a short distance. This workout gets your heart rate up quickly and is an ideal workout to shed fat quickly. The explosive motion of sprinting will also sculpt your legs and abs, while simultaneously increasing your endurance and lung capacity. [3] X Research source Follow these steps to perform a sprint workout. [4] X Research source Go to a track, or measure out a straight path of 100 yards. Warm up with either a jog or a brisk walk. Stretch thoroughly after warming up. The explosive motion of sprinting can pull or even tear muscles if they're not properly stretched. Stretch for 10 minutes before your sprinting workout. Start at the beginning of the 100 yard (91.4 m) path and sprint to the end. If you are a beginner, don't start out with a true spring just yet â€” run at about 50% of your top speed to make sure your body is ready and you don't injure yourself. Then gradually increase your speed with subsequent sprints. Slowly walk back to the starting line. If you're still fatigued when you reach the start, rest until you feel up to sprinting again. Perform six to 10 sprints in a session. Repeat the training two to three times a week. Be sure to wear an athletic supporter, or at least tight-fitting underwear, while doing sprints. The quick motions can lead to a pulled groin or testicular injury without proper support. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Try changing up the order in which you work out. For example, if you always to abs, triceps, biceps, back, and legs in that order, come up with a new order. You could also look up other workouts that train the same muscle groups. Perform this change up routine every few weeks to prevent a plateau.
