Good hygiene reduces the risk of bacterial infection following birth, and it helps her be more comfortable, too. [1] X Research source Your dog may pant for a few minutes or a few hours after giving birth, which is normal. She’s just tired and trying to cool her body down. You may see leaking fluids, called lochia, for several weeks after giving birth. These fluids are natural and normal, resulting from the shedding of your dog's uterine lining. Healthy lochia should be odorless, and may range in color from greenish-brown to blood-red. If your dog hasn't licked her pups clean within a few minutes of birth, wipe the puppies' face and nostrils with a damp, clean cloth to remove the placental sac. Then, give the pup back to their mother immediately."

On the flip side, if your dog doesn’t have much of an appetite and is eating less, she may not poop for 1 to 2 days. If she still hasn’t eaten or gone poop after 24 hours, contact your vet."

If your dog reacts with pain to your touch, or if you notice that the nipple is hard and/or hot to the touch, this is likely an indication of infection. Normal nursing glands, or nipples, should be soft and enlarged from milk production. If the glands are hard or red, this may indicate presence of infection, and you need to contact your vet. [8] X Research source If your dog appears to be avoiding nursing her pups, check her mammary glands for signs of infection. Mastitis is a bacterial infection of the nursing glands, and easily treated with antibiotics. Your dog's milk should be white and smooth, with no signs of clotting. Signs of mastitis include coloration of the milk (usually pinkish or yellow)."

Ensure the puppies have a clean, safe place to nurse. Make sure bedding is clean and dry. Keep the whelping box warm. Ideally, keep the temperature around 85 °F (29 °C) for the puppies' first week. Keep an eye on the puppies as well, and make sure they are active and feeding multiple times a day. If a puppy seems lethargic or uninterested in nursing, take them to a vet. While it is sometimes true in the wild that moms will eat their puppies, that rarely happens in domesticated dogs. [12] X Research source"

Be sure to change out the bedding in the whelping area regularly, and give puppies a nice, cozy space to cuddle whenever they’re feeling tired. [13] X Research source It’s a good idea to keep puppies contained in their own area, at least until they open their eyes. Try setting up a baby gate to keep them in one area once they start walking around. While the puppies are sleeping, take mama out for a break. Let her lie down on her own or go potty without puppies trailing behind her."

Offer a milk replacement for 1 meal per day to help teach them how to lap up liquids, as well as supplement their nutritional intake. After 2 days of this, mix milk replacement with puppy food to give them a very mushy meal. [14] X Research source Continue to gradually increase the amount of solid food over time. The texture of the food should go from soup to Cream-of-Wheat to oatmeal within about a week's time. Puppies will continue to nurse as they are weaned. By week 6, they should be offered soft, moist food as well as puppy kibble. Puppies should be completely weaned by week 8."
