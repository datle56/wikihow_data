      "content": "An industry plant is a major label artist who presents themselves as self-made. Industry plants usually appear independent and DIY, but in reality they have industry connections or music label support that gives them certain advantages. These musicians tend to have strong social media presences, take part in high-profile collaborations, and get other professional opportunities that would be out of reach for truly DIY artists. [1] X Research source Artists who become famous seemingly overnight are often accused of being industry plants, even though some, like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, have extensive catalogs and have been around for a while. Musicians who release super polished music that sounds like it was made in an expensive recording studio also tend to be pegged as industry plants. The term was popularized in the rap community and was used to call out rappers who lied about their upbringing in songs. [2] X Research source Industry plants can go on to have strong careers that help them shed the label, but this requires a strong passion for music."

Influencer and content creator Aaron Makelky says that the term industry plant is also used to describe a gullible person who lets the industry mold and control them. They’re quick to try and imitate popular artists to the point where it seems like they’re trying too hard to fit in. For example, an artist who copies a popular artist’s beat selection and flow on every song because they’re famous would be considered an industry plant."
