If you’re just going to have the swag over the window without any curtains, single curtain rod brackets are the way to go. Single brackets will hold up 1 curtain rod, which is all you need for the swag. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get double brackets if you want to hang curtains up with the swag. Double curtain brackets come with 2 slots instead of 1 so they can hold 2 curtain rods. If you want to hang up regular curtains that you can open and close along with the swag, you’ll need to use 2 rods.

To measure the width of the window, take measuring tape and measure from the outer edge of the window frame on the left side of the window to the outer edge on the right side of the window. Write the measurement down so you have it when you're shopping for curtain rods."

      "content": "Get a rod that's at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the width. Traditionally, curtain rods extend further than the width of the window. The more the curtain rod extends over the sides of the window, the larger the window will appear. If you want to make the window seem bigger, choose a rod that's up to 1 foot (0.30 m) longer than the width of the window. Avoid using a rod that's not at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the width of the window frame or it could be too short. Don't use a rod that's longer than 1 foot (0.30 m) or it could look too long above the window."

      "content": "Use a decorative or cafe curtain rod for your swag. Both decorative and cafe curtain rods can hold a swag, whether it's scarf-style or made with a rod pocket. If you're using a particularly heavy swag, you may want to go with a decorative rod since they're sturdier. Avoid using a traverse curtain rod for your swag. Traverse curtain rods are designed to hold curtains that have pins that hook into the rod. Since curtain swags don't have these pins, a traverse rod won't work. [5] X Research source"

The higher you hang the brackets, the larger your window will appear. Avoid hanging the brackets more than 8 inches (20 cm) above your window or your swag may look too high.

Hold them so the screw holes are level with the marks you made earlier. [7] X Research source Make sure the distance between the brackets isn’t greater than the length of the curtain rod or else the rod won’t fit. Use a tape measure to measure the length of the rod and then measure the distance between the brackets. If the distance between the brackets is greater, move them closer in toward the frame."

If your swag has a rod pocket, slide it onto the end of the curtain rod. Then, center the swag on the rod so the front of the swag is facing out.

Scarf-style curtain swags don’t have a rod pocket. Instead, wrap the fabric around the curtain rod so it drapes like a regular swag. Start by hanging one end of the swag over one end of the rod. Then, hang the other end of the swag over the other end of the rod. Let the fabric in the middle drape down. [12] X Research source When you’re finished, the draped fabric in the center should look like a regular curtain swag. With a scarf-style swag, you can experiment with different wrapping techniques until you find something you like. For example, you can wrap the swag so it's asymmetrical, with one end of the fabric hanging down further than the other end."

If you're using a scarf-style swag, make sure the draped part of the fabric is centered on the rod."
