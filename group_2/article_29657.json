      "title": "Sew",
      "content": "Sew or buy a green leotard. If you know how to sew, use a stretch fabric and a pattern to make a green leotard. Otherwise, check out a gymnastics, ballet, or theater specialty shop to find a leotard. Choose or create a lighter green leotard to mirror Poison Ivy's own suit. [2] X Research source Cotton, nylon, polyester, spandex and x-static all make excellent leotard materials. [3] X Research source Poison Ivy's costume is traditionally sleeveless, but you may add short or long sleeves depending on your comfort level."

      "title": "Purchase plastic green leaves from a craft store.",
      "content": "Purchase plastic green leaves from a craft store. You will need enough green leaves to decorate your leotard as well as a pair of shoes. Decide beforehand whether you want to cover your leotard or make a design with the leaves. Purchase enough leaves to decorate accordingly. Start with one or two bags of green leaves, and buy more if you run out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the leaves off of the plastic stalk.",
      "content": "Pull the leaves off of the plastic stalk. If your leaves came on a plastic branch, this will get them ready to put on your costume. Discard the stalk, as you will not need it for this costume. Paint the leaves with green or white glitter glue before you attach them to your costume if you want an extra shine. [4] X Research source Let the glitter glue dry if you use it before attaching the leaves to your costume."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stitch",
      "content": "Stitch or glue the leaves onto your leotard. Hand stitching the leaves on is more secure, but you can use fabric glue or a glue gun if you've never sewn before. You can cover the entire leotard or shape the leaves in a design, like a curve. Attach leaves over one leotard strap. [5] X Research source Pay special attention to the neckline, and attach leaves along the edge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue the leaves to a pair of boots or heels.",
      "content": "Glue the leaves to a pair of boots or heels. Heels are more traditional, but choose a pair of sensible boots if you plan to walk extensively in this costume. Use a hot glue gun to cover the heels entirely in leaves. [6] X Research source Add a pair of green tights under your shoes to complete the look. Choose a shade of green lighter than your leotard to add contrast. Ideally, your shoes should be green, red, or black to match your costume."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase a box of temporary red hair dye.",
      "content": "Purchase a box of temporary red hair dye. Many temporary dyes can last up to several weeks or even months, so read the dye instructions carefully before purchasing. Choose a spray-in hair color if you need the hair dye to wash out easily. [7] X Research source Chalk dye your hair for a temporary red hue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear your hair down and curled.",
      "content": "Wear your hair down and curled. Poison Ivy's hair is traditionally curled, so heat up a curling iron to mimic her 'do. Pick a bigger curling iron size for large and voluminous curls. Use hairspray to keep your style secure while you wear the costume. If you do not need to color your hair the day you wear the costume, you can use an overnight method (like a large pair of hair rollers ) to curl your hair instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase a red, curly wig as an alternative.",
      "content": "Purchase a red, curly wig as an alternative. For those with short hair or an aversion to dyes, purchase a red wig and back comb it with a fine-toothed comb. This will give your wig ideal texture and volume. Spritz your wig with hairspray to give the style hold. [8] X Research source To back comb, separate the wig hair into sections using rubber bands. Working with one section at a time, use a fine-toothed comb to brush halfway between the scalp and ends. Continue brushing until you reach your desired volume."

    {
      "title": "Create a leafy headband as an accessory.",
      "content": "Create a leafy headband as an accessory. Buy a thin green or black headband to form the base of your accessory. Glue leaves along the top and side of the headband until it is covered entirely. Place the headband in your hair or wig for an untamed style."

    {
      "title": "Apply glittery green eyeshadow on the tops of your lids.",
      "content": "Apply glittery green eyeshadow on the tops of your lids. The eyeshadow should cover the entirety of your lid without reaching your eyebrow. Layer a darker green shade of eyeshadow over a lighter shade for a fading effect. The dark shade should extend slightly further than the lighter shade, near your brow bone. Apply a red liner around the bottom of your eye for contrast."

    {
      "title": "Draw on winged eyeliner.",
      "content": "Draw on winged eyeliner. Apply a thin coat of eyeliner to your upper lash line, then decide how long you want your wing to be. Draw a thin, diagonal wing out and fill it in once you're satisfied with the length. [9] X Research source Black eyeliner is ideal so it stands out against your eyeshadow. Use a liquid liner if you need longer-lasting makeup."

    {
      "title": "Wear mascara or apply false lashes.",
      "content": "Wear mascara or apply false lashes. False eyelashes can give you better volume if you want to achieve Poison Ivy's striking makeup. Apply lash glue to your fake eyelashes, and line them up over your lash line. Hold your false and real eyelashes together to secure them tightly. If you apply mascara instead, choose a black mascara with plenty of volume. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw an ivy vine up one side of your face. Use a green eye pencil to draw a swirl trailing over from your neck to up your cheekbones and ending at your hairline. Fill in the vine to make it thicker and add leaves after you've traced the initial design. [11] X Research source Re-trace the drawing with a darker green color to give your vine depth."

      "content": "Choose a vivid red lipstick to complement your hair color. Lipstick is a must to finish off your makeup. Choose a lipstick color as bright (if not brighter) than your hair or wig. Black or bright green lipstick can be used as an alternative. [12] X Research source"
