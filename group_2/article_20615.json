You won't need to show it if your Social Security number is already in the system, but if you're not sure if it is, it's better not to risk it. [4] X Research source If you need to apply for your ID in a hurry and don't have time to wait for a Social Security card, see if you have a W-2, SSA-1099 form, or pay stub with your Social Security number on it. Those will work to verify your number."
