      "content": "Identify any soiled areas. Spot-cleaning your rabbit is the recommended method for keeping its coat clean. The first thing you’ll need to do is identify any areas of its coat that are dirty. In general, a rabbit’s problem areas are their backside, tail, feet, and belly because these are all places they may be unable to reach easily on their own. Look for dirt, food, and feces stains, as well as wet spots, which are often urine."

      "content": "Hold your rabbit so its problem areas are easily reached. Once you have identified any soiled spots on your rabbit’s coat, place your rabbit in a position that is both comfortable for them and that makes it easy for you to reach the soiled areas. Most of the time, you will need to position your rabbit on its back. To do so, either hold your rabbit belly-up in one arm or sit on the floor with your legs outstretched and lay your bunny belly-up on top of your legs. Make sure you are able to hold your rabbit securely in whichever position you choose. If the soiled area is on your bunny’s back or sides, you can simply lay a towel out on the floor or a large table and sit your rabbit on its feet to clean its fur. [1] X Research source Ensure your rabbit’s back is cushioned and its neck and back are supported in whichever position you put it. This will help prevent any injuries. [2] X Research source"

Now that you have your rabbit in a position that lets you easily access the stains on its fur, gently rub the fur and skin with a baby wipe to remove any dirt, food, feces, or urine. After you have targeted all the soiled areas, give your rabbit an all-over wipe-down with a clean wipe. Look for baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and hypo-allergenic. In addition, choose one that contains aloe and Vitamin E. These will be gentle on your rabbit’s sensitive skin. [3] X Research source"

Giving your rabbit a dry bath can help take care of these stubborn, dried-on messes. The first step in giving your rabbit a dry bath is to sprinkle baby cornstarch powder liberally over these areas.

Rabbit skin is surprisingly delicate, so keep your hand pressed against your rabbit’s skin at the top of the soiled area to keep from tearing it. For especially stubborn messes, use a fine-toothed comb to gently work the debris out of the fur after you’ve applied the cornstarch powder. To do so, start at the top of the stain (closest to the skin) and lightly tease the dirt away from the skin. Place your hand on your rabbit’s skin to keep from pulling too hard.

Wet baths can be very stressful for rabbits, however, so do this only in situations where spot-cleaning and a dry bath didn’t work. First, fill a clean bathroom or kitchen sink with approximately 2 ½ inches of warm water. [9] X Research source It may be helpful to use a sink that has a hose attachment for rinsing. You can also use a small kitty litter tub, a baby bath, or even a slanted paint pan. Use whichever works best for you and your rabbit. Place a non-slip mat on the bottom of your sink, tub, or pan. This will help keep your rabbit from slipping on the smooth, wet surface. [10] X Research source"

Be very gentle when wringing the water from your rabbit’s fur and when using a towel to dry it. Pulling or rubbing too hard can damage your rabbit’s skin.

      "content": "Brush your rabbit every two to three days. Like cats, rabbits lick themselves to self-clean. However, unlike cats, rabbits cannot vomit so any hairballs your rabbit ingests will stay in its stomach, blocking the stomach exit and causing serious health issues. Brushing your rabbit regularly can help cut down on the amount of loose fur it ingests, in addition to keeping its fur mat-free. Short-haired rabbits need to be brushed every three days to prevent hairballs and tangles in their fur. Long-haired rabbits should be brushed every day. Use a bristle-brush instead of a metal-toothed brush, as this will be gentler on your rabbit’s skin. Look for a brush made specifically for rabbits. You can follow up brushing with a rubber grooming tool or another hand-held finishing tool to help get any additional loose hairs. A damp washcloth will also work to remove loose hairs. [21] X Research source How much your rabbit needs brushed depends on their breed. As a general rule, the longer the hair, the more often you need to brush."

During this time, you’ll generally need to brush your short-haired rabbit once a day and your long-haired rabbit multiple times a day. The rate at which rabbits shed varies. Some rabbits will shed their coats over several weeks, while others shed it all within a few days. Pay attention to the shedding patterns of your rabbit and adjust how often you brush them accordingly. For example, rabbits that shed over the course of several weeks may need brushed only once a day, but rabbits that shed over a few days need to be brushed multiple times per day.

      "title": "Trim your rabbit’s fur as needed.",
      "content": "Trim your rabbit’s fur as needed. Short-haired rabbits don’t usually need their fur trimmed, but long-haired rabbits often do. If you have a long-haired rabbit, it is a good idea to keep its hair trimmed to one inch in length. This will help prevent mats and cut down on shedding. Don’t trim the hair around your rabbit’s feet. Doing so can cause your rabbit to get sores from a lack of padding. It is suggested that you keep the fur on your long-haired rabbit’s belly and between its legs trimmed short or even shaved. This hair is especially vulnerable to mats and tangles. You can use either scissors or electric small animal clippers to trim your rabbit’s hair. Be very careful, however, because rabbits’ skin is very delicate and you can easily cause a serious injury if you cut them with the scissors or clippers. It is best to have someone help you hold your rabbit still if you choose to trim its fur. If you are trimming its belly, between its legs, or its backside, have one person hold the rabbit straight up and down with its back pressed against the person’s chest. They should have one hand placed under the front legs and the other holding the back legs to prevent the rabbit from kicking and hurting itself."

Use these tools to carefully separate the mat, combing it out a tiny section at a time. Press your hand on top of the skin at the top of the mat to keep from tearing your rabbit’s skin. It may take you several sessions to get the mat out. Be patient and gentle to keep from hurting your bunny."

The most difficult mats to remove are sheet mats, or those that form a solid block in your rabbit’s coat. If you encounter a mat like this, shaving may be your only option. To shave your rabbit, purchase a good pair of clippers that will allow you to have enough control to get into tight spaces. Ask your veterinarian or groomer for recommendations on a good pair of clippers. [23] X Research source"
