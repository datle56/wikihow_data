      "content": "Measure the window, adding width for folds in the fabric. Start measuring at the top of the window or slightly above it using a tape measure. Make sure you measure the length to the point where you want your curtain to fall on the window or wall and record that number. Then, divide the width of the curtain in half, and add that measurement to the width so your curtain has folds when the curtains are closed. [1] X Research source For example, if your window is 90 inches (230 cm) wide, you would add 45 inches (110 cm) to the measurement to make the total width of your fabric 135 inches (340 cm). If you wanted the curtain to hang 4 inches (10 cm) below the window, you would add this measurement to the length. If the window is 80 inches (200 cm) high, you would use 84 inches (210 cm) as your length measurement. In general, full-length curtains and drapes tend to be anywhere from 60–120 inches (150–300 cm) long, depending on the size of the window."

      "content": "Choose a fabric that gives you the right amount of coverage. Curtains can be made from almost any fabric, so pick one that suits your needs. Heavier fabrics are great for filtering out light and making a room cooler and darker. Lighter fabrics are best for letting in natural light and warmth. When you purchase the fabric, remember to add extra length for seam allowances, as well! [2] X Research source If you want your curtains to look nice from outside of your house when you’re looking through the window, be sure to opt for a double-sided fabric."

      "title": "Cut each panel with an additional 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) on each side.",
      "content": "Cut each panel with an additional 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) on each side. Use a pair of fabric scissors or a specialty fabric cutter to trim your chosen fabric to size. If you want multiple panels, add at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of width to the fabric per panel and 2 inches (5.1 cm) of length per panel for the seams. Then, divide the total width by the number of panels and cut them to the proper width. [3] X Research source For instance, if you want 2 panels for a window treatment, and your original measurement plus half was 135 inches (340 cm), you would add 4 inches (10 cm) to the measurement for a total width of 139 inches (350 cm). Then, you can cut the fabric in half to make panels that are 69.5 inches (177 cm)."

      "title": "Fold and pin 1 in (2.5 cm) side seams on the back of each panel.",
      "content": "Fold and pin 1 in (2.5 cm) side seams on the back of each panel. Measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the fabric on the side for the seam, and crease along the side of the panel, folding the fabric to the “wrong” side of the fabric. Apply pins approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart along the crease. Then, repeat this process on each side of the panels, including the top and bottom. [4] X Research source After you fold and pin the fabric, step back to ensure that the seams are the same width."
    },
    {
      "title": "Iron the seams to crease the fabric.",
      "content": "Iron the seams to crease the fabric. Set your iron to the lowest level and press along each of the seams. Move the iron up and down the seams firmly and quickly for 5-10 seconds per seam. This will create a crease in the fabric to guide you when you apply the fabric tape. [5] X Research source Try not to hold the iron in place for more than 5 seconds, as this can cause scorching on the fabric."

      "title": "Remove the pins to press fabric fusion tape between the seam and panel.",
      "content": "Remove the pins to press fabric fusion tape between the seam and panel. Carefully pull the pins out of the seam that you want to fuse first, and cut a piece of fabric tape to fit the entire length of the seam. Press it into the fabric, and then fold the seam down on top of it, sandwiching the tape in between the fabric. [6] X Research source Remember to repeat this process for each seam, including the sides, top, and bottom of the panels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a damp towel on top of the seam and iron the fabric in place.",
      "content": "Place a damp towel on top of the seam and iron the fabric in place. Check the tape directions to set the iron to the proper temperature, which is normally the “wool” setting. Then, lay a damp cotton towel over the seam, and move the iron along the seam, holding it in place for 10 seconds in each spot to fuse the fabric together. [7] X Research source Once you have most of your seams done, you will likely have fabric overlapping in the corners. This is normal, and you can trim it on an angle to make sure the fabric doesn’t become too thick in the corners of the panel."

      "title": "Clip curtain rings 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) apart along the top seam.",
      "content": "Clip curtain rings 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) apart along the top seam. Position the rings on the top seam of the fabric with a ring at both of the top corners of the panel. To make the panels look identical, count to ensure that each panel has the same number of rings. [8] X Research source If the fabric for your curtains is patterned, make sure the pattern is facing the right direction before you clip the rings in place."

    {
      "title": "Slide the rings onto a curtain rod to hang the curtains.",
      "content": "Slide the rings onto a curtain rod to hang the curtains. Remove the rod from the window, and position the rings on the rod so the panels have an accordion-like shape. Then, hang up the rod and adjust the curtains to your preference. [9] X Research source Some people choose to iron their curtains before hanging them. You can also steam them while they’re hanging up to release wrinkles and creases in the fabric. Be sure to avoid the seams, as too much heat can cause them to curl or split apart."

      "title": "Measure the window, adding length and width for seams.",
      "content": "Measure the window, adding length and width for seams. Use a tape measure starting at or just above the top of the window, and measure the length and width. Make sure you measure the length down to the area on your window or wall where you’d like the curtains to lie. Then, add 4 in (10 cm) to the width and 12 in (30 cm) to the height. [10] X Research source For instance, if you have a window that is 120 inches (300 cm) wide and 160 inches (410 cm) high, your new measurements would be 124 inches (310 cm) wide and 172 inches (440 cm) high for a curtain that falls directly at the bottom of the window. Most curtains range in length from 60–120 inches (150–300 cm) depending on the size of the window, but you can make yours a non-standard length if you want."

      "title": "Choose a durable fabric that will provide enough light filtration for the room.",
      "content": "Choose a durable fabric that will provide enough light filtration for the room. At the craft or fabric store, opt for strong fabrics that are easy to slide along a flat surface, such as cotton, or linen. To make the room darker and cooler when the curtains are closed, opt for a soft, heavy fabric, like velvet, which will still be easy to slide on the curtain rod when you want to adjust them. [11] X Research source Avoid using heavy fabrics that don’t slide easily, like suede, as these can get caught or stuck on the curtain rod. Sheer fabrics tend to be more delicate and can be tricky to sew. If you want the curtains to look good from outside of the window as well, be sure to choose a double-sided fabric."

      "title": "Cut the fabric according to your measurements.",
      "content": "Cut the fabric according to your measurements. Use your new measurements to trim the fabric to the correct size for your windows. To split the curtain into 2 panels, divide the width in half so each of the panels are an equal width and the height remains the same for each. [12] X Research source It’s best to only have 1 or 2 panels per window, since more than 2 panels can easily bunch together and get stuck on the rod. If you decide to make 2 panels, be sure to add an additional 4 inches (10 cm) to your width measurement to account for 2 more seam allowances on the sides of the panels."

      "title": "Add 1 in (2.5 cm) seams along the sides of the panels.",
      "content": "Add 1 in (2.5 cm) seams along the sides of the panels. Fold and pin side seams onto the back of each panel, and then quickly iron over them to hold the seam in place. Use a sewing machine to quickly sew the seams down, or sew them by hand for a more handcrafted look. Once the seams are sewn down, remove the pins. [13] X Research source It’s important to sew the side seams first to allow the top and bottom seams to have open ends for inserting the rod. If you are sewing delicate fabric using a sewing machine, make the tension looser."

      "title": "Fold the top of the curtain down 3 in (7.6 cm) and sew it in place.",
      "content": "Fold the top of the curtain down 3 in (7.6 cm) and sew it in place. To make the top pocket for the curtain rod, crease the fabric so that the seam is at least double the width of the rod. Pin the seam in place and iron the crease to ensure that it stays in place. Then, use a sewing machine or hand sew the seam into place before removing the pins. [14] X Research source If you’re not sure how wide your rod is, 3 inches (7.6 cm) is normally enough to accommodate most rods. If you want a tighter fit so the rod stays in place, use the double width method. Be sure to adjust the measurements of your seam allowances to accommodate this change."

      "title": "Sew a 3 in (7.6 cm) seam onto the bottom of each panel.",
      "content": "Sew a 3 in (7.6 cm) seam onto the bottom of each panel. For the bottom seam, repeat the process for the top “pocket.” If you don’t want the bottom seam to be open on the sides, you can sew them closed along the side seam. [15] X Research source If you want to add a footer to the curtain, you can sew an additional line of thread down the middle of the seam. If the fabric is light, you can sew some weight into the hem to make your curtains drape nicely."

      "content": "Slide your panels onto a curtain rod and hang it in your home. Position the opening of the top seam on the curtain at the end of the rod with the pattern of the fabric facing toward you. Make sure the seams are facing toward the window, and then hang the rod up on the wall. [16] X Research source If you leave the bottom seam open, you can flip the curtains upside down to reverse the pattern of the fabric."
