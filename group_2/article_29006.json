      "title": "Get a small, thick stack of paper to make your flipbook with.",
      "content": "Get a small, thick stack of paper to make your flipbook with. You can use a notebook or pad of sticky notes or bind your own stack of paper using glue, staples, or a paper clip. Look for paper that is around 3 x 5 inches (7.6 x 12.7 cm). Something slightly smaller or larger can also work. Use lightweight paper for your flipbook so the pages are easy to flip."

      "title": "Draw an image on the bottom sheet of paper in the stack.",
      "content": "Draw an image on the bottom sheet of paper in the stack. This image will be the first sequence of your flipbook animation, so draw whatever you want to be the starting point. Draw the image toward the bottom right corner of the sheet of paper so it’s visible when you’re flipping through the book later on. Draw in pencil so you can erase any mistakes you make along the way. Go over the pencil with ink once you’re finished with your animation. Keep your drawing in one area of the paper. This way, your animation will always be in one location, making it easier to see when you flip the pages. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw the same image on the next sheet of paper, varying it slightly.",
      "content": "Draw the same image on the next sheet of paper, varying it slightly. Draw the image around the same spot on the page as the first image you drew. This image will be the second sequence in your animation, so it should display a minor shift from the first image. Use a lightbox under your sheets of paper in order to create an “onion skin” to be able to see the image on the previous sheet. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can also retrace the original drawing by pressing down hard to create an indent of the image on the next page. For example, to create an animation of a stick-figure person waving their hand, you’d start by drawing the figure with their hands down at their sides on the last page of the stack. On the next page up, you’d draw the same stick-figure person in the same spot on the page, but this time, one of his hands would be slightly moved upward."

    {
      "title": "Continue drawing slightly varied images on each subsequent sheet of paper.",
      "content": "Continue drawing slightly varied images on each subsequent sheet of paper. Always draw the next image or sequence of animation on the page that’s on top of the previous image you drew. These slightly varied images will create the animation when you flip through your book. For example, in the waving stick-figure person animation, you’d continue to draw the stick-figure person on each subsequent page, with his hand gradually moving higher up in each drawing. Once his hand is fully in the air in an image you draw, start to draw images of his hand moving back down to his side. This creates the look that he’s waving his hand up and down in the final animation."

      "title": "Use color to make your flipbook animation more interesting.",
      "content": "Use color to make your flipbook animation more interesting. Try using markers or colored pencils to fill in the images you draw. Use the same colors in each sequence of your animation so your animation looks fluid and continuous when you flip through your flipbook. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Create elaborate drawings so your flipbook is more complex.",
      "content": "Create elaborate drawings so your flipbook is more complex. Once you’ve mastered the basics, move on from drawing stick figures and start drawing interesting scenes and characters with dimension. Use shading and perspective to make your animation look more realistic. [4] X Research source Keep background shading consistent. If the moving item itself is casting a shadow, like a bouncing ball, then move the shadow with the item."

      "title": "Flip through your flipbook to watch your animation once it’s finished.",
      "content": "Flip through your flipbook to watch your animation once it’s finished. Hold your thumb on the bottom-right edge of the stack and slowly pull upward, flipping through each page of the book. Flip through the pages fast enough that your animation looks fluid but not so fast that you accidentally skip over pages in the sequence. [5] X Research source If the pages are slipping too much, secure them along the top edge with a binder clip or a staple. Ensure no pages are sticking together so your flipbook can be as fluid as possible."

      "content": "Print out images to create a physical photo flipbook. If you’re not the best drawer, have no fear! There’s a creative way you can still make a flipbook. Take a series of photos of yourself (we recommend taking a burst photo while doing an action to get multiple images). Then, print out the photos so they’re all the same size. Arrange the photos in order and glue, staple, or bind them together. [6] X Research source Try taking photos of you making a heart with your hands, signing “I Love You,” or making a silly face. Remember, if you’re taking individual photos, make sure to take a photo of every slight movement for a smooth animation."

This app allows you to create your own flipbook or animation without needing paper or writing utensils. Simply draw whatever you want and follow the app’s instructions. Similarly, you can create graphic designs on Canva and upload them. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that this is a digital flipbook. You won’t have to flip pages to see your drawing come to life—just hit the play button!"

      "content": "Use an online PDF flipbook converter. In the business world, flipbooks are digital books or PDFs with a “flipping” animation that makes it look like a page is turning on screen. While these aren’t specifically designed to make animated flipbooks, they could work in a pinch! Simply upload a series of drawings as a PDF to Flipsnack.com , InstantFlipbook.com , FlipHTML5.com , or Heyzine.com . Follow the website’s instructions, download your PDF, and then quickly hit the forward and back pages on the flipbook to make the animation come to life. Keep in mind that this isn’t a foolproof method and may be trickier to navigate for smaller drawings."
