      "content": "Fiction is a made-up story. Fiction literature is created from the imagination. This includes genres like mystery, fantasy, and romance. The characters, settings, and situations in the stories may seem real, but they’re entirely made up by the author or writer. [1] X Research source Fiction is “fake” because the stories aren’t set accounts of real-life events—they didn’t happen in real life. It’s very possible that a fiction story can be inspired by real-life events; however, the characters and plot aren’t real. For example, the Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre , and Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games are works of fiction. [2] X Research source Why read fiction? Studies have shown that reading fiction helps improve your social skills and emotional recollection.

      "title": "Fiction is imagined, while nonfiction is factual.",
      "content": "Fiction is imagined, while nonfiction is factual. Creative works that are fully or partially made up by an author or writer are fiction because they’ve been invented or imagined. On the other hand, literature that describes actual events, people, or places is nonfiction because it’s 100% true. [13] X Research source Think of it this way: If something is fabricated in a story, it’s likely fiction. To find out if something is fiction or nonfiction, ask yourself, “Did this story really happen in real life?” If you answer yes, it’s likely nonfiction. If you answer no, it’s probably fiction."
