      "content": "Make a double boiler using a pot of water and a mixing bowl. Fill a pot halfway with water and place it on the stovetop over medium heat. Then, set a small, heat-safe mixing bowl over the opening of the pot. The water will heat the bowl from underneath so you can melt your ingredients in the bowl without burning them. [1] X Research source The water should be hot, but not boiling. If it’s boiling, it might scorch your chocolate as it cooks! Think you’ll make your own chocolate regularly? Consider investing in a real double boiler so you don’t have to make one every time."

      "content": "Melt ¾ cup (140 g) of cocoa butter in the heated mixing bowl. Keep the cocoa butter moving continuously at the bottom of the bowl so it melts faster. Cocoa butter melts at about the same speed as ordinary butter, and it looks pretty similar when it melts too. [2] X Research source Find cocoa butter in the baking aisle at any health food store, as well as some major supermarkets. An equal amount of coconut oil works great as a substitute for cocoa butter.

      "content": "Sift ¾ cup (80 g) of cocoa powder into the melted cocoa butter. Add the cocoa powder little by little using a sieve to break up any clumping. Use a whisk or metal spoon to stir the two ingredients together until the cocoa powder dissolves completely. Make sure there aren’t any clumps or dry pockets in the mixture."

      "title": "Shake in ¼ cup of milk powder and 1 cup (100 g) of confectioners' sugar.",
      "content": "Shake in ¼ cup of milk powder and 1 cup (100 g) of confectioners' sugar. Give the mixture another thorough stir to make sure the last of your dry ingredients are fully incorporated. The chocolate should be starting to take on a lighter, more delicate color after adding the milk powder. [4] X Research source Want to make vegan “milk” chocolate ? Just use an equal amount of soy milk powder, almond milk powder, or rice milk powder instead. [5] X Research source If you’re trying to cut back on sugar, use 1 cup (240 mL) of agave syrup or 1–2 teaspoons (4.9–9.9 mL) of liquid stevia instead of confectioners' sugar. You might think you should use regular milk to make milk chocolate, but milk is actually too liquidy! All that excess liquid would leave your chocolate runny and prevent it from setting.

      "title": "Remove the bowl from the heat and stir the chocolate until it thickens.",
      "content": "Remove the bowl from the heat and stir the chocolate until it thickens. Fold the chocolate over on itself repeatedly from the bottom of the bowl until it’s smooth, creamy, and free of lumps. [7] X Research source Your chocolate will still be somewhat thin at this point. Don’t worry—it will continue to thicken as it sets up. For even more deliciousness, mix in nuts, mint, or dried fruit."

      "title": "Pour the chocolate onto a nonstick surface or into a candy mold.",
      "content": "Pour the chocolate onto a nonstick surface or into a candy mold . If you want your chocolate to harden into a single large sheet, spread it out over a nonstick baking mat or sheet of parchment paper to a thickness of about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) edge-to-edge. To make individual chocolates, transfer the warm chocolate to a candy mold instead. [8] X Research source No candy mold? Use a well-greased ice cube tray! If you’re using a mold, tap the bottom onto a hard surface a few times to get rid of any bubbles in the chocolate."

      "title": "Let your chocolate harden in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Let your chocolate harden in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Once your chocolate sets up, break it into pieces or pop individual chocolates out of their molds and dig in! Store your homemade milk chocolate in a covered container on your countertop, or inside a pantry or another cool, dry place. It should keep for up to 1 year. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Melt 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of coconut oil in a small pot over low heat.",
      "content": "Melt 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of coconut oil in a small pot over low heat. Coconut oil has a low melting point, so this should only take a few seconds. Keep the coconut oil moving continuously at the bottom of the pot to help it melt faster. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Add 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of honey and 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract.",
      "content": "Add 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of honey and 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract. Use a whisk or metal spoon to scrape the sticky honey into the pot. Then, drizzle in the vanilla. Stir the ingredients into the melted oil until they dissolve and form a thin, syrupy mixture. [11] X Research source Be sure to keep your cooktop on a low heat setting. If the oil gets too hot, it could scorch the sugars in the honey and spoil the flavor of the finished chocolate. For sweeter dark chocolate , add 1/4 cup (25 g) of confectioners' sugar, 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of agave syrup, or 3-6 drops of liquid stevia at the same time that you add the honey and vanilla."

      "content": "Sift in 1/2 cup (50 g) of cocoa powder gradually. Rather than dumping all of the cocoa powder in at once, add it a little at a time using a sieve over the pot to break up any clumps. As you do, keep your whisk or spoon moving to help distribute the cocoa powder evenly throughout the mixture."

      "content": "Take the chocolate off the heat and continue stirring it as it thickens. You’ll know your chocolate is done when it takes on a smooth, dark color and the surface becomes slightly glossy. At this point, it just needs to be left to harden! [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer the warm chocolate to a nonstick surface or candy mold to cool. Carefully pour the chocolate out of the pot and onto a flexible nonstick baking mat or cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. For cute, bite-sized pieces of chocolate, pour your chocolate into a candy mold instead. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Refrigerate your chocolate for 1 hour. Once it’s fully set, it’s ready to break into pieces or remove from the mold. Enjoy! Store your finished chocolate in the refrigerator, or keep it in a covered container on your countertop. Dark chocolate will last for up to 2 years. If your chocolate begins to melt or soften at room temperature, place it back in the refrigerator at any point to harden it back up."
