      "content": "Cut the pineapple, mango, peach, and nectarine into pieces. Remove the core from a pineapple and cut it into wedges or bite-sized chunks. You'll also need to peel a peach and mango before you cut them into bite-sized pieces. You can leave the peel on the nectarine before you cut it. Transfer the chopped fruit to a serving bowl. If you'd like a cold fruit salad, ensure that the fruit is chilled before you cut it or refrigerate the cut fruit for 30 minutes before you serve it."
