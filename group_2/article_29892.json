You can use anything as long as it's flexible and not too thin or brittle. It must quickly and easily tighten.

      "content": "Use string or cord if you don’t have wire. Make sure it's strong enough to hold a small (5-8 lbs; 2.5-3.5 kg) animal. If it snaps under your own strength, it probably won't work. The following items are suitable for a snare trap if you don't have or can't find wire near you. Shoelaces Dental floss Fishing line"

      "title": "Scout out the area.",
      "content": "Scout out the area. A snare can be used day or night, rain or shine, and in any climate. All you need to make sure of is that animals pass by more than once in a blue moon. Place your snare on a trail frequented by your prey. Placing random snares with no eye for signs of small game is a waste of time. [2] X Research source Look for signs of game in droppings, shelters, tracks, scratches, and signs of feeding. A significant source of water and food for the area is a safe bet as well."

    {
      "title": "Pick your \"engine.\"",
      "content": "Pick your \"engine.\" Now that you've found the general area you want to build your snare in, look above you. What sort of trees do you have to work with? The tree will be the beef of your machinery. [3] X Research source Find a sapling (a young tree) that is strong enough yet bendy. Keep in mind, it must be able to hold the game high in the air until you find it. If no saplings are around, look for a large tree limb and decent-sized rock. This is an alternate method that uses the same idea but doesn't require a bendable, well-placed sapling."

    {
      "title": "Carve a mouth, or hook, into two sticks.",
      "content": "Carve a mouth, or hook, into two sticks. Think of linking your own hands together (fingernails tucked into the other hand) and pulling your elbows apart. That is the tension you'll be using. [4] X Research source The base should be longer than the hook and a bit sturdier. The hook can be small--as long as it fits into the mouth of the base."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plant the base into the ground.",
      "content": "Plant the base into the ground. It is easier to drive into the ground if you carve it into a peg shape first. The point breaks the soil much more quickly. The base should be very close to the sapling you scouted out; the two will work in tandem."

    {
      "title": "Tie your cord around a bendable sapling.",
      "content": "Tie your cord around a bendable sapling. Make a knot that will not come off, even under tension. It should be about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) from the top, depending on the strength of the sapling. Test it before you assume it's sturdy. Remember: the animal will be struggling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the other end of your cord to the hook.",
      "content": "Attach the other end of your cord to the hook. Place the hook in mouth of base. Right now, the base should be the only thing preventing the hook from flying up into the air and the sapling straightening out. [5] X Research source Make sure your cord is the proper length. When the hook is in place, the sapling should be bent towards a 90 degree angle. When the hook is removed, it should straighten up again (dangling the animal)."

      "title": "Tie a noose to the bottom of the hook.",
      "content": "Tie a noose to the bottom of the hook. Again, make sure the knot is securely in place. At this point, the hook should have two cords attached: one to the noose and one to the sapling."

      "title": "Set up your trigger so the noose can be activated.",
      "content": "Set up your trigger so the noose can be activated. With the noose on the ground, a small animal is unlikely to disturb the rope heavily enough to trigger the hook. So, create a trigger for them! You have two choices here: [6] X Research source Option #1: Suspend the noose in the air. Tie another string to the noose on the opposite side of where your hook is. Tie that rope to another sapling or branch so the noose floats in midair and the line on the side of the hook is taut. Whenever an animal brushes against it, it should disturb the noose enough to trigger the trap. Option #2: Put a stick in the middle of the noose and connect it to the hook. Wrap a tiny branch around another piece of string and tie it to the taut rope holding your trap in place. Then, hang a second branch in mid-air over the side of the noose using two rocks (or other branches) as supports. Wrap the tiny branch and string around the support branch and pin it in place by setting a larger branch on top in the middle of the noose. The trick here is to get the tiny branch in the middle of two layers that pin it in place. We’re describing a large branch under and another branch on top. You can set it up using whatever weights you’d like, though."

Carve them into peg shapes beforehand to drill them into the ground more easily. Place their \"arms\" parallel to each other. You will use the armpits as a source of support for the necessary tension."

Test everything before you assume it's secure. A struggling animal will not go easy on your trap. Tie your wire around a rock and throw over a sturdy tree limb if easier or more convenient. The rock should dangle above the ground and emulate the same methods used with the sapling."

      "content": "Attach a small stick at the end of your wire. This is your trigger point. Knot your wire and then knot it again. A stick that is around 4 in (10 cm) is long enough. Hold it under the stick that's in the armpit of the first two, wire tugged tight in front. It uses the tension between the cord and armpitted stick to stay where it is when propped up."

      "content": "Follow the hook trigger method. You will need two sticks with carved out mouths and several feet of wire.

      "content": "Tie one end of your line to the hook and place the baited line in the water. Instead of a noose, you will be using your baited line to catch fish. The bait dangles in the water and the top of your line rests on the hook, ready to fly into the air upon even the slightest of tugs. Make sure algae or seaweed won't mess up your trap. Try to clear the area of any needless shrubbery that could trigger your snare unnecessarily."
