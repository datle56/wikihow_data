      "content": "Consider whether you even need to make the compass first. If you're low on iron ingots and/or redstone, you can save them by simply looking at the compass pointer when the items are placed in the crafting table but then not activating the crafting. Note that you can also see the compass on the item statistics page if you've made a compass in the past. This means you can see the direction pointer without having to even use the crafting table. If you need a compass to make map paper, you'll need to craft it."
