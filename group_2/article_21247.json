      "content": "Use pruners to cut 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) long stems below the buds. Look at your mother plant and pick out 3 to 4 stems that look green and healthy. Grab your pruners and cut each stem just below the buds to make cuttings that are 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) long. [1] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Try not to make your cuttings much longer than that! If they’re too long, they won’t root well. Disinfect the blades of your pruner with a damp cloth of rubbing alcohol before you cut to avoid infecting the plant."

      "content": "Remove the lower leaves, but keep the top 2 or 3. This will help the plant focus its energy on creating roots instead of making its leaves bigger. Gently rip off the bottom leaves on your cutting, leaving a couple of leaves up top. [2] X Research source You can also dip the ends in rooting hormone powder to increase the chances of rooting. This can help the roots develop faster and stronger. [3] X Research source You’ll be submerging the bottom 1/3 of each cutting in water or soil, or you will want to eliminate any leaves in that area. If your plant is flowering, pull the flower heads off with your fingers so the clusia focuses its energy on rooting instead of blooming.

They need sunlight, but they can get a little crispy if they’re exposed to too much. [8] X Research source If your cuttings turn brown, move them away from the window. Clusia plants use photosynthesis, or energy from the sun, to create their roots. If they don’t get enough sunlight, they won’t be able to grow, so this is super important!"

Clusia is one species that can grow in water, too. This is called hydroponics. To grow your clusia hydroponically, submerge the roots and leave the top part of the roots free of water so they can breathe. Rinse the roots and put fresh water in the glass every 2 weeks.
