    {
      "title": "Donate money.",
      "content": "Donate money. The easiest way to help the homeless is to donate your money to a nonprofit whose mission is to serve the homeless. This ensures that social workers and professionals who best understand how to help the homeless will have the resources necessary to do their important work. Consider leaving a donation to an organization that supports the homeless in your will. [1] X Research source You can also donate to local churches, temples, mosques, and other religious institutions that offer help to the homeless."
    },
    {
      "title": "Donate items.",
      "content": "Donate items. Donating your used or new items is another easy way to help. Donate these items to local organizations that house the homeless or otherwise support them. Alternately, you could provide such things to your local homeless population directly. The best items to donate include: [2] X Research source Winter weather clothing (such as hats, mittens, coats, and boots) New underwear and socks Travel-sized hygiene items (toothpaste, soap, etc.) Professional clothing (a hurdle to overcoming homelessness is looking presentable at job interviews) First aid items (such as Neosporin, Band-Aids, antibacterial cream, and hand sanitizer) Secondary medical items (such as sunscreen, heavy duty lotions like Bag Balm, allergy medication, and tissues) Bus passes (great for helping them get to job interviews) Linens (i.e. twin sheets, towels, pillows and pillow cases)"

    {
      "title": "Provide food.",
      "content": "Provide food. One of the constant struggles of homelessness is finding enough to eat. Donate canned or boxed goods to your local soup kitchen or homeless shelter. [3] X Research source Before making your donation, contact the homeless organization and find out which items they need most. Alternately, you could buy (or make) lunch for a homeless person you encounter on the street."
    },
    {
      "title": "Donate recreational items.",
      "content": "Donate recreational items. In addition to practical items like clothes and hygiene products, you might want to provide toys for the children of homeless families. Homeless children often have few possessions of any kind, and may not have any toys at all. For adults, you might want to donate books, magazines, or other reading materials. [4] X Research source Donating toys is an especially good idea around the holidays, when homeless kids often have few gifts to look forward to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Volunteer your time.",
      "content": "Volunteer your time. If you cannot donate money or goods, sign up to work with a homeless organization. The sort of volunteer opportunities available to you will vary depending on the organization you contact and the organization’s needs. You might be able to: [5] X Research source Pack boxes with foods for distribution to homeless people Serve hot food at a soup kitchen Help homeless people transition to working a job and paying bills Train homeless people in a skill like gardening or playing an instrument Use your skill set to assist the homeless in other ways (for instance, by giving homeless people free haircuts or tutoring homeless kids)"

    {
      "title": "Educate others about homelessness.",
      "content": "Educate others about homelessness. Many people have trouble sympathizing with homeless people because of the many negative stereotypes that the homeless population is burdened with. Educating others could be as simple as correcting a friend or coworker about a homeless stereotype they express, or it could be talking with your local city or county politicians about the problems homeless people face. If you have children, start by educating them. If you volunteer for an organization that supports the homeless, ask if you can take your child along so that they can see firsthand the hardships of homelessness."

    {
      "title": "Encourage local publications to publish information about homeless shelters.",
      "content": "Encourage local publications to publish information about homeless shelters. Many people are unaware that there are homeless shelters in their communities. Contact your local newspaper, religious institution, and the editors of local civic group newsletters and ask them if they would consider running a weekly or monthly listing of local services available to the homeless. That way, more people will know about and utilize these services."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write letters to the editor.",
      "content": "Write letters to the editor. Writing letters to the editor of your local paper can help promote greater awareness and understanding of homelessness in your area. You could also write to editors of national papers or publications. Share some information about the number of homeless people in your area (or country, if you’re writing to a national publication). Explain the different reasons why people become homeless. End by suggesting ways that people in your region or nation could help the homeless."

    {
      "title": "Start a blog about homelessness.",
      "content": "Start a blog about homelessness. Instead of (or in addition to) writing to established publications about homelessness, start a blog of your own to create awareness. Blogs are a great platform for you to share your understanding of homelessness and encourage people to help. Promote your blog via social media and encourage others to provide feedback. Incorporate video and photos on your blog as well as text."

      "title": "Organize a clothing or food drive.",
      "content": "Organize a clothing or food drive. One of the best ways to help the homeless and create awareness about homelessness in your community is to organize a collection for food and/or clothes. Talk to local businesses, schools and colleges, and religious institutions about leaving a bin or large box in or near their foyer. Place a large sign on the bin identifying the purpose of the drive and list the items that are most needed. [6] X Research source Advertise the food or clothing drive by putting up flyers around town and by asking your local newspaper to place a notice about the drive in upcoming editions. Restaurants are good places to host food or clothing drive bins, since they generate a lot of foot traffic. People will remember to bring along some canned or boxed food next time they visit. If you’re organizing the drive on behalf of or in conjunction with a particular nonprofit that supports the homeless population, ask them ahead of time what sort of foods or clothing items you should encourage people to donate. Include this information on the sign you attach to your bins or boxes."

      "content": "Support free and low cost medical care. Basic medical care is also a huge problem for homeless people.

      "content": "Oppose laws making homelessness a crime. In many places, being homeless can get you arrested. When homeless people are arrested, it makes it even harder for them to get back on their feet. To help the homeless, vote against measures that criminalize homelessness, and against politicians that support such measures."

      "title": "Create jobs.",
      "content": "Create jobs. If you're in a position where you can give a homeless person a job, do it! Whether it's offering to hire and train someone in a position like a secretary or file clerk, or just letting them do odd jobs like mowing your lawn, this can really make a huge difference for a homeless person. Be sure, however, that you don't take advantage of them. Pay homeless people a reasonable and fair amount of money."

      "content": "Give your recyclables to homeless people. Many homeless people rely on the small return they get on bottles and cans from recycling centers to purchase food or other necessities.

      "content": "Direct homeless people to services that could help. Some people may not know how to locate help and therefore never get any. If you see a homeless person, you could ask them if they need help. If they say they do, ask them if they’ve been to the local homeless shelter. If they have not and are interested in going, provide them with directions. [12] X Research source Many homeless organizations have printable maps or resource lists that you could print and give to the homeless person in question.

      "content": "Identify and dispel stereotypes. Many people carry around certain preconceived notions about what homeless people are like and why they are homeless. For instance, some people think the homeless are only on the streets because of their own poor choices. In fact, this is often untrue.

Continually evaluate your own ideas about homelessness and keep an open mind."
