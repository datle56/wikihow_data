      "content": "Aim to get a pedicure once a month. Whether you treat yourself to pedicures in a salon or do at-home pedicures yourself , most nail techs recommend getting a pedicure about once every 4 weeks. After a month, your feet will have built-up dead skin, your nails will have grown out, and your polish (if any) will likely be chipped or tarnished. [1] X Research source That said, some people choose to get pedicures more frequently for the following reasons: Every week: If you lead an active lifestyle, stand on your feet all day, or simply enjoy being pampered, getting a pedicure once every week might be a good option for you. Every 2 weeks: If you frequently wear open-toed shoes and your feet are exposed to pollution and grime, or if you’re on your feet a lot and build calluses quickly, a pedicure every 2 weeks might be beneficial. Getting a pedicure once a month gives your skin time to regenerate between treatments, as pedicure-grade exfoliation can irritate your skin if done more often. If you're just switching out your polish shade, go as often as you’d like (just skip the exfoliation)."

      "content": "A pedicure is a therapeutic foot treatment for your skin and nails. If you have cracked heels, calluses, and/or corns on your feet, a pedicure may be calling your name! This great opportunity for me-time is not only relaxing but also highly beneficial to the overall health of your feet, as a pedicure removes dead skin and trims and shapes your nails so they stay in tip-top shape. [2] X Research source A full-package pedicure typically involves a warm foot bath to soften your skin, a massage, exfoliation, and toenail trimming and shaping, followed by an application of polish. Because your feet are being exfoliated, you’ll only need to get a pedicure of this type about once a month. If you want a pedicure to change the color of your toenail polish, simply ask your nail technician not to over-exfoliate your feet. This way, you can have a pedicure as often as you’d like—hello, self-care!"

      "content": "Regular pedicures help to prevent foot issues like ingrown toenails. Ingrown toenails and other foot-related skin conditions, like corns, can worsen if they’re not properly treated as they arise and may need to be medically removed later down the line. Believe it or not, staying on top of your pedicure routine, whether it's at home or in the salon, can prevent a costly trip to the podiatrist.

Wanting some extra TLC and relaxation is reason enough. Pedicures typically last around 30-60 minutes. Bring a book, catch up on work, or close your eyes and relax—you’ve got options!"

If your cuticles are taking up most of your nail bed or are cracked and ripped, a pedicure might be just what you need to get back to looking your best. [5] X Research source Use cuticle remover to slough off excess dead skin around your toenails during an at-home pedicure. A cuticle is the clear layer of skin that’s located at the bottom of your finger or toe, which helps to protect the nail bed."

Take a moment in the shower to feel your feet for dryness, cracking, or calluses. If you have any of those foot conditions or a painful ingrown toenail, a pedicure can help. [6] X Research source Get your ingrown toenails treated as soon as they arise to avoid needing surgery later. Calluses and corns are hardened, thick layers of dead skin that build up on your foot and can cause pain."
