      "title": "The first kiss is more likely to happen when nobody else is around.",
      "content": "The first kiss is more likely to happen when nobody else is around. Ask the person you like out on a romantic date or just ask them to come over and watch TV or a movie with you. You can even ask them to come help you do something like washing your car or rearranging your bedroom. [1] X Research source A romantic picnic in a park is a great idea for a date where your crush might kiss you. Another great time to try and get someone to kiss you is when you say goodbye in the car or at the front door after a date. If you’re at a party or a social event with your crush, ask them if they want to grab a drink or go outside for some air to get them alone."

      "content": "Eye contact shows attraction and confidence. The next time you and your crush hang out or go on a date, make sure to stare deep into their eyes. You don’t even have to talk—let your eyes do the talking! Make eye contact whenever you’re flirting with someone. For example, if you’re playfully teasing them, make sure to look into their eyes. If you and the person you like are hanging out in a group of people, glance over at them from time to time and stare deep into their eyes, then go back to the conversation you were having. This lets them know that they’re on your mind."

      "content": "Smiling shows that special someone that you’re feeling them. Smile when you make eye contact with the person you like or when they’re playfully flirting and teasing you. Seeing your smile and your fondness for them can give your crush all the confidence they need to make the first move! Don’t forget to laugh at their jokes, too! You can play with your crush a bit by pretending to be mad about something they said for a second or two, then smiling to let them know you’re just messing around with them."

      "title": "A gentle touch is another way to show attraction to someone.",
      "content": "A gentle touch is another way to show attraction to someone. Touch or gently rub their arm while you’re hanging out and chatting or hold their hand while you're walking together. Or, touch your thigh or elbow to theirs while you’re sitting next together. [2] X Research source This is called “breaking the touch barrier.” The more comfortable your crush is with touching you, the more confident they will feel to kiss you for the first time."

      "title": "This gets your lips nice and close for a kiss.",
      "content": "This gets your lips nice and close for a kiss. If you’re sitting next to the person you like, like when you're sharing a booth at a restaurant, watching a movie on the couch, or sitting on a bench in a park, lean over towards them so your bodies are closer and your face is near theirs. If they’re still not going in for the kiss, turn your face towards theirs so your lips are almost touching. [3] X Research source If you’re too shy to cuddle up to your crush like this, try the “I’m cold!” trick. Tell them that you’re feeling a little chilly, and hopefully, they scoot over and get closer to you to warm you up."

      "content": "A not-so-subtle hint might be all it takes to get that first kiss. Try to naturally work a compliment about your crush’s lips into a conversation by asking them what they like about you. Then, when they ask you what you like about them, tell them you like their lips and the reasons why. [4] X Research source For example, you could tell them that their lips look so soft and smooth. If you want to be even more obvious, just tell them that their lips look super kissable!"

      "content": "An intimate dance is the perfect moment for a first kiss. If you and your crush are at a party, grab their hand and lead them onto the dance floor. Or, go to a concert together and dance along to the music. Make sure to dance nice and close! [5] X Research source You can also initiate dancing by saying something like: “I love this song! Dance with me!”"

      "title": "A little pampering makes your lips look extra kissable.",
      "content": "A little pampering makes your lips look extra kissable. Rub your lips with a sugar scrub to loosen any dead skin and let it sit there for 1 minute or so. Wipe off the sugar scrub, then sleep with lip balm on to moisturize your lips. If you wear lipstick or lip gloss, avoid any that are sticky—nobody wants gooey shiny stuff all over their lips after they kiss you. [6] X Research source To make a natural homemade sugar scrub, mix a spoonful of brown sugar with a bit of honey. If you want to wear some kind of lip product when you hang out with your crush, try a lip plumper to make your lips even more irresistible. Just be careful not to use lip plumpers too often because it can lead to chapped lips."

      "content": "A cheek kiss can lead to a kiss on the lips. Lean in towards your crush and give them a little peck on the cheek. Stay close and look at them to see if they’ll make the next move and kiss you on the lips. [7] X Research source If the person seems uncomfortable after you kiss them on the cheek, reel it in. They might not be ready to kiss you or they might feel differently than you think they do. If your crush happens to kiss you on the cheek first, turn your lips towards theirs and pucker them up to try and get that kiss on the lips you're dying for!"

      "title": "Your crush might be holding back because they aren’t sure if you want to kiss.",
      "content": "Your crush might be holding back because they aren’t sure if you want to kiss. The best way to clear any doubts from their mind is to just tell them you want them to kiss you. Or, ask them if they want to kiss you, then lean in for the first kiss yourself if they say yes. [8] X Research source For example, you could say something straightforward like: “Can you kiss me?” or “Can I kiss you?” Or, say something like: “I would love to kiss you right now, if you’re into it.” or “I would love it if you kissed me right now, if you want to.” If the person says “no,” maybe they’re not ready to kiss you, or they aren’t into you in the same way. No matter how much it sucks, be respectful of that. Brush it off by saying something like: “Okay, that’s cool.” or “Thanks for being honest with me.”"
