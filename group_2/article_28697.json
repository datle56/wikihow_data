      "content": "Pull your hair back. Without brushing your hair, grab it all starting at the front near your face and collecting all your hair into one hand. Hold the hair at the location where you want to have your bun. If you like, you can let a few strands or your bangs/fringe hang loose to frame your face. To create a sophisticated mod look, pull your hair up very high near the top of your head. For a more professional look, your hair should be drawn to the center of the back of your head. To create an easy carefree messy bun, pull your hair to the nape of your neck. You can choose to make your bun off-center for a more playful look if you would like. This look works best if your bun is placed either very low or very high. Because you are going for a messy bun look, don’t brush your hair or run your hands through it too much as you draw it back. Simply pick your hair up, resisting the temptation to finger brush it. Be sure to pick up any loose strands, and make sure that all of your hair has been included in your handful."

On the third wrap of the hair tie, don’t pull your hair all the way through the band. Instead, leave ½-⅓ of your hair hanging out the bottom as a tail, while the remaining portion of your hair will create a loop in the upper part of the ponytail. If you need to stock up on hair ties, you can buy some online here ."

Try using a hair bungee or making your own. [1] X Research source To make a hair bungee, slip two bobby pins onto a hair elastic. Slide one of the pins into your hair at the top of the ponytail, where the hair is gathered. Wrap the elastic around the handful of hair until there is no more slack. After a few wraps, slide the other bobby pin in toward the center of your ponytail to pin the elastic in place. Make sure to make a loop with your hair on the final wrap, instead of just letting it hang down in a regular ponytail. If you need to purchase bobby pins, you can find them online here ."

Take the tail and wrap it around the base of the hair tie, covering the band. Use 2-3 bobby pins to secure the tail around the base. Then, part the loop down the center and pull the two sides to your scalp, and pin. You don’t need to create a direct part through the loop, you are only trying to pin the body of it to your head so that it doesn’t retain its ring-like shape. Feel free to pull out little pieces of your hair to let hang loose or to pin in other directions to enhance the messy look. You need to have fairly long hair in order to create this look."

In this case, you can lean it to one side and pin it. Otherwise, allow the knot to stand upright. If you have thick hair, you may wish to use a hair bungee instead of a regular hair elastic.

This may require a few minutes of brushing, to verify that the hair from every part of your head is smooth and included. Once you are sure your hair has been smoothed, use a hair tie to wrap around your handful of hair to secure it tightly. Make sure that the hair tie is not too loose to allow for slippage over time."

Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you will need to use anywhere from 3-7 bobby pins to keep your bun in place. Avoid using more than necessary though, as you will be able to see if there are many being used. Slide the bobby pins in under the bun, so that you can only partially see the very ends. They should slide under (not over or around) the elastic at the center of your bun. If you have layers in your hair, you may need to use additional pins to secure the layers to your scalp. If you have curly or wavy hair, you may need to use a hairdryer or straightening iron to straighten and smooth your hair before you wrap it."

Continue this pattern until you reach the end of your ponytail. When you get to the end, simply hold onto it. You will pin it to your head, so there is no need to use an elastic. You can also keep your braid from unraveling by lightly teasing the ends, or sliding a pair of bobby pins over the ends in an X shape. If you feel that you absolutely must use an elastic with this style, try to use a small clear one to minimize its appearance. Otherwise, you will be able to see it inside your bun."
