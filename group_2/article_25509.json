      "content": "According to astrologer Angel Eyedealism, Virgos are \"staid and careful and cautious.\" These traits can lead those with Virgo placements to be shy around people they like. A Venus in Virgo who likes you might be chatty in a group of people but then get quiet around you. If they seem shy, it's not a sign of disinterest—on the contrary, it's a sign they like you a lot and want to make a good impression but aren't quite comfortable yet. When shy people like a Virgo in Venus flirt, they're subtle about it. You may also notice them looking at you (but perhaps quickly looking away when you catch them) and getting a little fidgety when you're close.
