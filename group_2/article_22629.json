      "title": "Apply a silicone primer.",
      "content": "Apply a silicone primer. If your piercing has completely healed and you've removed the jewelry, dab silicone primer over the hole. A silicone primer should go on smoothly over the hole and help fill it in a little. Primer will also help cover any blemishes or red areas on your face. You can also put a little concealer over the primer to create the look of an even skin tone."

      "title": "Use scar wax.",
      "content": "Use scar wax. Scar wax will be thick and difficult to work with right out of the container. Take a little out and warm it between your fingers to soften it and make it easier to apply. Thin the wax out so you can cover the hole and surrounding skin with the wax. Place a little spirit gum to the side of the scar wax that you'll place on the skin. Firmly, put the piece over the hole and use foundation to blend in the edges with the rest of your makeup. You can also find scar wax that comes in a tube, which may be easiest to use in small amounts. You can find scar wax and spirit gum at beauty supply stores, costume stores, or online. Spirit gum is a quick-drying adhesive used to attach prosthetics or makeup."

      "content": "Wear a bandage. For many people, the hole from a lip piercing won't be very large or noticeable. But, if you'll be talking with your parents or boss and fear they'll see the hole up close, you can always cover it with a bandage. Wear a small circular blister bandage so you don't end up with a large bandage covering most of your lower face. If your piercing is still healing, you'll need to keep the jewelry. A bandage might be a good option for concealing the piercing as well. Just make sure that the bandage isn't pulling the piercing down or getting the jewelry sticky with adhesive."

      "content": "Avoid covering a newly pierced hole with makeup. Since the piercing isn't flush with your skin, makeup may actually make the piercing stand out more.

This will prevent any from accidentally getting into the piercing."

      "content": "Consider when to get the piercing. The skin around your lip piercing will be noticeably irritated for a few days after you get the piercing done. Your skin may appear bruised or swollen and the piercing may discharge a white fluid. Because of these hard to conceal signs, plan to get the piercing when you can avoid your parents or boss for several days. If you can't completely avoid contact, try to keep your distance until the piercing heals. While the initial healing process takes several days, it will take 2 to 3 months for a lip piercing to completely heal. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a clear bioplast loop or stud for the piercing. Ask the piercer to use this material because it's less noticeable than a metal loop or stud. Some piercers can safely use bioplast for your initial piercing. But, if your piercer isn't willing to work with this material, choose a plain stud.
