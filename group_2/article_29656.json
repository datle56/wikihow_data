Leave a gap big enough that you can later push the fabric through once it is all sewn. Limit the use of a sewing machine for this step unless you are comfortable enough handling the curves and bends."

If the hole cannot be held close, remove some stuffing from inside the paw until the hole can be held close without any force. If the hole needs to be held close with force, the stitching will break apart upon release. If this happens, just undo the stitches that remained and start over."
