      "title": "Descale annually to prevent scale and mineral buildup.",
      "content": "Descale annually to prevent scale and mineral buildup. Tap water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. Over time, those minerals get deposited on the insides of your pipes, where they can build up and block the flow of water. [1] X Research source To prevent that, Calame recommends descaling the system once a year. If you have very hard water, you may need to descale your water heater every 6 months. Otherwise, once a year is probably fine. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn off the power.",
      "content": "Turn off the power. Calame says that before you do any work on a water heater, it’s important to turn off the power. If you have an electric heater, unplug it or turn off the power at the breaker box. [3] X Research source If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas supply, or turn the gas valve to the “pilot” position. [4] X Research source According to Calame, the instructions for turning the gas on and off are usually labeled on the water heater."

      "title": "Remove the service caps from the cold and hot service valves.",
      "content": "Remove the service caps from the cold and hot service valves. Tankless water heaters often have service valves that allow you to flush the system. Check your owner’s manual for the exact location of the valves, or look for two levers—one with a blue handle for cold water, and one with a red handle for hot water. Look for twist-off caps near these levers, then unscrew them. [5] X Research source A little water may spill out when you remove the caps—keep towels handy just in case. Your tankless water heater may also have a third valve. If it does, open the cap on this valve as well. Some water heaters are installed without service valves. Unfortunately, if you don’t have service valves, you’ll need to consult a professional for advice on how to flush your tankless hot water heater."

      "title": "Attach a hose to each service valve.",
      "content": "Attach a hose to each service valve. Service valves typically have a 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) diameter and male threads, so choose plumbing hoses with 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) female ends. Attach a hose to each service valve—one to the hot side and one to the cold side. [6] X Research source If you have a third valve, attach a hose to it also. Tighten the hoses securely by hand. Put the other ends of the hoses into a clean 5 US gal (19 L) bucket. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Give each service valve lever a quarter turn.",
      "content": "Give each service valve lever a quarter turn. Start with the cold water lever and pull it upwards about 90°. Then, do the same thing for the hot water. [8] X Research source Water will probably start coming out of the hoses, so be sure they’re securely in the bucket. If there are small T-shaped levers on top of the service valves, slowly turn each of those to open them after the water has drained out of the system. These are pressure valves, and they will help release any pressure that’s built up in the system."

      "title": "Attach the cold water hose to a submersible pump.",
      "content": "Attach the cold water hose to a submersible pump. Place a submersible water pump into the bucket with the ends of your hoses. Then, screw the end of the cold water hose onto the pump’s output valve. [9] X Research source If your pump doesn’t have a 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) male threaded end, attach a 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) plumbing adapter to the outlet so you can attach the hose. Leave the hot water hose (and the third hose if you have one) in the bucket—but be sure the end of the hose is pointed downward near the bottom of the bucket to avoid splashes or spills."

      "title": "Pour descaling solution or household white vinegar into the bucket.",
      "content": "Pour descaling solution or household white vinegar into the bucket. Add enough vinegar or descaling solution to cover the bottom of the pump—about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) in the bottom of the container. When you start the pump, the level of the solution will drop, so add more if you need to. Don’t let the level go below the bottom of the pump—letting the pump run dry can damage the motor. [10] X Research source You’ll probably need about 2 US gal (7.6 L) of solution. Check the owner’s manual for your tankless water heater. Sometimes, they’ll specify that you need to use a specific cleaning solution. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn on the pump and let it run for about 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Turn on the pump and let it run for about 30 minutes. Plug the pump into a nearby power outlet to turn it on. You should see vinegar or descaler coming out of the hot water pipe within a few seconds. [12] X Research source As the pump runs, the cleaning solution may get cloudy, and you may start to see debris floating in it. This is normal, and it means you’re successfully descaling your tankless water heater."

      "title": "Turn off the pump and disconnect the hoses.",
      "content": "Turn off the pump and disconnect the hoses. After you take the cold water hose off of the pump, leave it in the bucket until any remaining vinegar or descaler has fully drained out of the system. This may take several minutes. Once it’s drained, unscrew the pipes from the hot and cold service valves and screw the service caps back on. [13] X Research source If your tankless water heater has a water filter, remove it and rinse it out while the heater is drained, then put it back in. Check your owner’s manual for tips on how to remove the filter. Either tighten the service caps by hand or very gently use a pair of pliers. Don’t overtighten them, or you could damage the service valves. [14] X Research source"

This will open the hot water lines to the rest of your house again. Then, do the same for the cold water lever.

Run the hot water in an indoor sink for about a minute or until the water is clean and fresh again. [16] X Research source Because the power to the tankless water heater isn’t back on yet, the water coming out of the hot water tap will be cold. When you’re finished, you can turn the gas and power back on again. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean and inspect the outside of the hot water heater regularly. About once a month or so, wipe down the outside of the tankless water heater with a damp cloth. This will help prevent dirt and other buildup from getting into the system and causing damage. As you do this, check around the tank for any drips, leaks, or signs of wear. [18] X Research source Don’t ignore water leaks around your water heater . Over time, these issues can get worse, leading to problems like mold, mildew, and a risk of electrical fires.

Clean the filter housing with soapy water, replace the filter with a new one, and replace the filter.

You’ll need a submersible pump, two 3/4 “ plumbing hoses, a 3/4 “ adapter for your pump if it doesn’t come with one, a bucket of water, and 1.5-2 gallons of descaling solution or white vinegar. You can either purchase these items separately or in a tankless water heater cleaning kit . After the first time you flush the tank, you’ll already have all of the supplies—so the next time you need to flush the system, you’ll only need to purchase descaling solution or vinegar."

Over time, these deposits will block the flow of water through the pipes, which will decrease the effectiveness of your water heater. Eventually, hot water might not come out at all.
