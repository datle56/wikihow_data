Each of these ingredients has antibacterial properties and could help prevent infections. They also make a good base for your ointment. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of coconut oil, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of castor oil, and 1 oz (28 g) of beeswax into a double boiler. Each of these ingredients is available from most supermarkets or health food stores. A double boiler is important because if you put the oils over a direct flame, they might burn. Make sure you fill the bottom section with water or it won’t work. Petroleum jelly also has wound-healing properties and can help protect your skin.
