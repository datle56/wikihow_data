Professional Matchmaker LeTisha Underwood encourages you to do exciting things together, explaining the two main benefits of these activities. First, it will show her that you want her to be involved in your life's journeys; second, the adventure will help you bond together by releasing a chemical called “oxytocin” that's responsible for feelings of love. [6] X Expert Source LeTisha Underwood Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 14 December 2021. Show that you care by taking part in the things that she loves doing. Going to see a chick flick, even if you think it will be boring, will tell her that you care about her needs, and not just your own. The fact that you are still willing to watch it with her will make her appreciate the effort you’re putting in. If she wants to go clothes shopping, ask her if she would like to have you join her! If she lets you, help her find something to suit her best. [7] X Research source Keegan suggests taking her out on the town regularly, especially if you live in a big, vibrant city. He says, “Taking her out for live music and a glass of wine helps keep the relationship fresh and alive.” He warns against falling into the Netflix-on-the-couch trap, as this can lead to stagnancy in the relationship and doesn’t make her feel appreciated.

She'll realize she makes you like the luckiest person in the world, which you are! Place a hand on the small of her back, squeeze her shoulders, or hold her close when introducing her to one of your friends. [9] X Research source If she uses social media a lot, feel free to post photos together on social media. Post photos of the two of you, tag her at places, and change your relationship status . Show her you are publicly committed to the relationship and that you are proud to show her off. However, if she is a very private person, this may make her uncomfortable, so ask first. Don't be afraid to introduce her as your girlfriend if she is. She might be a little put off if you just introduce her using her name. If you haven't made it clear whether you two are boyfriend and girlfriend, stick to introducing her by name. Don't let go of her hand when another person walks by. It could give off the impression that you’re embarrassed to be with her, or that you're interested in someone else. If you're holding hands, wait for a good moment to break contact."

Some people never bother to get really close to a girl because they're only interested in having a physical relationship. Don't be the person who doesn't know very much about their girlfriend or forgets what she likes and dislikes. Ask her about her hobbies and find out what she's passionate about. Everyone is passionate about something, even if it's buried deep down inside. Find out what she loves to do more than anything else. Figure out what she likes about it. Try to understand it and be interested in it. Ask lots of questions . Ask her about her childhood, her parents and siblings, her goals, her fears and desires, and her likes and dislikes.

It lets her know you value her input and consider her when making a decision. It also demonstrates trust and willingness to be flexible, which are both essential in a healthy relationship. So, go ahead and ask her what she thinks of that new bold shirt you just got, and try not to be offended by her answer! Listen to her criticisms . No one wants to feel criticized, but compromise is part of a healthy relationship.

Stand up for her when she needs it. You don’t have to fight her battles or get physical with someone, but don't let other people mistreat you or your girlfriend. Comfort her whenever you can. Girls want the security of knowing that if something does happen, they won't have to worry about you jumping ship. Reassure her you're there to stay.

      "content": "Be spontaneous to keep the romance alive. The mere fact that you went out of your way to arrange a surprise date is often enough. Your date doesn't have to be elaborate. Tell her to meet you somewhere or pick her up yourself. Pretend you're doing something boring, like chores, and then surprise her with the date—like a movie, a cooking class, or a picnic somewhere remote. She might jump into your arms or look you lovingly in the eyes. Before your date, find out what her favorite flowers are and send her a bouquet. One good place to figure out what flowers she likes is at the grocery store. When you’re there together, ask her casually what kind of flowers look good, and then take note. Remember that different flowers symbolize different things. For example, while red roses mean love and romance, white roses mean friendship."

The more personal it is, and the more energy you put into it, the better. Here are some ideas: Make her a relationship journal. Buy a nice, blank journal. Write about when you first met her, all the first dates, and how she made you feel. Include pictures and other mementos, like movie stubs. Tell her that you want to take turns writing in the journal. Make her a collage of all the mementos you saved from the relationship. Save brochures, tickets, stubs, receipts, and pictures that mean something to both of you. Tape or glue them to a nice poster board and give it to her. Send her a video. Tell her how she makes you feel, what you love about her, and what you were thinking when you first met her. Set all of this to music and share it with her. Do something for her parents. Maybe her mom needs help organizing a silent auction. Volunteer to help out with ticket sales. Your girlfriend will be overjoyed that you're getting to know her family, and that you'd do something selfless for them.
