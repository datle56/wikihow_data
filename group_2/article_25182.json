[2] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. [3] X Research source Ask your partner questions. Everyone likes to talk about themselves, and trying to learn more about your partner’s life, hobbies, or thoughts signals that you’re interested. Try telling your partner something positive about themselves or about the time you just shared together, such as \"I really had a good time with you tonight, and I'd be interested in hanging out with you again!\" If they respond positively and echo your feelings - for example, if they tell you that they want to meet up again - this may be a good sign that they’re on the same page.

See if your date is facing you with an open and relaxed posture. This can be a good sign that they feel comfortable with you."

Initiating physical touch with your partner helps remove barriers between the two of you, allows you to gauge their interest, and may help both of you feel more comfortable.

[6] X Research source Examples of light, non-sexual touch include tapping your partner on the shoulder to get their attention, touching their arm while you’re talking to them, or placing your hand right next to theirs. Touching your partner anywhere else might be seen as more sexual, and could make them uncomfortable."

[9] X Research source If you aren’t getting verbal consent from your partner, you need to be extra cautious that you’re reading your partner’s body language correctly — signs that your partner wants to continue include smiling, leaning towards you, and touching you back in the same way you’re touching them.

You need to check both that your partner is interested in getting more physical with you, and that they're comfortable with doing so in a car in a potentially more hidden area. You should definitely have had some sort of basic physical contact, such as light kissing or hand-holding, before initiating a make-out session. You can see how your partner feels about getting more physical by saying something like, \"I would love to find a more private place to kiss you. Would you like that?\" [14] X Research source Tell your partner where you're planning on taking them before you drive to a more remote area. It may be tempting to keep it a surprise in order to make it feel more romantic, but you may end up killing the mood instead, as some people may be worried for their safety if you unexpectedly drive to an area where no one else can see you."

Double-check that both your partner as well as anyone else who may see you will not feel uncomfortable. Some people don’t like public displays of affection, and your partner may not want to kiss you where other people could see. Kissing in public is not against the law in most places, but if you want to escalate things beyond kissing, you may need to move to a more private spot indoors. If an act is illegal in public, then it’s illegal to do in a car that’s parked in a public spot. [15] X Research source"

You may need to ask your partner to hold on for a second, and make some minor adjustments or ask them if they're interested in moving to the back seat. Slide your seats backwards and tilt the seats back if you’re in the front seat. If you’re in a vehicle with a bench seat, you may be able to just tilt the seats back and then lie down across the seat. If there is a gearshift in between the two front seats, and you don't want to lean over it, it may help for both of you to move over to the passenger seat, where there’s no steering wheel or pedals to get in the way. Move the front seats forward if you’re going to hop in the back of the car. Try to make as much room as possible for you and your partner by sliding the seats up and flattening the backseat down into the trunk, if possible. [20] X Research source"

It can be hard to get physically comfortable when making out in a car, and you may have to adjust frequently. Furthermore, you should make sure your partner is feeling good about how far and how fast things are progressing. [21] X Research source Get verbal consent by telling your partner what you want to do before you do it. For example, as you're kissing, tell your partner something like, \"I'm going to slide my hand under your shirt,\" and wait for them to tell you yes or give you a non-verbal sign, like kissing you more enthusiastically. [22] X Research source Pay attention to your partner's body language. Anytime you escalate your physical touch, read your partner's reaction. If they lean in closer, or touch you back in the same way, that's a good sign that they like what you are doing. If your partner moves backwards, stops what they're doing, or doesn't give you much of a response back, then pull back, as these are all physical ways of giving someone a \"no.\" [23] X Research source"

You could also try driving to a nearby park and finding a place that's a bit more hidden by trees. Don’t park under a streetlamp, or in your partner’s brightly-lit driveway where parents might see. Make sure you’re allowed to be parked in your spot. For example, a lot of parks close at sunset and you could get in trouble for trespassing if you park your car there. [26] X Research source"
