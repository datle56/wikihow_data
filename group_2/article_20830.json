      "content": "Decide to go cold turkey or taper. When you're deciding to give up any food you'll have to decide if you're going give it up all at once or slowly taper it out of your diet. Regardless of which option you choose, there will likely be some withdrawal symptoms. If you're used to eating a lot of sugar, going cold turkey might be harder. It may be best to gradually remove sugar from your diet over a few weeks. If you only consume small amounts of sugar you may be able to go cold turkey with minimal symptoms."

      "content": "Journal. Letting go of sugar may not always be an easy task. In addition, finding foods to replace sugar in diet may also be difficult or time consuming. Start journaling your foods, diet plan, and how you're feeling as you cut sugar out of your diet. Come up with a strategy and make notes in your journal. You might start by writing down a food diary to get an idea of how much sugar you consume in any given day or week. Then you can start making a plan of how to reduce sugar in your diet. Also include different healthy swaps you are thinking about using. You might need to try a few different things before you find something that works. You can also include notes on your mood or how you're feeling about your progress. Journaling is a great way to manage any stress related to this task.

      "content": "Plan for symptoms of withdrawal. Like many food addictions, when you give-up the offending food, you may have some side effects. These symptoms are normal and to be expected. [3] X Research source Remember that sugar is essentially a drug. With any drug, quitting can lead to withdrawal and cravings. These will pass but the initial withdrawal phase may be a bit tricky. How long you experience withdrawal symptoms depends on how much sugar you've been eating and for how long you've been consuming sugar. [4] X Research source In general, for the first week or two after giving up sugar, you might feel nauseous, have a headache, and feel cranky. Journal about your symptoms and write down positive thoughts of giving up sugar to get you through the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms."

      "content": "Write a plan to get through cravings. You might dream of cupcakes, ice cream, and candy for the first few weeks, but rest assured that your cravings will eventually go away. In the meantime, curb them by trying the following: Dilute sweet beverages. Mix regular sodas with water or unsweetened seltzer. Dilute juices and other sweetened drinks with water as well. Reach for fruit. Good ideas to try include: pineapple, mango, and bananas as these are slightly more sweet than other fruits. If you're really craving something sweet and fruit or other tricks won't do it, go for a calorie-controlled option (something less than 150 calories)."

      "content": "Join a diet program or support group. Giving up sugar isn't easy, and it can help to have support from other people who are going through the same thing. Instead of trying to do it all alone, sign up for a group program or support group. Groups are either in person or online. You'll be able to share motivational stories and tips for making the process go more smoothly. Tell your friends and family what you're up to. The fact that you're giving up sugar may have an impact on other people you regularly eat with. Telling others you have set a goal to give up sugar gives you accountability and support. It also lessens the risk that friends and loved ones will offer you sugar-filled items."

      "content": "Prepare for slip-ups. Birthday parties, holidays, and other special occasions are celebrated with sugary treats, and it can feel next to impossible not to indulge. If you overindulge, that's OK. Get right back up and start back on your sugar-free diet as soon as you can. Try journaling about what you ate and why you ate it. Many times it might be stress or other emotional factors playing a part into why you slipped up. If you can, limit yourself to just one piece or one cookie so you don't end up throwing yourself off too much. Afterward, get right back on your sugar-free diet. You might experience increased cravings for a few days afterward, so you'll have to be extra careful to keep sugar away."

The nutrition fact panel tells you how many grams of sugar is in each serving. However, this doesn't tell you if it's natural or added sugar. You expect to find added sugars in sweet foods, but it's also commonly added to savory foods, like salad dressing, bread, and tomato sauce. Read the ingredient list to figure out if there's any added sugar in your foods. Added sugars include white sugar, brown sugar, beet sugar, cane sugar, molasses, agave syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, turbinado, honey, maple syrup, agave syrup, fruit juice concentrate and many more.

Naturally-occurring sugars in fruit and milk come with vitamins, minerals, and fiber making them much more nutritious. Naturally-occurring sugars include fructose (found in fruit) and lactose (found in milk). All fruit, fruit products (like unsweetened applesauce), and dairy products (like yogurt, milk or cottage cheese) contain naturally-occurring sugars. You can make a variety of healthier swaps by substituting foods that contain natural sugar for added sugar."

Most know that there is a large quantity of added sugars in these foods when they're made. Giving up on these can help cut out a large portion of added sugar in your diet. As mentioned before, you can choose to cut out these foods cold turkey or taper them slowly out of your diet. You may find it helpful to plan some naturally sweetened, healthy alternatives into your day."

All alcoholic beverages have some sugar. It's not just the sweetened mixed drinks like margaritas. If you're in the mood for a beer, choose light or low-carb for the least amount of calories and sugar. If you're in the mood for a glass of wine, make it a \"spritzer.\" This is a mix of wine and seltzer which cuts the sugar and calories in half.

      "content": "Order wisely in restaurants. It's easy to consume hidden sugar in restaurants, since the meals don't come with nutrition labels for you to examine. You can always ask the server to tell you what's in a dish, but it's often better to have a good strategy for ordering food with the least amount of sugar. Try doing the following to keep your restaurant meals sugar-free: Get your salads dressed with plain oil and vinegar, rather than choosing a pre-made salad dressing. Also, always ask for dressings to be served on the side. Ask for main dishes to be made without sauces and gravies that might have added sugar. Again, ask for these to be served on the side. When in doubt, order steamed vegetables or plain grilled meats instead of casseroles and other mixed dishes that contain a lot of ingredients. For dessert, opt for a plain bowl of fruit or skip it altogether."
