The type of wire used to hang pictures would be ideal, because it is strong to hold back curtains, yet thin enough to go through an acrylic bead. This is enough to make one beaded curtain tieback. If you'd like to make more, you'll have to repeat this method for each one that you make. Consider making 3 to 5 beaded strings, each one a little shorter than the other, and tying them all onto the same ring. This will created a tiered effect."

Pearl beads, silk flowers, and ribbon flowers are great choices! Make sure that the decorations match the color of your ring or the color/theme of your curtain. For a rustic theme, use flat-backed seashells, sand dollars, and starfish. Use different sizes for a more interesting design. Place the larger flowers/beads towards the middle, and the smaller ones towards the edges. Don't get carried away; less is more!"

Don't decorate more than 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters), or the pin won't be able to go through the curtain.

Make sure that the tip of the pin is in front of the ring."
