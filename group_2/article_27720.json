      "title": "Rinse and cut the peppers, tomatoes, and 1 onion in quarters.",
      "content": "Rinse and cut the peppers, tomatoes, and 1 onion in quarters. Wash 2 red peppers, 1 scotch bonnet pepper, and 3 plum tomatoes under water, and then peel 1 of the onions. Then, roughly chop the red peppers, onion, tomatoes, and scotch bonnet into quarters. [1] X Research source Using a white or red onion is up to your preference. White onions tend to taste milder, while red onions add a stronger flavor. Substitute fresh tomatoes with canned tomatoes if you prefer."

      "title": "Set the peppers, onion, and tomatoes in a blender or food processor.",
      "content": "Set the peppers, onion, and tomatoes in a blender or food processor. Simply puree the chopped ingredients until the mixture is smooth with no clumps in it. If the mixture is too thick to blend well, add ½ cup (118 ml) of water. [2] X Research source For a smokier taste, roast the red peppers before you blend them. Halve the red peppers and place them on a foil-lined baking sheet. Then, roast them in the oven at 400° F (200° C) for 20 to 25 minutes. If you prefer more heat, add another scotch bonnet pepper to the blender."

      "title": "Wash 2 cups (400 g) of rice",
      "content": "Wash 2 cups (400 g) of rice in a bowl of cool water 4 to 5 times. Rinsing your rice in water gets rid of excess starch which prevents your rice from getting mushy or sticky. Just pour 2 cups (400 g) of long-grain, parboiled rice into a bowl and cover it with water. Stir the rice with your hands and then pour out the cloudy water. Simply repeat the process 4 to 5 more times, or until the water pours out clear. One of the differences between Nigerian jollof rice and other varieties is that it is traditionally made with long-grain rice, like Golden Sella basmati rice or white rice, that is parboiled. This is rice that is partially pre-cooked; it’s sometimes referred to as easy cook rice. Feel free to use raw Golden Sella basmati or long-grain white rice instead of parboiled rice."

      "title": "Pour ½ cup (118 ml) of vegetable oil into a pot on the stove.",
      "content": "Pour ½ cup (118 ml) of vegetable oil into a pot on the stove. Nigerian jollof rice is so easy to make because it only requires 1 dish! Just get out a large pot or saucepan and add in your oil. Then, turn your stove burner to medium heat and place your pot of oil over it. [3] X Research source Use a pot that you don’t mind burning a bit on the bottom. Slightly burning the rice and ingredients is what gives Nigerian jollof rice its tasty, smoky flavor. As an alternative, use sunflower oil or palm oil in place of vegetable oil."

      "title": "Dice the onion",
      "content": "Dice the onion finely and fry it over medium heat until translucent. Peel your other onion and chop it into fine, uniform pieces. Then, add the onion to the hot vegetable oil, keeping it at medium heat. Regularly stir and saute the onion until it looks translucent, which typically takes around 4 minutes. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Scoop 2 tbsp (30 ml) of tomato paste and add it to the pot.",
      "content": "Scoop 2 tbsp (30 ml) of tomato paste and add it to the pot. Mix the tomato paste with the onions over medium heat. Frequently stir the ingredients until the mixture takes on a grainy, sandy appearance, which typically takes around 5 minutes. It’s okay if some of the tomato paste sticks to the bottom of your pot. This just adds to the authentic, smoky flavor of Nigerian jollof rice."

      "title": "Cook the puree and spices over medium heat for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Cook the puree and spices over medium heat for 15 minutes. Add the blended red pepper mixture into the pot, followed by 1 tsp (2.4 g) of curry powder, ½ tsp (0.5 g) of thyme, 1 tsp (2.4 g) of white pepper, 2 bay leaves, and 2 crushed cubes of chicken bouillon. Stir the ingredients together, cover the pot with a lid, and heat the mixture over medium heat for about 15 minutes or until it’s thickened. Use beef or vegetable bouillon cubes instead of chicken if you prefer."

      "title": "Bring the rice, stock, water, and salt to a boil over medium heat.",
      "content": "Bring the rice, stock, water, and salt to a boil over medium heat. Pour 2 cups (400 g) of washed rice, 1 cup (237 ml) of chicken stock, 2 cups (473 ml) of water, and salt to taste into the pot. Carefully stir the rice into the ingredients with a wooden spoon so the grains don’t break. Then, heat the mixture over medium heat until it begins to bubble. [5] X Research source Feel free to use beef or vegetable stock in place of chicken stock if you prefer."

    {
      "title": "Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the rice after 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the rice after 20 minutes. Bring the rice to a simmer by lowering the stove heat to medium-low. Cover the pot with a well-fitting lid and leave it for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, give the rice a stir with a wooden spoon to prevent it from sticking and burning. If you don’t have a well-fitting lid, cover the pot with tin foil. Trapping the steam and cooking the rice over low ensures it has a soft, tender texture. Some of the rice burning is okay, as you want to infuse Nigerian jollof with a smoky flavor."

      "title": "Cook the rice until it is soft and has absorbed all of the liquid.",
      "content": "Cook the rice until it is soft and has absorbed all of the liquid. Continue to cover and cook the rice for an additional 10 to 20 minutes. Just give it a stir with a wooden spoon every 5 to 10 minutes to check its tenderness. When the rice is soft and all of the liquid is gone, turn off the stove and take the pot off the heat. [6] X Research source For extra flavor, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter (or margarine) and slices of ½ an onion and 1 tomato into the pot when the rice starts to get tender. If you’re using raw rice that isn’t parboiled, it might take an extra 20 minutes until the rice is soft and done."

Nigerian jollof rice is great to eat on its own, or fry up some plantains , pair it with fried chicken or beef, or whip up a delicious coleslaw or salad. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Place leftover rice in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge. If you have excess jollof and you want to save it, simply place it into a glass or plastic storage container. Just set it in the fridge and eat it within 5 days of storing it. [8] X Research source Or, freeze your leftover jollof and heat it up on a day you don’t want to cook. Just place it in a freezer bag or airtight container and keep it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Then, reheat it in the microwave for about 4 minutes."
