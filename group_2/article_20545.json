      "content": "Shop for insurance and compare costs. You will not be able to finalize your insurance until you are given a TCP number. However, it is important to be prepared for the cost of insurance as it can have a substantial impact on your business plan. Find suitable insurers through the CPUC website. Insurance tends to cost significantly more if you seek a TCP permit without a vehicle, as opposed to including your vehicle information with your application. You are required to carry public liability and property damage insurance. For more information about the insurance requirements, go to the CPUC website. If you have employees, you must also have workers’ compensation insurance on file with the CPUC."

Your application will be reviewed within two weeks of being received. If your application is missing any required forms, you will receive a deficiency letter in the mail. Check your mail thoroughly to make sure you don’t miss this letter. Submitting an application and getting a file number does not give you authority to operate. Only active authority allows you to operate. Don’t submit an application until you are committed to meeting all requirements and able to begin operation within 3 months. If you apply for an \"A\" certificate, which allows you to operate round-trip sightseeing tours and charge individual fares while doing so, your application fee will increase to 1500 dollars."
