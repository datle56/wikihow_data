      "content": "Boil half a pot of water on your stovetop, then turn the heat to low. If you own a double boiler, you can use it to create the lemon oil. If you don’t, you can use a regular pot. Fill the pot halfway up with water on your stovetop and set the temperature to high. Wait for bubbles to break the surface of the water and then turn the temperature to the lowest setting on your stove. [3] X Research source If you’re using a regular pot, leave enough room in the pot to fit a bowl. Once you turn the temperature down, the water should stop boiling. It’s essential you turn the stove to the lowest temperature setting so that you don’t boil your lemon oil."
