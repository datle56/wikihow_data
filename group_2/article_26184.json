      "title": "Pop off the front wheel.",
      "content": "Pop off the front wheel. If your bike has a quick-release front wheel, remove it and place it next to the rear wheel for locking. If you can't remove your front wheel, or your U lock is not large enough to encompass both wheels, secure the rear wheel then continue reading for alternatives."

      "title": "Secure the wheels and frame to an immovable object.",
      "content": "Secure the wheels and frame to an immovable object. Using a \"D\" or \"U\" lock, secure the back end of your bike to another object. Place the \"U\" section of your lock around the rim of your rear wheel, your unattached front wheel, your rear frame, and the immovable object, then attach the straight bar to ends of the \"U\" to lock it. See Using Decent Locks for advice on U locks, and Selecting a Lock Location for how to select an object to secure your bike to. If your U lock is too small to fit around every object, use it on just the rear wheel and stationary object but place it \"inside\" the triangle made by the three rear sections of the bike's frame. This makes it impossible to pull the frame away from the wheel. [1] X Research source This is usually enough to deter a thief, since he would have to destroy the valuable rear wheel to take the bike. Do not attach your U-lock to the crossbar (or \"top tube\") of the bike. This is the horizontal or down-sloping bar between the seat and the handlebars. This makes it easy for thieves to use the bike frame as leverage to attempt to break the lock."

      "content": "Secure the front wheel (if not removed). The front wheel is less valuable than the rear, [2] X Research source but some level of security should still be used or even an opportunistic passerby could steal the wheel. You can loop a cable lock around the front wheel and the bike frame, and optionally around the rear wheel as well if the cable is long enough. Lock the cable together using its built in lock or a padlock. For greater security, use a second U-lock instead to secure the front wheel to its frame."

      "content": "Secure the saddle with a long cable. Use a D lock on rear wheel, through frame and an immovable object. Secure the front wheel using one end of the cable by pushing it through. Push a loop of the cable through the rails of your saddle; secure by passing the free end of the cable through the loop. Secure the free end in the D lock."

      "title": "Use two or more different locks.",
      "content": "Use two or more different locks. Using at least two good quality locks of different types (listed below) will deter thieves that only have the tools to deal with one type, or who don't want to deal with the extra hassle. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a small, hardened steel U-lock.",
      "content": "Select a small, hardened steel U-lock. Also called D-locks, these inflexible loops affix the frame and/or wheels to a solid object. The smaller the U-lock, the harder it will be for a thief to lever it open with a jack or other tool. For best security, pick a U-lock that is just barely large enough to fit over your rear wheel, frame, and the object you're locking the bike to. While the space inside the U lock should be as small as possible, the U lock material itself should be thick and strong."

      "title": "Consider heavy chains.",
      "content": "Consider heavy chains. Sufficiently thick chains (ideally 15mm links or more) are an excellent thief deterrent. On the other hand, they are much heavier than other options. [4] X Research source Chains are usually secured by a padlock, which can be the weakest link. Use as thick a padlock as possible to resist bolt cutter attacks. A short chain for locking one wheel of your bike to an object will be much lighter to carry around than a chain long enough for both wheels. In this case, you will need an additional lock (which is a good practice to adopt anyway)."

      "title": "Use cable locks only as a supplement.",
      "content": "Use cable locks only as a supplement. You can purchase a thick (20mm) cable lock that is somewhat harder to cut, but the best course of action is to use cable locks as additional thief deterrent, not stand alone security. [5] X Research source Cable locks can also be used to secure less valuable bike attachments to the frame, such as a basket."

The more pedestrians there are, and the easier they can see your bike, the harder it is for a thief to unobtrusively break your locks. If possible, place your bike in view of a nearby building's video surveillance camera. Even if this fails to deter a thief, you may be able to obtain footage of the theft to aid in recovery."

Use an object with these attributes when locking your bike: [6] X Research source Thick and sturdy . Don't select a wooden fence or thin steel object that can quickly be cut apart. Hard to disassemble . Check metal racks or railings for bolts; these can be removed by a dedicated thief. Firmly fastened to the ground . A strong thief or a team of thieves could simply pick up and remove a heavy object with the bike attached. Shake signposts to test whether they are anchored firmly to the pavement. Impossible to lift the bike over . A tall thief could simply lift your bike over the top of the object and take it home to remove the lock in private. Try to use something that is attached to the ground in two places, such as a sturdy bike rack, since a very dedicated thief could use a rope to hoist your bike even over a relatively tall object.

      "title": "Replace your quick release skewers with more secure options.",
      "content": "Replace your quick release skewers with more secure options. Many bikes have quick release wheels and saddles, which can be removed with a touch of the right tool. Many bike thieves are happy to walk away with just a seat and wheels, or with a bike missing a wheel if you didn't lock the frame. Locking skewers, available at bike stores or online, require a unique handle or key to remove (or at least additional effort by the thief). Simply remove the quick release skewers as normal and insert the more secure skewers in the same slot. Some cheaper skewers attach to the bike with a hex nut instead. These are still removed with a common tool (hex key or Allen key), but deter casual opportunists. Never leave the means to remove the skewer next to an unattended bike."

      "title": "Secure your saddle in other ways.",
      "content": "Secure your saddle in other ways. If you don't use locking skewers or desire additional security, you can use a length of chain to tie your seat to the frame: Wrap a long length of bicycle chain with electrical tape. This will prevent it from scratching your bike. Wrap the chain around the chain stays of the bike (the small bar of the frame parallel to the bike's chain). Then bring it up through the metal saddle rails that hold your saddle on the seat post. Secure the chain by clamping the chain together with pliers."

Use a marker to write your name or initials twice on each tire (on opposite points of the circumference), and/or onto the top of the frame. If writing your name on the frame, protect it with several layer of clear tape. This isn't too hard for a thief to remove, but every deterrent helps the thief move on to search for an easier target."
