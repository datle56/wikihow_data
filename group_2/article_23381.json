They can also perform an ultrasonography, a specialized ultrasound that can scan your penis to identify a fracture.

They may recommend the following conservative treatments: [10] X Research source Manage pain and swelling by applying an ice pack to your penis.

Let your doctor insert a Foley catheter to drain your urine while your penis heals. Wear compression bandages or a penile splint as instructed by your doctor to help your penis heal properly. Take estrogen to help prevent erections if your doctor prescribes them. Use an antibiotic if you have an infection. Take fibrinolytic agents to dissolve blood clots if they're prescribed."

      "content": "Follow your doctor’s recommendations as you recover from surgery. It takes around 6 weeks for your penis to fully heal from surgery to repair a fracture, so take all of the medications prescribed by your doctor as directed for the best results. Avoid sexual intercourse or getting an erection until your doctor says it’s safe to avoid reinjuring your penis or rupturing the sutures used to repair the fracture. Don’t apply ice or cold to your penis unless your doctor says it’s okay. Ask your doctor about any over-the-counter medications before you take them. Be sure to tell your doctor right away if your sutures rupture or you reinjure your penis."
