      "title": "Choose a silicone-based primer.",
      "content": "Choose a silicone-based primer. Silicone foundation primers are excellent for filling in wrinkles and creating a smoother surface as you apply the rest of your makeup. Using your hands or a small brush, apply a small amount of primer below each eye. Rub the primer into your skin, focusing on areas with visible wrinkles. [1] X Research source A pea-sized amount is usually enough primer for both eyes. Too much can make your foundation clump. Let your primer dry for a few minutes before applying the rest of your makeup."

      "title": "Use a cream concealer to mask your wrinkles.",
      "content": "Use a cream concealer to mask your wrinkles. A reflecting concealer pen or cream applied directly under the eyes can cover up eye bags and wrinkles nicely. Buy a concealer that matches your skin tone and apply a pea-sized amount directly below your eyelids. Blend the concealer in around the edges to give it a smooth, natural appearance. Avoid rubbing the cream under your eyes to prevent irritation. Instead, dab it gently under each eye using a makeup sponge."

      "title": "Apply your foundation lightly.",
      "content": "Apply your foundation lightly. While applying more foundation may seem like it would conceal your wrinkles, too much can make them more obvious. Apply a light-coverage foundation that matches your skin tone to the center of your forehead, under your eyes, on the tip of your nose, and on your chin. Spread it around your face, particularly underneath your eyes, with a damp sponge to soften its overall look. [2] X Research source Makeup brushes tend to make foundation look too thick or caked on."

    {
      "title": "Avoid powder-based makeup.",
      "content": "Avoid powder-based makeup. Powder foundations and blushes tend to set in the lines under your eyes and make them stand out. Avoid applying powders to the area under your eyes or any spot with lots of wrinkles. Use liquid or cream-based makeups instead, which are smoother and conceal wrinkles better. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Highlight your eyes with mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Highlight your eyes with mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow. Shift the attention from your baggy eyelids to your eyes themselves. Apply a dark black eyeliner and mascara to your top eyelids so they can draw attention from your under eye wrinkles. Top off the look with some smoky matte eyeshadow to accentuate your eyes and minimize your wrinkles. [4] X Research source Your technique for applying eye makeup (like how you apply your mascara and eyeliner) can depend on your personal preferences. The bolder your makeup is, however, the more it can distract from your wrinkles. Avoid liquid eyeliners or shimmery eyeshadows, both of which can highlight creases."

      "title": "Remove your makeup carefully to prevent worsening your wrinkles.",
      "content": "Remove your makeup carefully to prevent worsening your wrinkles. When you remove your eye makeup, gently rub your skin and lashes up and down with a makeup removal wipe. Avoid tugging on your eyelids or forcefully removing your makeup to keep your eye wrinkles minimal. [5] X Research source Instead of a wipe, you can use a makeup removing cream as an alternative. Apply a thick layer of the removal cream to your skin, let it sit for several minutes, and gently rub it off with a warm washcloth. [6] X Research source Check the ingredients in your makeup wipes before using them. Stay away from alcohol-based wipes, which can dry out and age the skin."

      "content": "Apply a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid once a day. Introducing moisture to the skin under your eyes can keep it from drying out and lighten hard lines. Before you put on makeup, dab moisturizer beneath both of your eyes and rub it into your eyes in a circular motion. Moisturizers containing hyaluronic acid are ideal, as they are most effective at pulling water into your skin and keeping it plump. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a retinol-based skin cream.",
      "content": "Use a retinol-based skin cream. Retinol-based creams increase collagen production in your skin, which can minimize wrinkles. After moisturizing your face, apply a retinol cream to your eyelids daily, using it as directed to maximize the results. [8] X Research source Try an over-the-counter retinol cream for persistent wrinkles. Wear 1 or 2 eye creams maximum. Too many eye creams can irritate your skin, which ultimately makes aging more visible."

      "title": "Wear sunscreen every day.",
      "content": "Wear sunscreen every day. Sunlight can age your skin and deepen your wrinkles over time, and retinol-based skin creams can make your skin sensitive to UV lights. Apply sunscreen to your skin before you put on makeup at least 15 minutes before you plan to go outside, and reapply it every 2 hours for as long as you'll be in direct sunlight. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Choose a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher."

      "title": "Exfoliate",
      "content": "Exfoliate your skin 1-2 times a week. A skin exfoliator can remove dead skin from your face while keeping it young and glowing. Apply the exfoliator to a washcloth or scrubber and rub it into your skin with circular motions. Rinse your face with warm water, then pat it dry with a towel. Choose an exfoliator based on your skin type. Those with dry skin may find mild exfoliators helpful, while those with oily skin may need a stronger exfoliator. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Exfoliating your skin too often can dry it out. Doing it 1-2 times a week is enough."

      "content": "Try light-emitting diode (LED) treatment. When your skin is exposed to certain LED lights, it can promote collagen production and alleviate wrinkles. A dermatologist may use an LED-emitting device to introduce these lights to your face and repair skin damage. Schedule a LED light therapy appointment with a local dermatologist to lift lines around your eyes. [11] X Research source LED light therapy generally costs between $150-300 per appointment. [12] X Research source The number of LED appointments you may need varies. Some may need a single appointment while others may need routine appointments. At least 3-4, however, is normal."

      "content": "Get 8 hours of sleep every night. Sleepless nights can make eye bags heavier and worsen wrinkles around your eyes. If you have trouble sleeping, drink less caffeine before bedtime, avoid stating at phone or laptop screens, or try other treatments for insomnia. Plan to avoid caffeinated beverages and electronic screens at least 30 minutes before bedtime."

      "content": "Drink 8 8-oz (0.23 L) glasses of water each day. When your skin is dry, it looks more aged and any wrinkles can look accentuated. Drink water through the day to keep your skin soft and plump. How much water you drink per day depends on a variety of factors. As a general rule, however, aim for 8 8-oz glasses (0.23 L) of water per day. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Include omega-3 and vitamin E in your diet.",
      "content": "Include omega-3 and vitamin E in your diet. Both of these can keep your skin supple and reduce bags under your eyes. Introduce foods rich in these vitamins to reduce wrinkles around your eyes or ask your doctor about taking an omega-3 or vitamin E supplement. Do not add new supplements to your diet without asking your doctorâ€”when in doubt, eating vitamin-rich foods is safer. [14] X Research source Foods high in vitamin E include almonds, swiss chard, mustard greens, spinach, eggs, kale, hazelnuts, avocado, broccoli, papaya, and olives. Foods high in omega-3 include flaxseeds, walnuts, salmon, beef, soybeans, tofu, shrimp, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and sardines. How much vitamin E and omega-3 you need a day varies, but the average adult should aim for 15mg of vitamin E and 1.1 g of omega-3."

      "content": "Quit smoking and drinking alcohol. Cigarettes lessen the oxygen levels reaching your skin cells, and alcohol can cause skin inflammation. Both can age your skin and deepen the lines in your face. Reducing your alcohol and cigarette intake can soften your skin and may reduce eye wrinkles."
