      "title": "“Jehovah Jireh” is the name of a place and means “The Lord will provide.”",
      "content": "“Jehovah Jireh” is the name of a place and means “The Lord will provide.” It’s a proper noun, and the name of a mountain in the Bible. Both “Jehovah” and “jireh” are Hebrew words. “Jehovah” is a name for God. “Jireh” is harder to translate, but means something close to fulfillment, abundance, or sustenance, derived from the Hebrew word meaning “see” or “to see to.” When placed together, the words mean “The Lord will provide,” or, “The Lord will see to it.” [1] X Research source “Jehovah Jireh” is commonly pronounced “jih-hoh-vuh jie-ruh.” The words may also be used as a name for God. Used this way, they mean “Lord the Provider.” These words appear in Genesis 22:13-15. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Jehovah Jireh is the name of the mount where Abraham bound Isaac.",
      "content": "Jehovah Jireh is the name of the mount where Abraham bound Isaac. In Genesis 22, God tells Abraham to take his son, Isaac, to the top of a mount, and to offer his son as a sacrifice. Abraham reluctantly obeys, and is stopped at the last moment by an angel. Because he was obedient, Abraham is rewarded, and he makes a new name for the Lord, “Jehovah Jireh,” or, “The Lord will provide,” and names the mount after this. [3] X Research source Isaac was Abraham’s only child, and a fulfillment of a promise from God to grant Abraham and his wife, Sarah, a child, after many years without one. This mountain was later called “The Mountain of the Lord.” God provided Abraham with a ram to sacrifice instead."

      "title": "Jehovah Jireh describes Abraham’s reward for his faith in God.",
      "content": "Jehovah Jireh describes Abraham’s reward for his faith in God. Because Abraham did as God said, Isaac’s life is spared. In addition, an angel promises Abraham, “...in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed My voice.” [4] X Research source In other words, Abraham is promised prosperity and many children, a family tree that will flourish and extend for years and years. God also promises Abraham His favor and blessings for generations to come. Some Jewish scholars say that Jehovah Jireh is also the place where King Solomon builds the temple in 2 Chronicles 3. God says something similar to Abraham’s mistress, Hagar, after she proves her loyalty by returning to Abraham. God says: “I will multiply thy seed exceedingly.” The well where this happened became known as “Beerlahairoi,” or, “The well of the one who sees.” [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Trust in God to provide for you.",
      "content": "Trust in God to provide for you. Some translators’ interpretation of the binding of Isaac show Abraham as certain God would provide a suitable sacrifice, and at the last moment, God did, revealing a ram to offer instead of Abraham’s son. [6] X Research source It’s a reminder that if you do God’s will , your needs will be taken care of, so trust in Him to protect and take care of you. Of course, God doesn’t want you to be helpless. It’s important to also try your best and work hard. Then you can trust God to provide what you can’t provide yourself."

      "content": "Remember that God has a plan. According to many scholars, Abraham agreed to sacrifice his son because he knew that God wouldn’t allow the boy to be dead—whether that meant he wouldn’t be killed, or he would come back to life. [7] X Research source Like Abraham, it’s important to remember that no matter your trials, God has his reasons, and he’ll show you the way through."

      "title": "Do good works for others.",
      "content": "Do good works for others. God provides in many mystical ways, sure, but sometimes he provides through His believers. That’s why it’s important to treat others fairly, and to perform charity whenever you can. You just might be the thing God is providing for someone else! Volunteer at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen to support your community. Spend time with family, friends, and neighbors to offer companionship and gospel to those around you. Pray frequently for yourself and for others to strengthen your own faith."

      "title": "The Bible contains many different names for God.",
      "content": "The Bible contains many different names for God. These names or “epithets,” are often used to describe certain qualities of God, or how he’s helped his people throughout their tribulations. Epithets are important parts of both Judaism and Christianity, as they serve as both praise to the Lord and a reminder of His work. Other epithets include: [8] X Research source “El Shaddai,” meaning “All-Sufficient One” or “Lord God Almighty,” appears many times in the Old Testament. “Adonai” means “Lord” or “Master,” is first used in Genesis 15:2. “Yahweh” is a major epithet, and means “Lord,” though it’s often translated as “I Am” or, “He That Is.” It’s the most-used epithet in the Bible, and according to Jewish tradition, is too holy to say aloud. “Elohim” means “Creator” or “Judge,” and is also used many times in the Bible."
