But if he asks you out via text or email, or an online dating network, then it may be okay to just respond virtually. This could make it less awkward for both of you, and can save you the pain of having to see his sad face in person; it can also leave him with more dignity then letting you see how crushed he is when you tell him you're not interested face-to-face. But if it's a close friend or someone you've dated for over two months or so, then you have to make the call and see what would be the most respectful thing to do.

[2] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021. If he asks you out, say something like, \"I'm sorry, but I just don't see anything romantic happening between us\" or \"I just don't feel any chemistry, but I really like you as a person.\" Keep it short and simple but let him know that you don't want to date so he doesn't get confused or keep hanging around longer than he needs to. He may keep asking you for reasons, and you don't have to give in and tell him all of the reasons why you don't want to date him. That will just make him feel worse, so spare him, even if that's what he thinks he wants."

Though it's not pleasant to lie a bit or to make up an excuse, no guy wants to hear you say, \"I'm just not into you.\" Think of a compelling reason that wouldn't hurt his feelings too much. [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021. Figure out what reason you're going to give in advance so he doesn't catch you in the middle of a lie. Don't say you like someone else if you really don't. He'll be able to figure it out pretty quickly. Also, don't say that you're not ready for a relationship if you do like someone else. If he sees you hanging out with or even dating another guy shortly after your talk, then he'll feel like a fool because you lied to him. It's okay to hurt someone's feelings as long as you're coming from a place of honesty, not cruelty. [5] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021."

There's no good in giving him false hope, and though this may make him feel better in the short term, he will only feel worse when it takes him much longer to realize that he has no chance with you than necessary.
