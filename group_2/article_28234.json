      "title": "Scrape the meat of the coconut from the shell.",
      "content": "Scrape the meat of the coconut from the shell. Use a coconut scraper, sharp paring knife, or a sturdy metal spoon. Removing the meat is tricky. A butter knife is much better than a sharp paring knife. You can slide it in between the meat and the shell and 'pop' pieces off, rather than slip, and cut your hand."

      "content": "Filter the coconut milk. Put a coffee filter or cheesecloth over a wide-mouth jar. Pour or spoon a small amount of the coconut mixture onto the cloth. Wrap the cloth around the coconut mixture and squeeze the milk into the jar. Squeeze hard, to make sure you get every last drop. Repeat this process until all of the coconut mixture has been used."

      "content": "Leave the jar unattended for at least 24 hours. As it sets, the coconut milk and oil will separate and a layer of curd will appear at the top of the jar. Refrigerate the jar so the curd hardens more quickly if you'd like. If you'd prefer not to refrigerate it, leave the jar in a cool room."

      "title": "Start with dried or dehydrated coconut.",
      "content": "Start with dried or dehydrated coconut. You can buy dried unsweetened coconut flakes from the grocery store. Be sure the only ingredient the bag contains is coconut. If you want to start with fresh coconut meat, cut the meat into pieces and use a dehydrator to dry it out over the course of 24 hours. You can use the oven at its lowest temperature to dry coconut meat. Cut it into small chunks, place it on a baking sheet, and cook it at a low temperature for 8 hours, or until its completely dry. If you're using store-bought coconut, go for the coconut flakes, rather than shredded coconut, which tends to clog the juicer."

      "title": "Put the coconut in your juicer.",
      "content": "Put the coconut in your juicer. Juice the dried coconut in small batches, since placing a lot of coconut in the juicer will cause it to clog. The juicer will remove the oil and cream from the fiber. Continue processing the coconut until all of the flakes have been run through the juicer."

      "content": "Blend the coconut and water. Put the grated coconut in a blender. Pour the hot water over the coconut and close the lid of the blender. Hold the lid of the blender in place and puree the coconut and water into a smooth mixture. Don't fill the blender more than halfway full with hot water. If your blender is on the smaller side, blend the coconut and water in two batches. Filling the blender too high may cause the lid to fly off. Hold the lid in place while you're blending the mixture; otherwise, it could come off while you're blending."

      "content": "Strain the coconut liquid. Place cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour the pureed coconut over the cloth or strainer so that the coconut milk drips into the bowl. Use a spatula to push the pulp and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. If it's easier for you, you could pick up the cheesecloth and squeeze it over the bowl with your hands. To extract even more liquid, pour more hot water over the pulp and squeeze it again."

      "title": "Boil the coconut liquid.",
      "content": "Boil the coconut liquid. Place it in a saucepan on a burner and turn the heat to medium-high. Bring it to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until the water has evaporated and the cream has separated from the oil and turned brown. The process of boiling the liquid until it reaches the right state could take over an hour. Be patient, and stir constantly. If you'd rather not boil the mixture, you can allow it to separate on its own. Place the liquid in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Leave it at room temperature for 24 hours, then place it in the refrigerator so the oil solidifies and floats to the top. Strain the oil from the liquid. [2] X Research source"
