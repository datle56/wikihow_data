Setting SMART goals gives you a path to continued growth and learning, which will drastically improve your life. [7] X Research source For example, suppose you want to lose 20 pounds. When you dig down, you discover that what you really want is to be more active and physically fit and feel more confident in your own body. Create goals that are aligned with that purpose.

Completing your routine makes you feel great about yourself and gives you the motivation to take on your day. Got bad habits you want to kick to the curb?
