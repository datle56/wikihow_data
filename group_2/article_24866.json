      "content": "Store silver in protective bags for extra defense against tarnishing. For silver that won't be on display when not in use, the best thing you can do is place it in a specialty container. The best kind of material for this purpose would be flannel or an anti-tarnish cloth, as these are specially treated to keep the chemicals that cause silver to tarnish from becoming activated. If you are placing multiple items made of silver in the same bag, make sure not to overstuff it. You don’t want your silver bumping into other pieces, as this could lead to serious damage."

      "content": "Do not wrap or store silver with materials that commonly lead to tarnishing. There are many common household items that can be harmful to you silver polishes because they either contain chemicals or create environments that lead to tarnishing. This includes newspaper or other common wrapping papers. The ink that coats them is acidic and can damage the silver. [1] X Research source Plastic bags can also lead to tarnishing; these also trap in moisture and prevent ventilation, which is not good. Cardboard boxes are not recommended for storage, even if just temporary, because they hold in moisture and don't allow for proper ventilation. Don't hold your silverware together with rubber bands. They contain sulfur, which leads to tarnishing."

      "title": "Keep your silver in a place with low humidity and away from high heat.",
      "content": "Keep your silver in a place with low humidity and away from high heat. Humidity and heat both increase the speed at which silver tarnishes. To keep your silverware and silver jewelry shiny and polished, put them into storage in parts of your house that meet these requirements. China cabinets are perfect for storing fine dinnerware for this reason as they regulate airflow to keep a consistent temperature and don’t trap in excess moisture."

      "content": "Take the silver out of storage every once in a while and use it! A great way to prevent tarnish from forming and to show off your silver (what’s the point of having it if it is never seen?) is using it! [2] X Research source This is because most people will wash their silver after using it, which you should do. When using silver dinnerware, make sure to rotate which plates and silverware you use so that all of your silver items are used equally. Otherwise the less-used ones will begin to tarnish."

      "title": "Clean the silver with warm, soapy water.",
      "content": "Clean the silver with warm, soapy water. Do this right after you are done using it, as the oils on your skin or residue from food can begin to chemically react with the silver and damage it. Wash your hands before handling the silver. You may also consider wearing cotton gloves. Do not put silver in the dishwasher. Though it won’t cause tarnishing, putting silver in a dishwasher can leave marks. Always hand wash with care."

      "content": "Soak the silver in a hot baking soda bath for an extra polish. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Line another tray with a layer of aluminum foil and fill it with a 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white vinegar, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of salt. Once the water boils, pour it into the tray. Place your silver into this mixture and leave it for approximately 30 seconds before taking it out. [3] X Research source"

Don’t let the silver air dry, as drops of water can cause spotting. [4] X Research source Don’t use paper towels either, as they can leave slight scratches.
