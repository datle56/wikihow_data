      "content": "Buy an organic, untreated sweet potato. Sweet potato vines are grown from slips, which are the stems that grow from a mature sweet potato. Most of the sweet potatoes you find in a store are treated with chemicals that prevent slips from growing, so look for organic, untreated sweet potatoes at your local farmer’s market.

      "content": "Put your sweet potato in a jar or glass of water. Your sweet potato needs lots of water in order to grow slips. Suspend your potato in a glass of water by poking 4 toothpicks around its middle. Then, balance the exposed toothpicks over the edge of your jar or glass so that the top half of the potato sticks out of the container. [2] X Research source If you can find a perfectly snug jar or glass, you don’t have to use toothpicks. Just wedge the potato inside, making sure that the bottom half stays submerged while the top half sticks out of the jar. [3] X Research source"

Make sure the temperature doesn’t drop below 50 °F (10 °C) to ensure that lots of healthy slips grow. [4] X Research source Replace the jar with fresh water every 2 to 3 days. [5] X Research source If you are growing slips during the colder months, or if the temperature drops, you can use a grow light or heat mat to keep your slips warm. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Harvest the slips once they’re about 6 inches (15 cm) tall. Gently twist at the base of each slip to remove it from the potato. Then, pull off most of the leaves on the stem, leaving only the 2 to 3 leaves at the very top. [8] X Research source Growing slips from a sweet potato can be tricky, so don’t be discouraged if you only have a few, straggly slips sprouting, or none at all. If your slips aren’t growing tall and lush, the best thing to do is grab another potato – or a couple – and start the process again. [9] X Research source If you have the opposite problem and have too many slips on your hands, they make great gifts for your friends and family!"

Poke a hole into the soil and gently place the slip inside, leaving just the leaves exposed. Then give the slips a nice, good soak. [12] X Research source You can also choose to grow your vine in the jar of water. All you have to do is change the water every couple of days to prevent it from becoming cloudy.

Sweet potatoes also love warm weather, so make sure the area you choose stays about 65-70 °F (18-21 °C).

However, you may find that your plant needs to be repotted earlier if it is rootbound. This is when the plant’s roots can no longer spread out in its pot and instead clump together, often taking the shape of the pot. [18] X Research source Regularly check your plant to see if it is getting crowded in its pot."
