      "content": "Shave your chest. If you have any chest hair already, shaving regularly might help it getting very slightly thicker, overtime, for some people, but not significantly so, neither is helps hair grow where it isn't. (This one of the reasons some girls prefer waxing instead of shaving.) Shaving cuts the hair close to its root, where it's thickest; when it grows out, the hair will be thicker for its whole length, though this is a temporary visual effect and is stimulated to grow continuously to reach its full length.

      "content": "Cut an onion in two and rub it on your chest. Rub the onion onto your chest using a circular motion. Once the surface of the onion is dry, cut about 5mm of the onion and continue; this can stimulate hair growth because onions contain sulfur, a mineral known to help with hair growth. [7] X Research source This method should probably not be used during the day, because of the smell. So let it do it's work during the night, and shower the next morning."

      "content": "Know the myths about hair growth. There are some well-intentioned myths out there about how to grow hair and what it takes to have a manly mane. Many of them have been debunked by science and are demonstrably false. Increasing blood flow doesn't increase hair growth. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Maybe you've been told to brush your chest with a toothbrush to increase the blood flow to the area, which is supposed to stimulate growth. It's not scientifically true. Brushing your chest will not get you chest hair. Unclogging pores won't help you grow hair. Some say that blocked pores can cause hair to be trapped beneath the surface of the skin, and that the secret to hair growth is simply unclogging those pores. It's simply not true. While scrubbing away dead skin and unclogging pores is definitely a good thing, it won't help stimulate chest hair growth."
