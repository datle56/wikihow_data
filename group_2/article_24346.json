      "title": "You’re in the process of a major transition.",
      "content": "You’re in the process of a major transition. This is perhaps the most common meaning of your dream. Doors are a symbol of change. If you are currently transitioning from one stage of life to another, a dream door may embody the sense of movement from one place to another. If you’ve just become a parent, you’re moving, you’re going back to school, or you’re changing careers, the door probably represents that change. [1] X Research source The saying “when one door closes, another one opens,” is very relevant here. Your door might be leading you to a new phase. This is likely the case if you’re dreaming of one door and walking through it causes your environment to change radically. If the door leads somewhere depressing, dull, and sad, it could suggest you are afraid of change and holding back. For example, if you’ve just had a child your dream door might symbolize your excitement about this new stage of your life as a parent. At the same time, if you’re apprehensive, maybe the door symbolizes your new fears about caring for a child."

      "title": "You want to make a change in your life.",
      "content": "You want to make a change in your life. Dreaming about a door may indicate that you feel stuck and want to change your life. If you’re on the precipice of a big decision or you feel trapped in a situation right now, the door may represent your need to make a decision. [2] X Research source Maybe you’re thinking about taking a vacation but you feel like your manager at work will be mad about you taking time off, or perhaps you’re in a relationship that feels kind of stuck and you’re debating ending things. This is especially likely to be the case if you’re dreaming that it’s difficult to open the door, the knob is missing, or you’re dreaming of multiple doors and you’re confused about which one is best."

    {
      "title": "You’ve got strong feelings about a life change.",
      "content": "You’ve got strong feelings about a life change. The door's placement, condition, color, and kind are all important to the interpretation. A door in good condition, for example, might mean that you think a transition is going well or that you’re excited about it. A dilapidated door might conversely mean you are uncertain or afraid of change. [3] X Research source What is the door's color? Some interpreters think a red door signifies that you are keeping anger or frustration bottled up. A black door may symbolize secrets, and opening it means that you are taking a risk. What kind of door is it? Trapdoors can represent hidden opportunities or, sometimes, suppressed feelings in the subconscious. A revolving door can mean going around in circles—that perhaps you feel your life is going nowhere. Are you outside or inside? Being inside might suggest you are in need of introspection and should take stock of your life, while being outside can represent freedom and opportunity."

      "title": "You’re getting closer to understanding what you want in life.",
      "content": "You’re getting closer to understanding what you want in life. If your dream takes you through the door, what stands on the other side could symbolize your hopes and dreams. Pay attention to where the door leads, as that could be what you truly desire subconsciously. [4] X Research source For example, if your door opens to a lush and vibrant landscape, the dream may indicate that you really do want to leave the big city for a more quiet life in the country. A door that takes you somewhere familiar and comforting is a sign that you are ready to take steps toward your goals. If you open the door to look inside but don’t walk through, you may not be ready to pursue your dreams because you feel unprepared."

    {
      "title": "You are facing a major obstacle.",
      "content": "You are facing a major obstacle. Whether or not you stumble through the other side says a lot about the importance and weight of the challenge. If you feel “stuck” on one side or you’re apprehensive about crossing over, the door represents the difficulty of the obstacle you need to overcome. If you freely move back and forth, you likely feel capable to tackle the difficulties you’re facing. [5] X Research source This is especially likely to be the case if an adversary appears in your dream. For example, if you’re facing an uphill battle to get a promotion at work and your boss shows up in your dream near the door, it’s a sign the door represents a challenge."

      "title": "Write your dream down as soon as you wake up.",
      "content": "Write your dream down as soon as you wake up. We forget almost all of our dream content after a few minutes of waking up. [6] X Research source So, as soon as you wake up, jot down everything you can remember. Writing your dream down will both help you to recall its events and serves as a good reminder for the future. It should also gradually improve your recall of dreams in general. [7] X Research source Try keeping a dream journal . Pick up a notebook and use it exclusively for recording dreams, and keep it near your bed, like on a bedside table, for easy access. Focus on images rather than on telling a story when recording the dream. The sequence might not be important."

      "title": "Assess your association with doors in the dream.",
      "content": "Assess your association with doors in the dream. Start by re-reading your dream log and analyzing your personal link to doors in your dream. What does your mind associate with them? For example, do they remind you of your time working in a restaurant that had swinging doors leading into the dining room? Are you walking through doors repeatedly? What feelings do your associations raise? [8] X Research source Pay attention to the setting of the dream. Where did it take place? It is somewhere you've been before or a totally new, imagined location? Was anyone or anything else near the door in your dream? For instance, it might be important if your late grandmother stood and opened the door for you."

      "title": "Consider your relationships with the people in the dream.",
      "content": "Consider your relationships with the people in the dream. The people who appear may shed light on your dream's overall meaning. Oftentimes, people represent themselves. Sometimes, they also reflect facets of our mind. For instance, a little child who tugs at your coat could represent an inner sense of guilt. [9] X Research source Who appeared in your dream? Besides their relationship to the door, think of who they are and what relationship you have with them."

    {
      "title": "Determine how the dream made you feel.",
      "content": "Determine how the dream made you feel. The emotional content of a dream is the main ingredient when it comes to interpretation. If the door made you feel nervous, there is a good chance that the door has something to do with your inner anxiety. If you felt exhilarated, perhaps the door represents something hopeful that you are looking forward to. [10] X Research source When you record dreams in your log, make notes about how the dream made you feel. All you need are impressions (happy, depressed, fearful, angry, anxious, powerful, etc); there are no wrong answers!"

      "content": "Read up on dreams and dream science. If you're interested in learning more about the possible meaning of dreams and dream symbols, consider learning more about the field. Although we still know very little—including why we dream—new and interesting discoveries are being made. [11] X Research source Currently, scientists have a range of theories. Some argue that dreams don't really mean anything but are the result of random electrical signals in the brain, while others think that dreaming evolved as a defense tool. Some people think dreams help us to process the emotions and events of the day."

      "title": "Be aware of the limits of dream interpretation.",
      "content": "Be aware of the limits of dream interpretation. Looking into dreams may give you insight into your own psychology, but we still know very little about dreams and their function. Dream symbols may not always be universal—that is, they might not apply to everyone—and you probably shouldn't rely on them to make major life decisions. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Remember that you’re the final word on what the dream means.",
      "content": "Remember that you’re the final word on what the dream means. Websites will often plug very specific meanings into symbols. Dream interpretation is actually a lot more messy than this. Given how little we know about the brain and dreams, you are better off relying on your own judgment or on the advice of a psychoanalyst. [13] X Research source Dream interpretation is highly personal and varies widely. There may be some symbols that carry a shared cultural or even universal meaning, but that doesn't mean that the interpretation is the same for everyone."
