This will protect the wound from exposure to bacteria and germs from your hands. [2] X Research source If you are touching someone else’s open wound, wear medical gloves to protect your hands and prevent the spread of germs. If you don’t have access to soap and water, do your best to wipe off any obvious dirt and use a little hand sanitizer if you have it."

      "content": "Rinse the wound under warm, running water. Let the water wash off any dirt or debris on the wound. Do not scrub or pick at the wound while you rinse it, as this can cause more damage. [3] X Research source Rinse from the center of the wound out, then pat the area dry with a clean cloth or gauze pad. If possible, use sterile saline solution to rinse the wound rather than plain water. You can also use a commercial wound cleaner, such as Constant-Clens, if you have it. [4] X Research source If you have soap, use it to wash the area around the wound. However, try not to get soap directly in the wound, since it can be irritating. Don’t rinse the wound with irritating antiseptics, such as alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. These chemicals can inflame the damaged tissue and slow down healing."

      "content": "Use a clean, dry cloth and direct pressure to stop the bleeding. Press on the wound with a clean, dry cloth, applying even pressure with your hands for several minutes until the bleeding slows. Minor wounds should stop bleeding within a few minutes once you apply pressure to them. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If the wound does not stop bleeding after you have applied pressure for 10-15 minutes, go to the doctor.

      "title": "Elevate the wound above your heart to slow the bleeding.",
      "content": "Elevate the wound above your heart to slow the bleeding. If the wound is on your leg, foot, or toes, set your leg on a chair or cushion so it sits above your heart. If the wound is on your arm, hands, or fingers, raise it above your head to help slow the bleeding. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If the wound is on your torso, head, or genital area, seek medical attention as soon as you can. All head injuries, in particular, need to be evaluated by a doctor. If the open wound does not stop bleeding after 10-15 minutes, despite elevating it and applying pressure, go see your doctor."

      "title": "Apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to the wound.",
      "content": "Apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to the wound. Use clean gauze to apply 1-2 layers of ointment or jelly. This will keep the area moist and prevent infection, which will speed up healing. [7] X Research source Be careful not to press too hard on the open wound when applying the ointment, especially on any areas that are red or swollen. A special silicon wound dressing is also a good option for keeping your wound moist and protected, which can promote faster healing. You can get these dressings over-the-counter in most drugstores."

      "content": "Take over-the-counter pain medication. The open wound may feel sore or irritated as it heals. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) to help with the pain every 4-6 hours or as specified on the label. Follow the dosage recommended on the label and never exceed the recommended amount. [10] X Research source Do not take aspirin, as it can cause the wound to bleed."

      "content": "Change the dressing 2 times a day. Wash your hands before you change the dressing. Remove the bandage in the direction of your hair growth so you do not damage the skin. If you notice the scab is stuck to the bandage, soak the bandage with a mixture of 1 tsp (6 g) of salt in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water, or use sterile water if you have it on hand. After the bandage has soaked for a few minutes, gently remove it. If the scab is still stuck to the bandage, soak it again until it comes loose. Do not tug or pull on it, as this can damage the wound and make it bleed again. Once you remove the bandage, rinse the wound with warm water or sterile saline solution and pat it dry with a clean cloth or gauze pad. Then, apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly directly to the wound or to the bandage to promote healing. Always change the bandage if it gets wet or dirty."
