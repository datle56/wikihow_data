This may sound silly, but if you aren't in the practice of making eye contact with people, then you might not be in the practice of producing a gentle gaze or smile. You may not actually be \"staring\" at someone, but the look on your face may suggest otherwise. This can make people feel very uneasy. Being stared at makes people feel uncomfortable and will make them want to avoid eye contact. Be sure to avoid making facial expressions that would suggest you are examining or critiquing a person. Practicing your smile in the mirror will also help you get over any feeling of intimidation of shyness that you may experience when making direct eye contact."
