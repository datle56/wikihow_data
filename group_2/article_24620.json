[11] X Research source In addition to the app, you can train for the running portion of your fitness assessment by regularly running 2 kilometres (1.2 mi), and strengthening your legs muscles through squats, and doing burpees. To avoid hitting a plateau in your progress, it’s important to change up your running routes and adjust your training intensity regularly. Challenge yourself by varying the pace, distance, or terrain to keep your body adapting and improving. You can train for the throwing portion of the assessment by doing a variety of chest, shoulder, and core exercises, such as push-ups and planks. Remember to keep your workouts diverse by altering the number of repetitions and sets, as well as the type of exercises you do. This will help maintain intensity and prevent boredom, ensuring that your body continues to build strength and endurance. To train for the lifting portion of the assessment, recommended exercises include lunges, glute bridges, and rope pulls."
