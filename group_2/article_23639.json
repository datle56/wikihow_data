Make an effort to bring it back on a regular basis, and research shows your relationship will improve—especially if you have younger children. [2] X Research source How often should you plan quality time ? A viral Reddit post might have the answer.

      "content": "Talk to each other openly and honestly. Even though some things might not be all that fun to talk about, you'll improve your relationship every time you're honest with your spouse instead of hiding something or sweeping a concern under the rug. Honesty is a great way to show your spouse how much you love and respect them. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source This falls in line with the \"5 C's\" theory of a healthy relationship. These 5 things, considered essential for a healthy relationship, include communication , commitment, compromise, compassion or caring, and compatibility. [5] X Research source Compatibility includes the idea of chemistry as well as the idea of having common goals and interests. \"If you want to show somebody that you love them,\" advises Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Allen Wagner, \"sometimes it's understanding why certain things have certain meaning to them, and finding that beautiful, even if it's not something that historically or subjectively you've found meaning in.\""

Keegan emphasizes that \"the number one way to show someone that you like them, or that you're interested in them, is to pay attention to them.\" \"As long as that person is in your life,\" he continues, \"you can pay attention to them, really listen to them, when you're with them, nad not be distracted by your phone or extraneous things going on, and really be focused on them.\" Psychotherapist Kelli Miller advises using a technique \"called reflective listening where the partner says something and the other partner repeats back what that person said.\" This validates what your spouse is feeling and lowers the risk of misinterpretation. \"Spouses need to lean on [each other] during a time of crisis,\" Miller explains. She advises first asking your spouse \"what they need, because everybody's going to need something different.\" Then you can figure out the best ways to support them. Miller recommends \"reminding your partner that you are a unit, and that you're in this together. So that person is reminded that yes, they're going through this crisis, but they don't have to really deal with that alone.\""

The meeting \"will involve longer term goals, middle term goals, and shorter term goals of the week ahead,\" while also making sure that they're organizing their time effectively. Make sure household chores are divided equitably so that both of you feel like you're contributing fairly. [6] X Research source For Wagner, these weekly meetings can free you up to have actual conversations with each other: \"When you take all of that away, it makes people very naked. It forces people to have to start to talk about the things that they think about, and they dream about.\" And those conversations about your thoughts and dreams strengthen your emotional bond."

      "content": "Accept the changes as your relationship evolves. Long-term relationships do change over time, but research shows they tend to get better with time. While people often go through difficulties early on in marriage, those who stick it through report that things just keep getting better. The key is to accept things as they are, rather than looking back and imagining your relationship was better at some point in the past. [7] X Research source It's easy to idealize those heady early days when you were first falling in love with your spouse and felt like you were walking on air. Those feelings come on in a rush and are overwhelming and intense. The more stable and secure love that you settle into is no less powerful—it's just not quite as all-consuming as the infatuation you felt in those initial stages. Reader Poll: We asked 1923 wikiHow readers who are in a long-term relationship with their partner, and 56% said that over time, the feelings of love and affection do change—but at the end of the day, both partners still care deeply for each other. [Take Poll] So if you’re worried about maintaining romance in the long term, take comfort in the fact that by continuing to prioritize your partner, you can maintain a loving connection."

[8] X Research source It's fine if the two of you happen to have a lot in common and enjoy doing a lot of the same things—but it's still a good idea to branch out and do something on your own . Spending time apart also gives you a chance to miss each other a little. \"If you want to let someone know that you care,\" Wagner relates, \"it's sometimes about seeing something when you're outside of the relationship that reminds you of the other person and lets them know you were thinking about them.\" \"[If] a person knows that they're in somebody's thoughts for really no specific gain… it feels really safe and really good,\" Wagner explains."

For example, you might decide to go hiking together and try out at least one new trail every month. \"In essence,\" Vossenkemper continues, \"you have to kind of know yourself and know your partner… to make suggestions about what could work for the two of you.\" Vossenkemper emphasizes that you \"try to make time for having fun together by like, engaging and sharing experiences or by attempting to be playful, joking, laughing at things together.\""

Couples who don't go to bed together, in contrast, tend to be pretty miserable with their nighttime routines and dissatisfied with their relationships in general. This makes turning in together a real win-win. [9] X Research source Researchers were surprised to find that it actually didn't even really matter that much what couples did after they went to bed—the frequency with which they had sex or were physically intimate didn't affect their relationship satisfaction. That means you can compromise by bringing a book or some work to bed with you if you aren't quite ready to go to sleep yet so that you're still in bed with your spouse as they drift off."

[10] X Research source For best results, make sure it's something that neither of you know how to do so that you can learn it from scratch together. You might also try teaching each other something that one of you knows but the other doesn't. Playing around in the student and teacher roles can add new facets to your relationship."

Wagner says to save up for the things you each dream about. \"I see a lot of people who fantasize about things they want to do as a couple, and one of the partners will shut it down because of money.

But just because you've already locked your spouse down doesn't mean they won't appreciate some playful flirting. Flirting isn't something that's really been studied extensively, but there's no question that it makes people feel desired, attractive, and interesting. [13] X Research source Flirting in a marriage does look a little different than the way you might've flirted with someone on the other end of a crowded bar back in your single days. Basically, it's more focused on emotional connection than sex and physical attraction. Flirting your way through marriage can also reduce tension between you and your spouse and help you fight less."

For example, you might pick up some of their favorite energy drinks if you know they're going to be up late to finish an important project. Why all the secrecy? Research shows overt support can make people feel obligated to reciprocate.

Often all you need is to take a few deep, calming breaths and you'll start to feel yourself coming down. Just continue to breathe deeply and focus on your breath. \"I would do my 30 seconds of breathing,\" House advises. \"Because you can't physically be angry and calm at the same time, it's biologically impossible.\" House also recommends the 5321 technique: \"You see 5 things, touch 4 things, hear 3 things, smell 2 things, and taste 1 thing.\" This technique can help ground you in the present. Miller mentions journaling if it \"helps you to write down your feelings,\" so you might try that and see if you find it beneficial."

And so people will argue about the most asinine things, but they're not arguing about that thing. They are kind of arguing about the way that they're talking about that thing.\" When you make an \"I\" statement , you focus on how you feel rather than blaming your partner. Vossenkemper calls this \"a gentle startup. I feel angry. I feel upset. I feel sad. I feel ignored. I feel small….
