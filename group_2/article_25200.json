Bring the second loop over the first loop, and pull on the tail end of the yarn to tighten the base of the loop. Then, slide the loop onto your right-hand knitting needle and tug the tail to tighten the loop around the needle. This will count as your first cast on stitch."

Then, insert the tip of your right-hand needle into the loop. Bring the working yarn over the tip of your right-hand needle, and then pull this yarn through the loop to create a cast on stitch.
