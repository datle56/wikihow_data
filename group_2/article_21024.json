      "content": "Send a good morning text at any point in your relationship. Each relationship is different, so there isn’t a certain time frame you should start (or stop) sending good morning texts. A good morning text can be a great way to show someone you’re thinking of them, whether you’ve just started dating or you’ve been together for years. Just make sure the other person is comfortable with whatever you send. For example, if you’ve only been seeing someone for a week, you probably don’t want to send them a paragraph telling them how much they mean to you. Simply telling them good morning and wishing them a good day is probably better. It isn’t necessary to send someone a good morning text every day if you don’t want to. These texts are supposed to be a nice way of letting someone know you’re thinking of them—it shouldn’t feel like a chore!"

      "content": "Send your text based on your partner’s schedule. A good morning text is a great way to let someone know you’re awake and ready to chat, and while there’s no right or wrong time to send one, basing it around your partner’s schedule can make them feel appreciated. Perhaps they want your text to be the first thing they see in the morning, or maybe they like to have a quick conversation while they’re getting ready for work. Try to find the optimal time to send your text so your partner can enjoy it. For example, if you know what time they go to work, send your text beforehand so they receive an encouraging message and have time to respond. If you wake up really early, like at 4 a.m., it may be better to wait a few hours before sending your text. There’s a chance sending one that early could disrupt their sleep!"
