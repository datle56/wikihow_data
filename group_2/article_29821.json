      "content": "Clear your room of clutter. This is the first thing you’ll have to do in order to make room for your secret space. It will help you see more clearly the space available to you. [1] X Research source Once clear, you can weigh the pros and cons of each spot to find the suitable space for your secret place. You’ll better be able to evaluate the perfect spot when you can see the entire space. Try moving things around in your room if you think you can use an area for your space."

      "title": "Use an existing spot.",
      "content": "Use an existing spot. Use a window nook, part of your closet, or a spot behind your bed to make your spot. Using an existing spot will save you time and headache. Don’t overlook corners. It is easy to make a corner into a secret spot. It already has shape without you having to add boundaries. If it’s big enough, you can even use spots under furniture—like under a desk."

      "title": "Create a new spot.",
      "content": "Create a new spot. Just because you don’t have a built in nook near the window or a giant walk in closet with space for your secret spot doesn’t mean you can’t have one. If this is the case, get creative and form one. Think basic. If you create an elaborate secret spot, it will be too noticeable and soon everyone will be asking questions. Try to use materials already in your room to make your secret spot. Use a blanket to create a space. Laying a blanket over the back of a chair or off the side of your bed is an easy way to create space. Plus, using a blanket in your room is not suspicious to anyone that walks by. Use pillows to build your secret spot. Support the frame with heavier objects and build small walls by stacking some pillows. Move existing furniture to create the structure of your secret space. A bookshelf can easily create a wall for your new space and if anyone asks, you can simply tell them you wanted to redecorate."

      "title": "Use an undetectable secret spot.",
      "content": "Use an undetectable secret spot. If you aren’t trying to make a spot to hide away in—rather to hide your things in—make it a small spot. Reach under your bureau or way behind your clothes in your closet to hide your things. Use a spot that your parents aren’t able to reach. Create a false bottom to a drawer. Empty your dresser drawer, place your stash at the bottom, and use a piece of cardboard that looks like the bottom of your drawer on top of that. Then re-stack your clothes to hide your secret space."

      "title": "Find the right light.",
      "content": "Find the right light. Using the correct lighting can make or break the atmosphere that you want in your secret place. Try to choose a spot near a window. Natural light will fill your secret space no matter the size of the window or space. If there is no way to put your space near a window, use a small lamp or nightlight to brighten the dark space. Hang a flashlight if there isn’t natural light or an outlet in your secret space."

      "title": "Create an atmosphere.",
      "content": "Create an atmosphere. You should always enjoy your secret space and the way to do this is to create the perfect atmosphere. It should be filled with some of your favorite things and scream your personality. Decorations are a great way to express yourself in the space. Use posters, pictures, or anything else you wish to liven up your secret space. Wallpaper is a great way to add character to your space. [2] X Research source Lay a small rug down in your space to add some color and comfort. Add scent your space with aromatherapy. Make the space smell the way you want. You can do this with air fresheners, flowers, or essential oils. Choosing the right scents define the feeling of your secret space. Include seating in your secret space. Chairs can be comfortable, but they may be too big. Try using pillows or bean bags if you need something smaller."

      "content": "Match your needs. Maybe you’re looking for a spot to sit and think, place to store your favorite pictures, or space to lay down and read a book. With your needs in mind, add some final touches to your secret space. Fill your secret spot with things to keep you occupied while you’re there. Maybe you want magazines or crafts to fill your time. Think about what you want and be sure to stock up. [3] X Research source If you prefer to store items in your secret space, use hangers, hooks, or storage boxes. You could even stack CDs or books to create a small but neat storage area. If you’re trying to store a lot of things, baskets and closet organizers are a great way to store tons of small items. Keep drinks or food in your secret spot if you plan to be there for a few hours. Make it as comfortable as possible for yourself."

      "title": "Remember, it is only for you.",
      "content": "Remember, it is only for you. Don't show your space to anyone or it won't be secret anymore. If you have siblings, try to lock your door to keep them from your secret space. If that’s not an option, talk to your parents about helping you keep the secret space yours. If someone does happen to discover your space, talk to them and explain that it is your secret personal area—they are most likely to understand."

      "content": "Enjoy your space. Now that you’ve created a secret space, be sure to use it as you intended. You’ve worked hard and now you can sit back and appreciate it. Keep it clean. If your secret space gets cluttered, it won’t be comfortable. Be sure to keep it clear so that you can relax. Keep it stocked with refreshments, new magazines, or anything else you might need in your secret space."

      "title": "Avoid distractions.",
      "content": "Avoid distractions. While you may be in a very busy house, try to keep your secret space a spot where you can focus (even if you’re focusing on relaxing). If you chose a spot with a window, use a lightweight curtain to block out excessive heat or outside noises. Keep headphones in your secret space to block out the noisiness in the house. Consider leaving your phone out of your secret spot. If it’s there, keep it on silent."

      "content": "Keep a balance. Now that you have your secret spot, you can spend a lot of time in it, but don’t become a hermit. Spending all of your time alone is not good for you. Interacting with family and neighbors keeps you safe, healthy, and happy. If you start spending all of your time alone in your secret space, they may start to worry. Your secret space is yours and you don’t have to answer any questions about it. They will respect your privacy as long as you continue to be a part of their lives."
