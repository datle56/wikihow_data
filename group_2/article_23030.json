Choose photos that show off your hobbies or interests, if possible. Here are some tips for the photos you upload to Hinge: The first photo, which is displayed as your profile picture, must clearly show your face, which means no glasses or hats. Use recent, updated photos. Wear something more formal or dressed up for at least one photo. Show off your sporty side (if you have one) in another photo. Wear different clothes in each picture. Don't upload a bunch of pictures that include you and other people."
