If the advancement mechanism does not move out, push down the shutter release, which is the silver button to the top of the advancement mechanism if looking from above. The spindle will move clockwise, which will appear to be wrong because it takes the film and bends it around the spindle in what looks to be backwards. This however is correct, and the film is wound on the spindle in this manner to ensure it does not slide off. The film should wrap around the spindle and move a short distance, once the advancement mechanism stops release the shutter and you will get another crank out of it."
