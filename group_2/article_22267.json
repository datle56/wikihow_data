Fried foods, fatty foods, alcoholic beverages, tomatoes, and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea, and soda can increase the acid levels within the stomach. Try to take away these foods and liquids from your diet so that your esophagus can heal. [3] X Research source There are other dietary restrictions as well. Dairy products, such as whole milk, cheese, butter, and sour cream, are also to be avoided. Also avoid food containing peppermint or spearmint. There are also fruits you should avoid as well, such as oranges, lemons, lime, grapefruit, and pineapples. If you do find yourself consuming these foods, drink plenty of water and eat approved foods to dilute their acidic powers."

      "content": "Eat a small amount of food frequently. Create five to seven divided meals a day and avoid eating two to three hours before bedtime. The esophageal sphincter of the stomach relaxes when the stomach gets too full, bringing the hydrochloric acid up into the esophageal walls. In other words, if you eat too much, your esophagus will let you know. It's best to avoid it by eating smaller meals more often. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Most of us frequently have this issue out at restaurants. At home it isn't so bad, but at restaurants it's just so tempting to finish what's in front of you, which is often too much. To avoid the impending disaster, box up half of your meal at the very beginning. You can take it home to eat later later."

These include: [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Oatmeal . Oatmeal makes you feel full without causing reflux. It also absorbs the acid in fruits if you add a small amount. This will considerably aid in lowering the acidity in the stomach. Ginger . Ginger contains anti-inflammatory ingredients to help treat various gastrointestinal problems. Peel or slice ginger roots and add it to your favorite recipes. Green vegetables. Green leafy vegetable contain low calories and zero saturated fat. It’s the most recommended diet for patients suffering from acid reflux. Just be sure to stay away from using tomatoes, onions, cheese, and high-fat salad dressing. Try asparagus, cauliflower, parsley, and other green vegetables. White meat. Red meats such as steak and beef are hard to digest, so go for chicken and turkey meats instead. Chicken makes good soup, too. The chicken skin contains a high amount of fat, though, so remove it before cooking. Poultry meats can be boiled or grilled; avoid eating them fried. Seafood. Just like poultry, fish, shrimp, and other seafood also help avoid acid reflux. Just don’t fry them. Seafood is easily digested and is very low in fat and therefore helps prevent reflux and avoid heartburn."

Improvement of symptoms can be resolved when the upper body is elevated. It will prevent reflux of acid or any gastric contents while sleeping. [10] X Research source While you're at it, get enough sleep, too. Having enough rest and enough hours of sleep will allow your body to relax, repair, and build up damaged tissues and muscles in the body.

Although is may seem counter-intuitive considering that acidic foods are definitely not recommended for acid reflux, the acetic acid which is the main ingredient of apple cider vinegar is a weaker acid compared to the hydrochloric acid being produced in the stomach. Consuming this kind of acid tends to balance the acid production in your stomach and allows it to reach neutral acid levels. [11] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Apple cider vinegar is available in many grocery stores and supermarkets.

It also is suggested often for patients who suffer from severe acid reflux. It is the only method that can cure the cause of acid reflux instead of just treating the symptoms. Often, even if medications and lifestyle changes help, acid reflux returns once these methods are stopped. This causes many to consider surgery. The surgery for acid reflux is a minimally invasive surgical procedure called Nissen Fundoplication. This procedure involves wrapping a portion of the gastric fundus, or stomach, around the esophageal sphincter.

The discomfort can be assessed on a spectrum from just mild burning to a severe burning chest pain, mimicking a heart attack. The pain of acid reflux is brought on by the gastric fluid, which has a very low acidic pH. It migrates up the esophagus and finds its way into an environment where it doesn’t belong and is not intended to be, such as your esophagus.
