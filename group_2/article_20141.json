      "content": "Communicate with your girlfriend about what went wrong. If you want to repair your relationship with your girlfriend, you will need to find out why she feels the way she does. Ask her if she can sit down with you and have a heart-to-heart conversation about how she is feeling and what you can both do to make it better. If you and your girlfriend have been fighting, wait until you’ve both calmed down before having a discussion. Trying to talk while both of you are upset may lead to more fighting and resentment. [1] X Research source You might start by telling her how you feel, then inviting her to give you her perspective. Use “I” language to express your feelings. For example, “I feel unloved lately, and I’m afraid we might be drifting apart. How are you feeling about things between us?” Do your best to stay calm and civil, and listen actively to what she has to say."

      "title": "Avoid blaming your girlfriend for problems in the relationship.",
      "content": "Avoid blaming your girlfriend for problems in the relationship. When things are going wrong, it’s easy to start pointing fingers. Instead of blaming her for any problems between you, listen to what she has to say with an open mind. Once you let her have her say, you may realize that you’ve been misinterpreting her words and actions. [2] X Research source Even if your girlfriend is at least partly responsible for things going sour between you, blaming her will only put her on the defensive and create a deeper wedge between you. Putting all the blame on her also takes away your own agency in the relationship and makes it harder for you to focus on making things better. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Take responsibility and apologize for your own mistakes.",
      "content": "Take responsibility and apologize for your own mistakes. Calmly acknowledge your mistakes to your girlfriend and apologize without making excuses or trying to justify yourself. Remember that taking responsibility doesn’t mean blaming yourself for everything that goes wrong. It just means reflecting on your own actions and recognizing that you there are things you may have done that contributed to the rift between the 2 of you. [4] X Research source For example, you might say, “You’re right, I haven’t been as attentive to you lately as I should have been. I let myself get too caught up in my own projects and didn’t really think about your needs. I’m sorry, and I’ll make an effort to do better from now on.” Avoid apologizing in a way that puts the blame on your girlfriend or excuses your actions. For example, don’t say something like, “I’m sorry, but you shouldn’t have frustrated me like that.”"

      "title": "Validate her feelings",
      "content": "Validate her feelings . Listening to what your girlfriend has to say about what she’s feeling may be hard, but it’s actually a good thing if she’s willing to open up to you. Let her know that you recognize what she’s feeling and respect her right to feel that way. That will go a long way toward showing her that you really care about her and the relationship. Try showing that you understand what she feels by “reflecting” her feelings back in your own words. For example, if she complains that you spend too much time watching TV instead of having quality time with her, say something like, “It sounds like you feel lonely and frustrated when I watch TV in the evenings instead of sitting down to chat with you over dinner.” [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Work together to come up with solutions. Once you’ve pinpointed the main problems that are driving a wedge between you and your girlfriend, ask her if she’d be willing to sit down with you and talk about what you can both do to make things better. You can offer your own ideas, but be sure to ask for her input and listen carefully to what she has to say. For example, if she’s frustrated because she feels like she’s doing too much work in the relationship, talk about ways to split up your responsibilities more evenly. You could offer to take turns cooking or washing the dishes, for example."

      "title": "Make a commitment to change and stay consistent.",
      "content": "Make a commitment to change and stay consistent. Acknowledging the areas where you need to improve and promising to work on them will not be enough. You need to show your girlfriend through your actions that you are truly ready to make a change. Make specific promises and follow through on them. For example, maybe your girlfriend has trouble trusting you because you’ve been unreliable in the past. Make a point of establishing consistent behavior patterns going forward—e.g., if you say you are going to be home at a certain time, make sure you are there! If you do slip up, own up to it and apologize immediately."

      "content": "Respect her need for space. If things are really bad between you and your girlfriend, she may not even be willing to have a discussion right now. If she doesn’t want to talk, don’t try to force it—she will only end up feeling smothered and resentful. Instead, reach out and let her know you are willing to talk whenever she’s ready, then back off and leave her alone. [6] X Research source You might say something like, “I understand that you don’t feel like talking about things right now. I just wanted to let you know that I love you and really want us to make this work if we can. I’ll be here if you want to talk.”"

[7] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 27 November 2019. If your girlfriend does break up with you , respect her decision.

One way to rekindle your girlfriend’s interest in your relationship is to remind her of all the things you love about her. [9] X Research source Make sure not to just focus on superficial things, like her appearance. Your girlfriend probably appreciates hearing that you think she’s beautiful, but remember to comment on who she is as a person, too. You could compliment her on things like her personality, her accomplishments, or even memories of your time together and what they mean to you."
