Try to stretch your lower lip out as if you are putting on lipstick, which will flatten your chin and help you to produce a better tone. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sit up straight , and don't let your back slouch and touch the chair. Scoot forward slightly in your seat. This helps improve air flow and tone quality. This is very important because slouching will diminish the quality of your sound."

      "content": "Close your eyes, think happy thoughts, and blow into the instrument. Start softly, so you can barely hear it, then start increasing the volume by blowing more air in the clarinet. If you've done it right, it should make a nice sound instead of a squeak or a weak noise. If not, try adjusting how much mouthpiece is in your mouth."
