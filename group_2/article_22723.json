      "content": "Tap your heels in front of you, one after the other. The foot movement of the Griddy is almost like a jig. To start, bend your knees slightly. Step forward with your right heel, then step back as you step out with your left heel. [3] X Research source Try to keep your toes close to the ground and lead with your heels. [4] X Research source Try not to squat down to the ground—instead, bend your knees a little bit and fold your torso over so it looks like you’re about to do a squat. Practice this heel tap until you can do it comfortably and at a moderate pace. You can walk around as you tap your heels, or do it in one place."

      "content": "Swing your arms back and forth with the rhythm of your feet. As you move forward, slowly swing your arms in front and behind you. This rhythm can vary depending on how fast you dance, but try to swing your arms about every one or two taps with each heel. [5] X Research source Do what feels natural—you can swing your arms side-to-side, back and forth, or pump them up and down. Try not to keep your arms by your side, or it may make the dance look stiff."

      "content": "Add other arm movements like “B’s” for flavor. The most popular way to spice up the dance is to make “OK” signs (or “throw your B’s”). To do this, touch your index fingers and thumbs together on each hand. Place the holes you make over your eyes as you heel-tap. [6] X Research source Do the “ice in my veins” pose by sticking one arm by your side, exposing the inside of your elbow, while making an “OK” sign with the other hand on top of it. [7] X Research source You can also act as if you’re dribbling a basketball between your legs or wiping your shoes. [8] X Research source The “B’s” stand for “Big Billionaire.” [9] X Research source Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson may have been the first to “throw [his] B’s.” [10] X Research source"

      "content": "The song “Right Foot Creep” made the Griddy go viral on TikTok. In September 2020, rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again made a song called “Right Foot Creep.” TikTok users discovered that the song lined up perfectly with the Griddy, and by October it became a widespread trend to dance to the song. [15] X Research source One of the first TikTokers to do this was @brucethompson, who posted a video of him doing the Griddy in a parking lot on September 19, 2020. On February 19, 2022, Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty (@grittynhl on TikTok) posted a video of himself hitting the Griddy. In January 2022, the song “Playboy” by Jx.Zero slowly began to replace “Right Foot Creep” on TikTok. In February 2022, the TikTok account @retirementhouse posted a video with the “Playboy” song that said “‘Grandparents can’t Griddy,’” followed by an older couple doing the dance. In 2023, @jackson._.burrus posted a video where someone hits the Griddy on a frozen lake while the person filming says, “Buddy is witerally Gwiddying on the fwozen lake.” This started a new trend of similar videos.
