      "content": "Measure your head. Use a cloth measuring tape to find the circumference of your head. Position the end of the measuring tape just below the curve of your skull, roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) above the top of one ear. Wrap the tape around your head keeping it as parallel to the ground as possible while you work. [1] X Research source Note that this measurement needs to be somewhat precise so that the hat sits snugly on your head, but also keep in mind that a measurement that is too tight will prevent the hat from sitting on your head at all.

      "title": "Cut some string.",
      "content": "Cut some string. Once you know the circumference of your head, multiply it by 1.273. For example, if your head measurement was 21.5 inches multiply 21.5 by 1.273 to get 27.37. You can imagine the shape you are going to draw for the body of your fez as part of a giant perfect circle. If the circle was a pizza, the piece we are trying to make would be the crust of one slice. Since we only need part of it, we don't have to draw the whole circle, just figure out its radius. We do that by multiplying your head measurement by 1.273. In this case, the radius is 27.37. Next, cut a piece of string that is that length. In this example, you would cut a piece of string 27.37 inches long. [3] X Research source Make sure you use something that won’t stretch a lot. Birthday ribbon is a good alternative if you don’t have any string or twine."

      "title": "Tape your paper down.",
      "content": "Tape your paper down. Before you start drawing your pattern, be sure to tape your paper down to the table or cutting board so that it doesn’t move around while you are working. One piece of scotch tape at each corner should be enough. [4] X Research source Your best bet is to tape the paper down to a cutting board. This way it will stay secure after you draw your shape and be ready for you to cut it out right away."

      "title": "Draw a curved strip.",
      "content": "Draw a curved strip. The curved strip will form the side of your fez. The longest part of the curve will need to equal the circumference of your head plus an additional 1/2 inch seam allowance. Take the length of string you cut and hold one end of it on the table perpendicular to the paper. Tie a loop in the other end and slide a pen or pencil inside. Place the pen at one edge of the paper. The string should be stretched from the point on the table and run at an angle to the pen. Now, keeping the string taut, slide the pen like a pendulum across the paper, letting the string guide you. This will work like a homemade compass and allow you to make a perfect curve that will match the size of your head. Do the same thing for the top of the shape, making the second curved line 5 inches above the first. [5] X Research source Make sure to keep the string tight while you draw your line or you’ll end up with an uneven shape. Keep your pen straight up and down while you draw. Tilting it will give you a distorted line."

The best way to do this is with a compass that you can buy at a place like Walgreens or Office Depot. Cut the circle out. This pattern piece will be used for the top of the fez."

      "title": "Pin the pattern to some felt.",
      "content": "Pin the pattern to some felt. Place the side pattern piece on a large piece of felt. Keep the felt and the paper as flat as possible, then slide straight sewing pins into the paper and material to hold the pattern in place. Repeat with the top pattern piece and another patch of fabric. Use as many pins as necessary to secure the pattern to the felt, but also keep in mind that pins cause the pattern to wrinkle and bunch up, so using too many could slightly distort the shape of the felt once you cut it out."

    {
      "title": "Cut out the pattern shape.",
      "content": "Cut out the pattern shape. Use sharp sewing scissors to cut out the felt pinned to the pattern pieces. Keep the scissors steady and rotate the felt as you cut. This will help you make a cleaner cut. Keep the sides of the scissors blunt to the edges of the paper pattern. Doing so can prevent the scissors from cutting at an angle and making the resulting felt piece too narrow or too wide. Note that this first batch of felt will form the outside of your hat."

      "title": "Repeat with interfacing.",
      "content": "Repeat with interfacing. Interfacing is a textile used on the underside of garments to help them maintain a rigid structure. Remove the pattern pieces from the second batch of felt and place them on a piece of heavy interfacing. Interfacing can be purchased at fabric or hobby stores. Pin in place, then cut the interfacing out according to the dimensions of the pattern pieces. Interfacing is necessary since it gives the hat body and structure. Without it, the entire hat would likely collapse into itself after you sew it all together. Use a heavy interfacing for best results."

Using your dominant hand, wrap a bundle of embroidery thread around your non-dominant fingers 20 to 30 times. The final tassel will be about four times as thick as the width you produce here, so keep that in mind as you wrap the thread around. [8] X Research source If you find it difficult to use your fingers or if you want a larger tassel, wrap the embroidery thread around a heavy piece of cardboard or cardstock, cut to your preferred dimensions. Note that the tassel will be about half as long as the width of your cardstock."

[11] X Research source This piece of embroidery thread will need to be about three to four times as long as your tassel. You will need to wrap the thread around a dozen times or more. Tie a small knot at the base of the wrapped portion when done. Let the ends of the thread hang down into the tassel, trimming them to size. [12] X Research source"

You’ll be constructing much of the hat inside out in order to hide the seems. Place the interfacing on top of the felt and pin in place with a few straight pins. Then iron the interfacing onto the felt according to the manufacturer's instructions. Repeat this process with the top of the fez, as well. [14] X Research source Make sure that the glossy side of the interfacing faces the fabric. The glossy side is usually the adhesive side. Use a low heat and a thin press cloth when ironing the pieces together. Do not use direct heat and do not use a high heat setting since doing either action may cause the felt to burn. Iron around the straight pins initially. Once the fabric and interfacing feel securely joined, remove the pins and iron over the spot to adhere the interfacing there. Let cool when done."

Spread out the outside piece of felt with the interfacing side flat against your working surface and the outer side facing you. Lay the inner felt on top, matching the edges precisely. Pin in place using straight sewing pins, then sew around both curved edges of the fabric with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. A seam allowance is the area between the edge and the stitching line on two pieces of material being sewed together. [15] X Research source Do not sew the two straight ends of the fabric together. When done, pull the two pieces of felt and the interfacing through one of the open ends. The interfacing should now be hidden on the inside of the joined fabric, and the side of the fez is now right-side-out."

      "title": "Pin and sew the two top pieces of felt together.",
      "content": "Pin and sew the two top pieces of felt together. [16] X Research source Just like with the side pieces, you should have two top pieces at this point, your outside piece, which has the interfacing on it, and your inside piece. Place the top piece of felt on your working surface with the interfacing lined side down. Set the inner felt material down on top, matching up the edge as closely as possible. Pin in place, then sew the pieces together, using a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Leave a small 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap in the side of the circle as you sew the pieces together. Remember, you are initially stitching these pieces together inside out to hide the seems. Leaving this small gap in the circle will allow you to pull the top piece of the felt right-side out once you’ve finished sewing it together. Do not sew the circle all the way around. When done, turn the circle right-side-out by pulling the material through the open gap. The interfacing should now be on the inside of the piece. Close up the hole you left to pull the piece right side out. Carefully fold the remaining open edge inside the circle. Stitch closed."

Pin in place, then sew the top round of felt onto the side with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. When pinning the top felt onto the side, make sure that the inside of the top piece faces you. This part can be tricky to sew. Keep the round top piece facing down, lying along the sewing machine, with the side of the fez extending up and into the air."
