      "content": "Curl your eyelashes. Curling your eyelashes will make your eyes look bigger and your lashes look longer and thicker without leaving any signs that you’ve done anything to your eyes. [1] X Research source The easiest way to curl your lashes is to purchase or borrow an eyelash curler : Pick up the curler as you would a pair of scissors. Open up the curler and bring it to the base of your eyelashes with the curve of the curler facing up and away from your face. Once the curler is around the base of your eye lash, close it lightly and pulse the grip in and out. Gently twist the curler upward to create the curl in your eyelashes. Hold it there for several seconds, then slowly pull the curler up the length of your lash, gently squeezing in a pulsing action. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can curl your lashes with a spoon . Face the hollow of the spoon outward with the edge of the spoon against the root of your lashes. Press the lashes against the edge for a second with one finger and slide the spoon from the roots to the tips. [3] X Research source You might also consider getting a lash lift (like a perm but for your eyelashes) at a salon. It takes about 45 minutes and lasts until your new lashes grow in.

      "content": "Shape your eyebrows if they’re extra thick or unruly. Although many men are shy about doing anything to their eyebrows, it’s important to be proactive about them, especially if they’re large and wild. If you don’t want to touch them yourself, try to find a groomer who has experience working with men. Generally, you should groom your lashes with tweezers instead of waxing. Wax will make the lines look too abrupt, sharp, and artificial. For a basic brow trim, brush your eyebrow hair straight up with a tiny mustache comb , then use small grooming scissors to snip any lights that stick up above your brow line. This way, you can tame your brows without looking overly manicured (or accidentally changing their shape too much). [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use eye creams to moisturize and brighten the skin around your eyes. Eye creams are applied to the skin around the eye. They have many of the same anti-aging qualities that other moisturizers have, but also contain ingredients that rectify conditions specific to the skin around your eyes. They will, for example, help prevent puffiness, while keeping the skin smooth and bright. Like other moisturizers, they will also help suppress the appearance of wrinkles. [14] X Research source Look for eye cream ingredients that help specific problems you have with the skin near your eyes: Antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and ferulic acid can help with puffiness and can brighten your skin. Retinol helps reduce wrinkles and signs of aging. Peptides produce collagen and can firm up sagging or loose skin under your eyes. Hyaluronic acid and ceramides are ulta-moisturizers that may also reduce wrinkles. Niacinamide and kojic acid can brighten skin and help with under-eye discoloration, like dark circles."

Add a small smirk with one side of your mouth, or a subtle smile with both sides.

Look at them for 3 or 4 seconds before breaking eye contact. [18] X Research source Avoid glancing furtively from one eye to the other.

Glance away when you make a joke or say something that could be perceived as bragging. Holding contact too closely during this point in the conversation could make it seem as if you are desperate for a reaction and thus not confident. To keep things interesting while maintaining eye contact, move your head slightly from time to time. Move your chin up and down.
