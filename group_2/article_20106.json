      "content": "Choose a trigger word or phrase to use. When teaching a dog a command you need to come up with a verbal trigger. This should be a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you would like it to do. For going to the bathroom, you can use a phrase like \"go pee,\" \"go potty,\" \"do your business,\" or anything else that you can count on using reliably. You could also just make up a specific sound that the dog will associate with going to the bathroom.

      "content": "Establish a designated potty spot. When training your dog to urinate on command, it's a good idea to pick a spot in the yard where you will always have the dog go to the bathroom. When you take your dog there it will be yet another signal to the dog that it is time to go pee. You can pick any space you like, but in general dogs like to go to the bathroom on grass. Just pick a corner of your yard or a section of grass in front of your home that suits your needs."

A dog may need to go at a variety of different times, such as: [2] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States.

      "content": "Take your dog outside on a set schedule. Part of training your dog to go to the bathroom on command is communicating with it that it is time to go to the bathroom. When you take your dog out at the same time every day, it begins to learn when it needs to go to the bathroom.

      "content": "Wait for your dog to pee. This can be the hard part of training your dog to pee on command, because you have to spend a lot of time waiting around for your dog to go to the bathroom. However, waiting for your dog to go to the bathroom is important. It is the only time that you can communicate that your trigger word is associated with going to the bathroom. Pay no attention to the dog while waiting. If you give your dog attention, it is less likely to go to the bathroom quickly."

      "content": "Say the trigger word. As your dog is in the middle of going to the bathroom, say your chosen trigger word. Say it in a positive, excited tone, so that your dog knows it's a good thing.

      "content": "Provide a marker when the dog is done urinating. Once the dog has finished its business you should say a word or phrase that marks the end of the action. This can be as simple as \"good boy\" or \"good dog.\" By marking the end of the action you are signaling to the dog that it has completed what you wanted it to do. If you have used clicker training to train your dog in the past, you can provide a marker click to show that the dog has done what you wanted it to do. This will increase the speed at which your dog understands your directions."

      "content": "Give your dog lots of praise once it goes to the bathroom. Pat or scratch your dog in its favorite spot and maybe give it a treat. This will show the dog that you are happy with its behavior. [5] X Research source Giving praise and a treat will create motivation to repeat the actions that lead to these positive rewards. Be sure that you don't go right back into the house after your dog has peed when first training your dog. Part of the dog's reward will be the time it gets to spend with you playing and exploring outside."

      "content": "Adjust the timing of your trigger word. After a couple of weeks of saying your trigger word as the dog urinates, change the timing of it to just before your dog starts going. It is key that your dog has internalized the connection between the word and it going to the bathroom, so be sure to wait a few weeks. [6] X Research source However, wait until your dog has finished going to the bathroom to provide the marker, like before. This simply signals that the action is finished."

Requiring that it pees right away in order to get a treat or praise is key to making sure the dog can eventually pee on command. [7] X Research source If your dog doesn't pee right away, revert back in the training and make sure the dog has the fundamentals before continuing on."

      "title": "Avoid giving punishment.",
      "content": "Avoid giving punishment. Do not use punishment at a training tool or as a response to poor performance. Punishment creates fear, not trust. It will make the dog suspicious of you instead of creating a relationship built on trust and understanding. There is a difference between withholding a treat or praise and punishing your dog. Punishment, in the form of yelling, harsh words, or physical assault, will only make your dog hesitant to go to the bathroom at all. Withholding treats will make the dog want to do better."
