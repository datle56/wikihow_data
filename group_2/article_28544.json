      "content": "Get comfortable. Before you can begin to fall asleep, you need to be comfortable so your mind will not be on your immediate environment. As you get ready for bed, wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothes. Tight-fitting or constricting articles of clothing may distract you or cause discomfort. Next, find a comfortable spot. If you are not quite ready to go to bed yet, find a comfortable position such as sitting cross-legged on a couch cushion. If you are lying in bed, lie in whatever position you feel most comfortable. You need to ensure that you find the position that feels most relaxing. It is the first step toward mind and body relaxation. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Ready your environment. Your body is most prepared to sleep when it is dark. This is because the natural sleep hormone, melatonin, is produced when you are in the dark. As you are getting ready for bed, turn off any bright lights. Try to avoid distractions like TVs, handheld devices, phones, or computer screens. This not only helps with melatonin production, it also helps relax your eyes and your brain. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Do relaxing activities before bed. One of the best ways to clear your mind and get ready to sleep is by doing a relaxing activity before bed. These activities include reading, meditating, or doing word puzzles. These activities help harness your mind and relax your worries about the day. You can focus instead of the characters in your book or the answer to the next crossword clue. Try to avoid watching too much TV before bed. It can overstimulate you and play around with your melatonin levels. [4] X Research source Studies have shown that engaging in relaxing activities before bed, such as concentrated breathing, can help combat those anxious thoughts."

      "content": "Let your thoughts drift away. You can help put yourself to sleep with self-hypnosis. This is a method where you focus on yourself, your breathing, and your internal thought processes in order to lull yourself to sleep. To start, try to relax your body, but don't worry about trying to turn off your mind. Let your thoughts drift by like they're on a conveyor belt—acknowledge them, then let them pass. [5] X Expert Source Alexandra Janelli Certified Hypnotherapist & Anxiety and Stress Management Coach Expert Interview. 27 August 2020. Often the things that come to mind at night seem so much bigger and more worrisome. This phase of sleep is called the thinking phase. It is the point in your sleep cycle where you focus on rehashing everything that happened to you throughout the day or spend too much time thinking about things to come. If you have a hard time letting go of your thoughts, focus more on relaxing each part of your body. The relaxation will come eventually. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Release tension in your body. Start with your toes and move your way up to the top of your head. Move or flex each toe so you’re aware of the way they feel when active. Now relax your toes and release any tension you feel. Make your toes and feet go limp without any pressure or energy exerted. Continue this routine for the rest of your body, tensing then releasing the tension in every muscle throughout your body. Move all the way up your body, focusing on the feet, ankles, lower legs, knees, upper legs, hips, back, front, shoulders, fingers, hands, lower arms, elbows, upper arms, neck, back of the head, jaw, face, mouth, eyes, and ears.

      "title": "Breathe deeply.",
      "content": "Breathe deeply. Once your body is relaxed, you can start your breathing exercises. Make sure your eyes are closed. Draw in long, deep inhalations. Exhale slowly and feel the air as it leaves your lungs. Concentrate on your chest and the way the breaths feel leaving your body. Let your mind concentrate fully on your breath as the air comes slowly into and out of your body. Open your mouth and relax your jaw muscles. Don't force your breathing. Just allow your breathing to continue easily, effortlessly, and comfortably. Feel your body relax into the mattress as the air flows in and out with each breath. The effects of hypnosis should feel similar to deep meditation, which is a sense of removal from the physical body, a distortion of time, and an overwhelming sense of euphoria. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Visualize a relaxing place. Once you have relaxed your body and gotten your breathing under control, you need to start the fantasy phase of sleep. To do this, think about the most relaxing place or scenario you can think of. This can be a beach in the middle of summer, a golf course on a beautiful day, a cozy fire in the mountains, or a hammock on the back porch of your childhood home. Immerse yourself in your relaxing place, focusing all your attention it. Make yourself remember what it feels, smells, or sounds like. The more elaborate your picture, the more relaxed you will become. Make up scenarios of what you are doing there, filling in other people that might be there, what food you might eat, what sounds you might hear, or any other atmospheric concern with the location.

      "content": "Choose a mantra. If you find it hard to visualize a certain place, you can instead create an inner mantra to help you fall asleep. Try soothing phrases such as restful, peaceful, sleep or beautiful, restful, deep, sleep . Say the mantra on every exhale, focusing your attention on the meaning of the words. Relaxation and suggestion have been shown to control activity in highly localized regions of the brain, allowing you to effectively rewire your thought patterns. In this case, you reduce your stressful thoughts while you increase relaxing bedtime thoughts. [13] X Research source The human brain is incredibly susceptible to suggestion, and repeating an affirmative phrase can have a lasting impact on your subconscious."

      "content": "Make a hypnosis recording. If neither of these options work, try making a hypnosis tape for yourself. It can be difficult to remember all of these steps if you're just getting started, and pausing to look up what you missed could take you out of your relaxing moment. Record yourself speaking the guided meditation above. Try experimenting with different suggestions and images, making different recordings for different scenarios and mantras. Include your positive or affirmative phrases so you can hear them and remember to say them as you drift off. Listen to your tape while you try to sleep. Research suggests that listening to a recording that urges the listener to \"sleep deeper\" may improve restfulness and deep sleep."

You will get better at it over time. The more you think about your relaxing place, the more realistic it will become. After a while, you will likely find that you can fall asleep easier and sleep better every night. You can try the same techniques if you have problems with waking up in the middle of the night.

      "content": "Eat lighter and earlier. When your evening meal is filled with heavy foods, your digestive system will be working hard to process everything. Avoid eating large, protein-heavy foods late in the day. This will cause your body to need to digest things longer, since there is so much food. For best results, try not to eat anything within 1-2 hours of your bedtime.

This will be even more useful if you do a similar activity, such as reading or crossword puzzle, at the same time as well. It will act as a signal that you are getting ready to sleep.
