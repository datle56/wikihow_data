      "content": "This is a great way to keep him interested in your conversation. Think of a few fun questions that you might ask him to get to know him a little better, like what he does for fun or where his family is from. Then, try to ask one or two questions every time you two text. He’ll remember you as the nice person who wants to know more about him, and that will get him thinking about you a lot. Try to ask open-ended ones that he can’t just answer with yes or no. You could ask questions like: [3] X Expert Source Judith Gottesman, MSW Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 19 October 2021. What’s your favorite way to spend the weekend?

You don’t have to be overly flirtatious if you don’t want to, but a little teasing or some fun banter is a great way to keep him coming back for more.

      "content": "If he doesn’t respond, just leave it be for now. You don’t want to overwhelm him with texts—that could push him away. Instead, if he’s not texting you back right now, move on with your day, and see what he’s doing later on. Hopefully, he’ll revisit the convo later and realize that he forgot to reply. [9] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. If the guy you’re texting tends to leave you on read a lot, it might not be worth your effort.

It might seem like you’re playing games, but it’s important to match his energy. Otherwise, you might seem too eager, and it could push him away. [10] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. On the flip side, if he’s replying pretty quickly, feel free to respond fast, too. It probably means he’s not super busy, and he has a lot of time to dedicate to your conversation."
