A bulky weight yarn is ideal for this stitch, but you can also use a thinner yarn if you prefer. If you are trying the brioche stitch for the first time, then you will need: two balls of bulky weight yarn in two different colors or two balls of the same color a pair of US 13 straight needles or US 13 circular needles for knitting in the round a stitch marker (only if knitting in the round)"

      "content": "Cast on your stitches . Choose one of your colors to begin with and cast on as many stitches as you like. If you just want to practice this stitch, then 20 stitches is good amount for straight needles, or 36 stitches for knitting on the round. Make sure that you cast on an even number of stitches. [1] X Research source You can turn your practice project on straight needles into a scarf or turn your practice project on the round into a hat."

      "content": "Purl two together . To purl to stitches together, put your right needle through the next two stitches on the left needle. The right needle should cross in front of the left needle as you do this. Then, wrap the front piece of yarn around the right needle and pull it through the two stitches on the left needle. As you do so, slip the stitches off of the left needle. The stitch on your right needle will replace them. [2] X Research source “P2 together” is the abbreviation for purling two stitches together."

Then, insert the right needle into the first stitch on the left needle as if you are going to purl this stitch. Instead, slip the stitch off of the left needle and onto the right needle.

[4] X Research source If you are knitting on two straight needles, then you can just turn the stitches around when you get to the end of the row and then continue working the pattern the same fashion. If you are working the brioche stitch in the round, then you will need to change the pattern for the second row."

Holding the yarn taut, pull the yarn through the two stitches and allow them to slide off of the left needle as the new stitch replaces them on the right needle.
