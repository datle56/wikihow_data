      "content": "ENTP It’s often the case with Myers-Briggs personality types that introverted personalities pair best with their extroverted counterparts. ENTP will push INTP out of their comfort zone, while INTP will help ENTP slow down and become more reflective and thoughtful, but their mutual value of logic and facts will make communication between the two of them easier. [1] X Research source This is a relationship without too much drama, since both INTP and ENTP value logic over feelings and argue rationally rather than emotionally. INTPs and ENTPs may be prone to self-doubt and feel misunderstood by others—which makes some sense, given that each of these types make up less than 5% of the population! But they’re each likely to find a kindred spirit in one another, which can help them relax and be themselves."

      "content": "INFP These signs are natural kindred spirits with INTP and therefore well-suited to be friends or life partners. INFP , like INTP, are prone to exploration and love learning new things, and while they may not always see eye-to-eye with INTP, their intuitive natures likely ensure they can work through any conflict with open-mindedness and respect. [2] X Research source Both types are reflective, open-minded, offbeat, and curious, which draws them together like magnets. They’ll likely spend a great deal of time talking about deep subjects, though INTPs tend to view the world more analytically, while INFPs follow their heart when making decisions. Because INFP is more emotional than INTP, they may have a tough time communicating, since they make decisions in very different ways. But as long as they can work to understand where their partner is coming from and practice communicating their needs, they’re sure to make a strong couple."

INTJ and INTP share a lot of the same values, interests, and ways of moving through the world, and conversation is sure to flow easily between them. Both types are rather independent and individualistic, as well as introverted, so they’re happy to give one another breathing room and alone time as needed. [3] X Research source A potential pitfall in this pairing is that neither type is particularly adept at communicating their emotions, which may leave feelings bubbling unresolved under the surface if both people aren’t careful. It can be helpful to make a point to check in on one another regularly to make sure everything in the relationship is going well."

      "title": "INTP",
      "content": "INTP Not surprisingly, INTPs have a lot in common with other INTPs and make a strong match. However, because they’re so similar, they may not challenge one another very much, so each person has the potential to stagnate in the relationship or even enable one another’s less-than-ideal habits. For example, INTPs have a tendency to ignore their feelings and to think their way through problems rather than acting—which may mean problems in the relationship will go unresolved unless both parties make a point to stay on top of things. [4] X Research source In general, though, relationships between INTPs are likely to thrive. They’ll probably have overlapping interests and hobbies, and will feel supported and seen by their partner. Even though they may not feel challenged in the relationship, they’ll still feel safe to be themselves and explore their own passions and curiosities without judgment—which is no small thing!"

Both types are independent, curious, and intellectual, and time is likely to fly when they’re together—but as introverts, they’re also both happy to give one another plenty of alone time. [5] X Research source These types are likely to be on the same page about most things and have no trouble finding ways to spend their time—as intellectual introverts, they may be prone to parallel play in peaceful silence. ISTP’s and ESTP’s value of logic over emotion means they understand one another pretty well—but it’s also a potential pitfall in a more intimate relationship, as neither may be particularly good at communicating their emotions or picking up on the other person’s."

As Introverted Intuitives, both types can take comfort in one another’s presence and may enjoy participating in intense theoretical discussions. [6] X Research source INFP is more focused on social situations and emotions, while INTP is more interested in abstract thought and logic—but as both signs are contemplative and curious, they’ll be eager to understand what’s going on inside the other person’s head and what makes them tick. This is part of their attraction to one another! While INTP can be spontaneous and free-wheeling, INFJ is more rules-oriented and hard-and-fast, and this can be a source of frustration for both partners."

They have a lot to teach one another about how they perceive the world, and a relationship between these two types is sure to open both participants’ eyes to new ways of seeing reality. [7] X Research source INTPs and ENTJs both tend to obsess over the same intellectual topics, from the deep to the witty and surface-level, and will likely have a lot to talk about together, making them ideal friends or life partners. As Intuitive Thinkers, both INTPs and ENTJs rely on logic and rationality when problem-solving, including problems in their relationship. These types may feel like they can be themselves around one another, making a relationship more effortless. Both types can be rather direct and blunt, which they can both appreciate at times—but at other times, they can behave rather stubbornly and come off insensitive, leading to petty disagreements if they’re not careful."

INTPs may find themselves particularly drawn to people with these personality types because they may be unpredictable—but still safe and compatible. Both types are free-spirited, curious, and relaxed, which makes a relationship low-key and simple. These types tend to have similar senses of humor as well, making them naturally drawn towards one another. INTPs’ reliance on Thinking over Feeling can be frustrating to ENFP, who may navigate problems primarily through emotionality.

INTP is sure to appreciate ISFP’s genuineness and depth of feeling, while ISFP may appreciate INTP’s nontraditional ways of viewing the world and their creativity when facing challenges. ISFPs prioritize emotions when making decisions, while INTPs prioritize logic.

In contrast to safety-seeking and low-key INTP, ESTP is outgoing and adventurous. INTP’s proclivity to spend their free time on introspection and exploring theoretical ideas may seem overwhelming to ESTP. That being said, these two types have a lot to offer one another, and thanks to their easygoing manners, they’re likely to be patient enough as they help one another expand their horizons and step out of their comfort zones."

Conversation between these two types is likely to be easy-breezy, since they’re both Introverted Thinkers who communicate in direct, simple ways. But since they can both be out of touch with their own emotions, they may not do a great job communicating their needs in a relationship unless they stay on top of things. One area where they may butt heads is in how they think, with INTPs being more open-minded and ISTJs being more traditional and conservative. As long as both partners can learn to respect one another’s ways of thinking and not try to change each other, they stand a chance of having a thriving romantic or platonic relationship."

INTPs and ENFJs may struggle to understand one another at first, but over time, they are likely to develop strong, trusting, and meaningful romantic or platonic relationships. [9] X Research source INTP’s curiosity and tendency to question norms will ignite ENFJ’s own curiosity, while INTP is sure to be taken by ENFJ’s compassion for others and desire to make a difference in the world. INTPs’ dominant function is Introverted Thinking, causing them to make sense of reality through logic and rationality. ENFJs’ dominant function is Extraverted Feeling, however, meaning they’re in tune with the feelings of others and consider social harmony a top priority. This difference in world views and modes of operating can be a source of frustration to both parties, but more likely than not, it’ll force both partners to step out of their comfort zones and to challenge their established ways of moving through the world."

These types tend to have different values, interests, and ways of moving through the world, making a relationship challenging to maintain—but thanks to their flexibility, it’s certainly not impossible. [10] X Research source ESFPs tend to be focused on the present and are very interested in pop culture and trends, while INTPs enjoy more intellectual and untraditional pursuits. INTPs are slow to connect with people who don’t share their interests, but thanks to ESFP’s warm and friendly personality, the two can still find ways to connect and learn to trust one another.

As long as these types harbor realistic expectations for the relationship and don’t try to change one another too much, they can make it work. [11] X Research source INTPs can be individualistic, rational, and occasionally competitive, while ISFJs tend to strive to keep the peace and look for common ground, and may view INTP as insensitive or stubborn. This can be frustrating to INTP, who is likely to crave a partner with whom they can playfully banter or debate—something ISFJs don’t typically have an instinct for. That being said, ISFJs are kind, caring, and compassionate, and they can help the withdrawn INTP open up.

But if they’re willing to put in the effort, they can learn a lot from one another and benefit from tremendous growth! [12] X Research source ESTJ and INTP both value logic and wit, which is something they’re sure to bond over. They’re both direct and enjoy debate, which makes them, in some ways, natural friends—as long as they can stay open-minded. INTP, as an Intuitive type, gravitates towards abstract concepts, but ESTJ, as a Sensing type, is likely to prefer discussing practical, present-day issues. Moreover, ESTJ, as a Judging type, may be overly concerned with following rules and not question convention; INTP, as an unconventional, innovative Perceiver, is likely to become frustrated by this.

It’s not impossible for these personality types to make it work, but considering they’re exact opposites, they don’t have much in common, and their opposite world views are likely to cause major friction. ESFJs, being so socially-oriented, value and uphold social traditions that baffle or even frustrate INTP, who’d rather spend their time thinking through abstract concepts or working through a problem. Meanwhile, ESTJ is likely to view INTP as out of touch with reality and difficult to get to know. It’s not that a romance or friendship between ESFJ and INTP can’t flourish—it’s that these types think, behave, and move through the world in such different ways, and likely have such different interests and hobbies, that they’re unlikely to really cross paths in a meaningful way or want to spend more time together. INTP and ESFJ can make a match work if they’re willing to put in a lot of effort to understand where each other is coming from. They can bring a lot of balance to one another’s personalities. ESFJ can help INTP be more social, while INTP can help ESFJ to be more intellectual and objective."
