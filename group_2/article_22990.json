      "content": "An AliExpress order usually takes seven to 60 days to ship. Most shipping methods offered by AliExpress promise your order will arrive between one week and two months after it ships. The distance the package has to travel from the warehouse to your door also affects delivery time. [1] X Research source If you pay extra for an expedited shipping method, AliExpress usually ships for between 1-10 days before arriving."

      "content": "Shipping Carrier The biggest factor affecting your AliExpress order’s shipping time is which carrier and shipping option you choose. Shipping carriers vary in terms of cost, reliability, speed, and whether or not they offer tracking. See a brief breakdown of average shipping times below. Note shipping times begin after the seller ships the order, which could take up to 10 days. [2] X Research source AliExpress Standard Shipping: 10 to 45 day shipping time. Usually free.

Cainiao Super Economy for Special Goods and Cainiao Expedited Standard Shipping: 20 to 40 day shipping time. ePacket: 7 to 30 day shipping time.

      "content": "Country of Origin Most AliExpress orders ship from sellers in China. Depending on where you are in the world, your package will probably have to travel a long distance to get from the warehouse to you. Keep this in mind when placing an order—especially if you’re used to ordering products from within your country. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Package Destination Different countries have different shipping times based on their location, customs process, and the volume of mail they must process. How long your AliExpress order takes to arrive will depend on where you are in the world. Below are some average shipping times for common destination countries, based on whether your shipping method is by boat (sea) or plane (air). The United States: around 23-51 days for sea freight and 5-10 days for air freight. [5] X Research source The United Kingdom: around 14 days for sea freight and 5-10 days for air freight.

      "content": "Customs When you order something from another country, it has to pass inspection by either (or both) its origin country and its destination country. Any order can be chosen for advanced inspection, which delays its arrival at your door. When you track your package on the AliExpress website, it will typically tell you once it has cleared customs in its origin country. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Shipping Method",
      "content": "Shipping Method Many AliExpress orders ship by sea instead of by air. Because AliExpress products are often being shipped from China to other countries, they must travel long distances. Shipping by sea will typically take longer than shipping by air—but it will also be cheaper in most cases. [11] X Research source Pay extra for an air-shipping method to get your order faster."

      "title": "Holiday & Seller Delays",
      "content": "Holiday & Seller Delays Because many AliExpress products ship from China, Chinese holidays that close or limit postal and customs services can increase the shipping time. The most notable holiday is Chinese New Year, which is usually celebrated for one to two weeks in late January and/or early February. [12] X Research source Sellers also usually have seven to 10 days to ship your package after ordering. This means your shipping window could be delayed if they wait the maximum time allowed to ship. If you’re concerned about shipping delays, avoid ordering products from AliExpress that ship from China during holiday weeks."
