      "content": "Store in a glass or plastic container in a room temperature area. Honey is best kept between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit and away from direct sunlight. [3] X Research source A pantry or cupboard is usually the best place for honey as it won't be as affected by the elements. If your honey didn't come in an airtight container, relocate it to a repurposed glass jar or sealed plastic container. If you want to keep your honey on the counter, take note of where sunlight comes through your kitchen windows so you can avoid placing your honey in its path. Honey does not react well to fluctuations in temperature so try and keep it away from drafty areas and vents in your house."

      "content": "Keep your honey in the refrigerator. You are able to store your honey in the fridge, but bear in mind that honey will crystallize if it drops below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. As long as you don't cause the honey's temperature to bounce around, a chillier environment is just fine. [4] X Research source However, the honey will be a little slower to pour out when you want to use it. Place the jar in a bowl or hot water to help break up and dissolve the crystals. Honey can also be frozen. Be cautious though, any moisture that gets in the honey can cause it to ferment whether in the fridge or pantry. This can produce mead but it does ruin the original honey.

      "content": "Make a decoy honey trap. You can redirect ants away from your main honey source by putting a small dish of a spoonful of honey or sugar water outside near your house. Ants will go for this source first and as they consume the dish's contents, refill it and periodically move it away from your house to draw them away. [6] X Research source Make sugar water by mixing a 1:1 ratio sugar to water. Dissolve the sugar by putting it into hot water and then let it cool. Another trap you can make is with peanut butter and bacon grease or a combination of sugar and Borax. Fill a small container with the mixture, place aluminum foil over the top, and poke holes for the ants to get in. These diversions will not kill ants, only distract them from your kitchen. You will need to be sure to move the trap away from your house to prevent an invasion."
