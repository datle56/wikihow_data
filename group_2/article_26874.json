      "content": "Let the milk warm up to room temperature. Set your bags of chilled breast milk out and wait for them to warm up. The bags of milk are ready to go once they’re around room temperature. [2] X Research source Make sure you have 1 c (240 mL) of breast milk for each pound (453.59 g) of soap you plan on making. The average breast milk storage bag holds around a ¾ cup (180 mL) of milk, so you’ll probably need to use more than 1 bag. If all your milk is frozen, defrost the breast milk ahead of time."

      "content": "Slice 1 lb (453.59 g) of melt-and-pour soap base into small chunks. Cut up the block of premade soap into small, 1 in (2.5 cm) cubes—this makes it easier to melt down and pour into silicone molds. [3] X Research source Melt-and-pour soap bases are essentially large bars of cold process soap (soap that’s processed with lye). They’re made with extra glycerin, which allows you to heat the soap base into a liquid. [4] X Research source Melt-and-pour soap bases come in many different varieties, including shea, aloe, and honey. [5] X Research source Choose one that really meets your skin’s needs—for instance, a shea base could be a good option if you struggle with eczema."

After each cycle, stir the melting soap with a spoon so it develops an even consistency. Keep heating the soap in short bursts until it’s completely liquified. [6] X Research source You can also use a double boiler set over medium heat to melt down the soap."

Stir in 1 tsp of medium-to-large exfoliants like jojoba beads , walnut shells, coffee grounds, poppy seeds , or pumice sand . Mix the ingredient of your choice into the soap, giving the mixture a good stir until it’s between 125 and 135 °F (52 and 57 °C). [8] X Research source You’ll have an easier time stirring in exfoliants if you’re preparing your soap over a double boiler. Body-grade essential oils and fragrance oils are a great way to give your soap a refreshing scent. Just mix 0.3 fl oz (8.9 mL) of your favorite oil into your soap mixture. [9] X Research source Always use body-grade essential oils for your soaps, since the soap will be applied directly to the skin. For more exact essential oil measurements, cross-reference your ingredients with this fragrance calculator ."

Give your soap a good sniff each time you use it—if starts smelling funky, throw it out. [12] X Research source Melt-and-pour breast milk doesn’t go through saponification, or the chemical process that would prevent the milk in the soap from turning rancid. Because of this, melt-and-pour breast milk doesn’t last very long before the milk starts to go bad. Some people use melt-and-pour breast milk soap to bathe their babies. [13] X Research source However, medical experts don’t officially advise this—instead, they recommend washing your newborn baby with just regular water. Once they’re at least 4 to 6 weeks old, you can switch to an unscented baby shampoo. [14] X Research source"

Pour out 10.4 fl oz (310 mL) of breast milk into an ice cube tray—the smaller portions will make the milk easier to melt down with the lye. Stick the tray into the freezer ahead of time so your milk is frozen and ready to go. [15] X Research source"

[18] X Research source Be sure to prep your soap in a well-ventilated area so you don’t have to deal with as many harsh lye fumes. [19] X Research source Warning: Always stir the lye into the milk—never pour the milk into the lye! If you add the milk second, the lye may explode out of the measuring cup, which is a huge safety hazard. [20] X Research source"

Turn up the heat slowly, stirring the oils together until they’re somewhere between 90 and 100 °F (32 and 38 °C). [21] X Research source Olive oil is a great choice for homemade soap since it takes a long time to go rancid. Canola oil, jojoba oil , meadowfoam oil , and tamanu oil also have really long shelf lives. [22] X Research source This amount of oil yields about 2 lbs (907.18 g) of soap."

Then, gradually pour the lye-milk mixture into the oils, using an immersion blender to combine everything together.

Make sure that each oil is labeled as “body-grade” before adding it to your soap mixture. If you’d like to give your soap a little exfoliating power, mix in 2 small spoonfuls (around 2 tsp) of exfoliant (like jojoba beads or pumice sand ). If you’d rather use a fine exfoliant (like colloidal oatmeal or bamboo powder ), dilute the 2 spoonfuls with 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of distilled water or light oil before stirring them into the soap mixture.

Spoon the mixture into your mold of choice—a rectangular mold is great if you’re looking to make a classic soap bar. Try to spread the soap mixture as evenly as you can across the mold. Then, slip it in the freezer for at least 24 hours. [26] X Research source Some DIY soap-makers prefer to freeze their molds before ladling the soap mixture in. The chilled mold prevents the soap from darkening and gives the finished product a lighter color. This is completely up to personal preference, though!"

Then, place the soap in a dry, well-ventilated area so it can cure completely—this allows the soap to harden even more so it has a longer shelf life in your shower.

[30] X Research source Don’t use lye-based breast milk soap to wash your baby, as it’ll be too harsh on their sensitive skin.
