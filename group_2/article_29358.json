This protects the privacy of your mailing list members and is good mailing list etiquette. Technically, you can add this label to the To: field instead. But if you do that, everyone on the list will be able to see and reply to all other members. Don't do this unless everyone on the list specifically asks to join a discussion listâ€”when people reply, it could create way too many emails for list members, and there'd be no way for them to unsubscribe.

If you have trouble finding your mailing list label this way, click BCC in the upper-left corner of the window (below the \"To\" field) to expand your list of contacts.
