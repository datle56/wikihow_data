Those include: which CDL training course you take, whether you're able to attend classes full-time or part-time, which endorsements you're training for, and more. It also depends on how many times you have to take the CDL tests. You can try an unlimited number of times to pass, but your state may require you to wait a few days or a couple of weeks between test attempts. [1] X Research source"

[2] X Research source If you're getting a CDL for the first time or upgrading from Class B to Class A, make sure your training course is ELDT-compliant.

      "content": "CDL license class type There are 2 different types of CDL licenses you can get: Class A or Class B. Each one requires a different amount of training because they prepare the driver to operate different types of vehicles. For example, a Class B CDL permits drivers to operate a truck or a bus, but not pull a trailer. For that reason, students can sometimes complete their Class B training in 3 weeks. Class A CDLs allow drivers to pull a trailer and other types of heavy-duty vehicles. That's why they typically train for at least 4 weeks. [3] X Research source"

If you're not working or only working part-time, take a full-time training course and get it knocked out quickly. If you need more flexibility because of work, health, or childcare responsibilities, join a part-time program to make slow but steady progress toward your CDL. Some training courses are self-paced. This means you can complete them as fast or as slowly as you want."

To apply for a CLP, contact your local driver's license office and ask them what documents they require. They may ask you to bring your regular driver's license, social security card, and other identifying information. [8] X Research source You'll also need to receive a physical from the Department of Transportation (DOT), get a DOT medical card, and let the state inspect your driving record.

The good news is that when you're ready to get your CDL, the license itself typically costs less than $50 at your local DMV. Lastly, you'll have to pay test fees to the state, but these are usually inexpensive. For example, a new Class A or B CDL license in Arizona costs $25, and the Skills test costs $25. That means you would have to pay $50 to the state, plus your training course tuition, to get your CDL.

      "content": "Restrictions indicate which vehicles a CDL driver can't drive or operate. For example, let's say you take the skills test and fail the air brakes portion of the test. In that case, you'll get an L restriction on your license. The L means you'll be restricted from driving a vehicle with a full air brake system. The good news is you can retake skills and knowledge tests as often as needed to meet your goals as a CDL driver. Here's a list of restrictions you should be aware of: [19] X Research source L : Restricts the driver from operating a vehicle with a full air brake system. This happens when the driver fails the Air Brakes Knowledge Test, doesn't correctly label the air brake system components, doesn't perform an air brakes system check correctly, or chooses not to take the Skills test for air brakes. Z : Restricts the driver from driving a vehicle with a full air brake system. This particular abbreviation means that the driver took their Skills test in a vehicle with an air over hydraulic brake system. E : Restricts the driver from operating a vehicle with a manual transmission. This restriction is for drivers who take their Skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission. O : Restricts drivers from operating a vehicle with a fifth wheel connection. This restriction is for drivers who take their Skills test in a vehicle that doesn't have some type of fifth wheel connection on it (like a pintle hook). M : Restricts Class A CDL drivers from operating Class A passenger vehicles or school buses. The only time this restriction applies is if someone gets their Class A, but got their passenger vehicle or school bus endorsements while driving a Class B vehicle. The \"M\" means they can only drive Class B or C passenger vehicles and school buses, not Class A vehicles of those types. N : Restricts Class B CDL drivers from operating Class B passenger vehicles or school buses. This restriction is similar to M, but the difference is that the Class B driver got their passenger vehicle and school bus endorsements in a Class C vehicle. Therefore, they're only allowed to drive Class C types of those vehicles, even though they technically have a Class B CDL. V : Indicates that a CDL driver has a medical variance. A medical variance is an impairment that prevents drivers from meeting the FMCSA's standard health requirements to get a CDL. The V on their license shows that the state where they got their CDL has approved them to use their license, even though they're impaired. [20] X Research source"

If you're worried about paying for your class, consider taking a college CDL course and talking to the financial aid department about assistance."
