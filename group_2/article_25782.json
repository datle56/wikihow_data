      "title": "Break down the word.",
      "content": "Break down the word. When you think of a word you don't know how to spell, don't panic. Step back and break the word into parts, either in your head or with pen and paper. Even when the spelling doesn't match the sound, this method will teach you to recognize common spelling patterns. [1] X Research source Example: Break \"constraint\" into \"con — strain — t.\" The second and third part are spelled how they sound. The vowel in \"con\" might not be obvious from the sound, but if you keep breaking down words you'll notice that the spelling \"con\" appears many times."

      "title": "Identify prefixes and suffixes.",
      "content": "Identify prefixes and suffixes. Many English words are formed from two or more parts. When possible, break words down into a \"root word,\" a \"prefix\" at the beginning, and/or a \"suffix\" at the end. Each prefix or suffix appears on many words, and almost always has the same meaning and spelling each time. [2] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source Example: Break \"independence\" into \"in — depend — ence\": 1.\"In\" is a prefix that means \"not\" 2. \"Depend\" is the root word 3. The suffix \"ence\" is probably the hardest to spell, but you only need to learn it once and you'll recognize it at the end of many words."

    {
      "title": "Guess at spellings based on other words.",
      "content": "Guess at spellings based on other words. When you have no idea how to spell part of a word, write down other words that include a similar sound. Chances are good that the mystery word is spelled the same way. This isn't foolproof, but it's much better than choosing a spelling at random. Example: \"Independence\" might sound like it ends with an \"s\" at first — but \"fence\" has a much closer sound than \"pens.\" This makes the \"ence\" spelling more likely to be correct (which it is)."

      "title": "Memorize extra difficult words by pronouncing each syllable.",
      "content": "Memorize extra difficult words by pronouncing each syllable. Some words have such weird spellings that they are difficult to remember even after breaking them into parts. Try ignoring the real pronunciation and instead pronouncing each syllable as it's written. Example: The military rank \"colonel\" is pronounced \"kernel,\" which doesn't sound anything like the spelling. To help you memorize the spelling, chant the word as it looks: \"col – o - nel.\" Example 2: This trick is especially useful for long words. Say the word \"congratulation\" as \"con-grat-u-la-ti-on.\" Once you're 100% sure about the \"tion\" ending, you can shorten this to \"con-grat-u-la-shun.\" Exaggerate the vowel sounds to make sure they sound different from each other. E, I, and A are easily confused if you're not careful."

      "title": "Make a visual connection between a difficult and easy word.",
      "content": "Make a visual connection between a difficult and easy word. People are much better at remembering images than spelling. If you keep making a spelling mistake, come up with a simple visual idea that connects the difficult word with an easy word that has a similar spelling. Example: The word \"gherkin\" (meaning pickle) has the same \"gh\" start as the word \"ghost.\" Think of a ghost holding a gherkin, and you'll train your brain to think \"gherkin → ghost → they both start with 'gh'.\" Making connections to an unrelated idea is often helpful when you're trying to memorize any information. This technique is called a \"donkey bridge.\""

      "content": "Remember the appearance of the word on the page. If you can't think of a word to connect it to, there's another way to create a visual idea, although it can take some creativity. Write the difficult word in large letters on a piece of paper. Focus on the letter or letters you have trouble with, and draw (or imagine) a picture that looks like those letters. It may help to include the meaning of the word in your image. Example: If you keep spelling \"citadel\" (meaning castle) with two \"L\"s, picture a citadel with a single, tall tree to the right of it. This may remind you that there's only one \"l\" at the end of the word."

      "content": "Try to write a mnemonic for each spelling. A mnemonic is a silly phrase that's easy to remember and tells you something about the word. One easy way to make a mnemonic is to write a sentence by turning each letter into a full word. Silly but simple sentences are best.

Every day, write down each word on your list three times and spell it out loud. Literally one minute of this \"studying\" each day will teach you the spelling quite quickly. Remove words from the list once you're confident you know the spelling. Add new words to replace them.
