      "title": "Slice the cabbage into quarters.",
      "content": "Slice the cabbage into quarters. Use a sharp knife to cut 1 medium head of napa cabbage in half. Next, slice each section in half again to form quarters and remove the core section from the bottom of each quarter.. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut each quarter into strips.",
      "content": "Cut each quarter into strips. Use the knife to slice each quarter crosswise. Create 2-inch (5-cm) wide strips from each piece so the cabbage is roughly shredded. [2] X Research source Traditionally, kimchi is made from cubed cabbage — you may also cut the quarters into cubes, if you prefer that size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine the cabbage and salt in a bowl.",
      "content": "Combine the cabbage and salt in a bowl. Place the sliced cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle ¼ cup (62 g) of kosher salt over it. Use clean hands to gently massage the salt into the cabbage so the leaves start to soften. [3] X Research source You can substitute sea salt for the kosher salt. You can wear kitchen gloves to protect your hands if you prefer."

    {
      "title": "Cover the cabbage with water and let it stand for 1 to 2 hours.",
      "content": "Cover the cabbage with water and let it stand for 1 to 2 hours. Pour enough distilled or filtered water into the bowl to cover the cabbage. Place a large plate on top of the bowl, and set a heavy object like a jar or can on top to weigh it down. Let the cabbage soak in the salted water for at least an hour. [4] X Research source Chlorine in tap water can prevent the kimchi from fermenting, so it’s important to use distilled, filtered or bottled water. Avoid soaking the cabbage for more than 2 hours or it may become soggy."

      "title": "Pour the cabbage into a colander to drain and collect the brine.",
      "content": "Pour the cabbage into a colander to drain and collect the brine. After the cabbage has soaked, dump it into a colander that’s sitting in the sink. Have a bowl beneath the colander so you can collect the salt water brine. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the cabbage with cold water 3 times and drain it again.",
      "content": "Rinse the cabbage with cold water 3 times and drain it again. Remove the bowl with brine from beneath the colander and set it aside. Run cold water from the sink faucet over the cabbage in the colander, shaking the leaves well to rinse them. Repeat the process 2 more times to ensure that the salt water is completely removed. Allow the cabbage to drain in the sink for 15 to 20 minutes so all of the water is removed. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mix the garlic, ginger, sugar, and fish sauce.",
      "content": "Mix the garlic, ginger, sugar, and fish sauce. Add 5 to 6 grated garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of grated ginger, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of fish sauce to a small bowl. Stir well until a smooth paste forms."

    {
      "title": "Stir in the red pepper flakes.",
      "content": "Stir in the red pepper flakes. Add 1 to 5 tablespoons (5 to 25 g) of Korean red pepper flakes to the paste. Mix well until the flakes are completely incorporated. [7] X Research source Korean red pepper flakes are also known as gochugaru , and can be found at Asian grocery stores and in the international aisle of some general grocery stores. For mild kimchi, add just a single tablespoon of the red pepper flakes. Increase the amount if you prefer a spicier flavor."

    {
      "title": "Combine the cabbage, radish, scallions, and paste.",
      "content": "Combine the cabbage, radish, scallions, and paste. Add the cabbage; 8 ounces (200 g) of peeled radish that’s been cut into matchsticks; 4 scallions that are trimmed and cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces; and the paste to a large, clean bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together well until all of the vegetables are coated with the paste. [8] X Research source It’s a good idea to wear gloves while mixing the paste with the vegetables. The paste can sting, stain, and leave a smell behind on your skin."

    {
      "title": "Pack the kimchi in a glass jar and add the brine to it.",
      "content": "Pack the kimchi in a glass jar and add the brine to it. Once the vegetables and paste are combined, transfer them to a clean jar. Pour some of the brine in as well, and press down on the vegetables until the brine rises up to cover them. Seal the jar tightly with a lid. [9] X Research source There should be at least 1-inch (2.5-cm) of space at the top of the jar. If there's any brine leftover after you cover the vegetables in the jar, you can discard it. If you don't have a glass jar, you can ferment the kimchi in a plastic zipper bag. However, be sure to squeeze out all of the excess air before sealing the bag."

    {
      "title": "Allow the kimchi to ferment for up to 5 days.",
      "content": "Allow the kimchi to ferment for up to 5 days. Leave the kimchi out at room temperature in the sealed jar. Let it sit for 1 to 2 days before opening the jar. Press on the kimchi with a spoon. If bubbles appear at the top, it’s properly fermented. If it hasn’t fermented, continue to let it sit, checking on it every day. [10] X Research source Another way to tell if the kimchi is finished fermenting is to taste it. When it has a tangy, sour flavor, it's ready."

    {
      "title": "Transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator for another week or so.",
      "content": "Transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator for another week or so. When the kimchi is fully fermented, place the jar in the fridge. You can eat it right away, but the flavor is usually better if you let it chill for another 1 to 2 weeks more. [11] X Research source Spoon some kimchi over a bowl of steamed rice for a tasty but simple meal. It also pairs well with fried rice. You can use kimchi to top a bowl of ramen noodles. For more creative dishes, consider topping a burger or sandwich with kimchi or mixing some kimchi into scrambled eggs for a bit of a kick."

      "content": "Store kimchi in the fridge for 3 to 5 months. As long as there's still brine in the jar, kimchi can last for several months in the refrigerator. You can usually tell that it's gone bad if brine becomes particularly fizzy with bubbles. [12] X Research source"
