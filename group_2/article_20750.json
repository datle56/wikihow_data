      "content": "Defeat Godrick the Grafted and visit the Roundtable Hold. The primary route to Moghwyn Palace involves a questline given by White-Faced Varré, that strange masked character you meet as you step out of the starting area of the game. His questline isn’t available, however, until you fight your way through Stormveil Castle and defeat its main boss, Godrick the Grafted. After you do, head to Roundtable Hold and speak to Finger Reader Enia. [1] X Research source Stormveil Castle is to the northwest of the starting area on your map. Shortly after you enter, you’ll need to defeat the miniboss Margit the Fell Omen. Roundtable Hold is only accessible by fast travel after meeting Melina, who will take you to Roundtable Hold after meeting her at the Site of Grace just outside Limgrave. Enia’s next to the 2 giant fingers. You can’t miss ‘em."

      "content": "Talk to Varré at Rose Church to receive the Festering Bloody Fingers. After beating Godrick and speaking to Enia, Varré vanishes from where you first met him and starts hanging around the Rose Church, where he’s waiting to give you his questline. [2] X Research source The Rose Church is located within Liurnia of the Lakes. Get there by hopping on your trusty steed, Torrent, and heading northwest from Stormveil Castle. When you talk to Varré, select the dialogue option “Something seems off” to initiate the quest. After, Varré will give you 5 Festering Bloody Fingers items."

      "title": "Invade 3 other players with the Festering Bloody Fingers.",
      "content": "Invade 3 other players with the Festering Bloody Fingers. The Festering Bloody Finger item lets you “invade” other players, jumping into their games and dueling them to the death. Go into your inventory and use the Festering Bloody Fingers 3 times to invade 3 players, and take them down if you can (but no worries if you can’t; the quest will continue anyway). Then speak to Varré again to receive the Lord of Blood’s Favor item after he anoints you a Knight of Mohg. [3] X Research source Neat! Invading other players requires an internet connection . If you want to get into Mohgwyn Palace without an internet connection, use the alternate method . Note that Festering Bloody Fingers are single-use items; once you use them, they’re gone. Varré gives you 5, but get more by buying them from the Merchant in the Mistwood."

      "title": "Use the Lord of Blood’s Favor item on a dead maiden.",
      "content": "Use the Lord of Blood’s Favor item on a dead maiden. Varré’s a pretty twisted guy, and now he wants to test your mettle by making you soak the Favor in the blood of a maiden. You’ve got a few options here. First, use the Favor on the dead maiden in the Church of Inhibition northeast of the Rose Church. Second, travel to Chapel of Anticipation by using an Imbued Sword Key in the Four Belfries area (north of the Rose Church), where you’ll find a dead maiden to use the Favor on. [4] X Research source Your third option is a bit more grisly. Travel to the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace (just north of Stormveil) and kill the NPC Hyetta, and use the Favor on the body, but only after completing the Castle Morne area during Irina’s questline."

      "content": "Return to Varré to receive the Pureblood Knight’s Medal item. You’ve got your blood-soaked favor, so head on back to Varré in the Rose Church and speak with him again. He’ll give you the Bloody Finger item (which is different from the Festering Bloody Fingers). Then talk to him once more and he’ll hand over the Pureblood Knight’s Medal, which is a reusable item and also your ticket to Mohgwyn Castle. When used, it teleports you to the entrance area of the castle. You’ve made it! [5] X Research source Take note: Moghwyn’s Castle is a late-game area with tough enemies. Luckily, the entrance area is near a large crow enemy that can be taken down pretty easily with ranged attacks to farm runes. The Bloody Finger item lets you invade other players. Unlike the Festering Bloody Fingers, it’s reusable, so don’t be afraid to use it over and over again."

But in order to get there, you need both halves the Haligtree Secret Medallion. [6] X Research source Find the right half of the Medallion by heading to the Village of the Albinaurics in the Liurnia area, where you’ll find an NPC disguised as a pot on the path past the Perfumer enemy. Smack the pot to reveal the NPC, Albus, who’ll give you the item."

Defeat Morgott the Omen King in Leyndell, which is a mandatory story quest, then talk to Melina at a Site of Grace. Melina will give you the Rold Medallion. Then, head to the Forbidden Lands north of Leyndell, where you’ll find the Grand Lift of Rold. Use the Rold Medallion to ride the lift up to the Mountaintops of the Giants area. Head north to the Castle of Sol, and defeat Commander Niall within the castle to gain access to the roof, where the left Secret Medallion lies. [7] X Research source Note that the Rold Medallion is different from the Secret Haligtree Medallion. The Rold Medallion gives you access to the Mountaintops, while the Secret Medallion gives you access to a secret area."

Equip the Secret Medallion and use the lift (selecting “Hoist secret medallion” rather than “Hoist medallion”), and voila, the Grand Lift of Rold transports you to the secret Consecrated Snowfields.

On the cliff near the trees is the Waygate to Mohgwyn, your ticket to the Palace. But beware, the Waygate is guarded by the Sanguine Noble. You can try to evade him, but killing him earns you a nifty set of armor. [9] X Research source Once through the Waygate, you’ll be in a dark cave. Just exit the cave and feast your eyes on the Palace beyond. Safe travels!"
