      "title": "Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar with a bucket of cold water.",
      "content": "Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar with a bucket of cold water. Make sure you use enough cold water to fully submerge your wool item. If you don’t have a bucket, you can fill up your sink instead. [1] X Research source Cold water will prevent the wool from shrinking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the wool piece inside out, then submerge it in the mixture.",
      "content": "Turn the wool piece inside out, then submerge it in the mixture. If you’re working with a piece of clothing, turn it inside out so the wrong side faces outwards. Then, submerge your wool item into the mixture fully, making sure all the fibers are completely saturated with water and vinegar. [2] X Research source The white vinegar will work to soften the fibers of the wool, making them less poky and itchy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the wool item for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the wool item for 15 minutes. The white vinegar needs a little bit of time to soften the fibers, so leave the item submerged. Don’t scrub or wash the wool item as it soaks to avoid stretching the fibers. If you notice any part of the item floating to the top of the water, gently push it back in so it’s submerged again. [3] X Research source Vinegar is also a mild cleanser, so it can refresh your wool piece if it’s starting to smell musty or dirty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the wool piece with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the wool piece with cold water. Pick your wool item up out of the water and use cold water to rinse it thoroughly for about 5 minutes. Don’t wring or squeeze your wool item to prevent stretching the fibers; instead, gently pat the excess water out when you’re done. [4] X Research source You can drain your bucket or sink of water and vinegar, since you won’t be needing it anymore."
    },
    {
      "title": "Massage hair conditioner into the fibers of the wool.",
      "content": "Massage hair conditioner into the fibers of the wool. While your sweater is still wet, squeeze out a quarter-sized amount of hair conditioner and rub it in between your palms. Gently massage the conditioner into the fibers of the wool, grabbing more if you need to. [5] X Research source Try to find high-end conditioner without silicones or sulfates to avoid drying out the wool."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the wool sit for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the wool sit for 30 minutes. As the wool soaks in the conditioner, the fibers will soften and reduce the pokey, scratchy ends that might be making you itch. Set a timer on your phone or computer so you know when it’s time to come back to your wool piece. [6] X Research source If you accidentally leave the conditioner on for a little longer, that’s okay. Just be sure your wool piece doesn't dry with the conditioner still on it, or it could make the wool feel slimy."

    {
      "title": "Rinse your wool item with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse your wool item with cold water. Using your sink or bathtub faucet, rinse the item out thoroughly with cold water until you can’t feel the slippery conditioner on it anymore. If any conditioner is left on the wool as it dries, it could cause a flaky buildup that will make your wool feel slimy. [7] X Research source Again, be careful not to squeeze or wring out your wool item to avoid stretching or misshaping the fibers."

      "title": "Spread your wool garment flat on a towel to air dry.",
      "content": "Spread your wool garment flat on a towel to air dry. Make sure your wool item is completely flat to discourage it from drying with lumps or bumps. Depending on how large and thick your wool piece is, it could take up to a full day to dry completely. [8] X Research source Wet wool can be kind of smelly, so you may want to dry your wool item in a ventilated area. Never hang wool pieces to dry on hangers, as it can stretch out the fibers."

    {
      "title": "Fold the garment up and seal it in a plastic bag.",
      "content": "Fold the garment up and seal it in a plastic bag. Make sure your wool piece is completely dry, then fold it up neatly. Slide the wool piece into a plastic bag, then seal it up tightly, squeezing the air out as you seal. [9] X Research source You don't need to vacuum seal your bag, but make sure the majority of the air is out."

    {
      "title": "Place the bag in your freezer overnight.",
      "content": "Place the bag in your freezer overnight. Make sure the bag is completely sealed and airtight to avoid moisture buildup on your garment. Leave it in the freezer for at least 8 hours to bond the fibers together and keep them from poking outwards. [10] X Research source Putting your wool item in the freezer can also stop it from shedding so much."

      "title": "Take the garment out and enjoy your less itchy wool piece!",
      "content": "Take the garment out and enjoy your less itchy wool piece! Unseal the bag and unfold your wool item. If it gets itchy again in the future, you can repeat the process of soaking in vinegar, conditioner, and then freezing it. [11] X Research source As wool ages, it may dry out and become more pokey and itchy."
