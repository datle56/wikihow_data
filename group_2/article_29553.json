      "content": "Draw the shape of your mask. Choose a piece of paper, cardstock , cardboard, or even a sturdy paper plate and decide what shape you want your mask to be. [1] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source To make your mask symmetrical, fold your paper in half and draw half of the mask. While the paper is still folded, hold it up to the window to trace the shape on the other half of the paper. Make a mask to cover just your eyes, half your face, or your entire face. Decide what shape best fits the occasion. Another way to make your mask symmetrical is to draw half of the mask on a folded piece of paper, then cut along the lines you drew to cut the mask out. Don’t cut along the fold, however, or you’ll end up with two separate halves. Make sure you’re satisfied with the size and shape of the mask if you choose this method."

      "content": "Draw eye holes and, if necessary, a mouth hole. To make sure the eye holes are in the right place, first hold the mask in front of your face, then use a pencil to make a small mark on the area in front of your eyes. Draw the eyes around the mark. Do the same for the mouth if you’re making a full-face mask. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut out the eyes and mouth.",
      "content": "Cut out the eyes and mouth. Use an X-Acto knife or a razor blade to cut out two holes for the eyes and, if you’re making a full-face mask, the hole for the mouth. If you don’t have an X-Acto knife or a razor blade—or if there isn’t an adult present—cut them out with scissors. [3] X Research source To cut the eye holes with scissors, fold the mask across where you want to cut, then cut a small hole. Unfold the mask and insert your scissors through the hole to cut out the remaining shape of the eye or mouth. If you’re a child and are having trouble cutting the eyes out, ask an adult for help. Don’t cut out your full mask yet. Leave the extra paper around the shape in case you find that you want a larger one while you’re decorating."

      "title": "Color your mask with markers, crayons, or paint.",
      "content": "Color your mask with markers, crayons, or paint. Now that you have the shape of your mask, design its base color. Use any medium you’d like to make your design, but paint, markers, and crayons work best. Go for a solid color or add designs such as stripes, stars, polka dots, or even scars. It’s up to you! [4] X Research source Chalk and pastels can rub off and get into your eyes, while markers with heavy scents or fumes can irritate your eyes and nose. If you’re not sure what designs you’d like, try drawing them with a pencil first so you can erase them if you decide you want something different. Consider designing your mask to look like your favorite superhero—like Spiderman!"

      "title": "Add glitter, jewels, feathers, and other decorations.",
      "content": "Add glitter, jewels, feathers, and other decorations. Once you’ve finished your base layer of color, make your mask even more unique by adding decorations. Try placing your decorations in different places before gluing them down so you can find the style you like best. [5] X Research source Make sure that your decorations aren’t too heavy. Too many additions will weigh down the paper and make it difficult for the mask to keep its form and it may not stay in place over your face. Use white craft glue to attach your decorations, as it is water-based and likely won’t aggravate your skin or eyes. Craft glue is also flexible when dry, so your mask will still be able to form around your face. If you decide to attach feathers, it may be best to add them after you cut the mask out so you don’t risk cutting any of them off."

      "content": "Attach some ribbon to tie the mask around your head. Get two pieces of ribbon (or heavy-duty string ), each about a foot long. Glue an end of each ribbon to the inside of your mask, from the outer edge of the eyes to the edge of the mask. Once the ribbon is dry and secure, pull it around your head and tie it in the back to wear your mask. [7] X Research source If you have a hole punch, you can also punch holes in the area between the eyes and the edge of your mask. Then, slip the ribbon through the hole and tie it in a snug loop. Do not staple the ribbon to your mask. This could be dangerous, as the staple could come loose and scratch your eye."

      "content": "Alternatively, attach a stick to wear the mask. If you wish to hold your mask to your face rather than tying it, make a handle using a chopstick, popsicle stick, or dowel . Simply glue the stick onto the back of the mask. White glue will hold well, as long as it’s applied generously. Keep the handle plain or decorate it with paint or markers before you attach it to your mask.

If you want your mask to last through many wears, it’s very important to keep it dry. To prevent damage from sweat, line the inside of your mask with scotch tape or glue some plastic wrap to it. Don’t wear your mask in the rain or around water, if possible."
