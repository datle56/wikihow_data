Especially if you’re interested in working in stores, finding a job opening could be as easy as talking to the manager when you order your coffee. During a time that’s not too busy, ask if you can talk to a supervisor about job openings. If you start this conversation during the “rush hour,” such as the morning coffee grab, workers may get frustrated with you. Start your relationship with the shop on the right foot by going at an off-time, such as the mid-afternoon. Say: “Hi there, I’m Suzy. I’m hoping to apply to work here. Do you have any open positions? Can I take an application home with me? Thanks!”"
