      "content": "Refresh your jeans by hanging them outside or by an open window overnight. Fresh air does wonders for helping keep denim smelling nice, and this is an easy way to air your jeans out before wearing them again the next day. If you’re going to hang them outside, be sure to check the weather forecast first! [1] X Research source Fresh air is free of scents that might contribute to your jeans smelling not so great, like cooking odors or tobacco."

      "content": "Infuse your jeans with a nice smell by putting dryer sheets in your drawers. If you keep your jeans in a dresser of some sort, try tucking a scented dryer sheet into the corner of each drawer. The scent from the sheet should transfer to your jeans, helping them smell dryer-fresh when you go to put them on. [2] X Research source Even used dryer sheets still retain some of their scent. Use them in your drawers instead of throwing them out after finishing a load of laundry. You could also spritz a few cotton balls with your favorite perfume, cologne, or essential oil for a similar effect."

      "content": "Spritz your denim with a fabric-refresh spray before going out. If you’re worried that your jeans need a little bit of a lift, this spray can add a nice scent and help you feel more confident that you and your jeans smell good. You can spray your jeans while you’re wearing them or before you put them on. [3] X Research source Generally, just 2-3 sprays on the front and back of your jeans should be plenty to refresh them."

      "content": "Keep a bowl of dried coffee grounds in your closet to absorb odors. Scents from your home can easily make their way into your closet where they can get drawn in to your clothing. Coffee grounds can help trap those odors; plus, your jeans may end up smelling a little bit like coffee which could be nice if you enjoy that particular aroma. [4] X Research source Change out the coffee grounds every week or so to make sure they’re the most effective. Baking soda also absorbs odors. If you don’t want to use coffee grounds, put a small bowl of baking soda on a shelf in your closet for the same effect."

      "content": "Remove odors and freshen up your jeans with a spritz of diluted vinegar. In a spray bottle, combine equal parts of water and white vinegar. Lightly spray the front and back of your jeans and let them dry completely before wearing them. [5] X Research source You can use this spray to refresh other articles of clothing, too! Keep a bottle handy in your bedroom or laundry room for easy access."

      "content": "Soak your jeans in water and vinegar to get rid of mothball smells. If you take your jeans out of storage and notice that they have that particular mothball scent, using white vinegar is a great way to remove and neutralize that odor. Soak them in a 1:1 ratio of water to white vinegar for several hours before washing them like you normally would. [6] X Research source White vinegar is an acetic acid, which means it can bond with odor-causing molecules and get rid of them."

      "content": "Take your jeans out of the washing machine ASAP to prevent mildew. It’s happened to the best of us—you forget you put in a load of laundry and when you finally go to move it, you’re hit with that specific scent of mildew and have to wash your clothes all over again. Prevent this from happening to your jeans by making sure to get them out of the washer as soon as they’re done. [8] X Research source If this is something you forget often, try setting a timer or alarm on your phone for the end of the washing cycle."

      "title": "Check the care label to follow any specific guidelines for washing.",
      "content": "Check the care label to follow any specific guidelines for washing. Depending on the type of denim you’re working with, you may need to hand wash your jeans or only use cold water. The care label will let you know what the makers recommend. [10] X Research source If the label shows a washing symbol with a hand over it, that means to hand wash the jeans."

      "title": "Turn your jeans inside out before washing them to help preserve their color.",
      "content": "Turn your jeans inside out before washing them to help preserve their color. This also helps your jeans get as clean as possible because the inside is where most of the bacteria and dead skin cells are located. It only takes a minute to do and can make a big difference in the long-term quality of your jeans. [11] X Research source The bulk of the agitation from the washing process will occur on the inside of the jeans, which will get them clean while protecting the exterior."

    {
      "title": "Use the washing machine on the lowest setting with cool water.",
      "content": "Use the washing machine on the lowest setting with cool water. If your jeans can go in the washer, it’s best to put them in along with other jeans or clothes that are the same color (either dark or light). You could also just wash them on their own. Low-agitation and cold water will preserve the quality of your jeans the best. [12] X Research source Check that you’re using the right amount of detergent for the size of the load. Using too much or too little detergent can actually contribute to your jeans smelling funky."

      "title": "Wash your jeans by hand if indicated on the care label.",
      "content": "Wash your jeans by hand if indicated on the care label. Fill a tub, utility sink, or large basin with lukewarm water. Add a small amount of liquid detergent and swish the water around so it gets soapy. Add your jeans to the water and move them back and forth so they get saturated. Let them soak for about an hour, drain the water, and then rinse the jeans with cool water. Gently squeeze the jeans to remove excess water and then hang them to dry. Don’t twist or wring out your jeans, as that could damage the fibers. You can also wash your jeans by hand even if the label says they can go in the washer. It’s totally up to you!"

      "title": "Hang your jeans to dry so that they don’t get damaged in the dryer.",
      "content": "Hang your jeans to dry so that they don’t get damaged in the dryer. High heat and excessive tumbling can stretch the fibers of the denim, causing them to wear down much faster than they would otherwise. It can also shrink your jeans—they’d most likely stretch back out after wearing them for a few hours, but that puts more strain on them, too. Hang them on a laundry line until they’re completely dry. [13] X Research source If you want to use your dryer, try setting it for just 30 minutes on the lowest-heat setting and then hang the jeans to dry the rest of the way. This will speed up the drying process while minimizing any potential damage."
