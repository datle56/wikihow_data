Roll your neck around clockwise five times, then counter-clockwise for a simple neck stretch. Wrap each arm around your body as if you were giving yourself a hug. With your other arm, hold it in place for a count of 15, then repeat with the other arm."

      "content": "Stick your tongue out as far as it will go. If you've got the right build for it, you should be able to stretch your tongue to your elbow in this position. If at this point, you can't touch your tongue to your elbow, stop. This stretch will get your elbow as close as possible to your mouth as possible. If you can't, it's because your upper arm is too long and no amount of stretching will make it happen. Don't risk hyperextending your shoulder by yanking on it too hard."

It's not guarantee that you can make your tongue longer, but there are some proven techniques that work to strengthen the muscle of your tongue, making it stronger and possibly bigger. Press the tip of your tongue behind your lower front teeth and roll the middle and back of your tongue forward. Smile in this position to stretch your tongue. Try to make space in the back of your mouth and in your throat, so that your tongue can move easily, rolling slowly out and relaxing slowly back in. [1] X Research source"

If you have tight muscles, you won't be able to do this, even if your arm is the proper length and you've got a Gene Simmons tongue. Bring your arm over your head, putting one wrist on the top of your head. Grab your elbow with your other hand, pulling toward the opposite side. Hold this position gently until a count of 15 and then alternate arms. Clasp hands behind your back and straighten your elbows slowly and repeatedly. Be gentle in this position, and go slowly. Try a set of 20."
