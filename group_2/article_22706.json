      "title": "Stand close to the ball so you can swing straight down at it.",
      "content": "Stand close to the ball so you can swing straight down at it. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with the ball just slightly in front of the line where your toes are. In general, a good position is 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) closer to the ball than you'd normally stand. This should give you a nice, vertical swing plane to lift the ball up. [1] X Research source If you want to test your ball positioning, take a slow practice swing. Find the ball position that lets you keep the club as straight as possible. If you’re too far away from the ball, your swing plane will be more horizontal. This will keep the ball low and hit it off to the sides."

      "content": "Position the ball closer to your front foot. First, position the ball right in the middle of your legs. [2] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview. 24 March 2022. Then move it forward 1-2 ball lengths, closer to your front foot. This helps you hit the ball in the ideal spot to send it flying high. [3] X Research source Don’t put the ball any more than 1-2 ball lengths towards your front foot. Otherwise, you’ll hit it on the top and it won’t go very high."

      "content": "Put the ball on a tee to raise it up about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm). If you don’t normally use a tee, then give it a try. The tee lifts the ball off the ground a bit and lets you get under it for a higher trajectory. [4] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview. 24 March 2022. A common height for the golf tee is 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm), but teeing the ball at 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) will give you a higher shot. [5] X Research source The legal tee height for golf is up to 4 in (10 cm), so don't go above that when you're practicing. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Bend your knees slightly so you can get underneath the ball.",
      "content": "Bend your knees slightly so you can get underneath the ball. Standing straight up makes it harder to get under the ball for a high shot. Bend your knees slightly before you start your backswing. This way, you’ll get under the ball for a higher trajectory. [7] X Research source You might have to adjust your ball position again after you bend your knees, since your club might scrape the ground. Do another slow practice swing to make sure you can keep the club as straight as possible without hitting the ground."

      "title": "Raise your front shoulder a bit higher than your back shoulder.",
      "content": "Raise your front shoulder a bit higher than your back shoulder. Tilt your front shoulder up a bit to move your head and center of gravity back. This keeps you behind the ball and gives you more lift. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Tilt the club head slightly away from you, towards the ball's outside edge. This gives you more lift and height at impact. If you're right-handed, open the clubface by aiming slightly to the right of your target. If you're left-handed, aim to the left instead. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Grip the club loosely and stay loose throughout your swing.",
      "content": "Grip the club loosely and stay loose throughout your swing. It’s harder to get under the ball if you’re stiff, so don’t squeeze the handle. [10] X Research source Position your hands slightly ahead of the ball on impact to gain more height. [11] X Research source If you’re worried about the club flying out of your hands, use good-quality gloves with a strong grip."

      "content": "Shift 60% of your weight to your rear leg before your backswing. Get set up and stand with roughly 60% of your weight on your rear foot and 40% on your front foot. This helps you stay behind the ball throughout your swing and lift it higher. [12] X Research source Don't throw all your weight forward when you swing. Maintain this weight distribution through the whole swing for a high shot. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Rotate your hip and shoulder back to generate power.",
      "content": "Rotate your hip and shoulder back to generate power. You’ll need a lot of power to hit the ball high, and that power comes from your body. Start your backswing by turning your rear hip and shoulder back, away from your target. Then, raise your club up, following your shoulder and hip. [14] X Research source Avoid sliding your hips back and forth during your swing. This won’t give you any power and it throws your swing off. Be sure to actually your hips and shoulder back to get more power."

      "title": "Bring your hands up behind your head on the backswing.",
      "content": "Bring your hands up behind your head on the backswing. This high backswing helps you keep the club straight and maintain a vertical swing. If your hands are lower, like around your shoulders, you probably won’t get a high shot. [15] X Research source If you can’t tell where your hands are going on your backswing, have someone watch and tell you. You could also put a camera behind you during your swing and review the video later."

[16] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview. 24 March 2022. Rotate your hips and shoulders forward, with the club following. This gives you a hard, fast swing so you can hit the ball with a lot of force. [17] X Research source When your swing is complete, your rear hip and shoulder should be facing your target. This is how you know you swung enough. Keep your head back behind the ball while you're swinging. This gets a lot of weight behind the ball for more lift and power."

      "content": "Hit the golf ball right in the center for a strong shot. You might think you need to hit the ball in a different spot to send it flying high, but that’s not true. Try to hit it square in the center on your downswing for a strong shot. [18] X Research source If the ball is flying too low, then you may be hitting it above the center. Check your swing trajectory to see where you’re making contact, and adjust your stance or swing if you have to hit the ball lower."

Follow the trajectory of the ball with your head and look upward. Remember to keep about 60% of your weight on your back foot during the whole swing, including the follow-through."
