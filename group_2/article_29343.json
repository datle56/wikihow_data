Stone can be found from Y-level 0 and above and is mined with a wooden pickaxe or better. Open a furnace and put cobblestone in the top slot, a fuel source like coal in the bottom slot, and wait for it to smelt into stone, which will appear in the rightmost slot. [1] X Research source You can also use a silk touch enchanted pickaxe to mine stone directly without it turning into cobblestone. Stone blocks can also be found in chests in villages.

[6] X Research source Gold ore can be mined using an iron pickaxe or better. Once you have gold ore or raw gold, which is dropped from gold ore when mined, smelt the gold . Pre-1.18, Y-level 28 is where you'll find the most gold. In 1.18 and above, Y-level -16 is where gold is most abundant. Gold ore is most commonly found in Mesa biomes, where it can be found from Y-levels 32-79 pre-1.18 and 32-256 in 1.18 and above. Gold ingots can be found in chests in dungeons, mineshafts, bastions, desert temples, end cities, jungle temples, nether fortresses, ruined portals, shipwrecks, strongholds, villages, woodland mansions, and in buried treasure chests.

Ancient debris attempts to generate twice in a chunk, once from levels 8-22 and again from levels 8-119. It can be most commonly found at Y-level 15. [10] X Research source A common strategy for mining ancient debris is to mine down to Y-level 15, mine a long tunnel, mine off sideways in branches, and then place beds and use them to explode a large area. Beds in the nether explode when you try to sleep in them, so they can be used as a cheap way to blast mine. However, you can take a lot of damage from doing this, so wear good armor and bring food and/or healing potions. Ancient debris can also be found in chests in bastions.
