It may not completely eliminate the noise, but some tranquil ocean or rainfall sounds can really help you stay calm. If your neighbors' dog is barking into the night, turn on the white noise machine to help you get some sleep and relax. [3] X Research source This is also a good option if you're not a fan of wearing earplugs while you sleep. If your neighbors have a noisy dog, you're not alone!

Invest in some furniture, like a couch, shelves, and a bed frame, to help block the sound. It'll be nice to enjoy some newfound peace and quiet on a brand new (or gently used) couch! [6] X Research source Furnish your house with upholstered furniture to really cut down on the noise. The fabric and stuffing are able to absorb more sound than wood furniture.

      "content": "Put up signs in your yard. If you’re tired of dealing with pets or people on your property, get some signs that send a message. Invest in a \"No Dog Poop\" sign to get the message across without having to talk to your neighbors about their dogs directly. If your neighbors themselves are the problem, invest in a \"No Trespassing\" sign .

      "content": "Set up camera surveillance. Consider setting up a camera to monitor your surroundings, which can give you some peace of mind. A Ring camera can let you know if and when your neighbors start poking around, whether it be with their pets, whenever you get a package delivered, or if they’re engaging in other similar snoopy behaviors. You can pair your camera with a sign that says “Recording in Progress.” While this course of action won’t necessarily help tune out your neighbors, it will keep them on their toes and hopefully away from you."

      "title": "Talk to them directly if the issue can't be ignored.",
      "content": "Talk to them directly if the issue can't be ignored. Knock on their door and respectfully bring up the problem. Talk to them about what's upsetting you in a compassionate, understanding way. Listen to their point of view, and try to come up with a solution that you both feel good about. [9] X Research source Maybe your neighbor frequently walks onto your property or lets their dogs play and use the bathroom in your yard. Address the issue respectfully and walk the property line together to determine where their yard ends and yours begins. Etiquette coach Tami Claytor suggests using the following template: ”Hi [name]. We've been neighbors for [amount of time]. I’m sorry, but last night, I couldn't fall asleep. I know you guys were having a good time, but I do have to get up early in the morning. So, I was just wondering if you could keep the volume down when it gets to be late.” She adds, “Just be soft spoken and ask. I wouldn't go with a confrontational attitude.” If you're nervous about meeting them in person, leave a note with your name and contact information on their door. Don't leave an anonymous note, as this can come off as passive-aggressive and may make things worse. Reader Poll: We asked 222 wikiHow readers if they liked to befriend their neighbors, and 73% of them said no. [Take Poll] However, if you already have a friendly relationship, it may be easier to ask them to keep it down."

      "content": "File a complaint if nothing else works. If you're concerned about safety, this may be your best option. It's possible that your neighbors won't be receptive to your requests. If that's the case, your next step is to call your local homeowners' association (HOA) or your apartment manager if you live in an apartment. They can help mediate the issue. [10] X Research source If further escalation is needed, file a complaint with your municipality online or by calling the non-emergency number in your state. Make sure you're familiar with the noise ordinances in your city, as what counts as a noise violation differs depending on where you live. [11] X Research source It’s important that you make an effort to talk to your neighbors first, as getting the city involved can potentially escalate the issue or put your neighbors at risk."
