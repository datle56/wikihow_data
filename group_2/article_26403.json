[1] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 27 May 2021. Clothes should not be tight because this creates and emphasizes the appearance of fat rolls. Clothes should also not be too loose, because the added bulk and hiding of your form will only make it look like you've got more under there than you do. Instead, just wear clothes that fit: your clothes should lightly hug your form without squeezing. This goes for underclothes too. You want to wear underwear and bras that fit. Many women, for example, wear a bra that is the wrong size. Underwear should not bite into your hips, and bras should keep your chest supported and firmly in place without creating rolls at your sides or causing your breasts to spill out over the edge of your bra."

      "content": "Wear items that draw in at your waist. An easy clothing fix to make you look instantly thinner is to draw attention to your natural waist. [2] X Research source This is the part of your waist that is thinnest. Choose fitted shirts that nip in at the waist and styles that include belts, patterns, texture, or stitching that draws in your eye at the waist.

      "content": "Tailor your cut-off lines. You can create a lot of illusions regarding your size by tailoring where you're visually cut off. The hemline of skirts, jackets, shirts, and other pieces of clothing can all change how you look. Generally, you want crisp lines at your hips or chest and waist, and keep cut-off lines and outlines as close to those spots as possible. For example, you'll want to avoid the clich√©d \"tourist\" clothes, since most of these add bulk and bad lines: capris, calf-length skirts, and long, baggy shorts will do you no favors. Straight leg, boot-cut jeans are the best choice for creating good lines. Women can also wear A-line skirts that hit at the knee or just above."

Avoid taking photos from too high above you, however. This will give the clear \"selfie\" look, and people will think you're trying too hard."
