      "content": "You’ll have a better chance of meeting someone if you’re out and about. If you’re old enough, you could try going to a bar or a club. If that isn’t really your scene, hit up a coffee shop or a bookstore nearby. [1] X Research source You could also try joining a book club or a hobby club to meet people interested in the same things as you."

      "content": "Your loved ones might know someone else who is single. If you feel comfortable, you can ask them to pass on your name or number and potentially set up a date. Your friends and family probably know you well, so they should be able to pick someone who is right for you. [2] X Research source Setups like this are often called “blind dates,” and they can be a little nerve wracking. However, they’re a great way to guarantee a date!"

      "content": "Pick a good opening line to keep your potential date’s interest. Try looking for something around you that you could talk about, like books in a book store or produce in a supermarket. It doesn’t have to be groundbreaking; just something that you two can talk about for a few minutes. [3] X Research source For example, if you are in a supermarket, you might say, “Those new bakery cookies look good. Have you tried them yet?” Or, if you’re in a bookstore, you can ask, “Have you read that book yet? The reviews say it’s great!” Stay away from pickup lines, as they can be a little off putting."

      "content": "Show the person that you’re interested before you even start talking. Stand up straight, push your shoulders back, smile, and make eye contact to show that you’re really listening. Try standing a little closer to them than you would with anyone else to show that you’re interested in them. [4] X Research source Occasionally, you can tip your head to the side or nod to show interest. Speak slowly and confidently."

      "content": "Strike up a conversation with someone you're interested in. Listen and pay attention to what your potential date is saying, and start the conversation off slowly. Look for details that you can use to keep the conversation going. [5] X Research source For example, if they say they haven’t tried something because they’re vegan, ask them how long they’ve been avoiding meat. Or, if they’re interested in the same book as you, talk about other books the author has written or novels that you’ve liked in the past.

Just tell them that you think they’re interesting and you’d like to meet up again. Try something like: [7] X Research source “I know we just met, but you seem really cool. I’d love to get to know you a little better.” “Are you free this weekend? I had a really nice time chatting with you, I’d love to continue this over dinner.”"

      "content": "Learn more about what they like to do for fun, then ask them out. People are usually more comfortable with their own plans, and they might be more likely to agree if they suggest something. For example, you could say: [8] X Research source “Know any good restaurants nearby?” When your date lists one, say “Sounds good! We should go there sometime.” “What’s your favorite place to get a drink around here?” After your date says the name of their favorite bar, say, “That place sounds cool. Want to grab a drink there tonight?”"

Say something like, “I bet you can’t come up with a better date than I can.” When they explain their date idea, change your mind and say, “Okay, you win. Let’s do that.” [9] X Research source This is a fun, flirty way to ask for a date that isn’t super serious. It can help put your potential date at ease if they’re not so sure about you."
