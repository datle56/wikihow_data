For this kind of mobile you will need a metal hoop or ring, about 10 inches in diameter, several different colors of felt and/or fabric, strong thread, cotton balls or batting, and yarn. The felt, fabric, yarn, and thread, can be in any colors you want. For this project you will also need a pair of scissors and a needle. You can choose to use hot glue or tacky glue if you aren't comfortable with your sewing skills."

Start by tying a bow when you first begin to wrap your yarn. After you have wrapped the entire hoop, untie the first bow that you made, and then tie it in a knot with the other end of the yarn. Cut any remaining yarn. [1] X Research source It could be fun to wrap the hoop in a brightly colored yarn, or you can keep it simple by wrapping it in a white yarn. Make sure that you keep the yarn tight together as you wrap it so that none of the metal will show through. You'll want to give yourself a good thirty minutes to do this, and try to do it in one setting so the yarn doesn't unravel."

      "content": "Create your fabric/felt shapes. Here you have lots of room to create whatever shapes you like and be creative. Cut your fabric or felt out in your desired shapes, making sure to cut two of each shape so you can sew them together. You can make as many shapes as you want, but a good start is making at least three shapes, with two cut-outs of each shape. To come up with shape ideas, think about the theme of your baby's room. Maybe you want to make little clouds, flowers, hot air balloons, dinosaurs, or stars. Use your creativity to make different shapes suited for your baby. If you aren't sure what to make or you need help creating the shapes, you can find pictures of the shapes online, print them out, and then trace them onto your felt or fabric."

Flip your pieces around so that their fronts are against each other, and then match the pieces of fabric or felt up so that they are lined up together. Begin by sewing around your shape until you have about an inch left of fabric to sew. Then, turn your fabric right side out. You can sew your shapes with a needle and thread, or you can use a yarn needle and your yarn for a thicker seam. It's your personal preference what kind of seam you want. A yarn seam can be a really cute addition to a baby mobile, especially if you have used felt fabric, but a regular thread stitch looks great too. If you sew with yarn, you'll want to match the shapes with their right side out, because you won't be flipping them once you have sewn. The yarn stitch will be outside of the fabric instead of inside the fabric."

You can cut your thread equal lengths, or you can cut them in different lengths so that some shapes hang down lower than others. Make sure you use light weight thread here as your shapes may not be heavy enough to pull down heavy thread. You can also use fishing line here if you want your connections to be less noticeable. Whatever connection you choose to use, make sure you cut pieces that are longer than your desired length, as you'll need some extra thread to sew into your shapes. To figure out the length of your thread you may try holding your mobile up above your crib or in your baby's room, and then holding the shapes underneath it at your desired length. Then, cut a piece of thread for each shape that is long enough to connect the shape to your hoop, with a few extra inches for sewing."

Make sure to start sewing the thread into the side of your shape, and then finish once you have reached the middle, top of your piece. This will ensure that your shape hangs straight. Once you have reached the middle of your shape, tie a knot in the thread but don't cut it. You can also sew a line straight down the middle your shape. Start the thread in the middle, center of your shape and sew a line upwards, to the top middle of your shape. This could be a good idea if the color thread you are using is the same as the color of the shape."

You will then lay the colored circles in rows across the columns until you have used all of the circles. Your columns will not be an even length, but this will make your mobile look more fun. First, lay the color #1 circles in two rows with an inch between each row. You will have two rows of the same color with 11 circles in each row and two circles in each column. On the third row, you will start by laying your color #2 circles, alternating between sizes. In your first column, lay one of the two-inch circles. In the second column, lay a 1.6 inch circle and underneath that in a fourth row lay your two inch circle. In the next column, lay the two-inch circle, and in the fourth column, repeat the second column (lay a 1.6 inch circle and below that, lay a two-inch circle). Continue to alternate these until you have used all of that color. For the third color, you can begin to place the circles out randomly. For example, on column one you can use two circles, on column two you can use two circles, and then on column three you can use one circle. Place the circles in these columns with one inch separating them, but have fun in placing them randomly. There doesn't have to be a specific order, and it's okay if on one column you already have a ton of circles and on another you only have three or four. You will fill in the gaps with the remaining colors."

It looks best if you place all of one color at once, meaning you don't place color #3, then #4, then #3 again in the same column. Try to group the colors together when you place them. After you have placed all of your colors, you can go back and make the changes you want. Your columns should be all relatively even, with only one or two circles difference between the column length. You don't want one column to have 5 circles and another column to have 15, so make sure that they are somewhat close to the same length. They don't have to be perfect, though, meaning the space between your circles doesn't have to be the exact same length. Sometimes it looks better if it looks like you didn't try to make the space perfect -- then it looks like the randomness was intentional."

Then, place the yarn along the circles and begin to glue each circle to the yarn. Make sure you glue the yarn to the entire diameter of the circle so that the circle doesn't bend over. This is the step where it may look better if you use a sewing machine. If you choose to take on that task, use thread instead of yarn and push each circle through your machine. To use your machine simply place a circle under the presser foot, sew it, and then pull the thread some before you place your next circle down. Don't stop your machine between each circle. You won't need any special thread or needles -- so it can make this project much easier by using a sewing machine.

Your ribbon might look better if you cut different lengths, so you can vary each length of ribbon by one or two inches. [4] X Research source To figure out how much ribbon you will need, place your embroidery hoop on the floor. Then, take a piece of ribbon and place it over the hoop.
