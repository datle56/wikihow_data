      "title": "Twist the tail ends of the wristband into a super tight coil.",
      "content": "Twist the tail ends of the wristband into a super tight coil. Try to make the coil as thin and tight as you can—the thinner the twist, the easier it will be to adjust the fastener. [1] X Research source Wristband fasteners have tiny “teeth” that lock the plastic in place on the fabric; by making the fabric smaller and thinner, you basically “unlock” the fastener and make it possible to move around. [2] X Research source Ask a friend to help you out with this, if you can. Doing this by yourself can be a little tricky! This method only works with plastic fasteners."

      "content": "Grip the fastener with your fingers while holding the band in your fist. Using your free hand, place the coiled band's tail end against your palm. Hold it in place with your pinky and ring fingers. Then, use your free fingers (your pointer, middle, and thumb) to grip the bracelet's fastener. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Slide the fastener along the coil until the wristband is completely loosened.",
      "content": "Slide the fastener along the coil until the wristband is completely loosened. Tug on the fastener in a firm, quick motion. If you’ve twisted your wristband tightly enough, the plastic fastener will slide right off. [4] X Research source Don’t be discouraged if this doesn’t work on the first try. If your fastener refuses to budge, try twisting your wristband a little more tightly."

      "title": "Slide the handles of a plastic bag through the open part of your wristband.",
      "content": "Slide the handles of a plastic bag through the open part of your wristband. Grab a basic plastic bag (like the kind you’d get at the grocery store) and slip 1 of the looped handles through the gap between your wrist and the wristband. Then, slide the other handle (and the rest of plastic) through the perimeter of your wristband. The bag should fit around your hand like a glove, with the wristband sitting on top of the plastic. This method works for both plastic and metal wristband fasteners."

    {
      "title": "Slip your hand further into the bag and pull on the extra plastic.",
      "content": "Slip your hand further into the bag and pull on the extra plastic. Push your fist down to the very end of the plastic bag and make sure the whole bag is threaded through your wristband. Then, tug on the handles and other sections of plastic to make the bag really snug and taut around your fist. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Flip the bag over the wristband and pull it off of your hand.",
      "content": "Flip the bag over the wristband and pull it off of your hand. Invert the handles and bottom sections of plastic that are peeking out beneath your wristband, creating a cone of plastic over your wristband and fist. Then, pull down on the inverted sections of plastic—the momentum will help loosen the wristband and force it off of your wrist. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make 1 vertical cut all the way through your small straw piece. Snip all the way from the top to the bottom of your small staw piece—so your cut will be 1 to 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (2.5 to 3.8 cm) long. Now your straw piece should have an opening and 2 flaps. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Line up the straw so it sits on the band just below the plastic fastener.",
      "content": "Line up the straw so it sits on the band just below the plastic fastener. Open up the straw piece and lay the straw flaps over both sides of the bracelet's tail. Nudge it down the band until the straw piece is completely flush with the end of the plastic fastener. [10] X Research source You can also wrap a long section of clear tape around the wristband instead of using a straw—it’ll have the same effect."

      "title": "Feed the fastener onto the straw.",
      "content": "Feed the fastener onto the straw. As you do this, inspect the fastener to make sure that the teeth are pressing onto the straw, not the bracelet's fabric. You might need to wiggle the fastener back and forth to get it completely on top of the straw piece. [11] X Research source"
