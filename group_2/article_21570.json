In Arabic, “habibti” (pronounced ha-BEEB-tee) is a term of endearment that means “my love,” “my dear,” or “my darling.” It is used to address women and girls. “Habibti” stems from the Arabic word “habib,” which translates to “dear” or “beloved.” [1] X Research source Example: “As-Salaam-Alaikum habibti! How are you doing today?” Example: “Have a wonderful day, habibti!”"

      "content": "Use “habibti” to lovingly address your female friends, family, and loved ones. Habibti is used as a pet name to refer to women. To greet the women in your life with love and endearment, use “habibti.” You can use it with friends, family members, and the special lady in your life. The weight of the term depends on who’s being addressed. For example, using “habibti” during a loving moment with your wife will be more impactful than using it in casual conversation with friends. [2] X Research source Loving Example: “Habibti, your eyes melt through my heart and enlighten my soul. You are my one, true love.” Friendly Example: “Come on, habibti! We’ve got a reservation at Al-Diar tonight!”"

      "content": "Don’t use “habibti” with a higher up or someone you don’t know. Only say “habibti” to a woman if she’s a relative or good friend. Using “habibti” with a woman you are unfamiliar with can come off as disrespectful or misogynistic. Using “habibti” to refer to a manager or professional acquaintance is also disrespectful, as you are expected to be formal in the workplace. Don’t use “habibti” to refer to men, either, as they may take offense to the term."

[3] X Research source For example, “habibi” can be used to refer to the clerk of the corner store you regularly attend, family friends, or even your pets, no matter their gender. ”Habibti” is typically used to refer to female friends, family members, or other loved ones."
