      "content": "Attach weights to your ankles to improve your strength while jumping. Start off with light weights, such as 1–1.5 pounds (450–680 g) ones. Secure the weights onto each ankle before you jump, jumping 5-10 times with the weights on. The weights will make your legs feel heavier than they actually are, strengthening your legs and ankles so that you jump higher once you remove the weights. Only attach weights to your ankles once you've mastered the specific type of jump you're doing. Be aware that ankle weights increase your risk of injury and may put more stress on your joints and muscles."

Do a certain number of each jump before immediately starting on the next jump For example, your drill might consist of 5 toe touches, 5 pikes, 5 hurdlers, 5 tucks, and 5 T jumps. Practice using the right arm movements for each jump, such as positioning your arms in a high V at the beginning of T jumps."
