Instead of rising back up slowly, though, jump from squatting position and try to turn 180 degrees. Come down from the jump in another squat––don't try to land standing straight up. Repeat, changing directions when you jump. For instance, turn to the right the first time, then turn to the left, and so on. [3] X Research source Do 3 sets of 5 until it feels easy, then increase to 3 sets of 8."

Jump on a firm surface, such as hardwood floor, where there’ll be plenty of room over your head for the rope. Jump for ten minutes per day. If you can’t do it all at once, you can break it up into two to three minute jumping segments, broken up by resting periods and/or other exercises. [6] X Research source Don't \"skip\" rope, where you essentially jump with one foot in a sort of running-in-place motion. Instead, try to keep your ankles together as you jump with both feet at the same time. As you improve, jump faster. You might start out moving the rope slowly, taking a small hop between jumps to maintain your balance. When you're ready, move the rope more quickly and get rid of the balance hop."
