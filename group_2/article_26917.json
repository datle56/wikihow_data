      "content": "Pour 1 tbsp (19 g) of salt and 3 tbsp (43 g) of Borax into the water. Treating wicks with Borax can help candles burn brighter, longer, and reduce the amount of ash and smoke produced from the wick. Turn off the heat and add 1 tablespoon (19 g) of salt and 3 tablespoons (43 g) of Borax to the hot water. Then, mix the solution with a spoon to fully dissolve the salt and Borax. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to use Borax, simply dissolve the salt in hot water. Or, skip making a solution altogether and dip your twine in the melted wax as described in the steps below. Keep Borax away from pets and children. Borax, or sodium borate, can be an irritant when it’s inhaled, with some people experiencing coughing, sore throat, and shortness of breath after breathing it in. It can also irritate your skin, so wear gloves when handling it. It is also considered toxic when it’s ingested.

      "content": "Cut your cotton twine and soak it in the solution for 24 hours. Take a piece of heavy cotton butcher's twine and trim it so it’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) taller than your candle container. Then, submerge it in the Borax solution. Set your pan in a safe location where it won’t be disturbed and let the twine soak for 24 hours. [4] X Research source If you don't know how tall your candle will be, soak up to 1 foot (30.5 cm) of twine and trim it down to size later. Almost any cotton cord like string, embroidery floss, torn pieces of cotton cloth, clean mop strings, and a clean shoelace will work in place of butcher’s twine. Linen, hemp, and jute twine are great alternatives to cotton twine, too. [5] X Research source If you’re feeling really crafty, use cotton balls or waxed dental floss! Grab a piece of cotton and twist it as you pull it out of the ball. [6] X Research source With floss, braid several strands together to make a thick wick."

      "content": "Hang the twine to dry for 2 to 3 days. Using tweezers or tongs, remove the twine from the Borax solution. Then, use a clothespin, clip, or hanger to hang the treated twine in a warm, dry location for 2 to 3 days. Place aluminum foil beneath the twine to catch any excess solution as it drips off. [7] X Research source It’s normal for crystals to form on the twine in the solution, so just wipe them off with a gloved hand."

Simply fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5 cm) of water and set a smaller pan or heat-safe bowl on top of it. Place your wax chunks in the bowl and heat the saucepan over medium heat until the water is simmering. [8] X Research source Wear oven mitts or thick gloves when handling melted wax. It becomes very hot and can potentially burn you if it accidentally drips onto your skin."

This is optional, but creates a stiffer wick that can make it easier to insert in the candle. [11] X Research source If you don't have enough wax to dip the string again, lay the wick on a sheet of aluminum foil and carefully pour the remaining wax on top. Let the wick dry on the foil instead of hanging it again."

[13] X Research source Both round and flat balsa wood strips work as a wick. Just make sure they’re about ½ to 1½ inches (1.25-3.75 cm) wide. Wooden dowels and thin strips of untreated wood like oak, cherry, and birch make great alternatives to balsa wood. [14] X Research source If you don’t know how large your candle will be, cut the wood down to a length between 6 to 12 inches (15.25-30.5 cm) long. You can always cut it down later, so it's better to have too much than too little."

Just place the trimmed balsa wood into a shallow dish. Then, pour enough room-temperature olive oil into the dish to completely cover the wood. Let it soak for 20 minutes to 1 hour. As an alternative to olive oil, use coconut oil, avocado oil, or palm oil. These oils burn cleanly like olive oil."

Once the excess oil is removed, the wood should feel slightly damp and oily to the touch, but not so oily that it leaves residue on your hands. [15] X Research source Instead of rubbing the wick dry, just place it on a plate covered with paper towels to let it air dry for several minutes."

Pour about 2 inches (5 cm) of water into a larger saucepan and heat it to a simmer over medium heat. To melt the wax , place the bowl of wax over the large saucepan. This type of wick just rests on the top of a candle–it is not inserted in the wax. As the wick burns, it melts the wax and creates a pool that the wick floats on top of. If you don’t want to use new wax, use the wax from old candles . Just break the wax into small chunks so that it melts quicker."
