      "content": "Note the prescribed amount. Before injecting heparin, you need to make a good note of the amount of the drug you need to inject. This is important, as too little of the medication won't have the desired effect and too much could hurt you. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source It is best to write down the amount of heparin you need to inject so you'll know how much you need to fill your syringe with."

Then, pull the plunger back to the point specified by the prescription. [10] X Research source Make sure the liquid covers the needle tip or you will pull back air rather than the medication. Review the dosage amount with the doctor or nurse before leaving with your prescription. Make sure not to fill the syringe with any more or any less of the medicine than the doctor has recommended."

You can inject it into your abdomen, thighs, or the outer deltoid area of your upper arm. Ultimately, the site of injection is up to you. To decide, you may want to consider the discomfort involved and possible bruising. [12] X Research source Don't give yourself a shot into any area of your body that is bruised, swollen, or tender. Don't give your heparin shot within 1 inch (2.54 cm) of a scar or 2 inches (5.08 cm) of your bellybutton."
