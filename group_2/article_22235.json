According to modeling agent Traci Halvorson, the key to a beautiful smile is to “be alive in your eyes.” [1] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 28 May 2021. Start with a relaxed face, then squint slightly to lift the corners of your eyes. Follow up by lifting the corners of your mouth to smize . You’ll know you’re doing it right if you cover your mouth and it still looks like you’re smiling. [2] X Research source Smiling with your eyes is also known as the Duchenne smile. It involves contracting the muscles around your cheekbones and upper lip to create a beautiful, genuine smile. [3] X Research source Narrowing your eyes might seem counterintuitive to a good smile, but it actually isn’t!

      "content": "A funny memory can help your smile look more friendly and natural. Think about the last time you were laughing with a friend or cracking up at your favorite TV show. Chances are, that smile lit up your whole face—your eyes were crinkling, your cheekbones were lifted, and those telltale smile lines were curving from your nose to your lips. Picture that same funny moment whenever you’re about to take a picture. You'll end up with a smile that’s beautiful and authentic. [4] X Research source On the flip side, look up a picture of two celebrities or politicians meeting on camera. Their smiles are probably tense, forced, and the exact opposite of what you want to go for."

      "content": "Don’t let your top and bottom teeth touch each other when smiling. Leave a tiny gap of space between your upper and lower rows of teeth for a natural smile.

      "content": "Wetting your teeth with your tongue can add some shine to your smile. As you’re getting in position for your photo, quickly slide your tongue over your upper and lower rows of teeth. A quick coat of saliva helps your teeth look bright and polished, which takes your smile to new, beautiful heights. Petroleum jelly can also do the trick—just rub a little bit over the front of your teeth to give them an extra sheen. Just be sure not to swallow it!"
