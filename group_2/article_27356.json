      "content": "Cut three strips of fabric approximately 4 inches wide from the longest edge of your material. These strips will become the straps that secure the samurai pants. Each fabric strip should be long enough to go around the intended wearer's waist with 8-10\" (20-25 cm) to spare."

      "content": "Form two tubes - one long, one short. Fold each strip in half lengthwise and pin, then sew a seam along the unfinished edges to create two tubes. Turn both tubes inside out so the seam is on the inside with the unfinished edges no longer visible, then set the tubes aside."

      "title": "Cut an area for the crotch.",
      "content": "Cut an area for the crotch. Cut a half \"U\" on the folded side of both leg pieces, starting approximately 1/3 of the way down the pants. Start perpendicular to the fold and curve smoothly to form the bottom of the \"U\". When you come parallel to the fold, run along the parallel line up to the top fabric edge. The inner or middle part of the \"U\" should be facing you. Make sure to cut both leg pieces equally."

Start at the front, then continue along the backside of the hakama pants. For extra durability, sew the top length of the strip to the pants as well. Note : The seam of the tube should be hidden on the underside, against the pant fabric. Terminate the stitching with a rectangle (long edge across the width of the tie). You can stitch an \"X\" within the rectangle to build in long term durability at this strain point."

      "content": "Adjust the length. Try the pants on in order to fit them to your specific leg length, making sure to secure them where they will be worn. Secure the pants by tying the tie strips in front, making sure the fit is comfortable. The ideal pant length is with the bottom hem at the malleolus, or big part of the ankle bone. Cut excess fabric from the bottom cuffs of each leg and hem them to finish your samurai hakama pant look."
