Coaxial (or \"coax\") ports resemble round, metal cylinders with a small hole in the middle, though your TV may just have a small circular hole in its back if it's old enough. [1] X Research source Both your TV and your VHS player must have a coaxial port in order for this method to work. If your TV or your VHS player lacks a coax port, you can still use AV cables to connect your VHS player."

      "content": "Make sure that you have a coaxial cable. Coaxial cables have the same connector on both ends—a hollow metal cylinder with a pin in the middle—and they often have a ring around each end that can be used to tighten the cable's connection to the port. If you don't have a coaxial cable, you can buy one online or in a tech department store."

You can usually tighten the coaxial cable in order to secure its connection to the VHS player. The coaxial port on your VHS will usually have something like \"TO TV\" written below it."

The channel used can vary from TV to TV; once you see your VCR's blue screen, you should be set. For some VCRs, you will need to set the channel on the VCR itself before you can play a tape. To play a VHS tape with your VCR, just insert the tape and press \"Play\" to begin playing it."

The red and white cables are for audio. The yellow cable is for video. If you don't have AV cables, you can buy them online or in a tech department store—they're quite cheap."

If you can find red and white inputs but no yellow input, look for a green input with the word \"Video\" nearby. If your TV has one of these, you can still use AV cables. If your TV doesn't have AV inputs, you will need to buy an RCA-to-HDMI ( not HDMI-to-RCA) adapter and an HDMI cable ."

Plug the white cable into the white port on the back of the VCR, plug the red cable into the red port, and plug the yellow cable into the yellow port.

Make sure that all three of the cables are in the same input area, row, or column. Input areas are usually numbered. If you're using an RCA-to-HDMI adapter, do the following: Plug the AV cables into the colored ports on the adapter, plug one end of the HDMI cable into the RCA adapter, plug the other end into your TV's HDMI port, and plug the adapter's power cable into a power source (e.g., a wall socket)."
