      "title": "Melt the shea butter and coconut oil.",
      "content": "Melt the shea butter and coconut oil. Both shea butter and coconut oil are solid at room temperature, so it's necessary to melt them in order to blend them properly. Measure out 2/3 cup shea butter and 2/3 cup coconut oil. Place the ingredients in a small saucepan. Melt them over low heat, stirring occasionally until they liquify, then remove the pan from heat. If you're using coconut butter in place of shea butter, melt it with the coconut oil. Don't let the ingredients come to a boil; use just enough heat to help them liquify. Boiling the oils will change their texture."

You can combine essential oils to give the cream even more depth. For strongly scented essential oil, use up to 20 drops. Lavender, rose, grapefruit, fir, ginger, vetiver, and peppermint essential oils all make wonderful additions to shaving cream. If you're sensitive to strong smells, add just five drops of oil or leave it out altogether."

Homemade shaving cream will keep for a month or two. If you want to preserve it for longer, try mixing in the contents of one vitamin E capsule; this acts as a natural preservative."
