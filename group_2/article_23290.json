The colors on the first 2 or 3 bands correspond to numbers from 0 to 9, which represent the significant digits of the resistor's ohmic value. The last band gives the multiplier. For example, a resistor with brown, green and green bands is rated at 15 mega-ohms (15,000,000 ohms). The code is as follows: [2] X Research source Black: 0 significant digit, multiplier of 1 Brown: 1 significant digit, multiplier of 10 Red: 2 significant digit, multiplier of 100 Orange: 3 significant digit, multiplier of 1,000 (kilo) Yellow: 4 significant digit, multiplier of 10,000 (10 kilo) Green: 5 significant digit, multiplier of 100,000 (mega) Blue: 6 significant digit, multiplier of 1,000,000 (10 mega) Violet: 7 significant digit Gray: 8 significant digit White: 9 significant digit Gold: multiplier of 1/10 Silver: multiplier of 1/100"
