      "title": "Lock in moisture with conditioner.",
      "content": "Lock in moisture with conditioner. Dry hair, especially curly hair, needs lots of moisture. This is because curly hair tends to be on the drier end of the spectrum compared to straight hair. If you have curly hair or textured hair, moisturizing is the key to preventing frizz when it's humid. [1] X Research source Choose a shampoo and conditioner that is made for curly hair. Some shampoos and conditioners even offer protection against humidity. After shampooing and rinsing your hair, towel dry the excess water from your hair and then apply your conditioner from roots to ends. If you hair is thin, then you may want to apply conditioner from the middle of your hair to the ends and skip the roots. If your hair is thick, then apply the conditioner all over. Then, let the conditioner sit on your hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out."

      "title": "Try deep conditioning your hair.",
      "content": "Try deep conditioning your hair. If you have thick textured hair or really curly hair, then it might help to deep condition your hair. Deep conditioning helps to lock in more moisture than regular conditioning and this may help to prevent your hair from curling up in the humidity. [2] X Research source To deep condition your hair, apply the deep conditioner to your hair and then let it sit for about 5-10 minutes (following the manufacturer's instructions). You can do other things in the shower while you wait, such as shaving and washing your face. If you are just washing your hair, then put a plastic cap over your hair and go about your normal routine until it is time to rinse. You can also warm up your conditioner slightly before you use it. This may help your hair to absorb the moisture better. To heat up your conditioner, place the bottle in a bowl of very warm water and let it sit for about 10 minutes. This should warm up the conditioner and make it easier for your hair to absorb. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Towel-dry excess water from wet hair. Don’t ruffle the cuticle by drying your hair with a towel. [4] X Research source Hair cuticles have lots of ridges. When you rub your hair with a towel, it raises the edges of the hair cuticle, which frizzes your hair. Instead of rubbing, press and squeeze so the towel absorbs the water. Use your hands first to squeeze out as much of the water from your hair as possible. Use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to absorb the excess water."

      "title": "Apply a serum or cream to damp hair.",
      "content": "Apply a serum or cream to damp hair. Anti-frizz serums and creams can help to lock in moisture when you apply it to damp hair. They also help control flyaways because the oils in the products coat your hair, creating a barrier between your hair and the humid air. Use a serum made with natural oils such as a Moroccan oil. Your hair absorbs the products made with natural oils better; they don’t just sit on top of your hair like products made with synthetic oils. [5] X Research source If you have thick hair, dry hair or color-treated hair, then a cream may work better. [6] X Research source If your hair is thinner, then apply it from the mid-length of your hair to the ends. [7] X Research source If you have thicker hair, then you can apply the cream or serum all over, but still focus on the ends of your hair. Straightening balms can also help to straighten curly hair and prevent it from curling up in humid weather. [8] X Research source Look for a straightening balm or cream that offers some protection from the humidity as well. In general, thicker creams will work better. They'll help weigh your hair down and protect it from the humidity for longer throughout the day.

      "content": "Allow your hair to air dry a bit. Don’t immediately blast your hair with a blow dryer. Allow it to air dry at least partially. Allowing your hair to dry slowly and naturally keeps your hair in place instead of blowing it around, which can cause frizziness. If you blow dry without smoothing it out, it also can make your hair look puffy. If you want to blow dry, then let your hair partially dry naturally first. Or, you can let your hair air dry completely."

      "content": "Blow dry with a boar bristle or Denman brush. If you are straightening your hair after letting it air dry, use the blow drier and a brush to seal and smooth the cuticle. [10] X Research source This smooths the cuticle down, while the heat from the blow dryer seals in the moisture and locks it in. If moisture is sealed inside your hair cuticle, it is less likely to attract the moisture in the air and become frizzy. [11] X Research source Blow dry your hair in a downward motion to smooth it out as you go. Brush your hair and move the blow dryer along with the brush in a downward motion. Opt for a boar bristle brush if your hair is fine- to normal-texutred. Boar bristle brushes are made from keratin, which is the same material that your hair is made from. If your hair has a coarse or thick texture, you may benefit from using a Denman brush. While you are blow drying, pay attention to the crown where frizz is really noticeable. If you don’t smooth out your roots, you’ll look like you have a halo of frizz around your head, and it can make your hair look really frizzy. [12] X Research source Make sure your hold your hair taught with the brush as your blow dry the crown of your head."

      "content": "Dry your hair completely. It is important that your hair is completely dry if you’re entering a humid environment. If your hair is damp, it will continue to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, making it appear puffy and frizzy. So, before you go outside in humid weather, make sure that your hair is completely dry. Like the serum, dry hair acts as a barrier between your hair and outside moisture. Even if you air dry, your hair should still be completely dry before leaving the house. Use a cool shot of air on each section of hair that you straighten. If your blow dryer has this button it will blast some cool air on your hair. This closes the cuticle, so it seals in the moisture on your hair."

      "content": "Skip the flat iron on humid days. Flat ironing your hair before you go out into humid weather may increase the chance that it will curl or frizz up. This is because flat ironing can dry out your hair and then it will try to absorb moisture from the environment when you go outside. To avoid this, you may want to consider skipping the flat iron on humid days. [13] X Research source If you do not want to skip the flat iron, then make sure that you use a heat protectant product, such as a straightening balm or cream."

Just in case the humidity does affect your hair, you don’t have to worry about frizz or looking like a “poof ball.” It will be contained.

      "content": "Straighten your hair . Using a straightening treatment such as a Brazilian straightening technique, relaxer, or keratin treatment may help to alter the texture and curl-pattern of your hair. Although all hair types and textures are prone to humidity, changing the texture of your hair permanently or semi-permanently might help to eliminate the degree of frizz on humid days even if it does not eliminate it completely. [17] X Expert Source Shun Pittman Master Cosmetologist, Global Salon Educator & Author Expert Interview. 11 May 2021. However, keep in mind that there’s no guarantee that a straightening treatment will eliminate frizz completely. Moisture makes the hair cuticle bend and curl as it tries to absorb the moisture from the air. This is the case even if your hair has been straightened. Hair that is more fragile and porous, such as curly, wavy, kinky-curly hair and color-treated hair, is especially prone to humidity even if you have straightened it. Generally, drier hair textures are affected the most by humidity because they require the most moisture and your hair will try to get it anywhere it can, even from the air."
