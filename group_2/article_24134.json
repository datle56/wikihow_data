      "content": "Decide how you'll install Wine. Ubuntu recommends that you install the Ubuntu-specific version of Wine straight from their repositories in the Software Center. [1] X Research source But, the developers of Wine recommend that you install the latest version of Wine from their repositories (WineHQ). [2] X Research source So, which should you choose? The Software Center version is always going to be older than the version from WineHQ. However, if you want a simpler install process that doesn't require typing any commands, you can quickly install a stable version of Wine through the Software Center . With this installation method, Wine will only update if there's a newer version available the next time you update Ubuntu itself. You won't be able to update Wine separately. To install the Ubuntu package, just open Software Center, type wine , and click Install . Then, skip down to step 8 to perform the final configuration steps. If you want the latest Wine release with frequent updates, you'll want to install Wine from WineHQ. It's not hard to install, but there are a few more steps than using Software Center. We'll walk you through them!"

If your system doesn't support 32-bit programs, there will be an extra installation step. An easy way to check is to open a Terminal window and run the command lscpu . [3] X Research source Once you run the command, check the value of \"CPU op-mode.\" You'll either see 32-bit, 64-bit, or both."

It also opens a panel that lets you change your Wine preferences. [5] X Research source On the Applications tab, you'll see that Wine can mimic different Windows versions for each application. The default Windows version is Windows 7, but you'll probably want to select a newer version of Windows (such as Windows 10 ). On the Desktop Integration tab, you can choose to add Windows-style theme and link Windows-like folder structure (e.g., Desktop, My Documents) to directories in Ubuntu.
