Making cannabutter is easy, but it is also time consuming and you need a decent amount of marijuana to make it. You will need: [2] X Research source 2 sticks of unsalted butter 1/2 ounce of marijuana (ground and with seeds/stems removed) 1 cup of water"

      "content": "Set up a double-boiler to melt the butter. The double boiler will melt the butter and allow the marijuana to steep without using too much heat. If you have a double boiler , then you can use it. If not, then you can just set one up on your own. [3] X Research source To set up a double boiler, place a large stock pot on your stove and fill it about 1/3 of the way full with water. Then, place a medium sized bowl over the stockpot. The bowl should be large enough to overlap the edges of the stock pot, but small enough so that the bottom of the bowl will be in or near the water. Heating cannabis is necessary to extract the THC and reap the psychoactive effects of the herb. You cannot digest the THC in raw marijuana, so eating raw marijuana would have no effect.

      "title": "Melt the butter in the bowl of the double boiler.",
      "content": "Melt the butter in the bowl of the double boiler. Place your two sticks of butter into the bowl of the double boiler and turn the heat on low to medium. The water will heat up and the steam will cause the butter to melt slowly. Keep the heat low. Do not allow the butter to come to a boil. The THC in cannabis is fat soluble, not water soluble. This means that it is necessary to heat the cannabis in butter or oil to capture the THC for use in baking. If you do not eat dairy and do not want to use butter, then you could use some non-dairy margarine or coconut oil instead."

      "content": "Wrap the marijuana in cheese cloth. While the butter is melting, you can prepare the marijuana. Place a piece of cheese cloth on a clean surface and fold it in half twice. This will help to ensure that no marijuana escapes the cheese cloth. Then place your marijuana on the center of the cheese cloth. [5] X Research source Fold over the shorter edges of the cheese cloth first. Then fold over one of the long edges and roll the marijuana towards the other edge, as if you are rolling a burrito. Use the cooking twine to tie up the burrito. Make sure that you wrap the string around the burrito evenly and secure it well or it might fall apart."

      "content": "Add 1 cup of hot water to the butter. Adding water will help to cover all of the marijuana with liquid and it will also help the marijuana to release its THC. Pour one cup of hot water into the bowl with the butter and marijuana tea bag. [7] X Research source Remember that the THC in marijuana is fat soluble, not water soluble. That means that water alone will not extract much of the THC from your marijuana. The water will just help to heat the marijuana so that the THC can be absorbed by the fat in the butter."

Keep in mind that the longer you steep the marijuana in the butter, the more potent the cannabutter will be. [8] X Research source If you do not want the cannabutter to have too much THC in it, then you might want to stop steeping it at around three to four hours. However, if you want it to be strong, then let it steep for a full six hours."

Then, remove the marijuana teabag from the butter with a slotted metal spoon and set it aside. [10] X Research source You may also want to use a second metal spoon to press the marijuana tea bag and squeeze out any excess liquid from the teabag back into the bowl."

Let the bowl and marijuana butter cool down to room temperature slowly and then transfer the bowl to the refrigerator. [11] X Research source You can leave the butter in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. If you transfer the liquid to a foil pan, then you can easily drain away the water after it cools."

The butter will also have risen to the top of the bowl and the water you added will be at the bottom of the bowl. [12] X Research source Pour out the water and keep the butter. You can use a strainer or just punch a hole in the bottom of your foil pan if you transferred the butter. The butter is now ready to use to make chocolate chip cookies or as a one to one substitute for regular butter in your favorite cookie recipe. For example, if the recipe calls for ½ cup of butter, then replace the butter with ½ cup of cannabutter."

For example, CBD or Cannabidiol and THC are some compounds. THC is a psychoactive compound that makes someone feel high."
