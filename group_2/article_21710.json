Hook a tape measure on a top corner of your window frame and pull it down to the bottom edge of the frame. Then do the same on the other side and in the middle, in case your window is not perfectly square. [3] X Research source If you already have a curtain rod, you only need to measure from the curtain rod to where you want the curtains to end. If you do find that your window is a different length on 1 side, keep the longest measurement."

      "content": "Add 4 in (10 cm) if you are installing a curtain rod. Most curtain rods are hung at least 4 inches (10 cm) above the top of the window frame. You may want to hang yours even higher to give the illusion of height to your windows and make the room seem taller. [4] X Research source Don’t add more than 8 inches (20 cm) to the length, as hanging curtains this high can look awkward. [5] X Research source You may also want to add 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) to your length to make your curtains hang down further below the window frame, which will block more light.

In order to have enough material for the curtains to fold over themselves several times, they should be at least 2.5 times as wide as your frame. [8] X Research source For instance, if your frame is 3 ft (0.91 m) wide, you will want curtains that are 7.5 ft (2.3 m) wide."

If you already have curtains and just want to make them darker, you can purchase blackout liners instead of full curtains. These typically clip on to the inside of the curtains, or have holes that allow them to attach to your current curtain rings. Make sure to get accurate measurements of your existing curtains before you buy liners."

If you want a room to be as dark as possible at night but still sunny during the day, you may want to buy a blackout roller shade instead of curtains. These shades are usually installed without a rod and can be easily rolled up when not in use. You can hang sheer curtains on the same window to use during the day."

      "content": "Make your own blackout curtains if you want to save money. Some fabric companies sell blackout curtain material by the yard. You can also just use a heavy material like velvet or wool, but it won’t be as effective. Buy enough fabric to fit the measurements you took and hem the edges. [13] X Research source To hang the curtain on your rod, make another hem along the top of the curtains that is large enough to slide the rod through. If you don’t like the look of the blackout fabric, you can buy another material as well and use this as the outside of the curtain."

      "content": "Insert plastic wall anchors if your curtain rod came with them. Many curtain rods will come with hollow plastic pegs called wall anchors that can be driven into your wall to hold the screw. This helps keep the weight of the curtain from damaging the wall. Drill or nail a pilot hole in the place where the wall anchor will go. Make sure the hole is not larger than the anchor itself. Use a hammer to gently tap the anchor into the pilot hole."
