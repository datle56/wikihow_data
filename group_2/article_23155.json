      "content": "Write “I love you” as .. ._.. _ _ _ …_ . _._ _ _ _ _ .._ Morse code changes each letter in the alphabet into a series of dots and dashes. In this case, you’re translating the letters I, L, O, V, E, Y, O, and U into Morse code to send to your special someone. Use a Morse code chart to learn the dot and dash combination for each letter. In this case, the letters of “I love you” are the following in Morse code: [1] X Research source I = .. (dot dot) L = ._.. (dot dash dot dot) O = _ _ _ (dash dash dash) V = ..._ (dot dot dot dash) E = . (dot) Y = _._ _ (dash dot dash dash) O = _ _ _ (dash dash dash) U = .._ (dot dot dash)"

If you’re not physically near each other but still want to send a coded message, translate your text into a series of dots and dashes. Or maybe you’re in class or at work and want to pass your partner a note. In that case, physically write out the dots and dashes on a piece of paper. Then just wait to see their reaction!"

      "content": "Tap out your message with your fingers. If you’re near each other, discreetly send your message by tapping out each letter on a table or wall. Use your fingers, a pen, or anything else that will make noise. There are specific rules when it comes to the timing of dots and dashes in Morse code, so use the following rules when tapping out your message: For dots, do a quick tap and pause for 1 second. For dashes, tap and pause for 3 seconds. For example, if you were to tap out the letter A, which is ._ (dot dash), you would tap once and pause for 1 second, then tap again and pause for 3 seconds. When you finish tapping out a letter, pause for 3 seconds. When you finish an entire word, pause for 7 seconds."

Use the flashlight on your phone, a light inside your house, or just a regular old flashlight to send your signal. For the dots, flip the flashlight on for 1 second. For dashes, leave the light on for a full 3 seconds. [2] X Research source Leave the light off for 3 seconds when you finish a letter and 7 seconds when you finish a word."

      "content": "Blink to say “I love you.” If you’re both in an important meeting and can’t be caught passing notes or tapping your fingers, blinking is another creative way to send your Morse code message. Close your eyes for 1 second to represent a dot, then close them for 3 seconds to represent a dash. Keep your eyes open for 3 seconds when you finish a letter and 7 seconds when you complete an entire word."

      "content": "Dots, dashes, and spaces are sent over specific units of time. If you’re sending your message via tapping, blinking, or by flashlight (or any other means that aren’t writing), there are certain rules to keep in mind so that your message is easily understandable. Each symbol and pause is allotted a certain number of units of time. “Units of time” can be seconds, milliseconds, or even shorter depending on how quickly you want to send your message. The important thing is that you’re pausing for the correct amount of time to distinguish letters and words. The rules are as follows: [3] X Research source A dot = 1 unit of time A dash = 3 units of time Pause between dots and dashes = 1 unit of time Pause between letters = 3 units of time Pause between words = 7 units of time"
