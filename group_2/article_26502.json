For breakfast you might have 1/2 grapefruit with a bowl of oatmeal, or you could have a scrambled egg with sauteed vegetables and low fat cheese. For lunch you could have a large salad with lettuce, spinach, beets, carrots, a handful of walnuts, 1/2 avocado , and beans (black or garbanzo). Drizzle a little balsamic vinegar over the top. For dinner you might go for grilled salmon (with a little dill and lemon), a serving of brown rice, and grilled zucchini. If you need a snack, go for protein and a fruit or vegetable. Try a hard-boiled egg and an apple or greek yogurt with blueberries and ground flax seed."
