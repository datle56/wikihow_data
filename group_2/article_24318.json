[1] X Research source When you insult them, take a small amount of time to think about it. Not too much or they'll catch on, but a long pause is just fine. If you're short on ideas use a previous insult and modify it. Chances are, they won't catch it. Take a few deep breaths (draw your breath in noisily if it helps) concentrate on what needs to be said and draw on your pre-rehearsed comebacks (see step 2)."
