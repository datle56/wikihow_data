      "title": "The battery may be bad.",
      "content": "The battery may be bad. The first step when your remote stops working is to swap the battery and see if that fixes the problem. The Hunter fan remote takes CR2032 batteries. [1] X Research source How to Fix It: Slide the back cover off of the remote. Then, use a small and pointy tool like a screwdriver to carefully slide the dead battery out. Insert the new battery with the positive side facing upward, then slide the cover back on."

      "title": "The battery’s contact points may be dirty or corroded.",
      "content": "The battery’s contact points may be dirty or corroded. If the contact points are dirty or corroded, your remote may stop working. After removing the battery, TV mounting service expert Jocotra Cathey says to look for signs of corrosion, like white powder. How to Fix It: To remove corrosion , tap the debris out, dip a cotton swab in white vinegar, and use it to wipe away the corrosion. Pry out the buildup with a screwdriver, if necessary. After removing the corrosion, use isopropyl alcohol to clean away the vinegar’s residue. [2] X Research source Don’t press too hard, so you don’t want to damage any internal components."

      "title": "Your remote may not be in the proper range.",
      "content": "Your remote may not be in the proper range. To work properly, your remote must be within 10-20 ft. (3.048-6.096 m) of the fan. If your remote only works within a very close range, the batteries may need to be replaced. [3] X Research source How to Fix It: Move within 10-20 ft (3.048-6.096 m) of your fan and test the remote. If it doesn’t work, replace the batteries."

      "title": "There may be an issue with your fan’s frequency settings.",
      "content": "There may be an issue with your fan’s frequency settings. Having the correct frequency settings is crucial for your remote to communicate with your fan. If two or more fans are operating within range of each other and are on the same frequency, they won’t be able to operate independently of one another. [4] X Research source How to Fix It: Remove the fan cover to access the canopy underneath, then adjust the dip switches in the canopy and remote to the on or off positions so they match each other.

      "title": "There may be an issue with your remote’s transmitter or your fan’s receiver.",
      "content": "There may be an issue with your remote’s transmitter or your fan’s receiver. A remote can’t operate if the transmitter or receiver is damaged, as they are both responsible for operation. The receiver may be built into the fan or it may be a separate device inside of the mounting bracket, which is located above the light. [6] X Research source Turn the power off at the circuit breaker before accessing your fan’s receiver. How to Fix It: Wipe off your remote’s transmitter to remove any dust that may be interfering with its performance. Once you access the receiver, wipe it down to remove any dust or debris. Use a webcam or digital camera to look at your transmitter. If it doesn’t emit a bright light, it may be damaged. In that case, you may need to get a replacement remote. If neither of the above options work, the internal electronics of your remote or fan may be damaged."

      "title": "Your remote may not be paired with the fan.",
      "content": "Your remote may not be paired with the fan. You may have accidentally unpaired your fan, or it may have somehow lost connection. If you suspect that your remote is unpaired because it isn’t working, resync it and try again. [7] X Research source How to Fix It: If you’re pairing a pill remote, start by removing the back cover by pressing on it and sliding it down. This will reveal the pair button, which has a circle outline with a protruding partial rectangle. Cycle power to the fan by flicking the wall switch off, waiting a few seconds, then turning it back on. Within three minutes, click the pair button. Once you hear the beep, your fan is paired. [8] X Research source If you’re pairing a 3-speed remote, turn the power off and on. Within 3 minutes of restoring the power, press the Fan Off and High buttons together for 4 seconds to sync. Your fan will start at low speed to indicate successful pairing. [9] X Research source Don’t hold the pair button down. That sends a command to reset the Wi-Fi."

In that case, you can get a replacement remote to resolve the issue. [10] X Research source How to Fix It: Order a replacement remote through Hunter or get a universal remote ."

      "title": "Your fan may not have power.",
      "content": "Your fan may not have power. If there’s no power being delivered to your fan, then the remote won’t be able to control it. Check that the wall switch is in the on position to make sure your fan has power. [11] X Research source How to Fix It: If you flip the wall switch and it doesn’t turn the fan on, turn the circuit breaker off and then back on to see if the problem is corrected. If the fan still doesn’t turn on, contact an electrician to inspect the switch housing and look for any loose or damaged wires."

      "content": "Why isn’t my remote working with new batteries? The contact points in your remote may be corroded, and that oxidation can prevent the batteries from properly powering the remote. [12] X Research source Wipe away the debris and corrosion to restore your remote’s functionality. Alternatively, the batteries may be bad (even if they're new). Try swapping them out with a fresh set or a different brand."

      "content": "What if the speed control isn’t working on my fan? Check that the reverse switch isn’t in the neutral position. If your fan only has a remote control, check to see if there are any issues with the remote. Most ceiling fans use a capacitor to control their speeds and kick the motor into drive. [15] X Research source If your fan only runs at high speed or won't change speed, that’s a sign that your capacitor has gone bad. Contact an electrician to replace it."

A fuse could have blown or the internal components may be bad. Luckily, Hunter fan motors come with a lifetime warranty—you just have to make sure your fan is registered. Visit Hunter's Support Site and Help Center and input your fan’s brand and model to register and start the replacement process. [16] X Research source"
