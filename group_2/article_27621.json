      "title": "Choose an ice cream with a thick consistency to use for the mochi balls.",
      "content": "Choose an ice cream with a thick consistency to use for the mochi balls. Thick ice cream will harden nicely inside of the mochi balls and won’t melt as quickly. The flavor, brand, or type of ice cream you use is entirely up to you and your preferences. Use a single flavor of ice cream, or use a different flavor for each mochi ball. [1] X Research source You will need at least 2-3 cups (300-450 g) of ice cream to make 10 mochi balls, so purchase a standard ½ gallon (1,200 g) container of ice cream. Pick traditional vanilla or chocolate ice cream for a simple taste. Experiment with more complicated flavors like mint chocolate chip, rocky road, or cookie dough. Use strawberry, matcha, or black sesame ice cream for a savory taste that is more traditional to mochi ice cream sold in Japan."

      "content": "Use plastic wrap to individually line 10 cups in the cupcake tin. The plastic wrap will keep the ice cream from sticking to the tin. This will work best if your cupcake tin has rounded cups instead of the flat, oval-shaped ones. [2] X Research source Instead of a cupcake tin, you can use the bottom portion of an egg carton or an ice cube tray that has large, round cups."

Use an additional spoon to help properly fill the ice cream scoop and empty it into the cups if needed. [3] X Research source If your ice cream is particularly hard, it will be difficult to get full scoops. Allow the ice cream to soften at room temperature for 2-5 minutes. [4] X Research source"

Add the shiratamako or glutinous rice flour into the bowl first, and then stir in the superfine sugar. Continue to stir the ingredients until they are blended and free of lumps. Once you get more comfortable with making the mochi ice cream, you can experiment by adding additional ingredients to the mochi batter. Some people prefer to add a pinch of salt to the batter, or even 1 tsp (2 g) of matcha (green tea powder) or a strawberry puree. [6] X Research source The bottom of microwave-safe bowls will either directly say, “Microwave Safe” or will have a symbol resembling a microwave with wavy lines across it."

[7] X Research source If the batter is too thin or watery, add 1/2 tbsp (4.25 g) of rice flour to thicken it. For batter that seems dry, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water to moisten it. Increase the increments of flour or water as need until your batter is smooth. [8] X Research source"

Scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl so the mochi doesn’t start to burn or dry out. After microwaving the batter, it should be cooked and resemble a sticky dough. [10] X Research source The bowl will be hot when you take it out of the microwave, so handle it with care and use potholders."

Don’t worry about wiping the starch off your hands. Having some on your hands will actually be beneficial and keep the dough from sticking to your skin as you handle it. [11] X Research source Have ½ cup (80 g) of cornstarch or potato starch set off to the side of your workspace. Use as much or a little of the starch as you want.

Work from the center of the dough outwards to keep the edges of the sheet from getting too thin. The center of the dough should roughly be the same thickness as the edges of the dough. The sheet can be a rough circle or rectangle shape, as either will work well when cutting the mochi.
