      "content": "Understand the importance of washing your face. Washing your face removes all of the oil, sunscreen and everyday pollutants from the environment that rest on the facial skin. It also helps prevent clogged pores, which in turn reduces the likelihood of developing breakouts. Finally, cleansing your face helps prepare the skin to absorb the products that you plan to apply to it. Washing your face is something that you should do at least twice a day, even if you don't plan on giving yourself a full facial."

      "content": "Use a commercial facial cleanser or wash. There are plenty of options out there, from $1 beauty bars to $40 cleansing lotions. Many estheticians, however, note that you don't have to spend a ton of money on a cleanser and that it is more important that you get something that is specific to your skin type. [1] X Research source As a general rule, gel and foam cleansers are more suited for combination/oily skin, while cream cleansers are more suited for normal/dry skin types because they add a little extra hydration to the face. If you have mild acne, you might want to try a cleanser with salicylic acid in it. Salicylic acid helps unclog pores to resolve and prevent lesions on the skin. One good option are Neutrogena's Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream or Power-Foam washes. [2] X Research source"

Here are a couple of options: Mix together 3 tbsp fresh apple juice, 6 tbsp whole milk and 2 tbsp honey. If you want the cleanser to be more of a warming cleanser, then pop the honey in the microwave for 10 seconds before you add it to the other ingredients. Place 1/2 tablespoon of oats in a food processor and pulse until powdered. Then add 1 tablespoon almonds and pulse until powdered. Mix in 1/4 teaspoon of honey and 1/4 spoon of soy milk.

      "content": "Use a spot treatment. Apply a spot treatment that you can purchase or make at home. Salicylic acid is one of the most commonly used acne spot treatments because it works to clear out the clogged poor and get rid of dead skin cells that help facilitate break outs. Benzoyl peroxide is another commonly used acne spot treatment, which works by killing the bacteria that causes acne, which in turn alleviates the inflammation caused by said bacteria. [4] X Research source Some recommended spot treatments include Malin+Goetz Acne Treatment with active sulfur and salicylic acid and Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 10, which is a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution. [5] X Research source For a DIY spot treatment, apply either tea tree oil or toothpaste to the affected area. Tea tree oil, which is an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory oil, is a great home remedy for people with sensitive skin, because it doesn't typically dry out or redden the skin like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid do. [6] X Research source Dermatologists, however, recommend applying spot treatments conservatively to avoid overusing these products which can result in redness, dryness and flaking of the skin. Make sure that you're only using a pea-sized amount of any spot treatment. [7] X Research source"

Look for something that mentions exfoliation on the bottle, or defines itself as a \"scrub\" (intended to \"scrub\" away all the dead skin cells). If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you might consider a scrub with salicylic acid. You can also buy products with gentle abrasive ingredients, such as jojoba beans, rice grains or corneal. These help with the \"scrubbing action\". Some products can have sharper particles, such as apricot pits and shells. If you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, it's best to avoid these type of exfoliators. [10] X Research source"

Here are some options: Mix together 1 mashed banana, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup soft brown sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsp vitamin E. The sugar is the exfoliating agent, as it acts like little microbeads that clear off dead skin cells. Blend a half dozen fresh strawberries with 1/4 cup of milk. The enzymes in the strawberries dissolve dead skin cells and the milk helps to soothe the area afterward. [11] X Research source Combine 1 teaspoon of honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil. Separately, prepare a package of plain oatmeal. Use less water than the instructions call for so the oatmeal turns into a thick paste. Then add the honey-olive oil mixture to the oatmeal. The oatmeal exfoliates, while the honey-olive oil mix hydrates. [12] X Research source"

[17] X Research source If you feel any burning or warming sensations while the mask is setting, remove it. Your skin may be getting irritated. When removing the mask, don't abrasively scrub it off, but instead let the warm water do its work to flush the mask out and off of your skin."

Because moisturizers hydrate the skin, they help the face look healthy, smooth, and fresh. Moisturizing also has long-term benefits. Hydration is what enables skin to function at peak performance, meaning that skin cells can repair themselves quickly and turn-over fresh cells. This has huge anti-aging advantages in the long term. Studies have shown that people who use moisturizer develop wrinkles at a fraction of the rate of those with dry skin."

      "content": "Select a moisturizer. You'll want to choose a moisturizer based on your skin type. If you have oily skin, look for lotions or gels instead of creams. If you have dry skin, look for a cream, which has more oil in it. The greater the oil content, the better absorption of the moisturizer into the skin to hydrate the tissue. If you have combination skin, try a lotion with no acids, such as Cetaphil, Aveeno, Neutrogena or Lubriderm. [18] X Research source Avoid choosing a very light moisturizer for after a facial. Your skin has just been deep cleaned and will need to be replenished with moisture. Otherwise, the lack of moisture in the skin will cause it to begin to overproduce oil and clog your pores, which in turn will lead to break-outs."
