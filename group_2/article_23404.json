Their antennae are relatively smooth and bend at a ninety-degree angle.

Soldier termites are slightly bigger than workers because they have large mandibles, or protruding jaws to defend the colony against invaders. Reproductive termites (also called alates or flying termites ) range from ½ to 1 inch long. [3] X Research source Each termite colony has different castes, or functional roles within the group. The caste system is divided into reproductive, soldier, and worker termites, and each caste has a distinctive size and look. [4] X Research source If possible, catch a termite in a mason jar so you can inspect it closely. Pick up the termite by gently clasping it between your thumb and forefinger, or by trapping it between a jar and a piece of paper. [5] X Research source"

While they do not cause structural damage themselves, they do form colonies of worker termites that feed on wood and may attack your home. [14] X Research source Swarming (when termites reproduce and form new colonies) usually occurs in “late spring and early fall,” according to Break. It tends to happen in the daytime, especially on warm days after a storm. After reproductive termites mate, they lose their wings. If you see piles of silvery, membranous wings that are about ¼ of an inch long, it could be a sign of an infestation. [15] X Research source"

Termites thrive in moist soil, so it’s important to use a concrete foundation and leave a ventilation space between the soil surface and structural wood beneath a building. After construction, keep the soil around the foundation as dry as possible through proper grading and drainage. Cover exposed wood with sealant or paint, and fix cracks, leaks, and exterior defects as soon as possible. [29] X Research source Break advises to keep “vegetation and trees at least 6 to 12 inches away from your house.” Do not pile or store wood next to your house, and perform periodic inspections to ensure termite colonies do not form.
