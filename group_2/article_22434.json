      "content": "Donate to those in need. If you’re able, consider donating money or items to local charities. Try taking unused food to a food bank, giving clothes you never wear to a homeless shelter, or donating money to organizations that help sick children. Check with local charities to see what they’re most in need of. [2] X Research source If you choose to donate money, make sure the charity is legitimate. Search the organization on GuideStar.org to make sure it isn’t a scam. Another option is to donate books to a library, school, or just children in your neighborhood. Or, build a little free library by your house to offer books to those who may not have other resources. Setting up fundraisers is another great way to make sure organizations in your area receive the donations they need."

      "content": "Clean up your neighborhood. Think about how you can improve the appearance of your community’s public spaces. Start by picking up trash or removing graffiti from walls or windows. Then, move on to bigger things like landscaping by pulling weeds or planting flowers. Making your community feel cleaner and brighter will encourage people to enjoy these spaces and result in a better quality of life for everyone. [3] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source When you walk down the street, pick up any trash you see and throw it away or recycle it. If there’s too much for you to tackle on your own, get some friends to help you. Scrape off or paint over graffiti to freshen up buildings and fences. If you’re good at painting, consider creating a mural on a public wall. You may need permission from the building owner or city first, though. Plant flowers or trees wherever you can. Adding more natural elements to urban spaces can help them look and feel more safe and inviting.

      "content": "Check on and help your neighbors. Take time to meet and get to know your neighbors. Sometimes, just checking in on someone and seeing how they’re doing is enough to brighten their day. Volunteer to help them out if they mention a difficult task, like moving or building furniture. If you see someone in need of assistance, come to their aid rather than averting your eyes. Spreading positivity and kindness can make a significant difference. [5] X Research source If you see a mother struggling to get a stroller down a set of stairs, offer to help her carry it. If you know your elderly neighbor is lonely, offer to take them out to lunch. If you notice someone looking lost, help them get where they’re trying to go. Offer to shovel your neighbor’s backyard or rake leaves for someone across the street. Babysit community kids, or watch their pets. Knowing people in your community is a great way to start learning what you can do to help. Start building your network by getting out and meeting people. Go to local events, frequent local coffee shops, and get to know your neighbors."

      "content": "Mentor or tutor a child. Volunteer with a school or after-school program, or reach out to parents in your neighborhood to find out which kids may need support, either academically or in other aspects of their life. Tutoring can encourage kids to build a lifelong love of learning, while mentoring can provide them with a positive adult role model and help them grow into their potential. [6] X Research source Consider joining a mentorship program like Big Brothers Big Sisters of America to give children a chance to experience a healthy relationship with an adult they may not have otherwise. Another way to help children is to organize a summer reading program to keep their reading skills active. Share your favorite books, give out prizes, and turn the program into a friendly competition. If sports are more your thing, you could also coach a youth sports team to encourage children to stay active. Ramamoorthy says to be a good mentor, you must “be able to explicitly understand why someone is coming to you. The interesting part is that mentorship differs from person to person and skill to skill. If you think at any point that you’re not going to be able to provide the things they need, you can connect them to someone new.”"

They may get lonely and would be very happy to have your company. Volunteer to read books, bring baked goods, make birthday cards, or do any activity that interests you. The facility will likely appreciate your help, and you’ll get to hear fascinating stories from people you might not have met otherwise. [7] X Research source"

Whenever you can, buy from local, small businesses rather than large chain stores. Try to get most of your produce from the farmer’s market, where members of your community go to sell food they’ve worked hard to grow. Change your mindset from buying the cheapest option available to leveraging your purchases to provide the most community good. [9] X Research source Shopping local can be more expensive, but know that your money will go toward boosting your local economy and building a strong, vibrant community. Additionally, consider starting your own business . You can serve your community by offering a great product and possibly even hiring employees."

Odds are, other people and organizations in your community are also taking steps to improve it by holding community events like festivals, cleanups, and meetings. Attend as many of these as possible to get to know your neighborhood and volunteer to help out whenever you feel comfortable. If you feel that your community could benefit from other events, gather a few of your neighbors and start to organize the event yourself. [10] X Research source For example, if someone you know is trying to hold a \"Bike to Work or School Day\" on Monday mornings, why not give it a try if you have a bike? Bring a friend along, too. Show people in your community that biking is fun. Many nonprofits hold community walks and runs to raise money. Paying the entry fee directly benefits the nonprofit, and participating in the event helps spread awareness about the cause. Go to concerts, festivals, and other events put on by local businesses or organizations. If no one shows up to these types of events, they might stop happening altogether."

Stay up to date on activities that impact your community, and form educated opinions on important matters. Vote in every election you can, no matter how small. Having an informed perspective and making your voice heard can have an effect on what direction your community takes. Encourage others to vote as well, as civic engagement is crucial for a healthy democracy. [12] X Research source Contact your representative about issues that matter to you. For example, if your city is deciding whether to cut down a few acres of forest to build a new supermarket, think about which option is better for the community. Then, call your representative or write a letter stating what you want to happen and why. In addition to voting, attend community meetings at which decisions are being made. Speak up about what matters to you. Assist in voter registration, as well, to encourage your neighbors to make their voices heard."

      "content": "Recycle and compost. Many communities are experiencing problems with landfills that are getting too full. Producing too much trash pollutes the environment, and that's not good for your community's long-term health. Do your part to help improve the situation by recycling and composting as much of your waste as possible. [13] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you want to go above and beyond, spread awareness about how to recycle, or start a recycling program at your school or place of work. Composting is useful in more ways than one. It allows you to dispose of your food waste without putting it in the trash, and as a result, you end up with rich soil you can use in your garden. Once you learn how to do it, show others how easy it can be. Determine what kind of products you throw away most often. Kellogg says, “My first recommendation [for reducing waste] is actually to do a waste audit. Every single person's life and what they throw out is going to be vastly different from trash can to trash can. When I did my own waste audit, the [most common] things that I found in there were paper towels, food waste, and food packaging.” This way, you know what you need to cut back on so you can start researching better alternatives."

      "content": "Save energy and water. Using excessive electricity and water strains community resources in addition to harming the environment. Think about all the ways you can conserve energy and water, like turning off lights when you’re not using them or taking shorter showers. Implement these changes in your household and educate others on how they can cut down on energy usage, as well. [14] X Research source Other ways to save energy include using energy-saving appliances, decreasing your reliance on air conditioning, turning down the temperature on your water heater, and unplugging your computer when you power it down. Making sure your pipes aren't leaking, limiting how much and how often you water your lawn, and using a low-water method of washing dishes are all ways you can help save water . Kellogg recommends switching to renewable energy: “Companies like Arcadia Power and Clean Choice Energy are energy suppliers, and when you sign up, they work with your existing utility companies to make sure all the energy you use is supplied by clean energy sources. It doesn't cost anything extra for you. And in fact, you typically see your electricity bills go down.”"

      "content": "Be less reliant on your car. Communities that rely heavily on car transportation often experience elevated air pollution levels. Air pollution is not only detrimental to plants and animals, but it causes major health problems for humans, too. Using your car less often decreases your carbon footprint, which helps your community. Here are alternatives to try: [15] X Research source Walk or bike where you need to go. It takes a little longer, but you see more along the way. Use public transportation. Even if your area doesn't have a great subway or elevated rail system, you may have bus lines nearby. Carpool to work or school, instead of driving places by yourself. Kellogg has implemented a rule for herself about when she should walk vs. drive somewhere: “If it's under a 30 minute walk, I walk there rather than driving. If you bike, biking is also a great solution…. I used to always carpool to work when I was working in an office. This will obviously save you a bunch of money on gas, as well.”"

Even just telling other people about your goal and what you are doing to accomplish it can help you to achieve it. [17] X Research source To find passionate volunteers and spread the word about what you're doing, share information via social media. Go public with your plan to make a difference, and tell people how they can get involved. Hold meetings to discuss how to put your plan into action.

Determine which cause you want to support to help your community by reading the local newspaper, looking for volunteer opportunities online, and talking to those who have lived in the area for a long time. Research different organizations in your community to find out which one best aligns with the community’s needs and your skills and interests. Reach out to them to see if they need volunteers. [23] X Research source For example, maybe there’s a river that’s so polluted no one can swim there, or maybe the local school needs more resources to buy books and computer equipment. Look for organizations that could help you achieve these goals. Try not to get overwhelmed by the size and scope of the problems your community is facing. Pick one thing that you care about changing, one thing that ignites your passion, and go from there. Websites like Idealist.org and VolunteerMatch.org can also help you to find out about organizations that are looking for volunteers. Ramamoorthy says it’s important to consider a number of factors when finding a good organization to work with: “When I first started volunteering or contributing, I started looking at organizations online [and] finding local organizations that were part of certain causes. I narrowed it down to 4 or 5, and then I picked the one that was most open to having volunteers. For me, weekends were the best time to volunteer, so I looked for opportunities at times [I would be available.]”"
