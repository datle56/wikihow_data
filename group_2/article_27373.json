      "content": "Pour 2 cups (256 g) of white flour into a mixing bowl. Any type of flour will work for this recipe, but hardtack made from white flour lasts the longest. Different flours like whole wheat or rye produce hardtack that won't last as long. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix in 1 cup (240 ml) of water into the flour.",
      "content": "Mix in 1 cup (240 ml) of water into the flour. Take the water cup in one hand and slowly pour it into the flour while using your other hand to knead the dough. Introduce the water gradually by pouring in a little, mixing the dough, and then pouring more. Continue this process until you’ve used all the water. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the dough into a ball. Using both hands, work the dough with your hands until it reaches a uniform consistency. It will feel like playdough when it’s mixed. If the dough gets flaky, add a few more drops of water. [4] X Research source You can use a mixing spoon for this step, but the dough might be too tough to mix completely with a spoon. Your hands work best. Use plastic cooking gloves if you don’t want your hands to get messy. You can also add 2 tsp (11.38 g) of salt, but this is optional."

      "content": "Roll the dough until it’s 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick. Sprinkle some more flour down so the dough doesn’t stick to your rolling surface. Then use a rolling pin to flatten out the dough. Keep rolling until the dough is about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick. [5] X Research source You could also use a plastic tube or a longer glass if you don’t have a rolling pin."

      "content": "Cut the dough into 3 in (7.6 cm) x 3 in (7.6 cm) squares. Hardtack was traditionally made into large square crackers, so use this shape for authentic hardtack. Use either a knife or a pizza cutter to slice the dough into even squares. [6] X Research source This size is just a suggestion. You can cut the dough into any shape or size you want. Some people use cookie cutters to make smaller, more portable crackers. Don’t get rid of leftover pieces. Cook them along with the other pieces too."

      "title": "Poke evenly-spaced holes in straight lines in each cracker.",
      "content": "Poke evenly-spaced holes in straight lines in each cracker. Holes allow the air and moisture to escape while the hardtack bakes. Use a knife or fork to poke a series of evenly-spaced holes through the dough. Keep the holes in a straight line so the hardtack cracker is easier to break when you eat it. [7] X Research source There is no set number of holes, but more is better. This releases more air and moisture and makes the cracker last even longer. The holes must be all the way through the cracker. Flip each one over to make sure you’ve pierced the dough all the way."

      "content": "Lay the crackers out on a baking sheet. Don’t overlap the dough or let it touch, or the crackers will be stuck together. The dough shouldn’t expand much, so you don’t need large spaces between the crackers. [8] X Research source Don’t grease the baking sheet. The oil will soak into the hardtack and it won’t last as long."

Cut one in half to make sure it's cooled all the way through. Then transfer them into a jar or plastic bag.

After the crackers are in an airtight container, place them in a cool area away from direct sunlight and take them out when you need them. [11] X Research source Store the hardtack in smaller amounts so if you only want a few crackers, you don’t have to expose the entire batch to air and moisture. Monitor the hardtack over time for mold. If you see any of this forming, throw the batch out and cook a new one. Some survivalists vacuum-seal their hardtack to make it last even longer.

      "content": "Mix in some spices for extra flavor. Any number of powdered seasonings can be mixed into your hardtack recipe to improve the flavor. For extra taste, try rosemary or oregano. If you like spice, try powdered cayenne pepper. You could also add more salt to the mixture. These options would all improve the extremely plain flavor of hardtack. Start with 1 tsp (5.69) of a seasoning in a small batch of hardtack and taste the end result. Add more for another batch if you decide it needs more flavor. For an experiment, mix several small batches of hardtack with a different flavors and see what you prefer. Then use that mixture for a larger batch."

As an added bonus, the crackers will also be softer with some oil in them, making them overall easier to eat. Adding oil of any kind will make your hardtack last a much shorter time. Only use this recipe if you will eat the hardtack soon. If you plan on storing it for a long time, skip this option."

Add more if you want more flavor. You can also add honey to hardtack before you eat it, like honey on toast. Remember that if you use honey the hardtack won’t stay preserved as long. Use this hardtack within a few months to avoid mold growth."

Sorghum flour is known for its naturally sweet flavor. Replacing white flour with sorghum with produce a better-tasting hardtack.
