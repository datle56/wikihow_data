      "content": "Assemble a double-boiler. Fill a medium-sized bowl with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a heat-safe bowl on top. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water. Try to use a glass bowl. It will help things heat more evenly."

      "content": "Add 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of petroleum jelly, 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of shea butter, and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of coconut oil to the bowl. The shea butter and coconut oil will moisturize your lips, while the petroleum jelly will hold everything together. If you can't find coconut oil, try some jojoba oil or almond oil instead. Both are very moisturizing. If you can't find or don't like shea butter, try cocoa butter or coconut butter instead. Both will give the lip gloss a subtle taste."

You can use extract or candy-making flavoring. Use no more than ¼ teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of almond oil, or your lip gloss may start to separate. [2] X Research source You can also use some essential oil instead of the flavoring. Essential oil is very potent. Start with one drop, stir, then add more if needed."
