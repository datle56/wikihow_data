      "title": "Mark which syllable needs to be stressed.",
      "content": "Mark which syllable needs to be stressed. In English, certain syllables are stressed in each word. When creating flashcards, make a note of which syllable needs to be stressed. You can draw a line over the syllable, underline it, or write the letters in capitals. Say this syllable with more emphasis or make it slightly louder than the others. The rules of stressing can vary greatly in English. In 2 syllable nouns (like wa ter) or adjectives (like yell ow), the first syllable is stressed. In 2 syllable verbs (like re lax ), however, the second syllable is stressed. In words with 3 or more syllables, the suffix (or ending of the word) determines which syllables get the stress. For example, for most words that end in -ly (like qui etly) or -er ( man ager), stress the first syllable. In words that end in -tion (cre a tion) or -ic (photo graph ic), stress the second to last syllable. Rules can vary greatly on stressing, and there are many exceptions to every rule. A dictionary will always tell you the correct syllable to stress."
