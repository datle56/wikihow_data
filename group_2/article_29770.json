[1] X Research source You can use a pail with tapering sides, but make sure that the widest part is at the rim. If your pail is wider at the bottom, you won't be able to pull it out when you are done. Secure the paper to the pail with tape to keep it steady, if necessary."

      "content": "Fold over one end of your rope and glue it in place. Draw a ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) long line of hot glue along the end of your rope. Immediately fold the end over onto the rest of the rope. This ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) stub will serve as the foundation for your basket. Use some ⅜-inch (0.95-centimeter) thick cotton piping cord. You will need about 10 to 15 yards (9.14 to 13.72 meters) to make one basket. It is always better to have too much cording than too little; joining cording on baskets is difficult. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Apply 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of hot glue, then press the rope into it. Don't squeeze out too much hot glue at once, or it will set before you can press the rope into it, and the bond won't be as strong."

Once the disk is the same width as the base, glue down another coil of rope, then stop. You are now ready to build up the walls of your basket."

[6] X Research source They can be as wide as you'd like them to be, but something around 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) would be ideal. You can hot glue the handles to the sides of the basket, or stitch them on using jute cord for a rustic touch. [7] X Research source You can also attach them with rivets by doing the following: [8] X Research source Use a leather punch to punch a hole into the end of each handle. Place a rivet into each hole. Position the rivets against the sides of the basket. Make sure that the rivets go through the cording. Hammer the rivets in place from inside the basket. Secure the handles with more hot glue if needed."

Fold the end of the rope under itself, then roll it in a spiral to form a small disk that is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) across. This will create the foundation of your basket. Use some 7/32-inch (0.56-centimeter) thick 100% cotton clothesline. It is usually found in spools online. A 200-foot (60.96-meter) spool will give your three medium-sized baskets."

Hold the rope against the side of the disk, then slide the disk under the presser foot. Make sure that the center of the foot is in the groove between the two coils. You can use a thread color that matches your rope, or you can use a contrasting color to make it look more interesting."

      "content": "Start sewing, turning the disk counterclockwise as you feed the rope towards the presser foot. The needle should be going back and forth across the groove, catching onto both coils of rope. This is what will hold the basket together. Keep going until the basket is the width you want it to be. Avoid making your basket too wide using this method. The wider it is, the more difficult it will be to sew. Something around 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) across would be ideal."

Grab hold of the disk, and turn it so that it is resting vertically against the side of the sewing machine. Continue sewing your way across the coils, using the same zigzag stitch as before, until your basket it the height you want it to be. Consider changing the color of your thread every couple of rows for an interesting, banded effect. At this point, your basket is just about complete.

Tug the rope up to loosen it and create a loop. Move forward a few inches/centimeters, and start sewing again; remember to backstitch a few times before you continue sewing around the basket. Make sure that the loop you make is big enough for you to slip your hand through."

Pull the rope up, move forward a few inches, and start sewing again. Once again, backstitch a few times at your new starting point. When you get to the start of the first handle, you can choose to finish your basket. You can also keep sewing across the handles for 1 to 2 more rows to make them thicker and stronger."

You can make it as long or as short as you want, so long as you can work without it getting tangled. [9] X Research source Something around 24 inches (60.96) would be ideal, however. You can use the same color of embroidery floss throughout the project, or you can use different colors to create a more interesting looking basket."

The stitches can be as close together or as far apart as you want them to be. Something around ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) would be ideal, however. When you run out of floss, push the needle under the stitch, through a coil, and knot the floss to the previous stitch. Pass the needle and floss through a few stitches, then cut the floss. To start a new thread: thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the floss. Pass it through the same stitches, but going forward this time. When you are back where you left off, continue sewing, the same as before."

Wrap the thread around both coils: the top one that you are feeding onto your basket, and the one attached to the disk. Do this for one row. [13] X Research source Add an element of design to your basket by wrapping the floss around the rope a few times to create a colored band. These bands can be as thick as you want them to be. Be sure to go back and sew the coils together as you normally would, however."

Wrap the embroidery thread around the end of the rope tightly until you have a colored band that is about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick. This will not only add an element of design to your basket, but it will also keep the rope from fraying."

Wrap your floss around the top of your rope, and then push the needle under the coil just beneath it. Go back over the top of your rope, then through the coil below it. Tie the floss to the stitch next to it, then push the needle between two coils of rope, hiding the floss between them. Cut the floss, and tuck the end into the ropes. [15] X Research source"
