Contacts: Apps that have access to your contacts are able to access and modify your list of contacts. They may also be able to view and transmit your contacts and their personal information. Be careful which apps you grant access to your contacts. Calendars: Apps that have access to your calendars can change, delete, and add new dates in your calendars. Reminders: Apps that have access to your reminders can add, change, and delete reminders you have set. Photos: Apps that have access to your photos can view, modify, or delete photos in your Photos folder on iCloud. Camera: Apps that have access to your camera may turn on and record images and video using your mac's camera. These apps may be able to access your camera and transmit data while running in the background. A green light will appear next to your camera when it is active. Microphone: Apps that have access to your microphone can activate and record audio using your mac's microphone. These apps may be able to access your microphone and transmit data while running in the background. Speech Recognition: This shows apps that have access to your speech recognition files from Siri.

Be especially careful which apps you grant access to input monitoring. Full Disk Access: Apps with full disk access can access and modify any files or data on your mac. This includes files and data from other apps. Be especially careful which apps you grant full disk access to. Malicious apps can use full disk access to access and transmit your personal information as well as make malicious modifications to your system. Files and Folders: This displays a list of files and folders you can allow or disallow an app to have access to. Click the checkbox next to all files or folders you want to allow the app to access. These include your Documents folder, Downloads folder, removable drives, network connections, and your desktop. Screen Recording: Apps that have access to screen recording can record what is happening on your screen and possibly transmit that data. Malicious app developers can gain access to private information this way. Be especially careful about which apps you grant access to screen recording. HomeKit: Apps with access to your Homekit can access your Home information. This includes information from Siri and your Homepod devices. Bluetooth: This allows apps to access and modify your Bluetooth settings. Automation: This allows apps to control other apps. Analytics & Improvements: This just allows apps to send user data back to the developer that they can use to make improvements to the app."
