      "content": "Mix vinegar and water. Plain vinegar is too strong to use on hair, so it's important to dilute it with water first. One-fourth cup of vinegar and one-fourth cup of water should be enough for a single hair rinse. If your hair is quite oily, you can add an extra tablespoon of vinegar. If your hair is dry or you tend to have dandruff, add a tablespoon of water. Curly hair and color treated or permed hair should be treated with a much more diluted solution, anywhere from 2 to 4 parts water to 1 part vinegar. Either distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar work well here. Many prefer using apple cider vinegar in the shower because the smell is less intense. [1] X Research source Apple cider vinegar can remove a lot of dead skin on your scalp.

Apple cider vinegar may also be a good choice if you have psoriasis or eczema on your scalp."

      "content": "Try adding a tablespoon of honey. Honey has both clarifying and moisturizing properties, making it a great addition to a hair rinse. This is especially helpful if your hair tends to be a little dry. Honey also smells fantastic and can combat the vinegar smell while you're in the shower. If you want to try adding honey, here's how to do it: Make your vinegar rinse with warm water to help the honey dissolve. Pour it into a container with a lid. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey. Put the lid on the container and shake well before use."

      "content": "Use an egg white for extra shine. Egg whites, like vinegar, clarify hair and make it look beautifully shiny. Since you've already got the vinegar out, why not try adding an egg? You can also use an egg white in place of vinegar if you happen to be out when your hair needs a rinse. Here's how to use an egg white in your rinse: Mix up your vinegar rinse as normal. Place it in a container with a lid. Separate one egg, letting the white drop into the container with the vinegar. If you have dry hair you can apply the yolk to the ends for extra moisture. Place the lid on the container and shake well before use."

Here's how to do it: [4] X Research source Mix your vinegar rinse as usual, and pour it into a small saucepan. Add a tablespoon of your favorite dried herb, like lavender, rose hips, sage, mint, or rosemary. Bring the rinse to a simmer and let the herbs cook for 10 minutes.
