Once the butter is melted, add the decarboxylated flower to the pot and combine. Let the mixture boil and then simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours. [3] X Research source Stirring regularly will keep the cannabis flower from burning and prevent it from sinking to the bottom of the pot. Keep the heat on a low setting, so the mixture doesn’t boil. Double Boiler Method : Simmer 1 cup (240 mL) of water in a large pot and add 1 cup (250 grams) of butter and your decarboxylated cannabis to a glass or metal bowl set as a double-boiler on top of the pot. Simmer on low heat for 3 hours while making sure the water doesn’t evaporate. [4] X Research source Crockpot method : Add the decarboxylated cannabis, 1 cup (240 mL) of water, and 1 cup (250 grams) of butter to a crockpot or slow cooker . Allow the cannabutter to cook at 150 °F (66 °C) for 3 hours. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Strain and store the cannabutter. After 30 minutes of cooling time, place a fine mesh strainer (or multiple layers of cheesecloth) over a storage container. Secure it with a rubber band to prevent movement. Pour the cannabutter through the strainer slowly so it has time to seep into the container. Seal your storage container and refrigerate it for a few hours so it can firm up. [6] X Research source Don’t press on the strainer or squeeze the cheesecloth to remove leftover liquid. It can end up releasing bitter tannins and chlorophyll which affects the flavor of your cannabutter."

If you’re concerned about making your weed edibles too strong, adjust your ratio with less cannabutter mixed with regular butter. [7] X Research source You can figure out the amount of THC per serving in the dosing guidelines section . Marijuana Brownies : You can use any brownie recipe you like. Just replace the butter or oil in the recipe with the cannabutter or cannabis oil you prepared. Marijuana Cookies : You can choose your favorite cookie recipe, as long as you replace the butter or oil in the recipe with your cannabutter or cannabis oil. Marijuana Gummies : Make cannabis oil instead of butter, then replace the oil in your gummy recipe with the cannabis oil."

Once cooled, place the flower into an 8 fl oz (240 mL) mason jar and pour in high-proof alcohol (like vodka) so it reaches 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the level of the cannabis. Secure it tightly and leave it in a dark space (like a closet) for 4 to 6 weeks. Shake the mixture daily so the ingredients don’t stay separated for too long; strain it through a fine mesh strainer into a dropper bottle and add to your edibles (or make marijuana tea ). [8] X Research source You can also ingest cannabis oil sublingually, which means to take the desired dose under the tongue. Let the liquid remain beneath your tongue for at least 1 minute. Swish the mixture before swallowing so the membranes in your cheeks and the tongue can absorb it. Effects usually begin within approximately 30 minutes and can last for up to 3 hours. [9] X Research source A more complicated and expensive option is to diffuse edibles using a cannabis infusion machine , which extracts certain compounds from cannabis and infuses them into various ingredients, like butters and oils; some cannabis infusion machines can also decarboxylate the cannabis flower.

      "title": "Calculate the amount of THC in your weed edibles.",
      "content": "Calculate the amount of THC in your weed edibles. Use the following formula to figure out the exact THC doses per serving in your weed edibles: 1 gram of cannabis = 1000 milligrams. The majority of cannabis contains 10% THC, which equals 100 milligrams of THC per gram. Therefore, 1 gram of cannabis typically contains 100 milligrams of THC. The amount of THC in your recipe depends on the amount of butter you include, along with the number of servings. For example, if your recipe calls for ½ cup of butter (115 grams), and you make 36 servings total, the batch contains 1,400 mg. Divide 1400 mg by the number of servings (36) to determine that each serving has 38.8 mg of THC. [11] X Research source"

You can also refrigerate or freeze the chocolate edibles for an additional 2-4 months; it will develop a “sugar bloom,” or white film caused by refrigerator moisture, but is safe to consume.

If you follow a specialized diet (ex. vegan), you can ensure your edibles don’t include anything you don’t want them to."

      "content": "How long do edibles take to kick in? Depending on the potency, edibles can last anywhere from 4-12 hours on average. Some edibles can even last up to 24 hours. The variation in time depends on certain factors, like the type of edible (baked good vs. gummy), the absorption method, and whether your stomach is full or empty. Your personal tolerance also comes into play in connection with how quickly you notice the effect of edibles. [23] X Research source"

      "title": "Why are edibles so much stronger than smoking weed?",
      "content": "Why are edibles so much stronger than smoking weed? Smoking cannabis means you’re orally ingesting Delta-9-THC into your bloodstream. When you consume cannabis in an edible, the THC breaks down in your stomach, where it transforms into 11-Hydroxy-THC, a more potent version of THC that lasts longer. Keep this in mind when you’re consuming weed edibles. [24] X Research source"
