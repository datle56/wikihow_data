Remove the laces from the top eyelets. Rethread them through the top eyelets so that they run from the outside of the shoe to the inside. Slip the ends of your laces inside your shoe. You can also tie your shoelaces into a bow, then tuck it underneath the tongue of your sneakers. [1] X Research source If you’re worried about the bow coming undone, you can also tie your shoelaces into a knot and tuck it in the side of the tongue."
