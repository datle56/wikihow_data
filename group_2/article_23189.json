      "content": "Ice cream hair refers to a unique hairstyle with bangs that flip outward. This fluffy, voluminous, and slightly cartoonish hairstyle gets its name because it looks like a literal scoop of ice cream—the top of the hair is smooth and rounded, while the edges flip up and outward. Ice cream hair is a popular option among young Caucasian boys, but since most TikTok users aren’t too fond of the style, it’s become a viral meme since the end of 2022. [1] X Research source Many TikTokers claim that ice cream hair looks like the “Shaggy” haircut in Roblox. To achieve ice cream hair, users either blow-dry their hair with a round brush or wear a baseball cap and blow-dry the ends in an upward direction. Currently, the hashtag ice cream hair (#icecreamhair) has over 46 million views on TikTok. The most popular video features 2 boys with dramatic flipped out hair, followed by stock photos that show scoops of ice cream and waffle cones on top of their heads."

      "content": "Grow out your hair as long as possible and get layered bangs. Aim to grow your hair to at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) on the top and sides, or until the front hits the bottom of your eyes. You’ll need to have lots of length because your hair will look shorter when you flip it upward and create the ice cream hairstyle. Ask your barber to add layers in the front to remove excess weight, and show them a photo of the style for reference. [2] X Research source Layering makes your hair more flexible, light, and easy to work with so the edges of your hair hold their shape. [3] X Research source"

Since you’re applying heat to achieve the ice cream hairstyle, invest in products that will make your hair as healthy and hydrated as possible. When you’re done washing your hair, wring out excess water with a towel and make sure your hair is still damp. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow-dry your hair with a round brush to create the flipped end effect. Attach a diffuser to your hair dryer before setting it to medium heat. Working in small sections, use a round brush to comb through your hair from the root to the middle, angling the airflow of the dryer from underneath the brush at the same time. When you reach the middle of your hair, flick your wrist upward and outward to create a bend in your hair. Concentrate the airflow on the bend to create the flipped, ice cream hair look. [5] X Research source Repeat this process 2-3 times on each section until you get the shape you desire. Before blow-drying your hair , apply a heat protectant spray to minimize frizz and prevent heat damage. If you don’t have a round brush or can’t get the perfect bend in your hair, throw on a baseball cap and blow-dry the ends that are sticking out from the cap in an upward direction."
