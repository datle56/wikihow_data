Depending on the battle format that the base uses, you'll have either a Single, Double, or Triple battle with three level 100 Blissey. Don't worry about your Pokémon fainting, since Healing Wish, which is the only move the Blissey will know, faints the Blissey, and fails if one is left, allowing you to defeat them easily. As Blissey has the highest experience yield in the game, you'll gain at least 10,000 experience points per Blissey, and you can get even more (possibly over 50,000 experience points per Blissey) by following the tips below. You can battle with the person in the base once a day."
