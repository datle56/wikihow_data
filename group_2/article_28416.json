      "title": "Use moisturizing lotion daily.",
      "content": "Use moisturizing lotion daily. Legs that are moisturized will automatically have a nice glow. When your skin is hydrated, it looks younger and much more vibrant. Put on a fresh layer of lotion to give your legs a gorgeous, subtle shine. There are tons of moisturizing lotions that can be purchased at beauty and convenience stores, and you can also use natural products like coconut oil or shea butter to moisturize your skin. Always apply lotion after you take a shower. This will help lock moisture into your skin, and prevent it from looking dull. Always apply lotion after you shave or wax your legs. Shaving and waxing can be harsh on your skin, so be sure to moisturize afterwards. If you're wearing shorts or a dress, carry a small lotion with you to re-apply throughout the day. Give your legs a rub down with lotion every few hours to keep your legs looking bright."

      "title": "Exfoliate your legs.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your legs. Exfoliation is the key to smooth and shiny legs, as it removes all of your dead skin cells. Dead skin cells cause our skin to look dull and dry. Exfoliating will eliminate that top layer of dull skin, revealing a new layer of bright, moisturized skin. Use a body scrub to exfoliate your legs 2-3 times per week. Body scrubs can be purchased at most convenience and beauty supply stores, or you can make your own at home. To make your own body scrub, you'll need sugar or salt and some type of oil (olive oil, coconut oil, etc.). Your sugar or salt will be your exfoliant, and your oil will be the moisturizer. Mix your ingredients together, your scrub should be thick. You can keep your body scrub in a tupperware container in the shower. Consider adding an essential oil (like rosemary or peppermint) to your body scrub to give it a relaxing scent."

      "title": "Apply oil to your legs.",
      "content": "Apply oil to your legs. If you want your legs to really shine, apply a small amount of oil to your legs. There are tons of oils that can turn any pair of legs into shiny show-stoppers, including coconut oil, jojoba oil, and olive oil. With oil, a little bit goes a long way. Pour a nickel sized amount of oil into your palms, rub your palms together, and proceed to apply oil all over your legs. The oil will create a shine that will last for hours while simultaneously conditioning your skin. [1] X Research source Be careful when applying oil to your skin, because oil can easily stain clothing. Make sure to rub the oil into your skin very well before getting dressed, as this will prevent any clothing damage. Applying oil to your legs right after shaving is a great way to lock in moisture."

      "title": "Shave your legs to remove your leg hair.",
      "content": "Shave your legs to remove your leg hair. Shaving is the quickest and easiest way to remove your leg hair. Removing your leg hair will automatically make your legs appear to be shinier. Shave as often as necessary â€“ some people shave every day, some shave once a week. Invest in a good razor, especially if you have sensitive skin. A good razor will often have multiple blades and a conditioning strip. When you shave, use a good shaving cream. There are many shaving creams that can be purchased at beauty or convenience stores, but you can also use natural shaving creams. Shea butter and coconut oil make for great shaving creams, as these products deeply condition the skin. Take your time when shaving your legs. Don't rush through the shaving process, as you could cut yourself or miss a section of hair. Shave your legs while in a hot bath or shower. The hot water will open up your pores, allowing you to get a closer shave."

      "title": "Remove the hair on your legs by waxing.",
      "content": "Remove the hair on your legs by waxing. Waxing is a great way to get smooth, shiny legs, and the results will last much longer than shaving. Waxing is a bit painful, but is worth it if you want better, longer lasting results. Many people choose to get waxed by a professional, but you can also wax your own legs at home. Exfoliate before waxing for best results. Purchase an at-home waxing kit. This kit should contain wax (that is typically heated in the microwave) and waxing sticks and sheets. Wax your legs slowly and carefully. Apply the hot wax onto one small section of skin at a time using the waxing stick, place the waxing sheet on top of the hot wax, and press down. After about 15 seconds, quickly pull the strip upwards off your skin. Repeat this until you have waxed your legs completely.

      "content": "Get laser hair removal to permanently get rid of hair. If you are sick and tired of shaving and waxing to get rid of your unwanted leg hair, consider getting it removed permanently. This process is a bit more painful and expensive than the typical hair removal methods, but many believe it to be worth it. You can get your hair removed professionally, or you can purchase an at home laser kit. Laser hair removal typically takes 5 sessions (on average) to remove all of your hair. Each at-home laser kit is slightly different, so be sure to read the instructions carefully."

      "title": "Consider tanning.",
      "content": "Consider tanning. Some people think tanned or dark skin tends to look shinier than pale skin. If you have naturally dark or tanned skin, embrace it! All you'll need is a bit of lotion or oil to create shine. There's nothing wrong with paler skin, but if you want to go for the tanned look, you could try adding some color with natural sunlight, a tanning bed, a spray tan, or some tanning lotion. For the quickest results, get a self-tanner at your local convenience stores. These self tanners come in spray or lotion formulas. Read the instructions on the tanner you purchase for specific instructions. If you choose to tan via sunlight or a tanning bed, be careful. Too much sun can be harmful to your skin, so always wear a sunscreen. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a body shimmer. Body shimmer can be purchased at most beauty or convenience stores. It comes in spray and lotion forms, and is a great way to add a bit of sparkle to your skin. Stores like Bath & Body Works often carry body shimmers. Create your own body shimmer instead of buying one. Mix some shiny gold or silver eyeshadow into your lotion for a homemade sheen. Start by adding a small amount of eyeshadow (just a sprinkling of eyeshadow), and add more until you reach your desired shine. Apply the lotion to your legs as you normally would."

      "content": "Use makeup to add shine to your legs. Using makeup on your legs not only creates shine, but also evens out your skin tone. Natural, dew-like types of foundation are great for legs, as are shimmery powder foundations. Rub your foundation into your hands, and then apply it to your legs like a thin layer of lotion. To apply powder, use a large powder brush and use large circular motions to brush the powder onto your skin.

Some of the higher end foundations that fall into this category include Nars All-Day Luminous, Clinique Stay-Matte, and Mac Nourishing Waterproof.
