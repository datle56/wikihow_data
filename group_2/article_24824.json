      "content": "Consider getting a professional manicure. Professional nail salons have the right equipment to give you a long lasting coat of polish. If you want a really long-lasting coat that doesn't chip, you can opt for a gel manicure, which uses a super hard setting type of nail polish that acts almost like acrylic nails. For the strongest, healthiest nails, have a manicure done every two weeks, either professionally or at home. [1] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. If you are very dedicated to having long nails, you can get acrylic nails, which are fake nails that are attached to your actual nails. These nails are very, very strong but they cost more than a regular manicure and are quite a commitment."

      "content": "Apply nail polish when your nails are dry. Although there is a myth that you should soak your nails before a manicure, water on your nails will actually stop the polish from adhering correctly.

This will also stop the polish from attaching correctly. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use good quality nail polish.",
      "content": "Use good quality nail polish. More expensive nail polishes usually contain more pigment, fewer potentially toxic chemicals, and better brushes inside. That said, you don't need to spend $50 to get a quality bottle of nail polish. Balance your budget with your desire for a crisp and smooth manicure. Also avoid using quick-drying polish if you want to avoid chips. The formula of quick-drying polish, while containing the same ingredients as the regular, has different ratios of ingredients. This difference in ratio makes the polish more likely to chip. Keep your nail polish from drying out by keeping the cap on the bottle when you're not using the brush. Also, make sure to close the bottle tightly after you're finished applying your polish, and store the bottle out of sunlight.

The spots where you apply small bits of polish to fill in any chips will not be as smooth or pretty as the rest of your polish, but they will help preserve the rest of your nail polish from chipping off. This is basically a last ditch effort to save your manicure. If you can, when a coat of polish starts chipping off, simply take it off with remover and start over."
