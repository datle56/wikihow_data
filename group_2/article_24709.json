      "content": "Use shampoo formulated for oily hair. It gets your bangs clean without weighing them down. Shampoos made for “normal” or “dry” hair contain hydrating ingredients that leave a film on your bangs and make them get greasy a lot faster. Check the label and make sure the shampoo you’re using is made for oily/fine hair.

      "content": "Wash your bangs every day. Try washing your bangs every morning when you’re cleansing your face. Shampooing all of your hair every day isn’t usually recommended since that can dry it out. Your bangs rest against your forehead, though, so they’re exposed to a lot more oil throughout the day. To prevent them from getting greasy, shampoo your bangs once a day, especially if you have oily skin.

When you’re conditioning your hair, just avoid applying it on your bangs.

Carry a little bottle of it with you when you leave the house and give your bangs a quick spritz whenever they start looking oily. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The dry shampoo absorbs the oil and gives bangs a little volume so they aren’t laying flat against your forehead. Baby powder works in a pinch if you don’t have dry shampoo! Just sprinkle the baby powder on your bangs and comb through them to absorb the oil. [7] X Research source"

It’s normal for dirt, styling products, and oil to build up on hair brushes and styling tools like flat irons. If you don’t clean your tools regularly, that buildup gets transferred right back onto your bangs. [9] X Research source To clean your styling tools: Pull out the hair in your brushes once a week.

It’s hard to keep your hands off your bangs sometimes, especially if you need to rearrange them during the day! Try to avoid touching them as much as possible, though, so your bangs don't get greasy. [12] X Research source Carry a comb or pick with you and use that if you need to restyle your bangs during the day. Touching your forehead can make your skin oily, as well.

      "content": "Wash your face twice a day. Natural oils on your face can quickly get all over your bangs. To prevent greasy bangs, be sure to wash your face with a mild cleanser twice a day (morning and night). It also helps to exfoliate your forehead and hairline a few times a week to prevent dead skin cells and sebum from building up there. [14] X Research source Massage your skin gently as you’re washing it. Being too rough can irritate your skin and make pores produce extra oil. Avoid cleansers with alcohol listed in the ingredients, too. Alcohol is a harsh ingredient that causes skin irritation; irritation triggers more oil production.

Look for products that are labeled “oil-free” and “noncomedogenic.” Moisturizers, cleansers, and cosmetics often contain ingredients that clog pores and cause oily skin.

If you notice your forehead looking a bit shiny during the day, gently press a blotting paper against the skin and leave it for a few seconds to absorb the oil.
