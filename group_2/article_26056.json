Although it is valid HTML to leave the anchor element empty, some browsers will fail to find it if there's nothing between the <a> and </a> tags. [1] X Research source Simply type in the text you would like to link to: <a>My Lasagna Recipe</a> The a tag does not typically change the style of the text. [2] X Research source In this example, \"My Lasagna Recipe\" will appear as ordinary text."

      "title": "Choose a value for your id.",
      "content": "Choose a value for your id. The example above used \"anchor-name-1,\" but it's best to give your anchors a descriptive value, such as \"lasagna\" in this case. This value must be unique to this id. If another id in the same document has the same value, the browser cannot identify the single anchor you're trying to link to. In HTML4, the value must begin with a letter. Can use letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons, and periods. [3] X Research source In HTML5, you can use any character except for spaces. [4] X Research source Be careful with your cases. \"Polish\" and \"polish\" are considered the same value, and should not appear in the same document. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source [7] X Research source All modern browsers (going back quite a while) should be able to interpret this. Here are a few examples: Anchor in a header: <h2 id=\"biblio\">Bibliography</h2> Anchor in an image: <img id=\"logo\" src=\"/images/logo.png\" /> Anchor in a paragraph: <p id=\"introparagraph\">(introductory paragraph)</p> Remember that each id can only appear once per page."

However, instead of a URL as the value of the href attribute, use the # symbol followed by the anchor value. To link to the lasagna recipe in the example above, you would type: <a href=\"#lasagna\">Click here to see my lasagna recipe.</a> Use exactly the same case as you did when creating the anchor. Some browsers will not recognize \"#Lasagna\" as a link to \"lasagna.\" [8] X Research source"
