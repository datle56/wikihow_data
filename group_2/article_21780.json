Then, using a pencil or the corner of a sticky note, mark the wall at the top center edge of the letter. If you’re putting up multiple letters, make marks for each before hanging anything up to avoid issues with spacing.

      "content": "Choose an adhesive based on the size and weight of the letters. For heavier letters, grab double sided mounting tape, large hook-and-loop fastener strips, or another thick, durable adhesive. For medium-weight letters, try Command strips or a similar resealable fastener. For small letters, you may be able to use sticky tack or a generic brand of tape.

      "content": "Prepare the adhesives. If you’re using tape, rip off multiple pieces and roll them into small, hollow tubes with the sticky sides facing out. If you’re using fasteners or similar items, remove the small strips of paper covering the sticky sides of the adhesives. For tack, pull off multiple pieces and roll them into small balls.

      "content": "Press the adhesives to the back of your letter. Place the adhesives at multiple points on the back of the letter, spacing them out evenly so that each area has some support. If you’re using tape, tack, or other small adhesives, focus on joints and corners since they will help keep the letter flat against the wall. If you’re using large fasteners or hook-and-loop fastener strips, place them on long stretches of wood so they can support the bulkiest part of the letter. [7] X Research source For hook-and-loop fastener and other adhesives that come in 2 parts, press both parts together before sticking your letter to the wall."

Make sure to push down on every area containing an adhesive to ensure the letter is fully attached. If you’re using adhesives like Command strips, hold them down for the amount of time listed on the packaging."

Then, mark the top center edge of the letter with a pencil or the corner of a sticky note. To avoid spatial conflicts, make marks for every letter you intend to put up before hanging anything.

Use a drill head that can create holes larger than the nail you plan on hanging your letter from. The thicker the letter, the deeper the holes should be. If your letter came with pre-drilled holes, skip this step. [10] X Research source If your letter is symmetrical, drill 1 or more holes near the top center of the object. If your letter is not symmetrical, in addition to a hole near the top center of the object, drill holes in any areas where the weight is strangely distributed, such as the bottom hook on a ‘J.’"

Then, create small pencil marks on the wall that correspond with the holes in the back of your letter. To make sure the marks are accurate, use a tape measure to find the distance between them and compare them to the distance between the holes in your letter. Also, use a laser level or ask someone to hold a bubble level where you want the base of the letters to go. This will help you make sure the letters are straight.

Hold it up against one of your marks and, with a hammer, gently pound it into the wall. Leave enough of the nail exposed that you can easily hang your letter on it. Repeat this for each mark.
