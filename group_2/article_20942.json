      "content": "Make a list. The best way to be prepared for your trip to the grocery store is to have a list of all the items you need to buy. That way, you know exactly what you need, can avoid impulse items, and won’t leave the store having forgotten something you need. To make a comprehensive list: [1] X Research source Go through your cupboards to see what staples you're running low on. This could include flour, sugar, canned goods, rice, spices, tea, and coffee. Check your refrigerator to see if you need any fruits, vegetables, juice, or other beverages. Create a planned menu for the next week or two. Look over the recipes you'll be making and ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Look through your storage closets and pantries to see if you need any bathroom or facial tissue, soaps, dish detergents, or other household goods."

      "content": "Check flyers for sales and coupons. If you're looking to save a few dollars at the grocery store, look through store flyers or online for the items that are on sale for the week. If you find coupons for any items on your list, clip them out or make a note of the brand that’s on sale. If you have a few grocery stores nearby, compare the prices of items listed in the flyers, and make lists of what items you intend to buy at each store to get the best price. To avoid spending extra money, only use coupons and flyers for items you were already going to buy. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Get to the store.",
      "content": "Get to the store. Because you may be buying a large quantity of food, it’s always best if you can take your own vehicle or get a ride to the grocery store. Otherwise, determine a route you can walk or bike, or find what public transit routes will get you to the store you wish to shop at. Don’t forget to take your reusable shopping bags with you. If you're taking public transit or walking, consider using a rolling cart or large backpack that you can use to transport your groceries back from the store."

    {
      "title": "Grab a cart or hand basket.",
      "content": "Grab a cart or hand basket. When you get to the grocery store, locate a shopping cart (if you need a lot of items) or a hand-basket (if you only need a few items). This will make your shopping experience much easier. Shopping carts and baskets are often located near or just inside the doors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place items in your cart or basket as you shop.",
      "content": "Place items in your cart or basket as you shop. If you brought reusable bags with you, don’t use them to carry your groceries: most stores prefer that you use the carts or hand-baskets. Make sure you don’t crush smaller, delicate, or fresh produce items with larger items as you shop. If you're using a cart, use the upper section near the handle for delicate things like fruit and eggs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get fresh produce.",
      "content": "Get fresh produce. The produce section is where you'll find all the fresh fruits and vegetables on your list, such as apples, oranges, bananas, lettuce, carrots, and other produce items. While each fruit and vegetable has a different indicator of ripeness, you generally want to look for firm fruits and vegetables that aren't bruised, dented, or otherwise damaged. [3] X Research source Try to buy fruits and vegetables in all colors to ensure you're getting the maximum vitamins and nutrients from your food. Remember that fresh produce won’t last as long as frozen, so only buy what you and your family will eat over the next week or so."

      "title": "Ask for help at the deli, butcher, and seafood counters.",
      "content": "Ask for help at the deli, butcher, and seafood counters. If you want to purchase fresh or specialty meat or seafood items, line up at the various counters. Wait your turn in line if there is one, and when it’s your turn, the person behind the counter will ask if you need help. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the products. You can even ask for samples if you aren't sure you'll like something. [4] X Research source Remember that meat and seafood have short shelf lives if they aren't frozen, so only buy what you'll be able to eat."

      "title": "Get baked goods from the bakery section.",
      "content": "Get baked goods from the bakery section. The bakery section is where you'll find items like bread, buns, and baked desserts like pies and cookies. Depending on your grocery store, you may even find fresh pizza dough, bread crumbs, crackers, and other baked goods in this department. Sometimes, bakery departments will bake their own bread, and these loaves are often uncut. If you want the loaf sliced, take it to the bakery counter and ask them to slice it. Many bakery departments also make fresh cakes that are baked to order, and you can have these customized and decorated for birthdays and other events. Talk to the people behind the bakery counter to find out what services they offer."

      "title": "Locate grocery items in the aisles.",
      "content": "Locate grocery items in the aisles. All your dried, canned, and baking goods will be located in the aisles in the center of the store. This includes pasta, rice, sugar, flour, spices, crackers, and cookies, plus canned beans, soups, sauces, vegetables, and other staples. When buying canned goods, avoid cans that are dented, punctured, or bulging. Canned goods are great to have on hand, because they last much longer than fresh staples like produce, meat, and bread. [5] X Research source These center aisles are also where you'll find household items such as toilet paper and dish soap."

      "title": "Stop by the freezers and refrigerated sections.",
      "content": "Stop by the freezers and refrigerated sections. In the freezers, you'll find frozen meat, prepared foods (such as burgers or meat pies), fruits and vegetables, and side dishes and snacks (such as ice cream and French fries). The refrigerators will hold dairy products, juices, prepared foods, packaged foods, and prepackaged meats. [6] X Research source Frozen foods like fruits and vegetables that don’t have added ingredients (like salt or oil) are just as nutritious as fresh produce, and they are typically cheaper and will last longer. Just make sure you're going right home, otherwise your frozen items may start to melt! [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check out the bulk section.",
      "content": "Check out the bulk section. Some grocery stores also have items available in bulk, and this could include spices, candy, snacks, dry goods like grains and pastas, and dried fruits and staples. If you take any of these items, make sure you write down the bin number for each item. There will often be white twist ties you can use to seal your bags and write the bin numbers on. Look for pens located near the bags. When buying items in bulk, pay attention to the price per weight. Sometimes things will be price per gram, pound, or another unit of measure, and this can add up quickly. Some stores will have scales that you can use to weigh your produce or bulk items, and weighing your bags will give you an idea of the final cost of your bulk items."

      "title": "Try to avoid the junk food aisles.",
      "content": "Try to avoid the junk food aisles. These tend to be located in the very middle of the store, right in the center of all the healthy grocery staples. This is where you'll find pop, chips, candies, and other unhealthy snacks. If you can avoid going down these aisles, the junk food will be out of sight and out of mind, so you won’t be tempted to buy it. While it’s ok to indulge once in a while, junk food is not part of a healthy meal plan, and these types of foods tend to be very pricey."

      "title": "Locate the checkout counter.",
      "content": "Locate the checkout counter. For convenience, checkout counters are usually located in between entrances or near exits. Each checkout counter will likely have a number above it, and if the number is lit up, that means the lane is open to use. Most checkouts usually have express lanes that are reserved for customers who only have a few items. The express lanes will say how many items you can take through that lane. If you have more than the limit, use a regular checkout. If you're in a hurry and looking for the quickest line, look for the line with the fewest people, regardless of how many items each person has in their cart. Paying takes longer than ringing items through, so the more people have to pay, the longer checkout will take. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your items on the belt.",
      "content": "Place your items on the belt. Line up behind the last person in the checkout lane you’ve chosen, but make sure you don’t crowd them with your cart or basket. Move toward the conveyor as the line shortens. When space frees up on the conveyor belt, grab a rubber divider from the side of the checkout and place it on the belt to divide your groceries from those of the person ahead of you. Start placing your items on the belt, but don’t crowd your food so that things get squished, bruised, or dented. More room will become available to you as the cashier rings through items ahead of you. Place large items and boxes on the belt first, and leave delicate items and fresh produce until the end so that it doesn’t get crushed. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave hand baskets under the conveyor.",
      "content": "Leave hand baskets under the conveyor. Usually, grocery store conveyor belts have an open section underneath at the end of the conveyor (farthest from the cashier) where you can leave your hand basket. Once you’ve emptied all your items, place the basket here. If there are others there already, stack yours inside. If you're using a cart, however, push it through the line with you as you go."

      "title": "Provide your reusable bags.",
      "content": "Provide your reusable bags. If you brought your own bags, now’s the time to use them! Some grocery stores require the customers to bag their own groceries, and in others the cashier will provide this service. . If the cashier is bagging the groceries, hand over your reusable bags. If you're bagging your own food, place larger items in the bottom and smaller and more delicate items on top. Separate raw meats from the rest of your food by putting them in their own dedicated bag. If you are buying eggs and loaves of bread, place the carton of eggs in the bottom of one of the bags and carefully place the bread on top. It's a good idea to put this bag in the \"seat\" of the cart so you know to place it in your car last in a safe place that won't have items placed or fallen on top of it. Make sure the cashier rings items through before you bag them."

      "title": "Provide any points cards and pay.",
      "content": "Provide any points cards and pay. When the cashier has rung through your last item, hand over any points cards you have that apply to that grocery store. This could include loyalty cards for that grocery store or other points you collect. Tell the cashier how you intend to pay. This could include with cash, with a debit card, or with a credit card. Give the cashier enough to cover the bill if you're paying with cash, and don’t forget your change. Otherwise, complete the transaction on the machine."

      "title": "Place your bags in the cart.",
      "content": "Place your bags in the cart. If you're using a cart, you can place the full grocery bags back in the cart to get them to your vehicle. When you’ve paid, take your receipt and leave the store via the exit. Place your groceries into your car if you have one, or find an out-of-the-way spot where you can pull over and put your groceries into your wheeling cart or backpack. When you're done, return the cart to one of the outdoor cart corrals located in the parking lot."
