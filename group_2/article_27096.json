      "content": "Know what nutrients dogs need. A dogs digestive system is different from the human one and the balance of ingredients in homemade dog food needs to be tailored to the dogs special needs. When you cook for your dog, keep the following in mind: Dogs are carnivores, so at least half of a dog's diet should be composed of protein, which provides dogs with the nutrients and minerals they need to be strong and healthy. [1] X Research source Chicken, turkey, beef, lamb, and fish are all acceptable sources of protein for a dog. Dogs can also be fed eggs and vegetables that contain protein. Organ meat, such as liver and kidney, should only be given to your dog a few times a week. [2] X Research source Dogs may also eat grains, root and green vegetables, as long as they are thoroughly cooked. [3] X Research source Feeding dogs a vegetarian or vegan diet can hurt their digestive system, since it's tough for dogs to break down large amounts of vegetables. Supplement your dog's homemade meals with vitamins made for dogs, to make sure they get everything they need. Talk with your vet about supplements you can buy. Be especially careful to make sure your dog has enough calcium, or she may suffer bone injuries as she grows and ages. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide whether to feed your dog raw or cooked meat.

[5] X Research source Other sources claim that cooked meat is a safer choice. A raw meat diet often also include bones, which provide dogs with necessary calcium and other nutrients. [6] X Research source Conduct research to decide what type of meat you want to feed your dog. Ask your vet if you want more information on the subject."

      "title": "Cook 2.5 cups meat",
      "content": "Cook 2.5 cups meat . You may use ground beef, chicken, lamb, turkey or any other type of meat your dog likes. Cook it by frying, boiling, baking, sauteing or otherwise heating it through. Add a small amount of organ meat to this recipe every other week, to ensure your dog gets the vitamins she needs. Olive oil is safe for dogs to eat, so feel free to use it to keep meat from sticking to your pots and pans. There is no need to season the meat with salt and pepper. Dogs don't have the same taste buds that humans do, and too many spices can upset their stomachs."
