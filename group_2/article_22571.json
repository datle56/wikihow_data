      "title": "Take measurements around and beneath your sink.",
      "content": "Take measurements around and beneath your sink. Use a soft measuring tape to determine the circumference or perimeter of your sink’s bowl. Once you have an exact measurement, write it down so you can remember it later. Next, measure the distance between the lower rim of your sink bowl and the floor. Add this measurement to your notes, so you can figure out how much material you need to cover your sink. [1] X Research source If you’re measuring a circular sink, hold 1 end of the tape along the left side of the bowl’s rim, then drag it around the curve of the bowl until you reach the right side of the sink. If your sink is especially large, you might want to ask a friend or family member for help. If you’re measuring a square or rectangular sink, measure the right, left, front, and back sides of the sink individually (if applicable). Take note of each separate measurement, then add them all together to get an idea of your sink’s perimeter. If you want, you can use a meter stick or metal measuring tape for this. A sink skirt is attached beneath the rim of your sink. Depending on the type of sink you have, the location of this rim may vary. For instance, a pedestal sink generally has a curved rim. For instance, if your sink is 13 by 17 in (33 by 43 cm), your sink skirt would need to be at least 43 in (110 cm)."

      "content": "Cut out a large section of fabric that fits around your sink. Lay out a piece of fabric that’s at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger on each side than the dimensions you just measured. Use a pen and a meter stick or measuring tape to sketch out the full size of your sink skirt along with the 2 in (5.1 cm) of hem allowance. Once the full skirt length plus the extra hem is sketched out, use a pair of fabric scissors to cut out the section of fabric. [2] X Research source You can find fabric at any store that sells craft supplies. Try to select a thicker material, like canvas or burlap. Consider reusing old curtains for this type of project. For instance, if your sink is 12 by 15 in (30 by 38 cm), you’d cut out a section of fabric that’s at least 41 in (100 cm)."

      "title": "Hem",
      "content": "Hem all 4 edges of the fabric to get rid of any coarse edges. Take at least ½ in (cm) of material from the outer edges of the fabric and fold them inward. Use as many pins as you need to secure this folded section of fabric. To hold the hem in place, use a sewing needle or sewing machine to stitch along the folded edge of the hem. [3] X Research source While you don’t have to hem your material, this process will make your sink skirt look much more sleek and professional."

      "title": "Stick a length of hook-and-loop fastener along the lower rim of the sink.",
      "content": "Stick a length of hook-and-loop fastener along the lower rim of the sink. Cut a long section of hook-and-loop fastener that matches the measurement around the circumference or perimeter of your sink. Remove the adhesive backing, then press the hook-and-loop fastener firmly beneath the rim of your sink. If your sink is especially large or curved, try applying the hook-and-loop fastener in sections. Make sure that the sink has the hooked portion of the hook-and-loop fastener while the skirt has the looped side (or vice versa). [4] X Research source Follow the instructions that come with your hook-and-loop fastener tape for exact guidance on how to attach the material. You can find hook-and-loop fastener tape at any store selling craft supplies."

      "content": "Cut another piece of hook-and-loop fastener that matches the width of your sink skirt. Lay your sink skirt out on a flat surface so you can attach the hook-and-loop fastener easily. Next, arrange the hook-and-loop fastener along the edge of the upper hem. Check that the hook-and-loop fastener is arranged in a straight line along your fabric so the skirt can fit evenly around the sink. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Sew a line of hook-and-loop fastener on the top edge of your fabric skirt. Pin the length of hook-and-loop fastener in place along the upper hem of your sink skirt to hold it in place. Next, use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to stitch the hook-and-loop fastener strip into place. [6] X Research source Since your skirt will be heavy, the hook-and-loop fastener needs to be sewn onto the skirt. However, you can use an adhesive hook-and-loop fastener strip along the edge of the sink."

Once both sections of hook-and-loop fastener match up, press along the edge of your sink skirt to attach it to the sink. Continue pressing along the entire base of the sink until the fabric is securely attached. [7] X Research source If you’re using a store-bought hook-and-loop fastener sink skirt, follow the manufacturer’s instructions so you can properly set up the fabric."

      "title": "Measure the open space beneath your sink to get a better idea of your options.",
      "content": "Measure the open space beneath your sink to get a better idea of your options. Determine the height of your sink by holding a measuring tape in place beneath the lower rim of the sink bowl, then extending the tape downwards until you reach the floor. Next, extend your tape along the back edge of the sink bowl so you can get an idea of how long it is. Additionally, find the width by measuring from the wall to the front rim of the sink. [8] X Research source These measurements can be useful if you choose to place cabinets, plants, or other items beneath your sink. For instance, if your sink is 3 ft (91 cm) long, 4 ft (120 cm) tall, and 2 1 ⁄ 2 ft (76 cm) wide, you wouldn’t want to invest in a cabinet that’s 4 ft (120 cm) long, 3 ft (91 cm) high, and 3 ft (91 cm) wide. Instead, look for a cabinet that’s around 2 ft (61 cm) high, 1 1 ⁄ 2 ft (46 cm) wide, and 2 ft (61 cm) long."

Visit your local home improvement or furniture store to browse through different drawers, cabinets, and shelves. Before making any purchases, check the dimensions of the furniture against the available space beneath your sink. If you don’t want to permanently install a new fixture in your bathroom, look for smaller, portable cabinets or shelves that can be assembled and arranged in front of your sink’s pipes. [10] X Research source When shopping for cupboards or cabinets, look for items that have an opening or space in the back to store and conceal any sink pipes."

      "title": "Cover the pipes with a pedestal basin if you have a pedestal sink.",
      "content": "Cover the pipes with a pedestal basin if you have a pedestal sink. Check online or in a home improvement store and look for pedestal basins, which are covers designed to conceal the exposed pipes beneath pedestal sinks. Use the measurements of your own sink to compare the pedestal basins to the sink in your own home, and see if you can find a product that meets your needs. If you don’t have a lot of hardware expertise, a professional at your local home improvement store may be able to help you physically install the basin. [12] X Research source Pedestal basins are typically round sinks that are built into or against the bathroom wall. A basin covers the exposed pipes and serves as the “pedestal” portion of the sink. If possible, try to determine the manufacturer of your current sink—that could make it easier to find a basin that fits correctly."

      "content": "Place a tall basket or storage bin in front of the pipes as a temporary solution. Search around your home for any extra basins, bins, or other portable storage items that you could fit under the sink. If you don’t have anything on hand, visit your local furniture store, or any shop that sells storage bins or baskets. Arrange any tall baskets or storage bins in front of the sink pipes to obscure them from view. Depending on the size and curvature of your sink, this might not be a viable option. For instance, a rectangular storage bin probably won’t fit beneath a round, circular sink."

      "content": "Coat your pipes with paint if you don’t want to add any new fixtures. Set down drop cloths and plastic sheeting around and beneath your sink. To prevent any paint from dripping onto your sink, apply strips of painter’s tape around the base of the sink. Next, dip a wide, 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) paintbrush into a bucket or painting tray filled with paint designed for metal or PVC pipes. Choose a color that matches the tiling, walls, or some other feature in your room, so your pipes blend in. [13] X Research source Visit a home improvement or hardware store to find paint that’s safe to use on metal or PVC piping. Read the guidelines on your paint can to see how long the paint will take to dry. While you probably won’t bump into the pipes while you use the sink, it’s important to keep in mind in the days and hours after you apply the paint."

      "content": "Use potted plants to obscure the exposed pipes for a simple solution. Visit a plant nursery to find a large, indoor plant that you can arrange beneath your sink. Specifically, look for something that will fit within the measurements of your sink and block any view of the pipes. If you want extra coverage, purchase an additional plant to arrange beneath your sink. [14] X Research source A corn plant, olive tree, or croton might be good options to consider.
