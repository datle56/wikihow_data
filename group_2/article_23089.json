      "content": "Get to know your cat's temperament. Before attempting to hug your cat, get to know your cat's temperament. Not all cats enjoy a lot of physical contact and could scratch or bite if hugged. Make sure your cat is the affectionate type before attempting a hug. Spend time with your cat. Spend an hour or so a day in the same room as your cat. Pay attention to how she interacts with you. Does she tend to be snuggly and affectionate, rubbing her face on you? Or does she tend to be somewhat standoffish, sitting near you but not wanting much physical affection? [1] X Research source Cats that are more touchy-feely tend to be more relaxed about being picked up and handled. It's probably safe to try and hug a friendlier cat, but one that seems standoffish or shy may dislike being handled in this fashion. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn about cat body language. Even a warm and affectionate cat will lash out when frightened. Take some time to learn about cat body language so you can gauge when a cat is in a positive mood. When cats are happy, they show it with their body. Ears are generally forward slightly, pupils constricted with eyes half closed, tails straight up and curled on the top, and backs arched with fur flattened. Cats will also purr or meow quietly when happy to see you. Conversely, an aggressive or frightened cat will growl or meow loudly in a lower pitch. She will dilate her pupils, thrash her tail back and forth or tuck it between her legs, and arch her back and stick her fur up. You should not try to hug a cat in this state."

Then, gently lift her towards your chest by raising her back legs with one hand and holding her back in place with the other. Remember, not all cats like being picked up. If your cat resists being held, try hugging her by just putting your arms around her when she's sitting or lying down by her. Many cats that dislike being picked up enjoy these kinds of hugs. Cats prefer different hugging techniques depending on their personalities. However, almost all cats prefer their full body be supported during a hug. Make sure her bottom legs are supported. Try to keep one hand on her chest or back and another supporting her back legs. [3] X Research source"
