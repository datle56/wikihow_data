      "title": "The title “Luther” refers to Luther Vandross, whose song Lamar samples.",
      "content": "The title “Luther” refers to Luther Vandross, whose song Lamar samples. Vandross was a famous soul and R&B artist, and his version of the love song “If This World Were Mine” with Cheryl Lynn is sampled in “Luther,” emphasizing its romantic themes. “If This World Were Mine” is an expression of love and yearning for a world defined by that love; “Luther” picks up this idea and expands on it. [2] X Research source In “Luther,” Lamar raps about wishing he could shape a better world for his partner and help her thrive, using samples from “If This World Were Mine” to set the stage."

      "title": "In the first verse, Lamar raps about protecting and uplifting his partner.",
      "content": "In the first verse, Lamar raps about protecting and uplifting his partner. The verse goes, “Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it’s hot / If this world was mine, I’d take your dreams and make ‘em multiply / If this world was mine, I’d take your enemies in front of God / Introduce ‘em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire.” [3] X Research source “Roman numeral seven” is a reference to the Bible, in which the number seven represents divine completeness—and implying that Lamar’s partner similarly completes him. “Drop it like it’s hot” is a reference to Snoop Dogg’s single “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” It’s also a playful reference to the dance move, encouraging Lamar’s partner to join in the dance. “If this world was mine, I’d take your dreams and make ‘em multiply” reflects Lamar’s wish to support his partner’s dreams and help her grow. “If this world was mine, I’d take your enemies in front of God, introduce ‘em to that light…” is Lamar saying he wants to protect his partner—so much that he’d go after her enemies with divine wrath."

      "title": "The chorus highlights the challenges and growth in relationships.",
      "content": "The chorus highlights the challenges and growth in relationships. Lamar and SZA sing, “In this world, concrete flowers grow / Heartache, she only doin’ what she know / Weekends, get it poppin’ on the low / Better days comin’ for sure / If this world were— / If it was up to me / I wouldn’t give these nobodies no sympathy / I’d take away the pain, I’d give you everything / I just wanna see you win, wanna see / If this world were mine.” [4] X Research source “In this world, concrete flowers grow” compares flowers blooming through concrete to the beauty of a resilient relationship that flourishes despite any obstacles, and implying that partners can still grow, even in tough times. “Heartache, she only doin’ what she know” conveys the idea that people with past traumas sometimes do unhealthy things because that’s what they already know, tying into the idea that this can be a challenge in relationships. “Weekends, get it poppin’ on the low” is possibly a reference to SZA’s 2017 song “The Weekend,” which is about having a casual relationship only on the weekend. “Better days comin’ for sure…I’d take away the pain, I’d give you everything / I just wanna see you win” expands on the desire to make life better for your partner, take away their pain, and help them succeed. “If this world were mine” is a sample from “If This World Were Mine,” continuing the reference to that song throughout “Luther.”"

      "content": "In the second verse, Lamar explores his connection with his partner. The verse goes, “Baby, you a star, strike, pose / When I’m (When you), with you (With me), everything goes (Slow) / Come and (Put that), put that (On my), on my (Titi), soul (Soul).” [5] X Research source This verse is full of imagery that captures the intimacy between partners—how Lamar feels when he’s with his partner and vice versa, as shown in “It go in (When you), out (Ride it), do it real slow (Slide).” “Baby, you a star, strike, pose” is more playful—it’s Lamar talking about his partner’s confidence, charm, and allure. “When I’m (When you), with you (With me), everything goes (Slow)” conveys the idea that Lamar and his partner feel calmer and more peaceful when they’re together."

      "title": "The third verse is a final pronouncement of love and commitment.",
      "content": "The third verse is a final pronouncement of love and commitment. It goes, “I can’t lie / I trust you, I love you, I won’t waste your time / I turn it off so I can turn you on / I’ma make you say it loud / I’m not even trippin’, I won’t stress you out / I might even settle down for you, I’ma show you I’m a pro / I’ma take my time and turn it off / Just so I can turn you on, baby.” [6] X Research source The verse begins with “I can’t lie / I trust you, I love you, I won’t waste your time ,” showing how precious the relationship is to Lamar—and how committed he is to his partner. “ I turn it off so I can turn you on” (and later, “ I’ma take my time and turn it off / Just so I can turn you on, baby” ) is Lamar saying he’ll tune out the rest of the world so he can give his partner all the attention she deserves. “ I’ma make you say it loud / I’m not even trippin’, I won’t stress you out / I might even settle down for you,” is another expression of commitment, showing Lamar’s willingness to “settle down” for his partner."

      "title": "Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s chemistry elevates the song.",
      "content": "Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s chemistry elevates the song. Their voices create a sort of balance between Lamar’s rap verses and SZA’s lovely vocals, particularly in the chorus. SZA’s vocals also become more prominent in later verses of the song. When SZA and Lamar’s voices come together, the result is pleasant-sounding and melodious, helping to convey the song’s core themes—love, longing, and the lift up one’s partner. Lamar and SZA have collaborated several times (as friends for around a decade who were once signed under the same label), and “Luther” is considered one of their best creative collaborations to date."

      "content": "The song was accompanied by a concept art music video. The video includes Lamar, SZA, and love interests for each of them: visual artist Annahstasia Enuke as Lamar’s love interest and model Geron McKinley as SZA’s. Original samples of “If This World Were Mine” are intercut throughout the video—and for its last minute, the first verse of Vandross’ song plays out in its entirety. [7] X Research source The video primarily features scenes between each couple, plus some scenes of Lamar and SZA singing their parts individually in between. It was shot at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, as well as the Brandeis-Bardin Campus of American Jewish University and its House of the Book. This is also where the teaser for GNX was shot."

      "content": "“Luther” blends hip-hop and freestyle, plus modern and ‘80s R&B. It begins with smooth classical guitar riffs and a sample from “If This World Were Mine,” a duet between Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn; that sample recurs throughout “Luther.” Lamar’s first verse is performed in a monotone; the second and third are accompanied by double vocal tracking and orchestrals, while Lamar and SZA harmonize in the chorus. [8] X Research source “Luther” was written by Kendrick Lamar, SZA, Ink, and Sam Dew. Vandross and Lynn’s “If This World Were Mine” was actually a cover of the original song sun by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell."

      "content": "The song has earned critical acclaim and worldwide popularity. Critics praised Lamar and SZA’s chemistry, as well as their clever take on a love song and the soft tenderness of the song compared with the other tracks on GNX, Lamar’s sixth studio album. Comparatively, the other songs are bolder and full of swagger; “Luther” stuck out as more sincere and from the heart. [9] X Research source True to all the acclaim it received, “Luther” also did well on the charts. It debuted at #3 on the US’ Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at #1 in New Zealand, the Philippines, and Singapore (as well as the US). It became Lamar and SZA’s longest-running chart-topper after 8 weeks at the top of the chart.
