      "content": "Fill an empty nail polish bottle ¾ full with clear school glue. You can buy empty nail polish bottles from cosmetics stores, or you can clean out a bottle that you have at home. Take any clear school glue you have and squeeze it into the nail polish bottle. Leave a quarter of the bottle empty so there’s room to add some water. [1] X Research source If you don’t have clear glue, white school glue may also work but it could look slightly hazy once it dries."

    {
      "title": "Top off the bottle with water.",
      "content": "Top off the bottle with water. Use a pipette or funnel so it’s easier to pour your water into the bottle. Slowly add water until it reaches the neck of the bottle. Otherwise, if you fill the bottle up to the brim, the polish could spill out as soon as you put the brush in. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake the bottle to mix the polish.",
      "content": "Shake the bottle to mix the polish. Screw the cap onto your bottle of polish so none of it spills out. Vigorously shake the bottle until the water and glue are thoroughly combined. When you see little bubbles throughout the entire mixture, then it’s ready to apply! [3] X Research source Shake the polish every time before you use it just in case the glue and water separate."

      "content": "Put 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of school glue in a bowl. You can use either clear or white school glue since they’ll both dry transparent, though white school glue might look a little hazier. Pour your glue into an empty nail polish bottle or a small bowl. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Add about 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of hand sanitizer.",
      "content": "Add about 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of hand sanitizer. You can use any store-bought hand sanitizer to help thin out your glue. Just squirt a little bit into the same bowl as your glue. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Combine the mixture.",
      "content": "Combine the mixture. Give the bottle a good shake or stir the ingredients together with a spoon until they’re both thoroughly combined. Once the polish has an even consistency, you’re ready to apply it to your nails. [6] X Research source"

Dip a nail polish brush into your homemade polish, and wipe off the excess on the edge of the bowl or bottle. Just drag the tip of the brush across your nail in a long, smooth stroke. Cover your entire nail with the polish so it’s completely protected. [8] X Research source Avoid applying your polish in thick layers since it will take longer to dry and give your nails a bumpy, uneven surface.

      "content": "Let your nails dry completely. It usually takes around 10 minutes for your nails to dry, so just sit and relax. Be careful not to touch your nails or do anything with your hands that could scratch or stick to the wet polish. Once your nails feel dry and not tacky, then they’re ready. [10] X Research source You can also point a hair dryer at your nails to help them dry faster. Homemade polishes usually last for 4–5 days. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Paint over the polish if you want to use it as a base coat. If you want to temporarily apply another color to your nails, paint a layer directly over the homemade polish once it’s dry. Whenever you want to get rid of the top color, just pick along the edges of your nail with some tweezers to peel the polish off easily. [12] X Research source This works extremely well since it allows you to remove polish without any remover."
