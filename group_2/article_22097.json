      "content": "Get your Sim pregnant. To have twins or even triplets, your Sim has to be pregnant. To get a Sim pregnant, the two Sims of opposite gender must have a high romantic relationship. The Relationship bar will need to be almost full for pregnancy to occur. When the Sims are getting intimate, there will be a \"Try for Baby\" option in the Romance menu. You must use this option; WooHoo does not result in pregnancy. If you hear a lullaby sound when they are done, and the female Sim no longer has the option to run somewhere, your Sim is pregnant."

Once your Sim is pregnant, she should constantly be watching Kidz Zone on TV, listening to the Children’s Music radio station, and reading pregnancy books. You have several in-game days before the birth, and the mother should be performing these actions as much as possible. Try to keep the mother happy during the pregnancy so that you have some control over the traits of the new infants."
