She says, “There is a true grieving process that happens in a breakup just like if you lost somebody to death.” She recommends navigating the five stages of grief: “Don’t try to cover up your grief with drugs or alcohol, or overeating or avoiding, or just getting into another relationship,” she advises. “You really need to process it and heal.”"

Befriending yourself during this time will only increase your potential for love.” Additionally, Broennimann encourages that you feel all your feelings instead of trying to avoid them. “Don’t be afraid of the deep longing and desire for a relationship if that is what you really want. In fact, sink into it, feel the pain of not having it. This is the transformative fire that prepares us for a healthier love,” she recommends. Schewitz suggests reflecting on the relationship in order to give yourself closure. She says, “One thing that really helps is understanding how you may have contributed to the breakup— not to place blame—but just to make yourself understand.” She explains that it’s easy to slip into victim mode when we're going through a breakup, but really, it can really be such a great time for personal growth and development."

She says, “Remember that once harassment, or any types of intimidation, cruelty, or abuse show up in your relationship— you no longer owe that person any social etiquette!” She recommends that you block their telephone number and social media."
