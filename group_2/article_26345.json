Though her brown-haired days are lesser known, a younger Marilyn did sport her natural brown locks with more frizzy, compact curls, and looked cute and natural.

      "content": "Get the hairdo. If you really want to have hair like Marilyn's, then you should get a layered, shoulder length cut, with shorter layers in the front and longer layers in the back. Once you've got this look down, you can give your hair extra volume by combing some gel into it while it's damp and then blow-drying it dry in sections. If your hair is more curly, then you may want to straighten it a bit first. Once your hair is dry, you should separate it in sections and spray each section with spray gel, and then set it in hot rollers. Once the rollers have set, you can remove them and brush your hair out, in a forward direction, and then add a bit more hairspray under your layers. Marilyn Monroe didn't have bangs. However, she did have a chunk of hair in a wave over her forehead. For extra bounce, flip your hair back and then work a bit of styling cream through it. Unlike today's celebrities, Marilyn Monroe didn't change her hair style, color, or length every other week. Her hair was pretty much always blonde and curly, falling just below her ears in the front and just above her neck in the back. However, she did experiment a bit with how curly it was, and sometimes had it more coiled and shorter and sometimes a bit longer and more wavy."

[2] X Research source Apply at least one or two coats of lash-lengthening black mascara to your eyes. Marilyn was known for her long lashes. You can even opt for fake lashes for fun, or use an eyelash curler to make those lashes more dramatic. A bit of black eyeliner along the top eyelid can also help emphasize your eyes.

Unfortunately, though you may have heard she would be a size 12-16 today, with today's sizes, she would be more of a size 4-6. [4] X Research source She looked absolutely gorgeous at this size, and you shouldn't try to mimic it, but rather, work to be proud of your body and your curves. [5] X Research source Stay healthy and happy with your body by doing at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether you're jogging or doing yoga. Do dumbbell exercises daily to keep your arms toned. Every morning except for Sundays, Marilyn would workout using \"bust-firming\" moves with her 3-pound dumb-bells. You can try eating like Marilyn on occasion, if you want to see what it was like. She would drink a cup of warm milk with 2 raw eggs whipped together in the milk for breakfast and claimed to eat steak, beef, or liver with at least 10 raw carrots for dinner. During the day she would mostly snack on fruit and veggies. After evening drama classes, she went out for hot-fudge sundaes. Try taking ice-baths, if you can stand it. This will instantly firm up your body. Marilyn did this before her birthday song for John F. Kennedy. She actually took them quite regularly. Marilyn was known for her curves. If you're not curvy yourself, work to create the illusion with your clothes, including padded bras and girdles. For example, a belt cinched in around your waist will instantly give you a sexy, hourglass shape."

      "content": "Have sex appeal. Marilyn Monroe is an icon known for her extreme sexiness. While you don't have to take it this far, you should work to be a bit playful and sexy, if you want to be more like Marilyn. This doesn't mean you should wear completely revealing clothes, but that you should show off a little leg or shoulder and not be afraid to flaunt what you've got. To have sex appeal, you don't put it all out there at once. You smile, you bat your eyes a little, you look down at the floor to be a bit coy and then straight ahead to show how confident you are. You have to know how sexy you are before other people believe it. Part of Marilyn's sex appeal is in her mixture of sex goddess aura as well as her innocence. You don't need to be too forward to be sexy like Marilyn. She was also a bit of a goofball, especially in movies like The Seven Year Itch . Don't think that you have to be serious all the time to be sexy. Some of her sexiness lies in her silly nature. Work on developing a low, sensual, and breathy voice. Marilyn had a very seductive voice. If you like, you can try slipping some of her sayings, such as, \"Isn't it wonderful,” into your daily conversations."

      "title": "Maintain your confidence.",
      "content": "Maintain your confidence. To complete the Marilyn look, you have to show how confident you are about who you are and how you look. Don't worry about what other people think about you and be happy doing your own thing, whether this means dating a baseball player or dancing the tango. The most important thing is that you believe in who you are and don't let gossip or rumors make you feel bad about yourself. Walk with a seductive wiggle in your hips, by placing one foot in front of the other. Use body language to show how confident you are. Keep a smile on your face, even if you're having a bad day. Work to cultivate optimism and a positive energy will radiate around you, just as it did with Marilyn. She didn't have the easiest life, but she tried to stay upbeat in spite of the challenges she faced."

      "title": "Don't let anyone stop you.",
      "content": "Don't let anyone stop you. Marilyn Monroe grew up with a mentally unstable mother who had her living with a series of foster parents; she never knew her father. She began working in a munitions factory after high school, spraying airplane parts and inspecting parachutes, before she was discovered for her beauty. She had three tumultuous marriages and many more affairs, and yet, she continued to perform, to sing, to dance, and to light up the stage. If you want to rock her attitude, then you have to keep going in spite of the hardship. If Marilyn had listened to the people who told her she would be better off as a secretary than trying to make it on the big screen, then she wouldn't have gotten anywhere. Adopt her can-do attitude and know that the sky's the limit."
