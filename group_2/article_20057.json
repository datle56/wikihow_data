      "title": "Remove the laces from the shoes.",
      "content": "Remove the laces from the shoes. The laces of your shoes are likely made of cotton or other fabrics or materials that can easily be burned by a hot iron. Take out the laces so they’re protected and the shoes are easier to stuff and de-wrinkle. [1] X Research source Consider washing cotton laces so they’re extra fresh when you replace them after getting the creases out of your shoes. Ironing works well to remove wrinkles and creases from leather shoes, sneakers, and suede shoes."

      "content": "Stuff the shoes with paper towels, rags, or a shoe tree. Stretching the toe box (the front of the shoe) will tighten the material of your shoes, making it easier to iron and get the wrinkles out of them. Use a shoe tree to stretch out the shoes, or fill the insides of both shoes with enough material to keep them packed tight. [2] X Research source Avoid using newspaper or colored paper, as the ink could stain your shoes. Use clean towels or rags so you don’t get any dirt on the inside of your sneakers or dress shoes."

      "content": "Fill an iron with water and set it between 60–80 °F (16–27 °C). Pour enough water into your iron so that it’s able to steam up when you use it. Set it to a relatively low temperature so it doesn’t singe or damage the material. Let the iron heat up fully before you use it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Dampen a white towel and lay it over the shoe.",
      "content": "Dampen a white towel and lay it over the shoe. Use a white towel so the dye from the fabric can’t stain or discolor your shoes. Wet the towel and squeeze out the excess water so that it’s damp but not saturated. Lay the damp towel over the surface of your sneakers or shoes. The water will help protect the surface of your shoes from the heat. [4] X Research source If the towel is too wet, it could warp or damage your shoes, especially if they’re suede."

    {
      "title": "Iron over the top of the towel to remove the wrinkles.",
      "content": "Iron over the top of the towel to remove the wrinkles. Once your iron has heated completely, place it against the damp towel covering your shoe. Move the iron in a gentle, circular motion to smooth out any creases or wrinkles. Keep the iron moving so it doesn’t sit for too long in one spot, as this could damage the material. Check the shoe every few seconds to make sure there is no scorching or burning. [5] X Research source Move the towel as needed to iron out all the wrinkles from the entire surface of both shoes. If the towel starts to dry out from the heat, add a little more water to dampen it again. Just make sure it isn’t saturated."

      "title": "Remove the damp cloth and let the shoes dry.",
      "content": "Remove the damp cloth and let the shoes dry. Once both shoes are ironed, take off the damp towel so the water doesn’t soak into the surface. Allow the shoes to air dry for a few hours until they’re dry to the touch. Leave the shoes stuffed until they cool. [6] X Research source If there are still some wrinkles or creases after they dry, repeat the ironing process to smooth them out even more."

      "title": "Steam leather shoes to remove wrinkles.",
      "content": "Steam leather shoes to remove wrinkles. If you have a steamer, repeat the same process you would use with an iron to remove creases. [7] X Research source If you don’t, dampen a cloth or towel and place it in a heat-resistant, microwave-safe dish. Then, heat it in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. Rub the steamy towel over the creased leather to heat it up. Then, insert a shoe tree or stuff the toe with rags so the shoe holds its shape while it cools. You may need to heat the towel more than once to remove all the creases. Let the shoe dry completely before removing the shoe tree."

      "title": "Blow dry shoes to remove deep creases.",
      "content": "Blow dry shoes to remove deep creases. Insert a pair of shoe trees into your shoes, then turn a blow dryer onto the lowest setting. Hold it 8-10 inches (20-25 cm) away from the shoes, and run the blow dryer back and forth a few times to heat the shoes. Then, use your finger to rub the warm leather against the shoe tree. Repeat as necessary until the creases are gone, and keep the shoe trees in place until the shoes cool completely. [8] X Research source Don’t hold the blow dryer in one spot for too long or you could warp the leather. Move it back and forth across both shoes."

      "title": "Apply leather oil to smooth out newer creases.",
      "content": "Apply leather oil to smooth out newer creases. Prevent wrinkles and creases from setting in and getting worse by smoothing them out with leather oil or leather conditioner as soon as you notice them. Add a few drops of high-quality leather oil onto the crease and gently rub it into the surface with a soft, dry cloth. Use your hands to stretch out the leather as you massage the oil into it. Condition the entire shoe, not just the creases, to create a consistent appearance. [9] X Research source For the best results, use a shoe tree after you’ve conditioned the leather to help the shoe hold its shape as it dries. Before applying the oil or conditioner, test it in an inconspicuous location to make sure there’s no discoloration. Similarly, use shoe-stretching spray to get rid of wrinkles and creases. In general, this works the same way as applying leather oil, but be sure to follow the product’s instructions to use it properly. Draper says to restore leather and prevent wrinkles, “Make sure that your leather is nourished annually, or more often depending on how often you wear the [shoes].” [10] X Expert Source Moe Draper Shoe Care & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2021."

      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol and a shoe tree for older creases. Mix together equal parts water and rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the crease and gently work into the leather with your hands. Slide shoe trees into the shoes and expand them to stretch out the creases until the shoes dry. [11] X Research source Leave the stretchers in the shoes until you’re ready to wear them so the shoes hold their shape. Be careful not to use too much alcohol, as this could dry the shoes out."

      "title": "Store your shoes with a shoe tree inside.",
      "content": "Store your shoes with a shoe tree inside. Whenever you aren’t wearing your leather sneakers or dress shoes, insert a shoe tree so they hold their shape. Expand the tree enough to tighten the leather so there aren’t any wrinkles or creases. In addition to preventing new creases , this can also slowly eliminate existing wrinkles and bring your shoes back to their original shape. [12] X Research source If you have boots, stuff them with pool noodles for a more affordable option! Draper says the most effective way to prevent creasing is to “Pay attention to your walk pattern, to not bend down and make creases in them, and to keep shoe trees in the shoes to prevent further creasing when the shoes are not being worn.” [13] X Expert Source Moe Draper Shoe Care & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2021."

      "title": "Buy shoes made of quality materials.",
      "content": "Buy shoes made of quality materials. Shoes can be expensive, but investing in a high-quality pair will usually save you money in the long run. The best shoes are often made of durable leather and suede. Shoes made from lower quality materials, like synthetic material, are more susceptible to creasing. However, be aware that some high-quality leathers may still crease more than others. [14] X Research source If you own a pair of creased shoes and can’t seem to remove the wrinkles, consider buying a new pair. New shoes shouldn’t have existing wrinkles, and this way you can take extra steps to ensure they don’t get creases, like storing them with a shoe tree and applying leather polish."

      "title": "Make sure your shoes fit properly.",
      "content": "Make sure your shoes fit properly. Shoes that are too big tend to crease more because there’s extra space between the foot and the shoe. When shopping for shoes, be sure to try them on so you know they fit properly . [15] X Research source If you have shoes that are too big, consider wearing shoe inserts so they have a tighter fit. Draper says it’s also possible to shrink leather shoes that have become too stretched out: “To shrink down shoes that are too loose, take them to your local cobbler, shoe repair, or shoe maker to have them reshaped. It may require modifying the sole so that the shoe does not go back to the stretched out shape. These modifications only work on high quality leather shoes.” [16] X Expert Source Moe Draper Shoe Care & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2021."

      "title": "All shoes will probably crease at some point.",
      "content": "All shoes will probably crease at some point. This includes sneakers, boots, dress shoes, and practically any other footwear. This is because as you wear them, the movement of your feet bends the shoe, causing creases over time. Creasing is normal; if your shoes didn’t bend and move with you, it would be very uncomfortable! [17] X Research source If you want to walk without creasing your shoes , train yourself to walk heel-to-toe and maintain good posture. Even then, the shoes may still wrinkle over time."
