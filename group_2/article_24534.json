Both personalities value the gradual process of dating. [1] X Research source Be careful with: Getting to know each other.

      "content": "ENTJ ISTPs and ENTJs balance each other's faults. Although it may seem opposing on paper, an ENTJ and ISTP make a compatible pair. An ISTP’s ability to listen adheres to an ENTJ’s love for talking. Both are efficient and organized workers who aren’t afraid to get the job done. To bond: Play 20 questions to get to know each other at a surface level. Be careful with: Communication. ISTPs prefer to listen, while ENTJs like to talk—remember to switch roles to get the most out of the relationship."

      "title": "ENTP",
      "content": "ENTP An ISTP and ENTP’s combined curiosity is certainly a force to be reckoned with. This relationship pairing is perfect for problem-solving and forming new ideas. Although ISTPs and ENTPs may differ in how they socialize, their love for anything creative ultimately brings them together. To bond: Swap fun facts. ISTPs and ENTPs love blowing people’s minds. Be careful with: Setting boundaries . ISTPs value their time alone, while ENTPs don’t mind being in a crowd. Over time, this could cause conflict."

      "content": "ISTP At the end of the day, ISTPs make suitable pairs for each other. They get each other inside and out, making them ideal companions. They understand each other’s need for alone time and value hard work and creativity. [2] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source To bond: Live in the moment together. ISTPs value making the most of the day, so jump on every wild and spontaneous date idea. Be careful with: Being too analytical. ISTPs are notorious for being emotionless in decision-making. While this can sometimes be a blessing, it can also be a curse. Reader Poll: We asked 479 wikiHow readers and 68% of them agreed that the best way to make a decision is by carefully analyzing and researching first. [Take Poll] So, this approach may be a good first step toward making decisions harmoniously."

      "title": "INFP",
      "content": "INFP Although they’re both introverts, ISTPs and INFPs clash romantically. While ISTPs are analytical and practical, INFPs are idealistic dreamers. An INFP craves romantic intimacy and dreams of a happily ever after. [3] X Research source On the other hand, an ISTP values space and freedom. [4] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source This difference in romantic preference can be a big deal breaker for these personality types. To bond: Do a creative activity together, like painting, writing a story, or going to a museum. Be careful with: Mutual respect. If given enough time, INFPs can make an effort to respect an ISTP’s need for freedom, even if it goes against their ideal version of a partner."

      "title": "ENFP",
      "content": "ENFP An ENFP’s romantic and hopeful energy can irritate an ISTP. These types are far from compatible because they need different things from their partners. ENFPs want partners they can explore the world and share every waking moment with. [5] X Research source On the contrary, ISTPs need a partner who can give them space to grow and thrive on their own. [6] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source To bond: Do something active together, like hiking or rock climbing.

INFJs are attracted to core values and emotional connections over physical appearances. [7] X Research source ISTPs, on the other hand, struggle to open up emotionally. Physical intimacy is usually the closest they’ll get to an emotional connection in a relationship. [8] X Research source To bond: Do a puzzle-solving activity together, like a puzzle or escape room.

      "content": "ENFJ An ENFJ’s commitment may be overwhelming for an ISTP. When ENFJs fall in love, they fall in love hard. They’re not afraid to show their emotions and make the first move, and although this may excite an ISTP, it may also terrify them. ISTPs aren’t against sudden romances, but the intensity of an ENFJ’s passion may throw them for a loop. [9] X Research source To bond: Do something fun and spontaneous together. ENFJs and ISTPs love a good adventure. Be careful with: Moving too fast. ISTPs aren’t opposed to quick-burning relationships, but they’re unwilling to express their emotions immediately."
