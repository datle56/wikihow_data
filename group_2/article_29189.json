      "title": "Cut a piece of paper down to the same size as an ice block stick.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of paper down to the same size as an ice block stick. Place an ice block stick on top of the paper and trace around it with a pencil. Take the ice block stick off the paper and cut around the line with a pair of scissors. [1] X Research source You will need 2 wide ice block sticks for this activity. Look for ice block sticks that are about 1 in (2.5 cm) wide. [2] X Research source Thin printer paper works best for this activity. Avoid using thick paper or card, as this makes it difficult to create a sound when you blow on the harmonica. Make sure that your paper doesn’t have any creases or folds in it."

      "title": "Place the paper in between the 2 ice block sticks.",
      "content": "Place the paper in between the 2 ice block sticks. This creates the body of the harmonica. Lie the paper flat on top of 1 of the ice block sticks so that it covers the entire stick. Cover the paper with the remaining ice block stick. [3] X Research source Purchase ice block sticks from a supermarket or a craft store."

      "title": "Wrap a rubber band around the left end of the harmonica 7 times.",
      "content": "Wrap a rubber band around the left end of the harmonica 7 times. Secure the sticks and the paper together with a rubber band, 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the left end of the ice block sticks. Continue to wrap the rubber band around the harmonica until the band sits firmly against the sticks. Thin rubber bands work best for this task. However, if you only have thick rubber bands, use these instead."

    {
      "title": "Slide a toothpick on top of the paper, to the right of the rubber band.",
      "content": "Slide a toothpick on top of the paper, to the right of the rubber band. Place a toothpick in between the top ice block stick and the paper. Position the toothpick so that it touches the right side of the rubberband [4] X Research source Purchase toothpicks from a grocery store. If you don’t have toothpicks, use thin skewers instead."

      "title": "Secure the right end of the harmonica with a rubber band.",
      "content": "Secure the right end of the harmonica with a rubber band. Place a rubber band 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the right end of the ice block sticks. Wrap the rubber band around the harmonica 7 times, or until the band sits firmly against the sticks. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place a toothpick under the paper at the right end of the harmonica.",
      "content": "Place a toothpick under the paper at the right end of the harmonica. Slide the second toothpick to the right of the rubber band, in between the bottom ice block stick and the paper. Try not to crease the paper as you push the toothpick into the harmonica. [6] X Research source The toothpicks give more room for the paper in the harmonica to vibrate. This helps to increase the volume of sound that the instrument can produce."

    {
      "title": "Trim the ends of the toothpicks with scissors.",
      "content": "Trim the ends of the toothpicks with scissors. Cut off any toothpick that sticks outside of the ice block sticks. This prevents the sticks from poking you in the face when you are playing the harmonica. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the ends of the harmonica and blow through the middle section.",
      "content": "Hold the ends of the harmonica and blow through the middle section. Place your lips on either side of the ice block sticks and blow firmly through the harmonica. Exhale lightly through the harmonica to make a quieter sound. [8] X Research source You can use these same techniques with a store-bought harmonica. Keep your tongue inside your mouth as you blow the harmonica."

      "title": "Suck the air through the harmonica to make a different sound.",
      "content": "Suck the air through the harmonica to make a different sound. Place your lips on the middle of the harmonica and take a breath in. Listen to the different sound that the harmonica makes. Try breathing in quickly and then slowly, to vary the sound that the harmonica makes. [9] X Research source If the harmonica isn’t making any noise, try breathing in more vigorously."

    {
      "title": "Hold down the middle of the harmonica while you blow to vary the pitch.",
      "content": "Hold down the middle of the harmonica while you blow to vary the pitch. Pinch the middle section of the harmonica between your thumb and index finger. Blow vigorously through the harmonica to make a louder sound. Tighten your pinch on the harmonica to increase the pitch of the sound. [10] X Research source If the harmonica isn’t making any sound, loosen your grip on the harmonica and blow more firmly."
