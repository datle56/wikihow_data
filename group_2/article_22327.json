Wrap an ice pack in a towel and press it against the injured area. Hold it there for 15-20 minutes at a time, and repeat this treatment 3-4 times per day for 2 days after the injury.

If heat and ice aren’t enough to reduce the pain, you can take an NSAID pain reliever daily while your back heals. These medications relieve the pain, but also reduce swelling and inflammation, which helps your back heal faster.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Common NSAIDS are ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin. In general, it’s best to start with the lowest effective dose (typically 200 mg every 4-6 hours) and gradually increase to a higher dose, such as 400 mg every 4-6 hours, if that doesn’t work.

After resting for a day or 2, start moving around again. Do simple household tasks that don’t require a lot of lifting or bending. Staying active like this helps keep your back loose and makes the healing process faster. [24] X Research source Let your pain determine the activities you can and can’t do. If something increases your pain, then skip it. Do not lift any heavy objects for at least a few days. If you have to strain at all, then the object is probably too heavy. Even if your back feels okay, it still needs more time to heal before you can lift things. Don’t try to start exercising again yet. Just do light activities that don’t stress your back."

Maintaining good posture is a good thing to do at all times, not just when you have an injury. It can prevent future back pain. Avoid prolonged sitting as much as possible. If you have to sit for a long time, try to shift your position frequently. When you’re driving, use a soft pillow to support your back."

To prevent future injuries, always follow a thorough warm-up and stretching regimen before you exercise. Don’t stretch before you’ve warmed up a bit.
