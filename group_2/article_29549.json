      "content": "Gather your supplies. Depending on what type of house you want to make, you'll need some different supplies. However, all of them are simple and easy to acquire. To make an origami house you need just one sheet of origami or regular paper, scissors, and a marker or pen. Making a paper dollhouse is slightly more complex but still easy enough. You should have 10 to 11 sheets of paper, a pen or pencil, tape, and scissors. If you want to build a paper fairy house you'll need paper, water, a small bowl, a tray or plate."
