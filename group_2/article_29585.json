      "content": "Take a clicker pen apart. Unscrew the parts on the barrel that come apart. Yours may come apart in 2 or 3 pieces. Pull the ink chamber and spring out of the barrel. Press something into the back end of the pen to push the plunger part and thrust device out. [1] X Research source If the tip doesn't unscrew, you'll need to carefully cut it off with scissors."

      "title": "Pull the thrust tube off the thrust device.",
      "content": "Pull the thrust tube off the thrust device. When the thrust device falls out, take the thrust tube (the small cap) off the thrust device, which is round with a piece sticking out one end. [2] X Research source Place the plunger back in the pen, which is the part that covers the thrust device at the end."

      "title": "Make the hole of the barrel on the clicker side smaller using pliers.",
      "content": "Make the hole of the barrel on the clicker side smaller using pliers. When your pen came apart, it should have unscrewed near the clicker end. Find the end of the clicker that fits back in the barrel. Use the pliers to bend the edges of that tube toward the middle. [3] X Research source You're basically making the hole smaller to hold the spring and thrust device back until you hit the plunger at the end of the pen."

      "title": "Put the spring back in the end.",
      "content": "Put the spring back in the end. Find the spring that you took out a minute ago. Slip it into the part that you just made narrower. It should easily fit in this hole, as the spring is much smaller than the barrel. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Insert the thrust device from the clicker over the spring. The thrust device has a small cylinder and then a piece sticking out one end. Put the piece sticking out down toward the spring. It should go through the center of the spring while the cylinder will meet up with the end of the spring. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Press the thrust device down so it stays below the edge of the tube.",
      "content": "Press the thrust device down so it stays below the edge of the tube. Use the tip of the ink chamber to press the end of the thrust device you just set in place. Press down until the edge of it goes under the edge of the barrel you made narrower. It should stay in place after you press down. [6] X Research source If it doesn't stay in place, take the spring and thrust device out and work on making the end of the barrel narrower. Then, try again. Test this part of the gun by pressing the end of the pen. It should shoot the parts out that you just put in place. Put those parts back together."

Screw it into the clicker end, just like you normally would when putting a pen back together. Make sure it is tightly screwed in. [7] X Research source Don't forget to leave the tip of the pen off."

Press down lightly on the plunger at the end of the pen to shoot the ink chamber out. [9] X Research source You can also use skewers or toothpicks.

Pull the ink chamber out, as well as the spring. [10] X Research source If your pen's tip doesn't unscrew, you can cut it off with scissors. Otherwise, you can just use the barrel from a non-clicker pen instead. You need a long, empty tube."

Cut the end of it off so that it is the same length as the pen barrel. [11] X Research source You can get small wooden dowels at craft stores or home improvement stores. You could also try a skinny pencil."

Drill one hole about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the end of the dowel or even a little less and another about the same distance down from that one. Go through the dowel with the hole. The holes should be large enough to fit a paperclip and a rubber band through, respectively. [12] X Research source It may take a few tries to get this right. You'll need a very small bit."

Round it so it makes a rough circle and pull the ends together opposite the hole in the wood. [13] X Research source The paperclip should hang over the end of the piece of wood. It will act as the trigger for the gun."
