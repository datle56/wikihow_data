      "content": "Watch something funny. Just as scary movies cause you to experience fear and anxiety, [1] X Research source watching a funny movie, video, or television show can make you feel happy. Laughing decreases your stress and causes your body to release feel good hormones. Laughter will help you feel good and forget about the scary movie you just watched. The subject of your funny movie does not matter. As long as it makes you laugh out loud, you will reap the benefits. If you cannot find anything funny to watch, at least watch something that is pleasant or not scary at all. What you watch affects what you dream about and how well you sleep. Reading jokes and funny stories that make you laugh are also an option."

      "content": "Remind yourself that the movie was not real. While the emotions that you experience during the movie are real, you know that you just watched a fictional story. If the movie you watched had zombies, vampires, werewolves, or some other mythical creature, tell yourself that none of those things are real. Tell yourself out loud, \"That movie was pretend. ___ are not real. I do not need to worry about this.\" [2] X Research source If the movie was more realistic, remind yourself that you are in a safe place and those things did not happen to you. The people you watched were actors and were pretending."

      "title": "Address your specific fears.",
      "content": "Address your specific fears. Specific scenes or scenarios in a movie may cause you to become scared. For instance, a burglar breaking into the house, getting attacked in the shower, or something hiding under a bed may really get to you. In these instances, remind yourself that these things happened in the movie, not to you. [3] X Research source For example, if you are concerned about the shower, go to the bathroom and see that no one is hiding in there. If you are worried about someone breaking into your home, double check the locks on the doors and the windows so you feel safe and secure. Turn the lights on or use a flashlight to look under your bed. If darkness is scary to you, sleep with a nightlight or keep the lights in the hallway on."

[4] X Research source Try to stick to positive distractions. The more positive thoughts and feelings you produce, the less power your scary thoughts will have over you. [5] X Research source Taking deep breaths is also a way to relax and calm yourself. Breathe in slowly through your nose and count to four. Hold your breath for seven seconds ,and then exhale through your mouth for eight seconds. You should feel better after a few minutes of deep breathing [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "title": "Do not go to sleep.",
      "content": "Do not go to sleep. If you go to sleep right after you watch a scary movie, you are more likely to have nightmares. While you are sleeping, your brain strengthens the memories and fear you experienced while watching the movie. [7] X Research source It is best if you do not go to sleep at all that night. However, if you cannot stay up all night, try to sleep as little as possible. The more sleep deprived you are, the less your brain can create those bad memories. Try not to watch the movie late at night when you tend to be sleepy. If you cannot physically spend time with another person after the movie, try calling, texting, or video chatting with someone."

      "title": "Spend time with friends or family.",
      "content": "Spend time with friends or family. Your family and friends are a great source of support for you. They can make you feel secure and safe. They can also encourage you, get your mind off the movie, and offer you advice about dealing with the scary movie. If you feel comfortable, discuss your fears with them. You can also ask them how they handle scary movies. They may have some tips that you have not thought of. Do not spend time alone with someone who is just as scared as you are. You may actually feel worse and freak each other out."

      "title": "Avoid watching scary movies at night.",
      "content": "Avoid watching scary movies at night. Horror movies always seem scarier at night. Watching a scary movie and then walking out into broad daylight will not have the same effect on you as watching a movie at midnight. If you are going to the movie theater, choose a movie that ends before the sun goes down. If the movie is coming on television, DVR or record the movie and watch it at another time. Watching a scary movie earlier in the day also gives you time to do other activities before you go to bed."

      "content": "Watch in a safe environment. Knowing that you are in a safe environment causes you to be scared in a fun way instead of experiencing true fear. [8] X Research source If you feel safe, your brain recognizes that you are not in true danger and allows you to enjoy the scary movie. [9] X Research source Watching a scary movie in a movie theater is usually a better experience than watching the movie at home. After the movie is over, you are able to leave the environment completely. If you find yourself getting too caught up in the movie, go to the bathroom or get a snack to give your mind a break. Watch scary movies with other people instead of sitting in the dark by yourself and watching the movie."

      "title": "Identify the scenarios that scare you.",
      "content": "Identify the scenarios that scare you. People are afraid of different things. While flesh eating zombies may scare you, a serial killer on the run may terrify someone else. People are often more fearful of movies that they can identify with. Figure out the things that scare you the most and avoid those types of scary movies. For example, if you babysit a lot, a scary movie about breaking into a home while babysitting may really get to you and cause you to be paranoid the next time you babysit. When you know your limits, you have greater control over how the movie will affect you. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Face your fears.",
      "content": "Face your fears. One way to overcome your fear is to expose yourself to what you are afraid of. You should expose yourself in a safe, controlled environment. This teaches you to move through your fear and allow it to pass. [12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if you are afraid of Freddy Krueger, you may watch the movie every week. To control your environment, you could watch the movie in the daytime with some of your friends. The more you expose yourself to something, you will develop more control and the movie will have less of an impact on you. If watching the entire movie is too scary for you, start small and work your way up. Watch the movie for 15 minutes one week and then 30 minutes the next week. Continue to build until you can watch the entire movie."

Go to source If your negative thought is, \"I am afraid dolls and stuffed animals are haunted,\" you may remind yourself that many people sleep near dolls and stuffed animals and are not harmed, and that you have never been attacked by a haunted doll. If you developed a fear of taking showers when you were home alone, you may remind yourself of all the times you have safely taken a shower, and all of your friends and family members that shower safely. You would also remind yourself that you have never been attacked while you were taking a shower and that you have no evidence that it is unsafe for you to take a shower when you are home alone."
