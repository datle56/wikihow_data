      "content": "Use color to entice him. What you wear - on your nails, your clothing - will trigger different sensations in him depending on the colors you choose. Think red. It can help you look hot, sexy, and works on many skin tones. Studies have shown that men rate women higher in attractiveness when they're wearing red, and that they're more likely to want to date them. [1] X Research source It's a good idea to wear no more than two colors at once. If you wear black, add a flash of color with a bright necklace or shoes. Just a single piece of jewelry can make you look hotter. Black is also a color that is associated with sex appeal. If you wear it, a man is also more likely to consider you sophisticated and elegant. Other colors such as blue and brown are less likely to be associated with being \"hot.\" They convey dependability and stability."

      "content": "Learn how to use makeup. Men like a little makeup. They think it's hot if you use makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your eyes or to highlight the lushness of your lips. But that's the key: It has to look natural. You don't want to look too much like a tomgirl who never wears makeup, but you also shouldn't cake it on. Use shimmer powder or lotion with shimmer in it so that your body glistens. Put it on your cleavage and shoulders. [2] X Research source Try using subtle fake lashes . He will be unlikely to realize what you've done differently, but beautiful eyes with lush lashes are definitely going to attract him. Men aren't fans of bright eye makeup colors like green or bright blues. A better choice if you're going out is a smoky eye. Use grays, silvers, golds, browns, and blacks to create the smoky eye look. Apply the powder under your eye, and above the eyelid. But if you do, choose a neutral lip. [3] X Research source Don't overuse eye liner or lip liner. Maybe try the Angelina Jolie look - black liquid liner subtly applied to the upper lid, and peachy or brown colored eye shadow, with a little black mascara."

      "title": "Be groomed.",
      "content": "Be groomed. Take care of your hygiene to impress him. If you don't show that you respect yourself, why will he respect you? Get a bikini wax. Try something different \"down there\" to surprise him. Regular bikini waxes might be a little painful, but they will make you more confident. Get your nails done professionally. Chipped nails aren't hot. Shave your legs and your underarms. Obvious things - but crucial. Get your eyebrows professionally shaped. Just go to any nail or beauty salon, and they will probably be able to wax them fairly cheaply. You will be surprised how grooming your brows can immediately improve your look."

      "title": "Look good when he wakes up.",
      "content": "Look good when he wakes up. Many men have this test. Does a woman look good when she wakes up in the morning or is she a scary sight when she doesn't have the makeup caked on? Try the no makeup look (maybe even during the day) to show him you can. If he thinks you look beautiful this way too, he will be very impressed. The key to pulling off the no makeup look is a healthy diet and great skincare (clean your face every night, and use a high quality facial cream. Don't forget sunscreen during the day). [4] X Research source Don't go to sleep with makeup on. A fresh face will look better in the early morning light than smudged mascara and lipstick will. You also don't want to leave makeup smudges all over the pillow. Wake up before he does and sneak into the bathroom. Brush your teeth, comb your hair quickly, and put a little blush or powder on (don't make it obvious, though)."

      "content": "Wear something nice to bed. You don't have to be trussed up in a corset or garter belt, but don't sleep next to him in ratty pajamas or shapeless jogging pants. Wearing only his T-shirt to bed is something he will almost always consider hot. Wear something with spaghetti straps or silk. You can never go wrong with these. Every now and then surprise him with sexy, but classy, lingerie. Choose a light cotton T-shirt or tank top and pair it with a pair of pajama shorts. He'll most likely think that this is sexy.

      "title": "Get a little color.",
      "content": "Get a little color. It's a bad idea to head for the tanning bed because you'll pay the price later with wrinkles and aging skin. But these days you can use self tanners that look more natural. Get a little glow by finding a local tanning salon that offers natural looking spray-tans. Choose the lowest level so your skin just barely looks sun-kissed. These days, the products are so sophisticated they usually look natural, at least for the most part. Use bronzing powder on the apples of your cheeks to give your skin an instant color burst. A little color makes you look healthy."

      "title": "Pay attention to the feet.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the feet. Some people ignore their feet, which can be a mistake. You can ruin a beautiful outfit if you're wearing old, scuffed, matronly shoes. Although you shouldn't wear them all the time, high heels for a night out will almost always make a man think \"that's hot.\" Get a pedicure. Red glossy well-done toenails will make even flip flops look pretty hot. Make the skin soft. Use heel cream to soften even the roughest spots of the feet."

      "title": "Play up your lips.",
      "content": "Play up your lips . If you put the focus on your lips, it will make him want to kiss you or think about kissing you. And he's likely to find it hot. Studies show that men prefer subtle lip gloss over bright red or other more obvious colors. Choose gloss over matte lipstick.You definitely want to strive for adding the moisture to your lips. Use Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer or Carmex Moisture plus Clear Gloss. [6] X Research source You could pop in a little red into your outfits every once in a while. Especially with black."

      "title": "Don't be too high maintenance.",
      "content": "Don't be too high maintenance. Men like it when a woman pays attention to grooming (so shave your underarms and pluck your eyebrows). But they don't necessarily like it if your feet are always crammed into high heels, and you don't know how to let your hair down. If you can master glamour at times and also the laid-back casual look, he will think that's hot. So be game for almost anything. Be willing to go to a sporting event, try fishing, hang out with the guys, go for a walk down the beach. You can look hot if you put your hair in a pony tail and wear sweatpants to lounge around the house sometimes - but not if you look like that when you go out to the grocery store or to dinner."

      "content": "Speak confidently. If you master the art of verbal flirtation, he will think you're hot. Being hot is an art form. It's not all about how you physically look. Whisper, especially in his ear. It's hot. Compliment him on his looks. Tell him he looks hot. If he feels more confident, he will get a boost of energy and may return the favor.

      "title": "Have interests outside of him.",
      "content": "Have interests outside of him. Cleopatra was no great beauty. But her ability to attract men was legendary. That's because she understood how to appeal to a man's common interests and spoke multiple languages. [8] X Research source Men are intrigued by women who have interests outside of them and can add something to the conversation. So deepen your knowledge in several areas that are of interest to you. Find a cause. Angelina Jolie became more attractive to men when she started doing philanthropic work. She matched beauty with passion for something outside herself, and men find that attractive."

      "title": "Be funny and confident.",
      "content": "Be funny and confident. Make a man laugh, and he will think you're more attractive. You don't want to be too serious or hard to please all of the time. Part of having a sense of humor is being able to laugh at yourself. If someone criticizes you, turn it into a joke, and shake it off. If you don't really have confidence, fake it. People will react to you differently because they will think you have confidence, which will then lead to a boost in your actual confidence."

      "title": "Use your eyes.",
      "content": "Use your eyes. Keep the focus on your eyes, and use them to seduce your man. If you make a connection through the eyes, he's more likely to think you're hot. Be able to look a man directly in his eyes for a few seconds without blinking. Then, look away shyly, so the look isn't too intimidating. Think of a specific emotion that you want to convey to him when you are looking into his eyes. This will help create an emotional link. Eye contact is so important that some studies have found men will look at a woman's face – and eyes – first even when looking at pictures of naked women. [9] X Research source To highlight your eyes and make them seductive, make sure your brows are well-groomed but not too thin or sparse. Darker eyebrows are sexier. Reader Poll: We asked 426 wikiHow readers if they thought putting away their phone enhances a date, and 89% of them said Yes. [Take Poll] Remember, you can't make eye contact if you're looking at your phone."

      "content": "Smile – a lot. It's not just about putting lip gloss on your lips. It's about showing a joy for life, and there's nothing like a beautiful smile to draw a man. Get your teeth bleached at the dentist or buy bleaching kits at the drug store. There's nothing attractive about a mouth full of yellow or stained teeth. Don't force your smile – make it a natural one."

      "content": "Tease him. Tell him you got a new brassiere in a color that's different, and ask him to guess it. Suggest you've got something planned for him later that evening that he will enjoy. Be seductive and tease him but in a coy, mysterious way. Never be crude. Light touches will tease a man in a good way. Put your hand on his knee briefly. Whisper in his ear. Grab his hand. [10] X Research source Master the art of the double entendre. Be coy and mysterious."

      "title": "Embrace your curves.",
      "content": "Embrace your curves. You should strive to be healthy. Develop a workout routine, even if it's walking for 30 minutes several times a week. And eat a healthy diet that's heavy in natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables. But don't fall into the trap that men want a skeleton. Many men actually say they prefer a few curves on a woman, even a rounded stomach. [11] X Research source The key is to project confidence. Be comfortable in who you are and don't be the kind of woman who goes out to dinner with a man and won't touch her plate. This isn't very hot to men. Not looking perfect actually can increase a man's confidence because he won't feel pressure to look perfect too."

      "title": "Taste good.",
      "content": "Taste good. When he goes in for a kiss, surprise him with lip gloss that has flavor to it. That way you will taste twice as good. Even some chapsticks have flavor to them. Katy Perry's cherry chapstick comes to mind. Some lotions have flavored scents too. Make sure your breath smells good. Carry small breath fresheners in your purse, and make sure to brush and go to the dentist for regular teeth cleanings."

      "title": "Activate his sense of taste.",
      "content": "Activate his sense of taste. You can enhance his experiences of being with you if you share sensual food with him. Share chocolates with him or berries. [12] X Research source Chocolate releases the chemical serotonin in the brain, which creates feelings of pleasure. Bake him homemade cookies and share them after a sexy date with a bottle of wine."

    {
      "title": "Choose the right scent.",
      "content": "Choose the right scent. You want something light. Think vanilla. Or a faint musky smell. You don't want to smell like your grandmother. Perfume should be lightly applied, but you want a signature scent. At the same time, he will get used to your scene over time, so now and then mix it up and surprise him with something new. Lather on lightly scented lotion in something like lilac or, again, vanilla, which has been tied to increased desire. Spray perfume in the air and walk backwards through it. This way, when he hugs you, you'll smell good to him because his head will be near your back. [13] X Research source Above all, don't put on too much perfume. Men hate this. No one wants to hang out with a walking department store."

      "title": "Soften your skin.",
      "content": "Soften your skin. There's nothing hotter than when a man's hand brushes your legs, and they're silky soft. You want skin a man wants to touch. To get soft skin, use a hydrating exfoliating body scrub to remove dry skin from your body. These scrubs also have a nice scent. [14] X Research source Choose a razor designed for women so you catch all the stubble when you shave. Then, put body lotion or body butter all over your body."

      "title": "Play up your femininity.",
      "content": "Play up your femininity. Although men like a girl who can hang with them, they aren't likely to classify a tomboy as “hot.” If you play up your femininity, it will make him feel manly and protective. Wear skirts and dresses more than pants. This will make you look more feminine. If you wear blue jeans, avoid jeans that are too plain or have holes in them."

    {
      "title": "Have silky hair he wants to touch.",
      "content": "Have silky hair he wants to touch. Touch is sensual. Take care of your hair. A flip of shiny, healthy hair is bound to attract any man. It's hot to have bouncy, shiny hair. Get natural color or subtle highlights. Avoid the “skunk” look or anything too overdone. Avoid tight permanents. Men like hair they can run their fingers through. Get regular hair cuts every 6 weeks to get rid of split ends. Wearing your hair swept to the side looks romantic and hot, especially if you put a few beachy curls in it with a curling iron or medium-sized rollers. Apply a shine spray to your hair after styling. This will give your hair more gloss. Use salon shampoo and conditioner. If you don't put good quality products on your hair, the results will show. Wear your hair down, and don't use a lot of hairspray. Men tend not to be fans of overly styled hairdos. They don't want to feel like their hands will be covered with product if they run their fingers through your hair. [15] X Research source Don't stick too close to obvious hair trends. Find a look that suits your personality and your face shape instead."
