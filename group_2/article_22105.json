You may also want to consider what they look like, their cultural or ethnic background, and how smart or creative they are. Avoid asking someone who is busy raising a newborn or has a lot of other things going on because the request may be too much to ask of them at the time. You might say something like, \"I have something big to ask of you... I admire your sense of humor and love the fact that you come from the same background as me. Whether it's a yes or a no, I cherish our relationship just the same.
