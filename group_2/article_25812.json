      "content": "If you want to avoid being shunned, continue to live as one of Jehovah's Witnesses while slowly fading. Fading involves slowly reducing your involvement over many months. Start by making fewer comments, going out in field service less often, declining parts on the theocratic ministry school, then finally reducing the number of meetings you attend. Be prepared to explain your reduced involvement to any Witnesses who inquire only in vague terms. As long as you avoid doing things that would qualify you for disfellowshipping or disassociation by action, many have found they can avoid being subject of a disfellowshipping announcement."

      "content": "If you are not concerned about shunning, simply stop attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and carry on your life in the manner that reflects your true beliefs. You are also welcome to write a brief letter of disassociation. Send the letter to the \"Body of Elders\" of the congregation you associated with, using the address of the Kingdom Hall. Once the letter has been received the elders may contact you to confirm your intention. Once confirmed an announcement will be made, \"So-and-so is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses.\" This announcement carries an implied command to faithful members to begin shunning you, not even saying \"hello\" if they see you."
