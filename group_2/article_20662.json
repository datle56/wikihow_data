      "content": "Allow the bad mood to be. This means don't force yourself to get out of bad mood or, most likely, you will fail. Our level of efficiency(or our best) is different at different times in our life. For example: Your efficiency when you are feeling enthusiastic and when you are feeling down, would not be the same. So don't compare like, 'I did such complex job with a great efficiency that day and now I cannot do such a simple thing, properly\". However, you can always do your best as much as your current mood(or state of mind) allows you to do. For example; if your current mood allow you to be 20 percent efficient, at best, then take action at the same level without forcing yourself to perform better. Then you will see how this mental static (bad mood) dissolves naturally, without any effort on your part, all while your efficiency gradually gets better."
