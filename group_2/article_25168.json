      "content": "Lock eyes with him. Be bold about making eye contact and do it often, especially right before you're about to go in for the kiss.

      "content": "Test the waters by kissing him on the cheek. If you're unsure about how he'll react to a regular kiss on the mouth, you can always give him a kiss on the cheek first. You can give him a quick peck after he says something sweet, or move in slow and prolong the kiss for a few seconds to show him that you're feeling romantic. If he seems shocked or pulls away, you may want to slow things down a bit."

Tell him what you're up to, ask about his plans for an upcoming event, or bring up an inside joke. Be sure to ask him open-ended questions that require more than a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" For example, you might say, \"I heard you're going to the Winter Formal with a group of your friends. Fun! What are you planning to wear?\" You could also say something like, \"I totally spaced when the homework assignment was announced in History. Can you help me out?\" [14] X Research source"
