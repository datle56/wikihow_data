This can backfire if you’re constantly counting down the minutes until you text him though, so keep yourself busy with work, friends, or other activities. Try not to keep him waiting too long, or he might end up moving on. Take 30 minutes to an hour to respond to his initial texts, but feel free to text him more quickly if you’re having a conversation. Remember—to play hard to get, you always have to text back at some point to show that you're interested. [1] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019.
