      "content": "Preheat your oven to 220 °F (104 °C) and line a baking sheet with foil. First, get that oven going. Then, line an oven-safe baking sheet with tin foil, which will save you some cleanup and make sure you can take advantage of every last crumb of weed. [1] X Research source This first process is known as “decarboxylation,” which is where you heat up the cannabis in order to activate the THC inside, making it usable for edibles. Decarbing is required if you want your edibles to get you high (and we assume you do), so don’t skip it!"

      "title": "Place 0.5 oz (14 g) of weed onto the baking sheet and spread it out.",
      "content": "Place 0.5 oz (14 g) of weed onto the baking sheet and spread it out. Take your cannabis buds (not the seeds, stems, or leaves!) and use your hands to roughly crumble it across your baking sheet, making large chunks. Then, use your fingers to spread it out in a single, even layer. [2] X Research source Your weed gummies’ intensity will depend on the intensity of your weed strain. For a milder high, use a strain with less THC content. Use nitrile gloves whenever handling weed to avoid getting the odor on your hands."

      "title": "Bake the weed for 45-60 minutes.",
      "content": "Bake the weed for 45-60 minutes. Set the tray of weed flower in the oven and let it bake for about an hour, turning the pan and using a spatula to mix the buds every 10 minutes or so to make sure it’s evenly heated. [3] X Research source Forty-five minutes is plenty of time for most weed strains, but recently harvested strains that still have moisture may take 60-70 minutes."

      "title": "Let the weed cool, then grind it with a grinder.",
      "content": "Let the weed cool, then grind it with a grinder. Take the tray of weed out of the oven and let it cool for about an hour. [4] X Research source Then, use a cannabis grinder to grind the decarbed weed into a coarse, flaky powder. If you don’t have a grinder, grind your weed by crumbling it between gloved fingers, or toss it in a coffee grinder. We’re not quite ready to make gummies yet! We still have to infuse oil with the decarbed weed. Store decarbed cannabis in an airtight container, like a food storage bag, until you’re ready to use it."

      "title": "Fill a pot with 2 in (5.1 cm) of water and bring it to a simmer.",
      "content": "Fill a pot with 2 in (5.1 cm) of water and bring it to a simmer. Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Heat it until it comes to a low simmer, then adjust the heat to maintain the simmer. [5] X Research source For this part, we’ll be double boiling the oil and decarbed weed to together to infuse the oil with THC so we can use it in the gummies. Double-boiling just means heating something in a container suspended over boiling water."

    {
      "title": "Place 2 c (470 mL) of oil in a glass bowl with the weed.",
      "content": "Place 2 c (470 mL) of oil in a glass bowl with the weed. Grab a heat-proof bowl (cooking bowls made of glass are best), and place your decarbed weed inside. Then, add cooking oil. Coconut oil works best, but you might also use olive oil, vegetable oil, or canola oil. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the bowl over the boiling water and let it simmer for 2-6 hours.",
      "content": "Place the bowl over the boiling water and let it simmer for 2-6 hours. Keep the water at a constant, low simmer, and stir the mixture in the bowl every 10 minutes or so to make sure it evenly heats and infuses. The longer you let it simmer, the stronger your oil will be. [7] X Research source Or, skip the double boiler and simply heat the decarbed weed and oil together in a saucepan for 3 hours, stirring frequently so it doesn’t burn. Go ahead and open a window and turn on a fan, since this step will likely make your home smell like cannabis."

    {
      "title": "Let the mixture cool a bit, then strain it.",
      "content": "Let the mixture cool a bit, then strain it. Remove the bowl and pot from the heat, and let the oil mixture cool for about 5-10 minutes, but not so long that your oil solidifies (if you’re using coconut oil). Then, strain the mixture into a new heat-proof bowl or measuring cup using cheesecloth or a fine sieve. [8] X Research source Your infused canna oil is ready to use! If you’re not ready for the next steps, store your cannaoil in an airtight container, like a glass jar with a lid. Keep it in the fridge for up to 12 months."

      "content": "Spray gummy molds with non-stick cooking spray. Coat the gummy molds lightly but evenly, so that the gummies don’t stick when you go to remove them from the molds later. [9] X Research source If you don’t have molds, fill a small, high-rimmed baking tray with about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) of cornstarch, then use the back of a measuring spoon to make small indents. This is now your mold! No need to spray this one."

Place these ingredients into a pot or saucepan, then heat them on the stove over low heat for 4-5 minutes, mixing constantly. If you made your infused oil with coconut oil, it’ll have to melt, so be patient! [10] X Research source Swap the water with an equal amount of fruit juice for an added burst of flavor. Add a spoonful of fruit puree for another bonus flavor blast!"

Add 0.5 tsp (5 g) of lecithin powder , a packet (3 oz) of flavored gelatin , and 2 tbsp (36 g) of unflavored gelatin to the bowl, and whisk it continuously. Stir until the mixture is a uniform consistency. [11] X Research source Whisk the mixture and keep it over the heat for about 10-15 minutes, until the gelatin is completely dissolved. [12] X Research source Lecithin helps bind the THC to the gelatin, making sure the THC doesn’t seep out of the gummies, so it’s a must-have ingredient. Don’t let the gelatin boil! Keep it over a low heat, and stir constantly."

Then, carefully pour the mixture into the molds, filling them all the way up to the top. [13] X Research source It may be easier to first pour the mixture into a spouted measuring cup, or even to transfer it to the mold with a turkey baster. You might also pour the mixture into a plastic bag, then cut off a corner of the bag to create a makeshift piping bag. Optionally, strain the mixture one more time to get rid of any large chunks, though this may not be necessary."

Then, just pop them out of the molds, and you’re done! Enjoy responsibly. [14] X Research source Store your weed gummies in the fridge in an airtight container until they’re ready for use. Store them in the freezer if you wish to keep them for more than a month. We recommend trying only a half or even a third of a gummy at time, then waiting for 4 hours to feel the effects, to gauge how strong they are."

If you want your gummies to be extra premium, roll them in a mixture of 0.5 cups (100g) of sugar and a pinch of citric acid for a sour twist, or skip the citric acid for a sweeter sensation. Or, infuse the sugar with cannaoil by mixing 4-5 drops of oil with about 5 tbsp sugar, then let it air dry for 2-3 hours before rolling the gummies in the infused sugar."
