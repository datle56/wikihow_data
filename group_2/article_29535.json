      "content": "Choose some colorful paper for your umbrella. Solid-colored cardstock or construction paper would work great for this, but you can also use patterned scrapbooking paper as well. Another option is to use wrapping paper. If you want a traditional cocktail umbrella pattern, print the templates included at the bottom of this tutorial."

      "content": "Cut a 3 in (7.6 cm) circle out of the paper. Use a pencil to trace the circle onto the back of the paper. Cut the circle out with scissors, then erase any pencil marks. [1] X Research source Use a glass, can, or small lid to trace your circle. A compass will also work. The measurement does not have to be exact; 3 inches (7.6 cm) is just the most common size."

    {
      "title": "Cut a slit going towards the middle of the circle.",
      "content": "Cut a slit going towards the middle of the circle. Find the middle of the circle, either by measuring it or drawing an X across the back. Cut a slit going from the outer edge of the circle to the middle. [2] X Research source Don't fold the circle to find the middle; you don't want any creases in this design."

    {
      "title": "Overlap the cut edges to form a shallow cone.",
      "content": "Overlap the cut edges to form a shallow cone. Take the edges of the slit, then overlap them until the paper starts to form a cone shape. You want to create a shallow cone, so something between 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) would be ideal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the cone with tape or glue.",
      "content": "Secure the cone with tape or glue. A small amount of tacky glue would work the best, but you will have to wait for it to dry. You can also use a glue stick instead. A strip of tape is another option, but you'll have to put it inside the cone so that it won't be visible. [3] X Research source If you are using glue, use a clothespin to hold the cone in place until the glue dries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hot glue the cone to a skewer or toothpick.",
      "content": "Hot glue the cone to a skewer or toothpick. Flip the cone over so that you can see the inside, then place a drop of hot glue into the middle. Quickly press the end of a toothpick or a skewer into the glue, then wait a few minutes for it to set. [4] X Research source Most skewers will be too long for cocktail umbrellas. It would be a good idea to cut yours a little shorter. If you don't want to use glue, just poke the end of the toothpick or skewer through the paper. [5] X Research source"

Use a coaster or glass to make the circle nice and neat. [6] X Research source Use a pencil to trace the circle so that you can erase the marks later."

    {
      "title": "Cut the circle out with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut the circle out with scissors. You can also use a craft blade if you are careful. Alternatively, you can use scissors with a scalloped edge to cut the circle out. This will give you a fancier edge. [7] X Research source If you use scissors with a scalloped edge, you won't have to cut scallops later on. Keep in mind that these scallops won't match up with the creases you'll add later."

    {
      "title": "Fold the circle into eighths.",
      "content": "Fold the circle into eighths. Rather than folding the circle all at once, make each crease separately. Fold the circle in half vertically, then unfold it. Next, fold the circle in half horizontally, then unfold it. Keep folding and unfolding until you have 8 segments. [8] X Research source Make all of the folds on the same side. If your paper is blank on 1 side, make the folds on the blank side. Run your fingernail across each fold to make the crease nice and sharp."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut a scalloped edge into the circle.",
      "content": "Cut a scalloped edge into the circle. Fold the circle into eighths using the original creases as a guide. Once you have a skinny triangle, cut a semi-oval or semi-almond shape into the curved edge. Unfold the circle to reveal a scalloped edge. [9] X Research source If you used scalloping shears earlier, then you don't have to do this."

      "title": "Cut a slit along 1 of the creases towards the middle of the circle.",
      "content": "Cut a slit along 1 of the creases towards the middle of the circle. The slit needs to go from the outer edge of the circle all the way to the middle. Use 1 of the creases as a guide. [10] X Research source You should use a regular pair of scissors for this, even if you used a scalloped pair in the previous step."

      "title": "Overlap the cut edges, then secure them with tape or glue.",
      "content": "Overlap the cut edges, then secure them with tape or glue. Cover the top of the left segment with glue or a piece of double-sided tape. Overlap the right segment onto it, then press it down. Make sure that the cut edges of both segments align with the adjacent creases. [11] X Research source Your umbrella will have 7 segments after this. You can use tacky glue or a glue stick for this. If you are using tissue paper, however, a glue stick will work the best."

      "content": "Cut toothpicks into spokes, then glue them to the umbrella, if desired. Cut both ends off of 8 toothpicks until they are a little longer than the radius of the umbrella. Glue the toothpicks to the creases on the underside of the umbrella. [12] X Research source The ends of the toothpicks should stick out from under the umbrella, just like real umbrella spokes. Use tacky glue or super glue for this. Hot glue is too thick."

      "title": "Glue a toothpick or skewer to the middle of the umbrella.",
      "content": "Glue a toothpick or skewer to the middle of the umbrella. Cut the tip off of a toothpick or skewer until you get the length you want. Flip the umbrella over, then place a drop of hot glue or tacky glue into the middle. Press the cut end of your toothpick or skewer into the glue. If you did not add the wooden spokes, you can just poke the toothpick or skewer through the paper. If you used tacky glue, stand the umbrella upright and stick it into a ball of clay or poster putty until it dries. [13] X Research source"
