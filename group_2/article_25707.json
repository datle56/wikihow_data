      "content": "Identify the guitar fretboard’s numbered frets. On a guitar, the front of the long, skinny part where you put your fingers is called the fretboard. The raised metal bumps on the fretboard divide it into frets. Scales are formed by playing notes on different patterns of frets, so it's important to be able to identify them. [1] X Research source The frets are numbered from the tip of the neck towards the body of the guitar. The fret at the very end of the neck is the 1st fret (or fret 1), the next fret in is the 2nd fret, and so on. Holding down the string on a certain fret and strumming the string over the body of the guitar plays a note. The closer the frets get to the body, the higher the notes get. The dots on the fret are just for reference—they make it easier to know where you're putting your fingers without having to count the frets up the neck constantly."

      "content": "Learn the names of the notes on the fretboard. Every single fret on the guitar plays a note that has a name. Luckily, there are only 12 notes—the names just repeat over and over. Take note that some notes have two different names: [2] X Research source This list includes A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/ Gb, G, G#/Ab, with “#” denoting a sharp and “b” a flat. After this, the notes start at A again and repeat. Learning the positions of the different notes isn’t overly difficult, but it takes some time to explain properly—check out this helpful wikiHow article if you need guidance."

      "content": "Call the guitar’s strings by their proper names. It's a lot easier to discuss scales if you know the strings' proper names, rather than calling them “thickest,” “2nd thickest,” etc. The strings are properly named after the note that they play when you don't press any of the frets. On a normal 6-string guitar in standard tuning, the strings are: E (thickest)—A—D—G—B—E (thinnest)"

      "content": "Figure out whole and half steps in a scale. In simple terms, a scale is just a sequence of notes that sound nice when you play them in order. All scales are built from patterns of \"whole steps\" and \"half steps.\" These notations are simply ways to describe different distances on the fretboard: [3] X Research source A half step is a distance of one fret up or down. For example, if you play a C (A string, third fret), moving one fret up will give you a C# (A string, fourth fret). We can say that C and C# are one half step apart. A whole step is the same thing except that the distance is two frets. For example, if we start on C and move two frets up, we'll play a D (A string, fifth fret). Thus, C and D are a whole step apart."

      "title": "Name the degrees of a scale in sequence.",
      "content": "Name the degrees of a scale in sequence. Since scales are sequences of notes that are supposed to be played in order, the notes get special numbered names called \"degrees\" to help you identify them: [4] X Research source The note you start on is called the root or 1st note. The second note is called the 2nd, the third the 3rd, and so on up through the seventh note. The eighth note can be called the 8th, but is usually called the octave. After the octave, you can either start over again from the second or keep going on from the ninth. For instance, the note after the octave can be called the 9th or the 2nd, but it's the same note either way. You may also hear other terms used: tonic for the 1st and 8th notes (since they’re the same note, just with the 8th being higher), supertonic for the 2nd, mediant for the 3rd, subdominant for the 4th, dominant for the 5th, submediant for the 6th, and several names (depending on the scale) for the 7th."

      "content": "Pick a starting note (root) for your scale. The major scale is a good choice to learn first because many other scales are based off of it. To begin, pick any note below the 12th fret on the low E or A string. Starting on one of the lower strings gives you plenty of room to move up and down the scale. [5] X Research source For example, start on G (low E string, third fret). This means you'll learn how to play a G major scale, since scales are named after their root note."

      "content": "Memorize the pattern of steps for a major scale. All scales can be written as patterns of whole and half steps. The step pattern for a major scale is especially important to learn, because many other scale patterns are derived from it. Start on the root (for example, G), then go “whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.” [6] X Research source If you start on G, move up one whole step to A. Then, move up another whole step to B. After that, move up a half step to C. Following the pattern above, continue up the scale, playing D, E, F#, and ending on G."

      "content": "Practice the fingering pattern for a major scale. You can play a whole scale on one string, but this is very awkward—you won't usually see guitarists do it. Instead, it's much more common to move up and down through a few different strings as you play your scale. This minimizes the amount of motion that your hand has to make. [7] X Research source For the G major scale, start on the 3rd fret of the low E string. Play A and B on frets 5 and 7 of the E string. Then, hit C on the 3rd fret of the A string. Hit D and E on frets 5 and 7 of the A string. Then, hit F# on fret 4 of the D string. Finish by hitting G on the 5th fret of the D string. You don’t have to move your hand up and down the neck to do this—just change strings and stretch your fingers."

In other words, just shift all the notes up or down by the same number of frets/steps to play a different major scale. [9] X Research source For example, to play a B major scale, just move up the neck to the 7th fret of the low E string. Then, use the same fingering pattern as before to play the scale like this: Low E string: B (fret 7), C# (fret 9), D# (fret 11) A string: E (fret 7), F# (fret 9), G# (fret 11) D string: A# (fret 8), B (fret 9)"

Once you master going up the major scale, try playing it back down again once you reach the octave. All you need to do is play the same series of notes in reverse order. [10] X Research source For example, to play the B major scale up and down, play these notes: Going up: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B Going down: B, A#, G#, F#, E, D#, C#, B If you want to get the scale to match up with a 4/4 beat, play each note as a quarter or eighth note. Hit the octave twice or go up to the ninth (just a whole step above the octave), then go back down. This will give you the right number of notes for the scale to line up with the measures."

Memorizing the new pattern can be handy as you get familiar with minors. [12] X Research source The step pattern for a minor scale, starting from the root, is: whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step. For example, to make a G minor scale, start with a G major scale and move the 3rd, 6th, and 7th degrees down a half step each. A G major scale is: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G; so a G minor scale is: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G."

Just like with majors, the notes in minor scales are played with a certain pattern of frets, which you can slide up and down the neck to play different minors. As long as you're starting on the low E or A string, the minor pattern is the same. [13] X Research source For example, to play an Eb minor scale, take an Eb minor scale and slide the 3rd, 6th, and 7th degrees down one fret, like this: A string: Eb (fret 6), F (fret 8), F# (fret 9) D string: Ab (fret 6), Bb (fret 8), B (fret 9) G string: Db (fret 6), Eb (fret 8)"

This means that a chromatic scale can be made simply by going up and down the frets in order. [15] X Research source Try this chromatic exercise: First, pick one of the guitar's strings (it doesn't matter which). Start counting a steady 4/4 beat. Play the sting open (no notes fretted) as a quarter note, then the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd frets. Without stopping, play the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th frets. Keep the beat steady and play the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th frets. Continue this pattern until you reach the 12th fret, then go back down! For example, if you're playing on the high E string, your chromatic exercise would look like this: Measure one: E (open), F (fret 1), F# (fret 2), G (fret 3) Measure two: F (fret 1), F# (fret 2), G (fret 3), G# (fret 4) ...and so on up to the 12th fret, then back down"

The minor pentatonic contains these degrees: root, flat 3rd, 4th, 5th, and flat 7th, plus the octave. It's basically a minor scale without the 2nd or 6th. [16] X Research source For example, if you start on the low E string, the A minor pentatonic scale is: Low E string: A (fret 5), C (fret 8); A string: D (fret 5), E (fret 7); D string: G (fret 5), A (fret 7) From here, you can keep going, playing the same notes on higher strings: G string: C (fret 5), D (fret 7); B string: E (fret 5), G (fret 8); E string: A (fret 5), C (fret 8)"

Just treat the octave as the new root and use the same step pattern to play a second octave. Starting on one of the bottom 2 strings generally makes it easier to fit 2 whole octaves in the same area of the neck. [18] X Research source For instance, you can try a 2-octave scale in G major. Start with: Low E string: G (fret 3), A (fret 5), B (fret 7); A string: C (fret 3), D (fret 5), E (fret 7); D string: F# (fret 4), G (fret 5) Keep going, using the same step pattern—whole step, whole step, half step, and so on: D string: G (fret 5), A (fret 7); G string: B (fret 4), C (fret 5), D (fret 7); B string: E (fret 5), F# (fret 7), G (fret 8) Then, go back down!"
