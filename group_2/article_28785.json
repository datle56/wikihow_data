      "title": "Buy some elastic jewelry cord.",
      "content": "Buy some elastic jewelry cord. You should be able to find this at a craft store like Michael’s or Joann Fabric, or you could just purchase it online. It comes in a variety of colors. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the cord.",
      "content": "Cut the cord. Cut a piece of cord about two arm-lengths long. Making this choker uses a lot of cord. If in doubt, err on the side of too much—you can always trim it later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clip the cord onto a clipboard.",
      "content": "Clip the cord onto a clipboard. Fold your length of cord in half, and secure the halfway point by clipping it onto a clipboard. You can also use a binder clip and a hardcover book if you do not have a clipboard. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Start looping.",
      "content": "Start looping. A tattoo choker is basically made up of a series of simple loops. Start with the cord on the left (we’ll call it “L”). Loop it over the cord on the right (“R”). Wrap L around R, then pull it back through the loop you made, tying L to R. Pull it up so the loop is at the top of the cords."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep going.",
      "content": "Keep going. Do the same thing again, this time beginning on the right, and looping R around L. Make sure you keep alternating sides as you go, or it won’t come out right. Keep going until it is long enough to fit around your neck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the ends.",
      "content": "Tie the ends. This choker will be relatively stretchy, so you can just tie it off when it is the right size for your neck, and stretch it over your head to put it on. Thread one end of the cord through the loop at the other side of the choker, and tie it securely to the other end. Melt the knot together with a match or lighter to keep the Stretch Magic Cord from coming untied while you’re wearing the choker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out how long to cut chain or string.",
      "content": "Figure out how long to cut chain or string. You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the chain around your neck and adding an inch. When you’ve got the right measurement, cut the chain. Then cut another chain which is longer than the first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach a clasp to the chains.",
      "content": "Attach a clasp to the chains. Use a jump ring to link together one end of each chain and a lobster clasp. Close the jump ring with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Jewelry-making supplies like lobster clasps and jump rings can be purchased online or from craft stores, or you can recycle them from old jewelry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the pendant to the choker.",
      "content": "Add the pendant to the choker. Thread both chains through the loop on the pendant. If the loop is not big enough, attach a jump ring to it and thread the chains through that so the pendant can slide easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "See how it looks.",
      "content": "See how it looks. Fasten the smaller of the two chains around your neck using the lobster clasp. Using a mirror, adjust the length of the second chain until it hangs the way you want it to. Cut it to that length, and attach it to the first chain with a jump ring."
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out what length you need.",
      "content": "Figure out what length you need. You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the ribbon around your neck and then adding an inch. When you’ve got the right measurement, cut the ribbon. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hem the ends.",
      "content": "Hem the ends. Fold one end of the ribbon back onto itself to create a loop about ¼ - ½ inch long. Sew it in place with thread that is a similar color to the ribbon. Do the same thing on the other side of the ribbon, making sure to fold it in the same direction as before, so that the cut ends both lay on the side of the ribbon that will not be visible when you wear it. [4] X Research source If you are in a hurry or don’t feel like sewing, you can always opt to simply tie the ribbon in a bow at the back of your neck. If you want to do this, you should add an extra two or three inches to the diameter of your neck, rather than just one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a way to tie it.",
      "content": "Add a way to tie it. Cut a two or three inch length of string or embroidery floss. You may want to select one that is a similar color to the ribbon, but it will not be visible from the front, so any color will do if that’s not available. Just thread it through the loops you sewed, and tie the ends together to hold your choker in place. Trim any excess string."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach a clasp.",
      "content": "Attach a clasp. For a slightly classier look than just tying it on with a string, add a clasp and chain. These can be purchased online, or you could just recycle one from an old necklace you don’t wear anymore. The choker should already be pretty close to the right length, so a half-inch in length on either side should be fine. Jewelry chain is very fine, so you should be able to cut it with an ordinary pair of scissors. Just sew it in place by threading the needle through the links in the chain a few times."
