Use a small funnel to transfer the liquid into a glass spray bottle . Seal the bottle tightly and shake until all ingredients are fully mixed. [1] X Research source Using distilled or purified water instead of tap helps preserve your DIY air freshener and prevent any chance of bacterial growth. Oil and water don’t mix, so vodka helps the essential oils disperse through the air. If needed, you can substitute the vodka with an equal amount of alcohol-free Thayer’s witch hazel . You can use any essential oil scent you like, but cleaning expert Grettel Monge recommends using natural, chemical-free essential oils. “When oils diffuse into the air and you’re actually smelling them,” Monge explains, “[the chemicals] could cause some kind of allergy or reaction.”"

You can also use baking soda air fresheners for your car. The mason jar should fit snugly in a cup holder and keep any unpleasant smells at bay. Keep shaking the air freshener every few days, and add more drops of essential oil if you feel the scent is starting to wane. Make a new baking soda air freshener every one to three months. At this point, the baking soda will have absorbed all the bad odors it can and won’t be as effective."

      "content": "Choose a combination of spices, herbs, and citrus fruits. Gather enough ingredients to fill one standard-sized cooking pot or a 2-pint (0.95 liters) mason jar. Grettel Monge, owner of Essential Cleaners Miami, recommends a combination of “cut-up oranges, cinnamon sticks, and apples.” If you like a sweeter scent, try 2 sliced lemons, 3 rosemary sprigs, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Another fresh but sweet combination is 3-4 sprigs of thyme, ½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) of mint extract, 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of vanilla, and 3 sliced limes. To create a woodsy, wintery scent, combine a handful of pine needles, 4 bay leaves, and 1 whole nutmeg. Be sure to grate the outer layer of the nutmeg; this will help it release its scent."
