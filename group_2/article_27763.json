      "content": "Head to a quiet, secluded place. No one wants to make out with an audience, especially for your first time. Get some privacy by planning a romantic picnic or a quiet movie night at home. [2] X Research source Resist the urge to cut the lights completely. You might think that total darkness will ease your nerves and hide any slip-ups. For a first-timer, though, it'll actually make things a lot more difficult—you can't see where you're going, and you'll want to be able to gauge your partner's reaction. Save the full darkness for later sessions when you know each other better. If you're alone in a bedroom or a basement, you can dim the lights a bit without being too obvious about it. Set the mood, if you like. If you know that someone you like will be coming over solo later and that there's a good chance you'll be making out later, then you can make sure your room is neat and tidy, that there's no chance a parent, sibling, or roommate will interrupt, and that everything smells nice."

      "content": "Use flirty body language to send signals to your partner. If you're already comfortable kissing someone regularly, move it into making out simply by continuing the kisses. If you haven't kissed this person much before, though, initiating a make-out session might take some extra maneuvering. Here are some ways to let the other person know you're interested: [3] X Research source Find excuses to get close. Putting your body as near as possible to the other person's is a pretty strong hint. Sit close if you're on a couch or in a car, or hold hands and stand with your body completely against theirs. Make it extra obvious by staring deep into their eyes. Reveal slightly more skin. If you're wearing a cardigan or jacket, take it off casually. You could also undo the top button of your shirt, roll up your sleeves, or pull up your hair, so that your neck and chest are more exposed. Get handsy. Before you start kissing , make your intentions clear by using your hands to start closer contact. [4] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. Hold hands, offer a shoulder or foot rub, play with the other person's hair, or lightly trace your fingers over their face or throat."

      "content": "Read your partner’s body language before you start. Are they incredibly eager to start kissing and pretty experienced when it comes to locking lips? Or is this their first time too, and are they acting even more nervous than you feel? If your partner is really ready to take it to the next level, relax and let them take the lead. But if you see that you're the one who is doing more of the hinting, touching, and talking, take a deep breath and muster up all of the confidence you have. [5] X Research source If you aren’t sure whether or not your partner wants to kiss you, just ask. Say something like, “Can I kiss you right now?” If your partner is feeling nervous, asking for permission might just put them more at ease."

Slowly bring your face toward the other person's, maintaining eye contact until you're a few inches away. Then close your eyes and start a kiss. If they seem interested, you're probably clear to move on to making out; if you run into hesitation, though, it might be best to try another time. If it's your very first kiss, then you may be a little nervous, but take a deep breath and let your lips touch your partner's at a slight angle. This will make it easier for you to use your tongues when you're both ready. [7] X Research source Even though you’re planning to make out soon, stick to just using your lips for now. Going in with your tongue too quickly can be a little jarring, and it’s better to start out with light pecks than it is to jump in too early. Take a deep breath, smile a little, and slowly lean in toward your partner. You don't have to get it right the first time and remember: they may be just as nervous as you are!"

Don't alternate techniques too often, but do it often enough to shift gears as soon as you feel the other person losing interest. Try playing around with these variables: [9] X Research source Pressure: Alternate between soft, gentle kisses and harder, more insistent ones. Speed: Slow kisses are a good start to making out, and they're nice for taking a subtle breather in the middle. To convey more passion, though, you can speed up to quicker and deeper lip work. Tongue: Try French kissing, or gently touching your partner's tongue with your tongue, to heighten the intensity. More than anything else, keep your tongue in motion—don't let it just sit in your partner's mouth. Make small darting movements, or sweep it around your partner's tongue in smooth, circular motions."
