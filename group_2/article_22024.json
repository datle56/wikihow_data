      "content": "Hand-tame your hamster. Before you can play with your hamster outside their cage, you need to get them used to being handled by you. Start by feeding your hamster treats from your hand. When your hamster approaches you without fear, try letting them play in your hand. When they are comfortable there, pick them up. Gradually increase the amount of time you hold your hamster. [4] X Research source Always let your hamster sniff at your closed fist before attempting to pick them up. Do not surprise them. Always handle your hamster over a table or while sitting on the ground. Otherwise, your hamster might suffer a serious injury if they squirm out of your grasp. A fall of only one foot can seriously injure a hamster. [5] X Research source If your hamster tries to squirm away or bites you, put it back in its cage. It is tired of being held."

      "content": "Make sure your hamster cannot escape when playing outside their cage. Play with your hamster in an enclosed area. Be aware that hamsters can escape through very small spaces, such as under doors, so you will need to keep your pet under supervision when playing outside its cage. Don’t play in an area with a small space that your hamster can squeeze into to hide, such as underneath couches or drawers. Bathrooms are convenient enclosed space to play in, but be sure to shut the toilet lid. Consider purchasing a hamster playpen to make sure your pet can’t escape. It should be larger than the hamster’s cage. Also consider covering the pen with a mesh screen so your pet can’t escape. Purchasing a child’s wading pool is an easy way to provide an enclosed, inexpensive play space."

Having a plan in advance can ward off panic and make it much more likely you will find your pet. Search near the hamster’s cage first. Look in small places: behind and underneath furniture, in between cushions on sofas and chairs, on bookshelves, in drawers, and inside shoes, tissues boxes, and shoe boxes. If your search fails, leave the cage open and place your hamster’s favorite food near and inside it. Turn out the lights and wait for your hamster to come. If that fails, set out some food before you go to sleep and surround it with flour so that your hamster’s tracks lead you back to its hiding place."

[8] X Research source Solid wheels are preferable, as your hamsters toes or legs may get caught between the bars of a wire wheel.
