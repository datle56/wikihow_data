Open Snapchat , then tap the profile icon in the top-left corner of the screen; you'll see your current score below your name in the middle of the page.

      "title": "Send snaps often.",
      "content": "Send snaps often. Your snap score increases by one point for every snap that you send, so make snapping your friends a regular part of your day. [2] X Research source If you don't use Snapchat for a few days, your first snap after the hiatus will reward you with 6 points."

      "title": "Snap multiple friends at once.",
      "content": "Snap multiple friends at once. You receive a point for each friend to whom you send a snap, and you'll often receive an additional point for sending the snap itself (for example, sending a snap to 10 people will result in 10-11 points). [3] X Research source After taking a snap and tapping the white \"Send\" arrow, you can tap friends' names to select them. Each person you select will receive your snap when you tap the \"Send\" arrow again. The more people to whom you send snaps, the more often you'll receive snaps that you can open back."

    {
      "title": "Open unread snaps.",
      "content": "Open unread snaps. You receive one point for every snap that you open. To open a snap, tap the red (photo) or purple (video) box next to the sender's name. You will not receive extra points for replaying snaps ."

      "content": "Add friends on Snapchat. For each friend request that you accept or that is accepted by someone else, you'll often gain one point. This isn't a strategy with much longevity, but it's good to know when starting out on Snapchat.
