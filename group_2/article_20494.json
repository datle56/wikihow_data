      "content": "Read over your sentencing order carefully. When you receive your sentencing order, you must look it over carefully with your attorney to ensure there are no errors. Although this isn't necessarily a matter of shortening or reducing your sentence, keep in mind that you will serve the period of time written on your sentencing order."

      "title": "Compare the sentencing order to the trial transcript.",
      "content": "Compare the sentencing order to the trial transcript. If you have any questions about your sentencing order, compare it to the original trial transcript and make sure the document matches the judge's orders. Any mathematical, technical, or other clerical errors can be corrected if either you or the judge notices the error. For example, if the judge sentenced you to 7 years, but your sentencing order states you were sentenced to 70 years, that's clearly a clerical error and can be corrected if you notice and point it out immediately."

      "title": "Alert the judge to any errors.",
      "content": "Alert the judge to any errors. If there is an error in your sentencing order, you should tell the judge as soon as possible. The federal rules only allow a judge 14 days to correct an error in a sentencing order. After that, she can do nothing.

      "title": "Acquire information about another crime.",
      "content": "Acquire information about another crime. Federal Rule 35 and corresponding state rules provide for your sentence to be reduced if you give information to the state about other crimes. Typically you must seek reduction within a year of when the judge announced your sentence. However, there are some exceptions where you may be eligible for a reduction even after a year. [2] X Research source If you acquire new information, you should talk to your attorney and let the prosecutor know as soon as possible, even if you've been in prison for more than one year, if you want to get your sentence reduced. If a prosecutor promises to get your prison sentence reduced if you work for him on the inside and gather information about the case, but after a year the prosecutor has not filed a motion to have your sentence reduced, talk to your attorney and find out what you should do in those circumstances. If you are considering cooperating with prosecution to get your prison sentence reduced, you should also talk to your attorney. Experienced defense attorneys understand the risks you take in assisting prosecution while you are behind bars, and will help you minimize those risks and protect yourself and your family."

      "content": "Tell the prosecutor what you know about the other crime. If you talk to another criminal, either in prison or out, and he gives you information about another crime, sharing that information with a prosecutor can get your prison sentence reduced. Any information you share within one year of being sentenced can be helpful in reducing your sentence. [3] X Research source You can have your sentence reduced even after a year if you have new information to offer that you just learned, or if you gave information to the prosecutor within your first year, but it didn't become helpful until later on. [4] X Research source If you have information within a year of your sentencing, but you didn't tell prosecutors because you didn't think it would be helpful, you can share it later and still be eligible for a sentence reduction, provided you share the information as soon as you realize it might be helpful. [5] X Research source For example, suppose you knew where a friend was keeping his money, but you didn't realize your friend was the subject of a criminal investigation, so there was no need to give prosecutors this information. However, two years after you've been sentenced to prison you see a news report indicating that prosecutors are looking for this money stash. If you inform prosecutors of what you know immediately, you may be eligible to have your sentence reduced. [6] X Research source"

If the information you provide leads to a conviction in the other crime, the prosecutor can file a motion to have your sentence reduced in exchange for your cooperation. [7] X Research source Cooperation doesn't guarantee the prosecutor will file a motion. Prosecutors only file motions to have prisoners' sentences reduced if the cooperation amounts to substantial assistance in the criminal case. What constitutes substantial assistance will vary from prosecutor to prosecutor."

Only the president has the power to commute federal sentences, and only governors have the power to commute state sentences in most states.

[9] X Research source Generally, any federal sentence is eligible for commutation, except one related to impeachment or treason. States may further restrict the types of sentences eligible for commutation. Your attorney will be able to tell you if you are eligible for commutation, or you can check with your state's department of paroles and pardons. [10] X Research source State governors have the power to convert consecutive sentences into concurrent sentences. Many states also allow their governors to commute a death sentence to a life sentence without the possibility of parole. In some states, the governor also has the power to commute a life sentence into a sentence for a definite term of years. [11] X Research source"

Avoid getting caught up in any misbehavior by other prisoners, even if you don't mean to take part in it. If you see inmates causing a serious disturbance, such as a riot, get as far away as possible from where it is happening. Otherwise, you could be mistaken for a participant in such a disturbance."
