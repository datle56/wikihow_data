      "content": "Purchase a new filter. You can find air filters at home improvement stores and most big box stores. If you're not sure what to buy, look at the size you already have after you pull it out. Basic air filters take care of things like dust and dirt. You can also buy filters to help reduce allergies, as they filter out more particles. However, the more they filter out, the less efficient they are because AC has to work harder to get the air through the filter.

It's often near the floor on the wall and looks like a vent/grate. [2] X Research source However, it may also be in the floor, ceiling, the furnace, or even the air conditioner.

      "title": "Place the new filter in the vent.",
      "content": "Place the new filter in the vent. Check for the airflow arrow on the vent. The arrow should point inward towards the duct not outward towards the grill. It should set right into the frame of the vent, as long as you have the right size. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the grill.",
      "content": "Clean the grill. Wipe down the grill with a damp rag to remove buildup of dust and hair. You can also use a vacuum cleaner if it's particularly dirty. Run the hose along the vent on the outside and inside to clean it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Check inside your AC unit. With some units, especially indoor units, your filter may be inside the unit. Find the AC closet. Pull off the front panels. They should just slide off. Often, the air filter is at the bottom. [8] X Research source Before pulling the filter out, check which direction the air flow arrow is pointed so you can install it correctly."
