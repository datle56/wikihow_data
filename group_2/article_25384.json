      "content": "Look for small, red sores on your scalp. As scalp ringworm progresses, small, pus-filled sores can begin to develop on the scalp, called a kerion. The skin may also begin to \"crust\" —it will look like very dry flaky skin that you can peel off. These are all signs that the infection has gotten worse and requires immediate medical care. [6] X Research source If you have oozing and tender sores on your scalp, you should get them treated right away as they can cause permanent scarring and hair loss. If you have a kerion, you may also develop a fever and swollen lymph nodes. Your body will try to fight the ringworm by raising the temperature of your body, leading to a fever. Your lymph nodes will also swell as they try to get the infection out of your blood. [7] X Research source"
