      "content": "Try donkey kicks to activate your glutes and outer hip muscles. Start on all fours with hands shoulder-width apart and knees directly below your hips. Keeping one knee on the ground, lift the other leg off the floor, while flexing your abdominal muscles. Lift your leg until your foot is facing the ceiling and your knee is parallel to the rest of your body. Hold and slowly, with control, return your knee to the original position. Try 3 reps of 20 for each leg. [2] X Research source Donkey kicks must be done for each leg. While some people like to do an entire set for one leg and then follow with the other leg, other people like to move leg to leg within the same repetition. Find what works for you. If you find being on all fours to be difficult, try kneeling on a pillow or an exercise mat. The added cushion will take pressure off of your knees."

When squatting, keep your weight on your heels, rather than tilted forward on the balls of your foot. Always keep good form when squatting. It’s important to keep your back straight and chest open, rather than slumping over into poor posture. [12] X Research source Keeping your back straight keeps your legs engaged and your butt working hard. If you feel good about squats, try amping up your reps or weight . Another option is to hold at the lowest part of the squat. Pausing at the most difficult part will aid in strengthening, and in turn, enlarging, your butt muscles. Don’t have a set of dumbbells? Don’t find an excuse to skip this exercise. Use things in your home to keep you in tip-top shape. For example, a milk jug filled with water can act as a decent-sized weight. To amp it up, try filling your jug with loose change."
