A cute anklet and a tribal bracelet pair well. If it's winter, then skinny jeans, moccasins/ballet flats, a halter and an over-sized cardigan look fantastic. For guys: T-shirt, shirt or jacket and jeans, trousers or shorts.For a visit to the beach, be sure to pack shorts or a swimsuit. If you are going to a fancy restaurant, wear a nice dress or a nice pair of pants and some respectable shoes. If you are just going for a walk in the park, wear something nice but casual, such as a top, pants and a belt. Since this is the ultimate non-gendered look, it's a perfect solution for all events really."
