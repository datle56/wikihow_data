      "title": "Select a topic.",
      "content": "Select a topic. Grab a pad of paper and a pencil, a computer will work too, and generate a list of potential topics. Write or type down every idea that comes to mind. Remember, the most mundane idea could turn into an amazing story! Your topics could be as general as “a children’s book about a zebra” or as specific as “a historical-fiction novel about George and Martha Washington’s courtship.” At this stage in the process, every idea is a good idea! If you are struggling to come up with ideas, draw inspiration from your own life. What are your interests? Do you have a secret passion for car racing or anime? Draw ideas from you childhood memories. Dramatize your first trip to the zoo or your first swimming lesson. After creating a list of potential subjects, select a topic from the list that grabs your attention. You will dedicate the next few weeks, months, or years to writing about the topic, so pick a topic that excites you! [1] X Research source To determine if your idea has legs, write an elevator pitch, a short, to-the-point speech about your topic. If it sounds innovative, thrilling, and or interesting as an elevator pitch, it should make an excellent story! [2] X Research source If you are struggling to come up with a topic or narrow the list down to one topic, step away. Take your mind off of the book by exercising, shopping, or completing household chores. When you feel ready to tackle the task, return to the list refreshed, refocused, and re-energized!"

      "title": "Identify your audience.",
      "content": "Identify your audience. Identifying your audience may give your book direction and focus. You would not write the same story for children, young adults, and adults. The plot of a children’s book would be far less complex than the plot of an adult novella. Once you have selected your ideal age group, determine which faction of the age group is your target audience. Is your reader male or female? Does your ideal reader like mysteries, thrillers, romances, or sci-fi? Once you have identified your audience, create fictional reader profiles. Name your fictional readers and give each one a back story. Note their age, sex, education level, their likes, dislikes, and hobbies. Keep their profiles handy throughout the brainstorming and writing process. You will find yourself asking, “would Jason like this character?” or “will Stephanie laugh at this line?” [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Develop your characters.",
      "content": "Develop your characters. Your characters will bring your story to life! Create interesting characters capable of driving the plot forward. Create a stellar and complex protagonist and a brilliant antagonist. Develop your supporting characters too! Create a detailed profile for each character you create. Find or draw a picture of the character. Don’t simply state surface level details. It is not enough to state that a character is tall, blonde, and an attorney. That information provides limited insight into the character’s personality! Instead, provide information on their family history, the academic career, their job, their worst fear, their favorite foods. Keep these profiles out while you write. Spending time on the minor details—the little things, the imperfections—will make your characters more interesting and relatable! [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline your book.",
      "content": "Outline your book. Writing a book of any length requires planning! Outlines will help you remain focused throughout the writing process and they will prevent you from straying from your plot. Get creative and use your strengths. If you are a visual person, develop a storyboard. If you are a more logical person, develop an outline organized by headings and subheadings, points and subpoints. When outlining, keep in mind that every plot has 5 sections: an inciting incident, complications, a climax, an anti-climax, and a conclusion. Construct your story arc around these 5 sections. Develop an incident that launches your book. Create complications that test your protagonist. Craft a climax that brings the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist to an exciting peak. Tie up loose ends throughout the anti-climax. Bring your book to a close in the conclusion. You could also make a flowchart, use bullet points, write on note cards, create a concept map. Sometimes it is helpful to create multiple forms of an outline. Each type of outline forces you to think through your story in a slightly different way. Storyboarding requires you to visualize the plot and your characters; flowcharts force you to consider how one subplot flows into the next subplot. Don’t aim for perfection. Outlines are meant to be rough sketches of your story!"

      "title": "Research the market.",
      "content": "Research the market. Your topic will never be completely novel. To avoid completely reproducing a published work, research the market. Find 3 to 5 books that are similar to your topic and read them. Analyze how the plots differ from your plot. Determine if and how your characters are unique and innovative. Identify what makes your book special in comparison to all the other thrillers or romances on the shelves. [5] X Research source If you are struggling to identify your book’s individuality, don’t panic. Revision is a natural part of the writing process! Return to your outline and be willing to make changes to your plot and characters. Your work will be stronger as a result of these alterations! Don’t get disappointed when you discover a book with a similar plot. There is nothing new under the sun!"

    {
      "title": "Revise your outline.",
      "content": "Revise your outline. Revisions may be stressful and frustrating, but they are always necessary! Review your outline with a critical eye and a red pen. Does your story flow? Is the climax exciting? Does the plot reach a logical conclusion? Is the conclusion too obvious? Are there any tangential sections or subplots that should be cut? Are your characters developed enough? Do you need to develop more characters? Is the setting appropriate? Will my audience enjoy the finished product? After critiquing your outline, make any necessary changes. [6] X Research source If you feel too close to your work, ask a friend to look it over for you. They may be able to identify any plot holes or tangential sections."

      "title": "Schedule your writing time.",
      "content": "Schedule your writing time. While it is ideal to write every day, it is not practical for everyone. Consider your commitments and set a realistic goal for yourself. Determine how frequently you will write. Decide if you will have time to write every day, twice a week, or just once in awhile. [7] X Research source Some weeks or months you will have more time. Be flexible. If you see an opportunity to write for an hour, grab it!"

    {
      "title": "Set a word count goal.",
      "content": "Set a word count goal. Set a realistic word count goal per writing session. This goal is meant to keep you accountable, focused, and progressing towards the completion of your work. If you are a slower writer, your word count goal may be 1000 words per session. If you only have one hour to devote per session and you are a speedier writer, set a word count goal of 1500 to 2500 words per session. If you are setting aside 4 to 8 hours a day to write, aim for 5,000 to 10,000 words per session. [8] X Research source Don’t stress over failing to reach your goal in the allotted time. Instead, remain positive and try to meet the goal during your next session."

      "title": "Write.",
      "content": "Write. Find a quiet place, free of distractions, and write! Don’t stress about comma placement or noun-verb-agreement. Just get words down on the page and edit later. Have your outline, audience profiles, and character profiles out on your workspace in case you need to look up a detail here or there. If you are feeling stuck or having a hard time getting started, join a writing workshop. Talk over your problems with other experienced writers; get feedback on your work. [9] X Research source Use one word file instead of multiple word files. Keeping your work together in one place will generate a sense of continuity. Plus, if you make a change to your plot that impacts an earlier chapter, all you have to do is scroll up to make the alteration. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Revise, edit, rewrite, repeat.",
      "content": "Revise, edit, rewrite, repeat. Open a new word document and copy-paste your novel into it. This will allow you to preserve each version of your work. Read through the document at a pace you are comfortable with. Some writers like to revise in one sitting, while others revise their work over the course of a day or week. Search for typos and grammatical errors. Pay attention to the flow of the story—are there any plot holes, is there a scene that needs to be removed, and is your climax at an appropriate point in the story? Read your dialogue carefully—does it sound realistic, does each character have a consistent voice, and is it easy to follow? After revising your book once, set it aside for a day before making your next set of revisions. When you feel confident with the story, declare it “finished.” A work is never completely finished, but at some point you must stop striving to perfect it. If you struggle to edit your work with a critical eye, ask a colleague, friend, or family member to serve as your editor."
