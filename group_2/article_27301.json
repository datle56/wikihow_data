      "content": "Place 1 to 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) (13 to 39 grams) of coconut oil into a small dish. You can also use a small cup, bowl, or plastic container. Because this lip gloss uses edible ingredients, it is a great project for young children. If you don't have coconut oil, use petroleum jelly or plant-based un-petroleum jelly instead. Be aware that it won't be edible any more. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Add in a few shakes of cake decorating pearl dust. You don't need to measure out a specific amount; the more you add, the darker the color will be. Remember, you can always add more later. You can find \"pearl dust: in little tubes or jars in the cake decorating section of a craft store. Make sure that the label says \"pearl dust\" and not \"color dust.\" Do not use cake glitter. This includes gold and silver sugar sprinkles and edible confetti. It only make your lip gloss chunky and won't give you enough sparkle."

      "content": "Transfer the lip gloss into a small, plastic jar. The little plastic jars that you use to store beads in work great for this. You can also buy empty lip balm jars, and use those instead. If you have an old lip balm jar that you wish to use, make sure that you clean it out well first. You should be able to fill 1 to 2 plastic jars, depending on how small they are."

You will need 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) (52 grams) of coconut oil, 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) (42 grams) of beeswax pellets, and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (26 grams) of shea butter. Place everything into a microwave-safe container, such as a glass measuring cup. [2] X Research source If you don't have coconut oil, you can use another type of oil, such as almond, grapeseed, or olive. If you don't have shea butter, try cocoa butter instead. Keep in mind that this may affect the color and flavor. [3] X Research source"

Repeat this process until everything is melted. [4] X Research source Expect to do this 2 to 3 more times, depending on the strength of your microwave. If you don't have a microwave, or simply don't want to use one, set the jar into a pot filled with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of boiling water, then stir it as it melts. [5] X Research source"

Don't be afraid to mix flavors to create new ones, such as lemon-mint, lavender-peppermint, or vanilla-orange. Keep in mind that some types of essential oil are more potent than others, so you may end up using even less. [7] X Research source Read up on the essential oil that you are using to ensure that it is skin-safe. If you can't find essential oil, or if you don't want to use it, use 1/2 dram (1/2 bottle) of candy-making flavor oil instead. If you want to make multiple flavors of lip gloss, divide the mixture into smaller jars first, then add your flavoring accordingly."

If the lip gloss is taking too long, you can speed the process up by sticking it into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes. Once the mixture has set, screw the caps onto the jars."

Dip the wand that came with your lip gloss into the glitter, then put it back into the tube. Pump the wand a few times to mix the glitter into the lip gloss. Your lip gloss is now ready to use! Dip the wand into the glitter 2 to 3 times for extra sparkle. The lip gloss does not have to be perfectly clear; it can be tinted another color. Do not use regular glitter from the craft store.

[10] X Research source Eyeshadow comes in different finishes, from a fine, pearlescent finish, to a grainy, glittery finish. Pick the one that you like the best. You can use cosmetic mica powder with this method as well, but cosmetic-grade glitter won't work. It'll be too heavy for lip gloss."

[11] X Research source You can find clear lip gloss bases (i.e. Versagel) in online stores specializing in makeup making supplies.
