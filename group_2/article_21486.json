      "content": "Start growing out the top of your hair first. For a flow hairstyle, you want the hair on the top of your head to be the longest. If it's shorter than medium to long length, you'll want to start growing it out, which may take several months depending on how long it currently is and how long you want your flow hairstyle to be. [1] X Research source The exact length of your flow is a matter of preference, but generally, the top of your hair will need to reach your ears for it to be considered a flow hairstyle."

      "content": "Keep the sides and back trimmed short until the top is 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. With a flow hairstyle, the sides and back of the hair are generally shorter than the top. Before you start growing the sides and back out, wait until the top is longer so they're not all the same length. [2] X Research source While you're waiting for the top of your hair to grow out, you can keep the sides and back buzzed, or you can keep them tapered by asking for a scissor cut when you go to the salon or barber."

    {
      "title": "Grow out the sides and back once the top is 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.",
      "content": "Grow out the sides and back once the top is 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Once there's a 3 in (7.6 cm) difference between the top and the sides and back, you can grow the rest of your hair out without having to worry about it being too long compared to the top. [3] X Research source Once you start growing out the sides, you'll want to avoid having them buzzed whenever you go in for a trim."

    {
      "title": "Continue growing your hair until the top reaches your ears.",
      "content": "Continue growing your hair until the top reaches your ears. At that point, your hair will be medium length, and you'll be able to style it in a flow hairstyle. You can continue to grow out your hair if you'd prefer a longer flow, or you can keep it trimmed to that length. [4] X Research source You might go through awkward stages while you're growing your hair out, but that's normal! You can wear hats or use more product to style and tame your hair while you're waiting for it to grow out."

      "title": "Get your hair trimmed every 2-3 months to keep it healthy.",
      "content": "Get your hair trimmed every 2-3 months to keep it healthy. It might seem counterproductive, but it's important to trim your hair every few months to get rid of split ends . Untrimmed split ends can travel further up your hair and actually make it harder to grow your hair out. [5] X Research source Make sure you tell your barber or hairstylist that you're growing your hair out so they don't trim too much off."

      "title": "Style your hair right after you get out of the shower.",
      "content": "Style your hair right after you get out of the shower. A flow hairstyle is easiest to create when your hair is damp. When you get out of the shower, let your hair air dry slightly, or gently squeeze out the excess water with a towel. Make sure it's still a little damp. [6] X Research source Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel to dry it since that can cause damage. Let your hair air dry if possible instead of using a blow dryer since heat can damage long hair."

      "title": "Brush your hair back and away from your face to one side while it's damp.",
      "content": "Brush your hair back and away from your face to one side while it's damp. You can use a brush or your hands. The key is to get all of your hair off of your face and brush it back so it's flowing to one side. [7] X Research source The flow hairstyle is supposed to be effortless and casual, so you don't need to use any products. However, you can use a grooming cream or leave-in conditioner to keep your hair pushed back if you'd like. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on a hat while your hair is still damp if you want wings. One optional component of the flow hairstyle is flipping the ends of your hair out so they look like flowy, wavy wings. If you're interested in the wing look, wearing a hat while your hair dries is an easy way to achieve it. Once your hair is completely dry, take the hat off and run your fingers through your hair to finish styling it. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Limit how often you shampoo your long hair to keep it healthy.",
      "content": "Limit how often you shampoo your long hair to keep it healthy. Shampoo strips your hair of its natural oils, and washing it too frequently can make it dry and brittle. Try to limit how often you wash your hair to once or twice a week. [10] X Research source If your hair gets greasy in between washes, apply a dry shampoo to the roots to absorb the oils."

    {
      "title": "Condition your hair",
      "content": "Condition your hair every day to keep it hydrated. Unlike shampoo, conditioner won't strip your hair of its natural oils. Instead, conditioner hydrates your hair and locks in moisture. To keep your flow hairstyle healthy, use conditioner more often than shampoo. [11] X Research source You can also get a co-washing product, which washes and conditions your hair at the same time. That way, you never have to use shampoo."
