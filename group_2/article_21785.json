A vertical bike rack is a good option if you're trying to conserve wall space. Choose a horizontal bike rack if you want your bike to hang flat against the wall.

Once you have the rack in position, mark where all of the screw holes on the rack line up with the wall. Most bike racks have two screw holes. [2] X Research source If you’re using a horizontal rack, make sure the distance between the floor and the bike rack is greater than the height of the bike. If you’re using a vertical rack, make sure the distance between the floor and the bike rack is greater than the length of the bike."

For example, if the bike rack came with 6mm screws, use a 5mm drill bit."

Use a bathroom scale to figure out the weight of the bike if you're unsure. Weigh just yourself on the scale, and then weigh yourself on the scale while holding the bike. Subtract your weight from the weight of you plus the bike - the number you're left with is how much your bike weighs."
