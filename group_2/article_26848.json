      "title": "Boil all the smaller items inside the stockpot for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Boil all the smaller items inside the stockpot for 10 minutes. Place the spoon, knife, cheese mold, cheesecloth, colander, mesh grate, and cheese mats into the large stockpot, cover everything with water and bring it to a boil. Let everything boil for 10 minutes, and then carefully drain the water and set the items on a clean countertop. [1] X Research source Although blue cheese is moldy by nature, you want to make sure to not introduce any other kinds of harmful bacteria to the mixture. This process cleans the stockpot for you, so you don’t have to do anything additional to it."

      "title": "Clean the baking tray and large plastic bucket with soapy water.",
      "content": "Clean the baking tray and large plastic bucket with soapy water. Don’t use an old sponge to clean the items, as it could transfer bacteria in spite of the soap. Use a new sponge or clean washcloth to wipe down the baking tray and the 5 gallon (19 liter) plastic bucket. [2] X Research source You could mix in 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of bleach to wash these items if you want to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe down the countertops and stovetop with water and soap.",
      "content": "Wipe down the countertops and stovetop with water and soap. Any working surface that you think you might use during the cheese-making process will need to be wiped down. Use warm water and dish soap, and then dry off the surfaces with a clean towel. [3] X Research source Wear gloves if you have sensitive skin—just make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before you begin the cooking process."

      "title": "Heat the milk and cream in the stockpot until it reaches 88 °F (31 °C).",
      "content": "Heat the milk and cream in the stockpot until it reaches 88 °F (31 °C). Add 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of whole milk along with 2 cups (470 mL) of cream, and attach the thermometer to the side of the stockpot. Warm the milk slowly by turning the heat to medium, rather than high, to prevent it from scalding. [4] X Research source You can use any kind of animal milk, as long as it’s whole milk. Goat, sheep, and cow milks are all acceptable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend the blue cheese and water while the milk is heating.",
      "content": "Blend the blue cheese and water while the milk is heating. Take the 1 ounce (28 g) of blue cheese and put it in a blender along with a 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of water. Blend it for about 30 seconds, or until completely smooth, and then set it aside. [5] X Research source Using blue cheese to make blue cheese is an easier way to introduce the penicillium to the mixture without actually having to find and buy it. The penicillium is what creates the mold in the cheese, giving it its characteristic blue veins and strong taste and odor. If you would rather not use blue cheese for the mold component, you will need to add 1 ⁄ 4 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of penicillium to the milk and cream at this time."

      "content": "Add the yogurt culture, mesophyllic starter, calcium chloride, and blue cheese to the pot. You’ll use 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of calcium chloride mixed with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water, 1 package of yogurt culture starter, 1 package of direct-set mesophyllic starter, and the blue cheese and water you blended previously. Stir the pot for about 1 minute to incorporate all the ingredients. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Lower the heat so it maintains a temperature of 88 °F (31 °C). Turn down the burner and check the thermometer until the temperature reaches the right degree. The temperature component of blue cheese is really important to getting it to the right consistency. [9] X Research source If you’re having a hard time getting the right temperature on the stove top, you could fill the sink with hot water and submerge the pot in there for a more gentle heating process. You may need to add more hot water every so often to keep the temperature at the right level."

      "content": "Let the liquid simmer and coagulate for about 90 minutes. Put the lid back onto the pot, removing the thermometer if you need to. Set a timer for 90 minutes. When you check the pot once the time is up, the mixture should break into chunks when you push it. [10] X Research source If the consistency is more like yogurt, let it sit for an extra 15 minutes. The top of the pan will be filled with the coagulated milk, and beneath it will be the whey, which is the remaining liquid."

Then do the same going the opposite direction, to create a grid pattern. [11] X Research source This process just helps to loosen the curd and makes it easier to scoop out."

      "content": "Let the curds sit for 15 minutes with the heat still on. After you’ve cut through the curds, you need to give them a little more time to rest. This helps them solidify more and lose any additional whey. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix salt in with your hands and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. Use 2 tablespoons (17 grams) of kosher salt and sprinkle it evenly overtop of the curds. Then use your hands (wash them before touching the curd) to gently mix up all the curds. This will help them not coagulate together again. Then let the mixture sit for an additional 10 minutes. [16] X Research source You may also be able to find specific cheese salt at the specialty cheese shop, which you can use, too. But kosher salt will also work just fine!"

Set up a station for yourself to get ready to fill the molds.

Fill it up as high as you can. [18] X Research source If the mold fills before you’re out of curds, let the mold sit for 10 minutes to let extra moisture come out, and then continue filling it. Try to avoid pressing down on the curds. Just let them settle organically."

Make sure to set the mold back down over the cookie tray each time to you flip it.

You can leave it for longer than the 8 hours, but at a minimum, that’s how much time it’ll need. [20] X Research source If you have cats or other animals that might get onto the counters, set up a barricade so they can’t get into the kitchen overnight."

Cover the grate with another cheese mat. Place the cheese inside the bucket, and then sprinkle it generously with kosher salt. Don’t worry if some of the salt falls off! [21] X Research source You’re going to be using a lot of kosher salt over the next few days, so if you’re starting to run out, make a trip to the store for more."

If there is any whey that has drained off, take a moment to get rid of it when you add the new salt by draining it into a sink. [23] X Research source Flipping the cheese lets you salt the other side periodically, and it also helps to keep shifting the weight so that the excess whey continues to come out."

This is what will create those blue veins that run through the cheese. [25] X Research source The holes let the penicillin from the blue cheese move around."

      "title": "Keep flipping the cheese every 2 days until you see red and white mold.",
      "content": "Keep flipping the cheese every 2 days until you see red and white mold. Once this mold appears, use a long, thin, clean knife or cake frosting spatula to scrape off the mold. Throw it away, and return the cheese to the bucket. Keep doing this, at least once a month, whenever you notice the mold has grown a lot. [26] X Research source Always make sure to disinfect your tools before you use them on your cheese."

After the long waiting time is over, give the cheese one additional scrape and then wrap it up tightly in either foil or a cheesecloth.

Just make sure to reseal it with the cheesecloth or foil after you’re done each time. The longer you let it age in the fridge , the stronger the flavor will get. [28] X Research source For a fun gift idea, you could wrap small parcels of blue cheese in cheesecloth, wrap it in butcher paper, tie it up with string, and decorate the paper."
