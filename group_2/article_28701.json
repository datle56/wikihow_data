      "title": "Select a diode strength and color.",
      "content": "Select a diode strength and color. The strength of a diode will be listed in milliwatts (mW). The color of the diode will be determined by its wavelength (measured in nanometers, nm). A wavelength of 650 nm corresponds to a red laser, a wavelength of 405 nm corresponds to a blue laser, and a green laser has a wavelength around 520 nm. Green lasers are the most expensive, followed by blue. Red is the cheapest. [1] X Research source You can buy diodes online and sometimes at electronic supply stores. The diode costs can range anywhere from tens to thousands of dollars, depending on the laser you choose."

      "content": "Take apart an old DVD or Blu-Ray disk burner. If you aren't picky about the color, you can take apart an old DVD or Blu-Ray disk burner. There will be two diodes. Find the diode on the disk burning side. The one on the disk reading side is not strong enough to produce a burning laser. [2] X Research source The diode will look like a small round light. It is likely encased in metal and will be positioned so that it can shine on the bottom of the DVD/Blu-Ray tray."
    },
    {
      "title": "Salvage the diode from the disk burner.",
      "content": "Salvage the diode from the disk burner. Once you have located the disk burning diode, remove it from the DVD (or Blu-Ray) burner. You may have to remove small screws or cut the diode away from the rest of the burner. It is possible that the diode is encased in a metal casing. If this is the case, the casing can be left on the diode after you remove it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Connect the diode to a laser driver.",
      "content": "Connect the diode to a laser driver. The laser driver is the electrical component that controls the functioning of the laser. The diode will likely need soldered to the laser driver. There should be two leads coming from the diode for this purpose. Use a soldering gun to solder the leads to the driver at the positive and negative terminals. These terminals should be labeled on the driver and extend to the edge of the driver for soldering purposes. [3] X Research source The driver should not be connected to any power source until soldering is complete."
    },
    {
      "title": "Power the laser with batteries.",
      "content": "Power the laser with batteries. After the diode has been connected to the driver, you can connect the driver to a power source. Batteries are the go to choice since they make your laser portable. You will need at least AA batteries to produce a burning laser. [4] X Research source The driver will have leads for a power supply. These leads will need to be connected to a battery pack or directly to the battery. If the leads need soldered, you will have to use a battery pack. You cannot solder onto a battery."

      "title": "Encase the laser.",
      "content": "Encase the laser. You can buy a laser casing online to house the parts of your laser. Alternatively, you can make a laser casing from things lying around your house. Popular items used to make casings include Altos mint cans, bic lighters, and the casings of weaker laser pointers."

      "title": "Obtain a laser lens.",
      "content": "Obtain a laser lens. A laser lens is needed to condense the light from a wide pattern to a thin beam. This concentrates the energy of your laser. This concentrated beam is what allows you to burn things with your laser. [5] X Research source Glass lenses are better than plastic lenses, but they are more expensive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Concentrate the beam.",
      "content": "Concentrate the beam. Adjust the lens to concentrate the beam when you are using the laser. This will make the beam powerful enough to burn through some materials and ignite matches or paper. Be very careful when using this laser. Do not point it at anyone or anything that does not belong to you. The laser is very dangerous when focused. [6] X Research source It is a crime to point the laser at aircraft and/or motor vehicles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Widen the beam when you are finished.",
      "content": "Widen the beam when you are finished. Adjust the beam so that the laser is spread out. This will make the laser less powerful when hitting any one spot. This is the safest way to store the laser in case it accidentally gets turned on. Keep in mind that the laser can still be dangerous, however. It should never be within reach of children."
