      "content": "Evaluate the space where you plan to install the floating flooring. Before you go about laying down your floating floor, you need to know how much ground you need to cover. Although it's perfectly possible to buy only the amount required for the job, it's beneficial to purchase a little more than necessary to account for mistakes and patch-ups, especially if you're installing for the first time. Using a tape measure, measure the room from one wall to the opposite wall, and write down the distance. Suppose the distance is 10 feet (3.05 m). Next, measure the distance of the opposing walls to each other. Suppose this distance is 12 feet (3.66 m). Multiply these two measurements to find the total area you will need to cover with pre-finished hardwood flooring. From the example, you would multiply 10' x 12' (3.05m x 3.66m), which would give you a total area of 120 square feet (11.163 square meters)."

      "content": "If your subfloor is concrete, cover it with a wood or engineered wood subfloor first. Laying down your floating flooring directly onto concrete is a no-no. For one, there's less insulation. Also, the possibility of dampness, however small, is greater when there are fewer membranes between your concrete foundation and your floating floor. In choosing a wood subfloor, many professionals like to use OSB (oriented strand board) or plywood. Use the measurements above to estimate how much OSB or plywood you will need. If you decide to install your floating floor on concrete anyway, you need to test the concrete with a calibrated concrete moisture meter to verify that it is dry (less than 4% moisture content) before proceeding.

Before you really get started, there's just a few more things you need to take care of: [2] X Research source Use a level at various spots on the floor to make sure it's even. Fill in unlevel spots or grooves with patching compound. Sand down bumps and ridges in the subfloor. When you're all finished, vacuum the floor to remove any dust or debris."

      "content": "Pick out the floating flooring. Pre-finished hardwood flooring comes in different sizes, thicknesses, lengths, colors and designs. Some common finishes and wood options include oak, cherry, maple and walnut. Which you choose depends largely on personal preference. Calculate how many boxes of floating flooring and how many rolls of foam underlayment you will need to purchase. You can find this information by reading how much footage each box and roll covers. Divide the total area of the room by the area the box or roll covers. Open the boxes and let them sit in the room for three or four days to let the flooring adjust to the house climate."

Lay out the first piece of square edge flooring with the groove side against the wall so it fits snugly against the spacer. Place the next piece end to end. [4] X Research source Why do you need spacers around the walls? The floating wood floor will expand and contract as a unit with temperature fluctuations. Leaving a small barrier around the side of the room will give the flooring enough of a buffer to do its thing without cracking. [5] X Research source"

Continue this process on the floor along the wall. If you have one, a dead-blow hammer will remove the need for a kick tool or wood block to serve as padding.

If you're trying to install flooring around doors for example, you might find that the floating floor doesn't quite fit beneath the casing. Trim these door casings with a flush-cut dovetail saw if the flooring doesn't fit underneath the casings. To do this, hold the saw flat against a scrap piece of flooring to use as a guide, and press the saw into the casing, gently make the cut. Slide the flooring underneath to make sure that it fits.

Usually, you can fasted one piece of flooring to its vertical cousin by tapping on the bottom of the end piece. But what if the end piece butts up against a wall, and you don't have the space to tap the tongue and groove together? For this you use a tool called a pull bar, which is a long strip of metal with a tongue on either end going in opposite directions. Just fit the pull bar down into the seam between the end piece and the wall, and then tap on the upward-sticking tongue of the bar to connect the tongue and groove. [11] X Research source"
