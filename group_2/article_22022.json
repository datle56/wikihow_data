      "content": "Have a movie marathon. Choose your favorite movies or television show. Find a free weekend and get your friends together for a spot of binge watching. In between viewings you can discuss what you love about the entertainment and they're your favorite. Make sure you have lots of food on hand. Snacks make a binge watching weekend more fun. Make sure to take breaks now and then to stretch or take a walk outside. Amuse yourselves watching a bad movie, especially a cult classic. You can also do this with a poorly written book. Take turns reading it out loud and see how far each person gets before they are laughing too hard to keep reading. You can even turn it into a game (a drinking game for those over the legal drinking age, or using chocolate/candy as prizes otherwise). Everyone will thank you."

Look for old notes you passed back and forth or a journal you wrote together. Maybe you made dolls, or played football together. The objects will help you recall more of the times you spent together."
