Insert another needle into the loop and make a knit stitch (K1). Then make a purl stitch and 1 more knit stitch before pulling the last stitch onto your right needle. You'll need 4 double pointed needles in any size you like."

Knit into the front and back of each of the stitches that remain on the left needle. [4] X Research source Increasing each stitch in the row will double the number of stitches on your needle.
