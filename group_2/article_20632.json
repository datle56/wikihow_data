      "content": "Make eye contact and act relaxed when you’re around her. In one study, researchers observed men at a bar to see who had the best shot at picking up women. Throughout the night, the researchers found that men who made eye contact, moved around, and acted comfortable ended up getting more positive attention. [1] X Research source With this in mind, do your best to move and act confidently whenever you cross paths with her next. For example, you might make eye contact throughout a conversation or use a lot of gestures while you talk. Reader Poll: We asked 1671 wikiHow readers, and 67% agreed that the best way to show confidence when meeting a girl is making eye contact and smiling . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Show her that you’re genuine and down-to-earth. If she hasn’t seemed interested, flirting and playing hard-to-get won’t get you very far. Instead, pay close attention to her whenever you talk, and make it obvious that you’re listening. Try to sprinkle empathetic language into the conversation, so she feels heard and understood. [2] X Research source You might say, “That’s fantastic!” or “I’m so happy for you!” if she shares something positive, or “I’m so sorry to hear that!” if she shares bad news."

      "content": "Asking genuine questions helps you build a connection. The next time you’re both chatting, ask insightful questions about whatever she’s talking about. [3] X Research source Showing that you really care about her thoughts and feelings might pique her interest in you. If she’s complaining about having a busy schedule, you might ask, “What would you want to do if your afternoon was completely free?” If you can, stick to open-ended questions. Unfortunately, “yes” or “no” questions can make your chat feel more like an interrogation. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "General, friendly statements can be great conversation-starters. Instead of flirting or saying a pick-up line, make a broad statement that’s really easy for her to reply to. With any luck, your conversation will help you build a positive connection with her. [5] X Research source If you’re waiting in line for food, you might say “Wow, that pizza looks really good!” or “I hope this food is worth the wait.”"

      "content": "She may feel more attracted to you if you have things in common. [6] X Research source Pay attention to her interests and hobbies, and turn them into a conversation-starter. Your chat might get the ball rolling in a positive direction! For example, you might say, “I love your hoodie! Are you a fan of the Blue Jays too?” If she likes reading, you might say, “I’m looking for something to read during study hall. Got any suggestions?”"

      "content": "She might feel better about you after doing you a favor. [7] X Research source If you can, try asking the girl for a small request. With any luck, she might start viewing you in a different light! You might ask to borrow a pencil from her, or see if she can look something up for you on her phone. Psychologists call this the “Benjamin Franklin Effect” because of this popular Ben Franklin quote: “He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, then he whom you yourself have obliged.” [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Becoming a familiar face could make her feel attracted to you. Also known as the “mere-exposure effect,” this is an easy way to build a rapport with the girl you like. [9] X Research source As you pass her, offer a friendly wave or say hi so she notices you. The more she sees you, the more positive she might end up feeling about you. Don’t go too overboard with this! While there’s nothing wrong with passing by and saying a quick hello, don’t follow her everywhere she goes. That might have the opposite effect."

      "content": "Pick-up lines aren’t always the smoothest way to start a conversation. Instead of being clever, focus on being genuine. Believe it or not, a simple “hi” or “hello” can go a lot further than a cheesy line like “Your beauty is unreal. May I pinch you to make sure I’m awake?” [10] X Research source If you’d really like to give a pick-up line a try, go for something more creative. For instance, a line like “Did anyone ever tell you that you look like what you look like?” could be a funny, Zen-like way to break the ice."

      "content": "Beauty isn’t everything, but it’s definitely part of the formula. During one study, researchers pretended to hook several women up to a lie detector. Then, they asked the women if good looks made men seem more attractive. Believing they were attached to a lie detector, the women admitted that men who looked good seemed more appealing. [11] X Research source Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean that you have to break the bank on new clothes or hair products. Instead, focus on looking and feeling your best before seeing her again."

      "content": "They can put in a good word for you with her. If her friends like and trust you, she’s more likely to feel the same way, too. Don’t go too over-the-top with this; instead, just offer a light, friendly suggestion and see how it goes. You might say, “I’ve got it really bad for Katie, but I don’t think she’s interested. Do you think you could put in a good word for me?”"
