      "content": "Recognize the symptoms. E. coli predominantly affects the gastrointestinal tracts in adults. It causes either watery diarrhea or, in more severe cases, bloody diarrhea that can lead to other complications such as kidney failure. E. coli infections occur most frequently while traveling to areas of the world with poorer hygiene than we have here in North America. It is transmitted via fecal contamination of food, water, etc. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Symptoms of an E. coli infection include: [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Abdominal pain Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Fever Abdominal cramps"

      "content": "Do not take anit-diarrheals and antibiotics. It is important to understand that E. coli infections are not able to be \"cured\" (and the bacteria cannot be \"killed\") with typical medical drugs such as antibiotics or even antidiarrheals. Rather, the treatment offered by medical professionals is \"supportive,\" meaning it consists of rest, fluids, and medications for symptom management such as pain and/or nausea. This is counter-intuitive for many people, who often expect medical drugs as a \"cure\" for illnesses such as an E. coli infection. Antidiarrheal medications are not helpful because they delay the passage of the infection and a worsening of symptoms. Your best bet, counter-intuitive as it may seem, is to allow the diarrhea to continue to get rid of the infection as soon as possible. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Antibiotics are also not recommended — they have been shown to worsen the illness, because when the bacteria are killed they release more toxins, resulting in greater damage.

      "title": "Kill the bacteria naturally with your immune system.",
      "content": "Kill the bacteria naturally with your immune system. Because antibiotics are not advised in E. coli infections, it will be up to your immune system to kill off the infection. Fortunately, your immune system is very capable of doing this, given adequate time and proper support. Rest, follow your doctor's instructions, and allow your immune system to do its job! [6] X Research source Talk to your doctor about the supportive measures you can take to get through the infection. It will be important to stay hydrated as you will be losing lots of fluids while you are sick."

      "title": "Rest.",
      "content": "Rest. It may sound simple, but rest is key to recovering as quickly as possible from an E. coli infection. Since there is not much that traditional medical treatments can do, rest becomes very important to allow your body the energy to best fight off the infection using its own natural defences. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take time off work or school. Not only is it important to stay home and rest for your own recovery, it is also important as a means to avoid contaminating others in the workplace or school. You should remain isolated socially because E. Coli infections are very contagious and you do not want to be responsible for infecting your entire office or class with this unpleasant bacteria. Be sure to wash your hands frequently, and to avoid others as much as possible for the duration of your illness (which should get better within a week or so). E. coli is transmitted through fecal matter, so wash your hands extra thoroughly after using the restroom. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay hydrated. E. coli infections tend to cause lots of diarrhea. As a result, is important to rehydrate yourself with water and fluids containing carbohydrates and electrolytes to compensate for the fluids lost in the diarrhea.

      "content": "Try using oral rehydration salts. Oral rehydration salts (ORS) is a powder containing salts and electrolytes that are needed in the body. It is more effective than plain water when it comes to rehydration. The powder is mixed in a litre of water and then the solution should be drunk of the next 24 hours. [10] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The powder can be obtained online and in pharmacies and most grocery stores. Alternatively, ORS can be prepared at home by dissolving 4 tablespoons of sugar and half teaspoonful each of baking soda and salt in one liter of water.

      "content": "Go to the hospital for cases of severe dehydration. You will be given intravenous fluids to replace the electrolytes and ions that have been lost during diarrhea and vomiting. An indication of when to go to hospital is when you can no longer tolerate fluids by mouth because of nausea, or when you are having diarrhea more than four times a day. If in doubt, it is best to see a medical professional to assess whether IV fluids can help to speed your recovery. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Electrolytes are substances that are found in the body and help to maintain the normal functioning of the body. You may be required to get a blood transfusion in cases of severe bloody diarrhea (which some strains of E. coli can cause). Your blood will be checked to determine hemoglobin levels. This helps to know the amount of blood that has been lost so that the blood can be transfused back."

      "title": "Modify your diet.",
      "content": "Modify your diet. As your condition improves, start with a low fibre diet at first. This will help the digestive tract restore its normal function more quickly. If you have too much fibre, your stool will bulk up and pass through your digestive tract too quickly — a process that is already likely happening with your condition. You can add more fibre back into your diet after the diarrhea has subsided and when you are feeling better. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Also avoid alcohol and caffeine. Alcohol can alter your liver metabolism and it is harmful to the lining of your stomach. Caffeine worsens diarrhea by increasing dehydration."
