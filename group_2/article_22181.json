      "content": "Not sure how to text your crush or girlfriend? Have no fear because we talked to marriage therapist Adam Wagner to bring you the best relationship advice! We asked him all about communicating with your special someone, and he had plenty of tips to share: Let her know you’re thinking about her with something personal. For instance, you drive by a restaurant and text her, “I just drove by where we had our first date, and I just wanted to say I love you.” Know that if texting her is “awkward and uncomfortable in the beginning, it’ll eventually become natural and organic,” especially the more you get to know each other. The best way to demonstrate love is “to be open to the other person’s thoughts.” The key ingredient to a lasting relationship? Respect . You have to “understand the value of what your life would be if you didn’t have her.”"
