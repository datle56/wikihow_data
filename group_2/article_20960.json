      "content": "Deep condition your hair every 2-3 days for 2 weeks before bleaching it. This isn’t required, but it’s helpful if you have the patience for it. Going from black to blonde hair is going to require several bleaching sessions, and bleach easily dries-out and damages your hair. Get it to the healthiest state beforehand to make the result look that much better. [1] X Research source Similarly, stop using heat-styling tools for a few weeks before bleaching to limit damaging heat exposure."

      "content": "Strip away existing dye and color with a clarifying shampoo . Please note that if your hair hasn’t been color-treated, you can skip this step. Clarifying shampoo won’t completely remove the color from your hair, but it can lighten it enough to make it easier to bleach. Use the shampoo for 2-3 washes before you plan on bleaching your hair. [2] X Research source Avoid using clarifying shampoo the same day you apply your first bleach treatment. It could cause your hair to get excessively dry."

      "title": "Do a strand test to see how the bleach takes to your hair.",
      "content": "Do a strand test to see how the bleach takes to your hair. This test will help you determine how long you should leave the bleach on your hair for. It could also tell you if your scalp is too sensitive for the bleaching process. Use a small section of hair that is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and that can be easily hidden underneath the rest of your hair. [3] X Research source Clip the rest of your hair back so that it doesn’t accidentally come into contact with the bleach. Wear gloves and follow the directions to mix the bleach powder and developer. Leave the bleach on your hair for 30-45 minutes before rinsing it out. If your scalp gets red or irritated, that could indicate you have an allergy or sensitivity to the chemicals. If this happens, don’t proceed with bleaching your entire head. Visit a professional colorist to see what your next steps should be instead."

      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 sections with elastics or clips. Once you’re ready to start your first bleaching session, separate your hair into 4 quadrants: part your hair down the middle, then split each side into 2 sections, one high and one low. Use hair elastics or clips to keep each section separate. [4] X Research source If you have a lot of hair, you may want to separate it into even more sections so that it’s easier to work with."

      "content": "Protect your skin and clothes by wearing gloves and an old T-shirt. Bleach is a harsh chemical and can burn your skin, so you should limit how much of your skin comes into contact with it. Wear a pair of rubber gloves when mixing and applying the bleach powder and developer. Change your clothes and wear something you aren’t super attached to—if you drop bleach on your shirt, it’ll stain it. [5] X Research source You may also want to lay down some old towels to protect the space you’re working in. If bleach gets on the furniture, it can cause irreparable stains."

      "content": "Mix the developer and powder in a small plastic bowl. When it comes to going from black to blonde hair, it’s best to not skimp on the product you buy—visit a salon or cosmetics store rather than a grocery store to buy your supplies. Check out the following breakdown for information on which volume of developer you should buy: A 20-volume developer will lift your hair 1-2 shades; this would be a good option if you’re working with hair that has been previously colored and is damaged or dry. A 30-volume developer will lift your hair 2-3 shades; this is a great option if your hair is in its natural state. A 40-volume developer will lift your hair about 4 shades, but it can be very damaging; if your scalp is sensitive, avoid using this high of a developer as it could cause major irritation. You may need to use a higher volume developer to make up for the underlying pigments in your dark hair. [6] X Expert Source Charlie Adams Professional Hair Stylist & Board Certified Haircolorist Expert Interview. 21 July 2021. Because your hair is so dark, using bleach is the best option for lightening your hair. Other methods, like using peroxide or sun-in spray, will give your hair a coppery tone and will probably never give you the shade you actually want."

      "content": "Apply the bleach to each section of your hair, starting with the ends first. Start with a bottom section and undo it from its elastic or clip. Take a 1 inch (2.5 cm) piece of hair and use the applicator brush to spread the bleach from the tips to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your scalp, leaving the roots untouched. Repeat this until the entire section is covered, then undo the next quadrant and do the same thing until your entire head (sans roots) is done. [7] X Research source The heat from your scalp can make the bleach act faster, which sometimes results in what is called “hot roots,” meaning that your roots are significantly lighter than the rest of your hair."

      "content": "Go back and apply bleach to the roots of your hair. After you’ve bleached the lengths of your hair, it’s time to go back and tackle the roots. Start at the back of your head and work your way forward in sections, applying the bleach just to the 1 inch (2.5 cm) you left untouched previously. Feel free to secure each quadrant of hair in an elastic or clip as you finish to help yourself stay organized. [8] X Research source If at any point the bleach starts burning your scalp, rinse it out immediately."

Feel free to cover your hair with a shower cap during this stage so that you don’t accidentally get bleach on furniture or anything else. [9] X Research source Don’t leave the bleach in your hair for more than 45 minutes. Keep in mind that this is just the first bleaching session in your process. You’ll need to do at least one more to get your hair to the right shade of blonde, so don’t get upset if the color isn’t looking perfect just yet."

Use a bleach-specific moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, which is often included in the bleaching packet you purchased. Let your hair air dry rather than using a blowdryer—remember, your hair just went through a lot so it’s important to limit heat-styling products right now.

      "content": "Use toner on your hair after 1-2 days to help neutralize brassy tones. You’re going to be walking around for a few weeks with your hair in an in-between state, so using toner at this stage will help you feel less self-conscious about any potential orange or brassy shades. Opt for a silver, pearl, or light ash toner to help cool down your hair. If you don’t want to apply toner at this stage, at least switch to using purple shampoo, which will also help get rid of brassy tones and make your hair color look ashier."

      "content": "Wait 2-4 weeks before repeating the bleaching process. This is the most important step in keeping your hair as healthy as possible during your black-to-blonde transition. If your hair is brittle and dry, put off the second bleaching session for 3-4 weeks; if it seems to be responding well to conditioning treatments, wait 1-2 weeks. [12] X Research source If after the second bleaching session your hair still isn’t as light as you want, wait another 1-2 weeks and then do a third session. Or, you may want to visit a professional colorist at that stage to get some help before doing any more damage to your hair. Don’t do more than 3 bleaching sessions maximum. It will be extremely hard for your hair to come back from that much exposure to a harsh chemical."

If you don’t want to buy a product at the store, applying coconut oil and letting it sit for 20-30 minutes can help rehydrate those bleached locks of hair.

Once it’s time to apply the next round of bleach, use either the same or a lesser-volume developer than you did before. The higher-volume a developer is, the more damage it will do to your hair. [14] X Research source A 20-volume developer will lift your hair another 1-2 shades. With the right toner, it may be enough to get your hair to the bright blonde color you want. A 30-volume developer will lift your hair another 2-3 shades. This is a good choice if your hair isn’t horribly brittle and dry from the first round of bleach."
