In a bowl, combine a packet of dark cherry Kool Aid with 1-2 tablespoons ( 14.79 ml-29.57 ml) of chocolate syrup. Add a teaspoon (4.93 ml) of water and stir. Adjust the mixture as you wish, adding more water if you want it more liquid-y or more chocolate syrup if you want the blood to look darker.

Combine 16 parts white corn syrup with 1 part each of powder washing detergent, water, and either beet or pomegranate juice. Stir to mix the ingredients. [2] X Research source Add in a small squirt of chocolate syrup if you wish to make the blood a more realistic color. You can buy 100% pomegranate juice at the store, or use the beet juice that comes in canned beets. You can also use beet powder in place of beet juice. This blood is non-edible and is quite sticky."

      "content": "Make fake blood from tomato paste and water. One of the most simple ways you can make fake blood is to combine tomato paste and water. Use about 4 parts tomato paste to one part water, and stir to combine the ingredients for an edible fake blood. Add in 1 part maple syrup if you want a thicker, sludgier consistency. You can also use ketchup or tomato sauce in the place of tomato paste, though they have a brighter and less realistic color."

      "content": "Combine red and blue paint with water. In a medium sized bowl, add 2 parts red washable tempera paint to one part water. Then pour in a dash of blue, about one teaspoon (4.93 ml) per cup (236.59 ml) of red paint you are using. Stir with a paintbrush or a spoon until the colors and water are mixed. Washable tempura paint isn’t edible, but it also won’t stain your clothes. Adding a touch of blue gives fake blood a darker and more realistic color. Stir the tempura paint instead of shaking. Because of the chemical composition of the paint, shaking can cause it to foam."

      "content": "Mix red ink with glue. Glue dyed with red ink makes thick and sticky fake blood. Add your desired amount of liquid school glue to a disposable bowl, using as much glue as you want blood. Add in red ink, which you can purchase from art and hobby stores, until you are satisfied with the intensity of the color. If you want a darker blood color, add brown ink or chocolate syrup. [4] X Research source You can also remove the ink tube from a red pen, cut it with a serrated knife, and pour the red ink into the glue. Aim to use about 3 parts glue and 2 parts ink. To make the fake blood less bright and more realistic, add in cocoa powder a teaspoon (14.79 ml) at a time. Cocoa powder darkens the fake blood to make it more of a burgundy color than a bright red. Corn syrup and cocoa powder creates a thicker blood than using just paint and water."
