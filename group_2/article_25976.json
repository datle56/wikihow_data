      "title": "Light language is a way to channel the sound of your soul.",
      "content": "Light language is a way to channel the sound of your soul. As opposed to the cultural and societal languages we are used to, light language is a purely vibrational energy that can be felt and expressed. [1] X Research source It cannot be interpreted with the logical mind, but rather received by the heart and spirit. Light language is a universal language, meaning that it can share the same meaning through multiple dimensions. [2] X Research source Light can be thought of as informational frequency or “codes” and physical expression is the language used to convey that information."

      "title": "The origins of light language are said to date back to proposed ancient civilizations.",
      "content": "The origins of light language are said to date back to proposed ancient civilizations. It’s thought that mysterious civilizations of the past, like those of the unproven Atlantis and Lemuria, used light language in healing ceremonies. [3] X Research source Some also believe that light language originated in the subtle realms. The subtle realms, or worlds made up of matter that aren’t visible to the naked eye, are considered by some to exist all around us. [4] X Research source Many spiritualists even accept light language as the first language of the human experience, and that all earthly languages are contrived from light language. [5] X Research source Though light language is not verified by science, it has been around for centuries. Researchers are just now beginning to study it, where it could come from, and how it may benefit those who practice it. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Many believe light language comes from within you and your higher self. Your higher aspects, which some contend have incarnated in other dimensions and realms, are able to send your earthly form messages, lessons, and guidance when you are in a reflective—or open-minded—state. [7] X Research source Light language may be able to dive deep into the memory of your DNA, so the messages received can tap into your past. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Light language is channeled language instead of a learned language.",
      "content": "Light language is channeled language instead of a learned language. Here on earth, society has languages in place with specific rules in order to communicate with others. Light language, however, has no rules. Because it speaks into your soul and not your mind, it is not necessary to translate it—your heart and spirit will know how to use the messages you receive."

      "title": "Speaking light language is called channeling.",
      "content": "Speaking light language is called channeling. When it comes to light language, think of yourself as a channel on the radio and the information you are receiving as the songs and information being played. Essentially, you are using your voice to replicate the frequencies being channeled through you. When others are around you and you are channeling light language, you can transmit the energy you’re receiving to another person. In fact, healing is even possible just by listening to someone speaking light language since it is coming straight from a higher frequency!"

      "title": "Interpreting light language is called downloading.",
      "content": "Interpreting light language is called downloading. Similar to the way you download a song, movie, or audio file, light language is downloaded within you. Light codes are transmitted from higher dimensions and realms, which are then downloaded by your soul and expressed through your body. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Light language can be used for healing.",
      "content": "Light language can be used for healing. The intention behind light language is to shift your energy to a vibration that is higher than its typical state. In this higher vibration, you are able to better connect with spirit guides and more easily understand communication from them. [10] X Research source Everyone is said to have guides (yes, including you!) but we often have trouble accessing them or lack knowledge of how to get in touch with them. Light language removes the physical barrier between the human world and the spirit world, so connecting with spirit guides becomes a much more tangible experience. Guides can provide important internal lessons towards healing while we are here on earth."

      "content": "Many use light language as a way to move forward and evolve. Because light language taps deep into your consciousness, it can unlock your hidden truths, gifts, focus, creativity, and ultimate power. [11] X Research source When you recognize the unique capabilities that your DNA and soul possess, you can use them as tools to unleash your divine purpose and destiny. When you are in a lower vibrational state, it may point to an imbalance in your body, mind, or soul. When you tap into light language, the high vibrational energies that it transmits overpower all low vibrations and negative energy. [12] X Research source By removing these negative energies, you can clear a pathway to a better future."

      "title": "Light language may sound like gibberish to the untrained ear.",
      "content": "Light language may sound like gibberish to the untrained ear. Sometimes, it will come out of your mouth in sounds such as undecipherable words, primal grunts, chants, clicks, or chirps. Other times, it is expressed through the body in hand movements, swaying, or dancing with no sounds at all. Some people channel ancient symbols like hieroglyphs or pictures which can be expressed through painting and art. [13] X Research source A few typical light language bodily expressions are sweeping motions that indicate a clearing of energy, zig-zagging to convey protection, and circular motions to represent healing.

      "title": "Light language might sound like a foreign language.",
      "content": "Light language might sound like a foreign language. As you allow yourself to receive messages and codes, words may come out that sound fluent and clear, but you won’t be able to translate them. Don’t worry! Your higher self will know exactly what they mean and how to interpret them."

    {
      "title": "You cannot control how light language will sound.",
      "content": "You cannot control how light language will sound. When you try to guide the sounds and movements your body is creating, the entire purpose of light language is lost. Our human consciousness does not possess the power to control the magic and healing that comes with light language, so you must allow it to occur as it comes. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Activate light language in a meditative state.",
      "content": "Activate light language in a meditative state. Because anyone can activate their own light language, the key is learning how to put your conscious thoughts to the side and allowing channeled messages to come through. This is done through meditation . [16] X Research source Once you’ve reached a state where you’re able to let go and fall into your subconscious, your unique codes and messages will begin to flow through. Don’t think too much during your meditation session. Light language cannot be translated by our minds, so there is essentially no point in trying to decipher it. Just allow your body to accept the flow of energy within. If you find that you are meditating and no frequencies are coming through, this could be due to a blockage in your energy. [17] X Research source You may have an issue with self-expression, a feeling of being undeserving of divine guidance, or too many conscious thoughts getting in the way. If this should happen, the best thing to do is speak to an experienced spiritual advisor who can work with you on removing these blocks."

      "title": "Light language can come through when you aren’t even trying to activate it.",
      "content": "Light language can come through when you aren’t even trying to activate it. Anytime you make a doodle, list, or journal entry, light language symbols are coming through. [18] X Research source Even though a scribble or doodle may seem nonsensical, it contains tons of information loaded with meaning that human language just can’t physically convey. What’s more, light language can come through when you’re at a concert feeling the energy of the music, connecting with nature, or really just at any time your higher self would like to connect."

      "title": "Light language can be verbally expressed through voice.",
      "content": "Light language can be verbally expressed through voice. While some people express light language via unintelligible words and sounds, many find themselves channeling songs and various melodies as well. [19] X Research source It can manifest as gentle whispers, breathing patterns, and even as voices that don’t sound like your own. When you first hear the sounds of light language, it might feel as if you’ve heard them somewhere before...and you may have! Your higher self has experienced many lives, whether it was on Earth or in other galaxies and dimensions. Your soul possesses knowledge of ancient languages, so these are sounds of your past coming through. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Light language may manifest through the hands.",
      "content": "Light language may manifest through the hands. When light language presents through the hands, it’s as if they are thinking for themselves. Whether this is seen through gestures, mudras, signs, or patterns, it will look different for different people. [21] X Research source Channeling through the hands can also look like sign language (though not the same), or as creations on paper. In fact, many people explore light language art as a form of healing, which involves drawing, painting, or designing codes, scenes, and images transmitted to them through light language. [22] X Research source To do this, grab some paper, canvas, pencils, paint, or whatever medium you feel drawn to, and slip into a meditative state. Allow your hands to do all the work while trusting your intuition, and welcome the flow of whatever your body expresses on the canvas or paper. Alternatively, you can also work from memory based on light language images you received in the past. Hand expression can also be done through writing, which looks like codes and symbols, or even simple scribbles. [23] X Research source These representations are a way to bring forth healing emotions—whether it be love, comfort, confidence, or peace. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "Light language can be physical movement through the body.",
      "content": "Light language can be physical movement through the body. Those who express light language through movement often sway, stomp their feet, or move about—it’s all about what feels right and natural. [25] X Research source Movement allows you to access light language at times in which verbal expression or writing may not be available. While you can access light language at any time, movement is the simplest to access in public spaces. Like sign language, these movements of the body have specific meanings, so it’s important to act upon whatever energy your soul is telling you it would like to express."
