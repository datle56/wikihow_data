      "content": "Stir in the oil and water. Pour in 1 tablespoon of vegetable, olive, or canola oil and 3/4 cup (180 ml) of water. Stir the pizza dough until it forms into a ball. You may need 1/4 cup (60 ml) more water, if your flour absorbs a lot of the water. [2] X Research source Ensure that you add the extra water a tablespoon or two at a time. Avoid adding so much water that the dough becomes sticky."

      "title": "Knead the dough.",
      "content": "Knead the dough. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and scoop the pizza dough onto it. Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, so the dough becomes smooth and elastic. [3] X Research source You can knead the dough however you like. The important thing is that the dough is stretched and folded repeatedly. This will develop the gluten in the flour."

      "content": "Shape the dough. You can use a rolling pin to roll the pizza out to any shape you like, or you can place it into your pizza pan and stretch the dough to fit the pan. Keep in mind that the pizza crust will be thick if you make one pizza out of this dough. [4] X Research source If you want to make two thin-crust pizzas, just divide the dough in half and roll them until they're as thin as you'd like."

Sprinkle your choice of pizza toppings across the top and bake the pizza for 15 to 25 minutes. [5] X Research source If you're making two thin crust pizzas, they may only need 10 to 15 minutes."

Just stir the added flavors in until they're just combined, since you don't want to over-mix the dough. You can add up to 1 1/2 cups of mix-ins (like the dried fruits or nuts), or add seasonings and herbs according to your taste. Good options for quick bread include: [10] X Research source Fruit: cranberries, dried cherries, apples, blueberries, orange zest, raisins Nuts: walnuts, pecans, almonds Herbs and spices: dill, pesto, caraway seeds, chili powder, garlic powder Cheese: parmesan, cheddar"

To test if the bread is done, stick a toothpick into the center of the loaf. It should come out clean. Cool the loaf in the pan for 15 minutes. Then take the bread out and serve it.

Use a sharp knife to score an 'X' through the top of the loaf. [16] X Research source Cut the 'X' deep into the dough, almost reaching the bottom of the dough.

Carefully take the bread out of the oven and brush it with 1 tablespoon (14 g) of melted butter. This will give it extra flavor and make the crust softer. [17] X Research source For an even softer crust, you can brush the bread with milk halfway through the baking time."
