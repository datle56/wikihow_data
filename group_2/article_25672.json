      "content": "Talk to experienced affiliate marketers and ask for their advice. Affiliate marketing can have a steep learning curve and can feel tough to break into. Fortunately, there are many experienced marketers out there who may be willing to impart their tricks and tips to you. They’ll be able to teach you to select a marketing niche that can earn you money and to design your website to get as many visitors as possible. [5] X Research source If you don’t know any affiliate marketers, try finding some by searching for blogs that discuss topics you’re interested in. Then look for advertising links to companies’ products. If you see these links, you’ve found an affiliate marketer! Or, go directly to the companies themselves. Email a company of your choice and ask to be put in touch with any affiliate marketers they work with. When you reach out to affiliate marketers themselves, try having a professional but friendly tone. Email something like, “Hi, I see that you have done some affiliate marketing work with Patagonia! I’m interested in breaking into the affiliate marketing world as well, but don’t have much experience so far. Would you be willing to pass along any helpful tips you’ve picked up?”"

      "content": "Select a niche that you’re interested in. Affiliate marketing enterprises work best if you’re marketing for a product or company that you genuinely appreciate and have an interest in. Let’s say you love the outdoors, and often go on camping trips. Consider doing affiliate marketing for companies who make camping products, hiking boots, backpacks, or outdoor gear. [6] X Research source There are a huge number of niches you could look into. For example, you could look into doing affiliate marketing for companies who make musical instruments, snack foods and soft drinks, sporting goods and sports equipment, fishing equipment, literary publishers, office supplies, or mattresses and bedding. Beginning affiliate marketers who start out marketing for companies and products that they don’t care about typically lose interest quickly."

If you’re new to web design and don’t want to tackle coding your own website, try building a website for free through one of the many no-cost website-building platforms like Wix, Weebly, or WordPress. You could also use a blog site like BlogSpot as your platform to begin affiliate marketing.

      "content": "Post content online regularly and build up an email list. If you’re posting affiliate marketing links but nobody visits your website, you won’t make much of an income. The best way to draw new people to your website is by posting new, interesting content. Also offer an email newsletter that users can subscribe to for additional content! Don’t start doing any affiliate marketing until you have at least 500 email list subscribers. [8] X Research source Say that you run a blog called “The Camping Life,” about outdoor activities. You could post reviews of campsites and national parks, and send out a newsletter reviewing specific camping products that you’ve tried out. Depending on how frequently you post new content and send out emails and newsletters, it could take between 3–6 months to build up 500 subscribers."

      "content": "Brush up on SEO to increase your web traffic. To be a successful affiliate marketer, you’ll need to bring as many viewers to your website as possible, to maximize the number of people who see your marketing content. For example, a great way to maximize your SEO is to include half a dozen keywords in your website copy. Then, when people search for these words in a search engine, your website will appear relatively high up in the search results. So, in our example, you’d want to use words like “camping,” “affordable,” and “backpacking” to draw in visitors. [9] X Research source There are great online articles about SEO that you can read to improve your know-how. You can also take free SEO training courses at Udemy and other sites."

      "content": "Reach out to companies whose goods you’d like to market. Once you’re regularly producing content and have plenty of subscribers, it’s time to reach out to merchants with who you’d like to affiliate market. The best way to go about this is by sending an email to the director of their marketing or sales department, if you can find that information online. Explain that you run a popular website or blog devoted to a topic relevant to the company’s products. If the company agrees to take you on as an affiliate marketer, they’ll send you a specific URL that you can use to create ads on your website. [10] X Research source Let’s stick with our camping/outdoors example. You could try reaching out to backpacking and outdoor companies like REI, Patagonia, and North Face to see if they’ll take you on as an affiliate marketer."

      "content": "Place the company’s URL on your site and in your newsletters. Take the unique URL that the company sent you, and position it prominently on your website or blog. It’s also a good idea to name-drop the company in your weekly newsletters and include the link there too. Try to ensure that the majority of your website’s visitors will see the link by positioning it near the top of your site and newsletter! [11] X Research source For example, you could have copy on your website that says something like, “I went camping last weekend and my Eureka tent kept me warm and dry! Follow the link to see their great catalog of products.” Eventually, website users will start clicking through the advertisements and purchase products from the company you’re marketing for. At this point, the company will send you a commission check."
