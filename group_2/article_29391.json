(*Picture shows a bowl, but if you use a coffee mug, you get a round more uniform egg*) Prick the yolk with a fork so that it won't explode while cooking in the microwave. Put it in the microwave for 1 minute. If you put cling film over the egg, the egg will cook better."

      "content": "Get two slices of bacon . Wait one minute for the plate to cool down in the microwave before cooking the bacon. Cook the bacon until it's done. Most microwaves have a \"bacon\" cycle, which it is recommended that you use. If there is no \"bacon\" cycle, start with 90 seconds per slice on highest setting. Before placing in the microwave , if you want to get as much fat off the bacon as you can, put paper towels between the bacon to soak up the fat."
