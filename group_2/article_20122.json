      "content": "Consider why you want your ex back. While the relationship might‚Äôve been great, sometimes it‚Äôs better to leave an old dynamic in the past or let go of a former partner. Before you start trying to get your ex back, consider your motivations. [2] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. Some honest self-reflection can help you avoid reigniting a relationship that‚Äôs toxic or that doesn‚Äôt serve your best interests. [3] X Research source Good reasons for getting back together: Your timing was off the first time you were together. You needed more time to get over a previous relationship. You have developed a new appreciation for your ex. Bad reasons for getting back together: You‚Äôre scared of being alone. (Of course, it‚Äôs natural to be lonely after an old relationship goes south, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should plunge back into that relationship.) You miss what‚Äôs familiar to you. (Again, this is a completely normal feeling, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should get back together.) You‚Äôre jealous of their new relationship. (This is a totally understandable experience, but it‚Äôs not exactly a healthy reason to start afresh with an ex.) Enlist a trusted friend, family member, or therapist to consider why you want to get back with your ex. They can help you tease out some less-than-stellar reasons and might even help you move on."

Did it bring out the best or the worst in each of you? Were you both encouraging to one another and positive forces in each other‚Äôs lives? If you broke up because the relationship was negative for one or both of you, you may want to hold off on getting back together. [4] X Research source For example, if you two fought all the time or did not actually enjoy spending time together, then it‚Äôs probably best for you and your ex to part ways. Some couples are so focused on getting back together that they don't acknowledge the issues and problems that prevented them from having a functional relationship. Try to give your past relationship a sober and realistic assessment. It‚Äôs okay to recognize that it wasn‚Äôt healthy and to cut your losses."
