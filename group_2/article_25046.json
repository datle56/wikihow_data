These image identities are based on facial features and body characteristics. [27] X Research source Each Kibbe body type falls along a spectrum of “yin” (soft) and “yang” (angular) features. Yin energy leans toward more feminine or Romantic types, while more masculine or Dramatic types have more yang energy. [28] X Research source"

      "content": "The Kibbe system includes 13 total body types. These types have varying combinations of yin and yang to help you find wardrobe basics, makeup, and hairstyles that highlight your unique features. Just remember, the Kibbe system is helpful, but it doesn’t define you. While the system can help you develop a flattering personal style, it doesn’t have to represent who you are. [29] X Research source Dramatic: Fully yang with angularity, sharpness, sleekness, and height. Soft Dramatic: Mostly yang with strong yin features for a balance of angularity and softness. Flamboyant Natural: Yang-dominant with a tall, lean, and blunt body balanced by a natural softness. Natural: Similar to a Dramatic but with blunt edges rather than the sharpness of a body with full yang energy. Soft Natural: Blends yin with softened yang for a straight, angular body and more roundness than a pure Natural. Dramatic Classic: Almost perfectly balanced between yin and yang energies for a symmetrical body with slightly angular and muscular features. Classic: A perfect balance between yin and yang energies, resulting in a refined, understated figure with completely even and symmetrical proportions. Soft Classic: Balanced and refined like the pure Classic but with slightly more fullness and softness to their features. Flamboyant Gamine: Balances the yin and yang energies in a petite frame but with more exaggerated features. Gamine: Blend a yin face with a yang body, creating a gamine’s narrow, petite frame with full and rounded facial features. Soft Gamine: Balances yang energy by scaling it down into a petite frame with delicate, rounded features. Theatrical Romantic: Almost entirely yin with a soft and delicate figure, but a touch of yang gives them broad and sharp facial features. Romantic: All yin and often described as voluptuous with soft, rounded, and curvy features."

If you’re not sure what your Kibbe body type is, one of the easiest ways to find it is by taking our Kibbe Body Type Test . David Kibbe’s original book has gone out of print, but he has plans to release a new book titled David Kibbe's Power of Style: A Guided Journey to Help You Discover Your Authentic Style . The new book will have updated guidelines to help determine your type, with recommendations for hair, makeup, and clothing styles. Your facial features are only one small part of determining your Kibbe type. In fact, some say that David Kibbe no longer uses faces to determine your style identity. Kibbe no longer uses the pure Gamine, Classic, and Natural body types because he feels no one falls perfectly into those types, but they can be helpful when you’re figuring out your own image identity."
