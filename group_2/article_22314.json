      "content": "Ice your toe for 20 minutes at a time. Apply a cold ice pack to your bruised toenail every 2 hours on the first day and 3 to 4 times daily after that to help ease the swelling. Put a towel over the ice pack so the cold surface isn't touching your skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Cold therapy is best for reducing swelling right after an injury because it decreases blood flow to the area. Try submerging your toe in an ice bath if you want better coverage of the affected area."

      "content": "Elevate your foot above the level of your heart whenever you’re lying down. Use pillows or a tall footrest to prop up your foot while you're sitting or lying down. Make sure your toe is above the level of your heart to help the swelling go down faster. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Elevation decreases blood flow to the area, which helps manage pain and swelling. Try to keep it elevated for at least 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 times per day, to speed up the healing process."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you do need to walk around to run errands, wear supportive shoes that aren’t constrictive around your toe or the top of your foot. Slip-on sandals with arch support are a good choice. Just be careful putting them on and taking them off. If you’ve injured your big toe, avoid wearing sandals that have a toe-hold."

      "title": "Apply heat for 15 minutes at a time after 48-72 hours.",
      "content": "Apply heat for 15 minutes at a time after 48-72 hours. Use a heating pad or heated compress on your toe only after the swelling has gone down, which can take anywhere from 2 to 3 days after your injury. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Leave it on for only 15 minutes at a time and do this up to 3 times a day. [5] X Research source Don't apply heat before the swelling has gone down—just stick to ice. Heat increases blood flow to the area and can make any swelling worse."

      "title": "Take an over-the-counter painkiller to ease some of the pain.",
      "content": "Take an over-the-counter painkiller to ease some of the pain. Try acetaminophen or ibuprofen. For ibuprofen, take 400 mg (two 200 mg tablets) every 4 to 6 hours as needed. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For acetaminophen, take 600 mg to 1,000 mg (two 325 mg tablets or 500 mg tablets) every 4 to 6 hours as needed. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take either painkiller with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water. If your toe or the area around your toenail is swollen, ibuprofen is best since it contains anti-inflammatories. [8] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you're pregnant, avoid taking ibuprofen because it can cause pregnancy complications. Don’t take ibuprofen in high doses or daily for longer than 1 week because it can increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. The maximum daily dose is 800–1,200 mg per day for minor aches and pains. Each pill of acetaminophen contains around 325 mg—don't take more than 4,000 mg within 24 hours. Keep in mind that the above dosages are for teens and adults; follow the instructions on the medicine label carefully when giving either painkiller to children."

Don't pick at it or touch it, and try to avoid wearing socks or shoes that are extremely tight because they can irritate and put pressure on the wound. Your body is built to deal with bruises accordingly, so it's best to take a hands-off approach and let it do its thing.

      "content": "Wash and bandage your toe if it's bleeding. If there's blood coming out from under your nail, hold your toe under the faucet and rinse it with cool water. Pat the area around your toe dry with a clean towel and let your toe air dry. Wrap a clean adhesive bandage around your toe once it's dry. [11] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Stretchy gauze might be more comfortable and stay on better than a regular adhesive bandage. To put it on, cover your toe with a small gauze pad and then wrap the gauze around your toe so it's slightly tight but not so tight that you feel lots of pressure. Take off the bandage and let the wound “breathe” once you notice the bleeding has stopped. Apply antibacterial ointment or petroleum jelly on your toe before you bandage it to help speed up the healing process."

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Another way to calculate your ideal intake is to divide your weight (in pounds) by 2. The result is how many ounces you should drink a day. For example, if you weigh 140 pounds (64 kg), you should drink around 70 fluid ounces (2,100 mL) per day. Avoid alcohol and highly caffeinated drinks like coffee and black tea while your toe is healing because these will only dehydrate your body and extend your recovery time."

Gently rub a pea-sized amount of aloe vera gel onto your bruised toe 3 to 4 times a day. Check the ingredients on the back of the package to ensure the gel is 100% aloe vera. Additives dilute the actual content of aloe vera, which means the gel won’t be as effective.

[17] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source However, arnica gel may not be safe to apply to broken skin because it can absorb into the body, so consult your doctor before use. You can also take arnica orally by dissolving 2 pills under your tongue every 6 hours or by drinking 2 to 3 cups of arnica tea every day. Note that because arnica is a homeopathic remedy, not all medical studies have found it to be effective at healing bruises faster."

Nail trephination is when the doctor uses a small sterile needle to poke a hole in your nail to drain some of the blood. This will help relieve pressure on your nail and, hopefully, ease most of the pain.

A toe box that's too tight can cause your toes to smash up against the top, front, and sides of the shoe, so make sure there’s at least 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of space from your big toe to the front of the toe box. Don't allow more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of room because your foot sliding back and forth in the shoe can cause your toenails to bash up against the front. [24] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should have enough room in the toe box to comfortably wiggle your toes. If you have a history of bruised toenails from running, buy shoes that are 1/2 to 1 full size bigger than your regular size. Just be sure to wear cushy socks and check the distance from your big toe to the end of the toe box. Try on new shoes to buy at the end of the day when your feet are the most swollen."

      "content": "Use the right size socks made from synthetic fibers. Choose socks that aren't too loose or too tight around your toes so they're not putting extra pressure on them while you're walking or running. Opt for synthetic fibers like acrylic and polyester over cotton to keep moisture to a minimum. [26] X Research source It's important to have moisture-wicking socks because any moisture can cause the sock to slip on your foot or the inner sole of the shoe, putting pressure on your toes and causing unnecessary friction. When you put on your socks, the front seam should lay flat across the top of your toes. If the sock tends to slip in your shoes and the seam ends up under your nails or at the tips of your toes, that's a sign you need better-fitting socks. The heel part of the sock should be stretched around your heel without any bunching or sagging material. If you often wear hiking boots, choose medium to thick socks made from a blend of materials like merino wool, nylon, lycra, and elastane."
