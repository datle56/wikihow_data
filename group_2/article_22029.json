Here are some ideas for you to use inside of your notebook: Turn it into a diary. Write down your personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Also write about your family, friends, house and pets. Write about all of your secrets. Turn it into a poem book. Come up with poems in your notebook. Try to make one up yourself. It doesn't have to rhyme. Make it into a photo album. You can put whatever photos you fancy into the notebook. Find old photos and put them into the notebook. Put in photos of you, your family, and your friends. Keep them safe.

      "content": "Create a notebook just for you. This is easy, so you'll probably have fun and finish soon. If you make a mistake, try again and never give up. It is your notebook and you can make it just for you. First, Find 20-85 sheets of paper. Line them up vertically. Try to line them up straight. Try not to move them. Now, either glue (does not matter whether it is a stick or tube) or staple them together at the left. If you use glue, make sure to use an old, heavy book or your hand to press down to keep any paper from hanging out because it can be difficult to find a solution to. If using a stapler, make sure not to get your finger stapled. However, getting your finger stapled isn't as serious or painful as it seems. In fact, some experience no pain at all. If you want, just buy a personal notebook or diary from a store."

If you use thick, wet markers that leave marks on the back of the paper, remember that the ink may bleed through to the next page. As said above, feel free to draw whatever you fancy, however, don't draw anything inappropriate, violent, or something that implies something mean or bad about another person or yourself.

Freewriting is supposed to be entertaining. You can write anything you desire. Think of freewriting as a way to pass time, entertain yourself, and express yourself thoroughly. Although you can write whatever you desire, don't write profanity, mean or hateful claims about other people, inappropriate things, and negative things about yourself and your life. Also, don't take a risk writing about controversial topics. Doing that is a good way to hurt someone's feelings, ruin relationships, and lower your self-esteem.

Remember not to use the same password for several sites. Keep the notebook somewhere where no one would look. If they find your passwords, politely ask them to not log into your account. If they really did find your password, change your password to something lengthy, confusing, and hard for others to guess but easy for you to remember. If they get into your account, tell them that it's wrong to snoop on other peoples stuff. Forgive them if they apologise."
