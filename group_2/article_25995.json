      "content": "Choose your fire. Use a wooden match or pipe lighter. Pipe lighters are made specifically for tobacco pipes, and should not alter the taste of the tobacco. If using a match , strike it and let it burn for a few seconds to get the sulfur off. Be wary of lighters that are not specifically designed for tobacco pipes. Some pipe enthusiasts claim that the butane from the lighter subtly impacts the flavor of the tobacco itself. Strike a wooden match against the emery strip along the package. Allow the sulfur to burn off the tip before applying it to the pipe. A wooden match will not impart a taste of lighter fluid."

      "content": "Perform a \"false light.\" Char the top of the tobacco, but do not light it completely yet. Hold the flame just above the tobacco at a skimming distance. Draw your breath in using a half a dozen steady puffs. Move the flame in a circle to reach all of the tobacco. [1] X Research source This \"charring light\" aims to burn the tobacco slightly, but not to light it completely. Don’t breathe the smoke into your lungs. Puff steadily and slowly to avoid a sharp “tongue bite.” Pipe tobacco is generally stronger and more flavorful than the tobacco used in cigarettes."

      "content": "Keep charring and puffing. Once the pipe is evenly lit, this is the “true light.” You are now ready to settle into the smoking session. Keep puffing periodically to make sure that the pipe stays lit. The bowl should stay lit for at least 5-15 minutes once it is properly burning. Keep air flowing through the tobacco. If you don't want to inhale so often, try exhaling gently into the pipe. The air should stoke the pipe fire from within and send a thin wisp of smoke trailing up out of the bowl.

[3] X Research source Tamp the tobacco down lightly to remove the charred top when the light goes out. The removal of ash from tamping will allow the pipe to burn more evenly."
