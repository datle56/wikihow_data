      "content": "Limit your sodium intake to minimize water retention. Eating too much salt can cause your body to retain water, adding unwanted pounds and making you feel bloated. To lose water weight, resist the urge to add salt to your food. Cut back on high-sodium foods and beverages such as processed meats, salted snack foods like chips and nuts, and sports drinks. [2] X Research source You can avoid many hidden sources of sodium by cooking your own meals from fresh, unprocessed ingredients. When you cook, try replacing salt with other flavorful seasonings, like black pepper or garlic. Eating more potassium-rich foods, like bananas, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes, can also help you flush excess salt out of your body."

This is the reason that many people experience rapid weight loss when they first switch to a low-carb diet. [3] X Research source To quickly shed water weight, try cutting back on high-carb snacks like white bread and pasta, baked goods, and potatoes. Try replacing high-carb foods in your diet with fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber, like berries, beans, and leafy greens. Going on a very low or no-carb diet for more than a few months can be bad for your health. Talk to your doctor about safe ways to adjust your carbohydrate intake. [4] X Research source"

Most low-calorie diets involve restricting your daily intake to no more than 800-1500 calories. [10] X Research source Before attempting a diet like this, talk to your doctor about how much you can safely restrict your daily calorie intake, and for how long. Eating such a small number of calories each day is unhealthy for most people, and won’t help you keep the weight off in the long term. Most doctors don’t recommend very low calorie diets (under 800 calories a day) unless you need to lose weight quickly for medical reasons (e.g., if you are preparing for a surgery or trying to manage a medical condition, such as diabetes).

The number of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your weight varies based on your age, sex, and activity level. On average, most adult women are supposed to get about 2,000 calories a day, while the recommended amount for men is about 2,500. You may be eating more than you think, however—for example, the average American adult eats about 3,600 calories a day. Before you start cutting calories, write down everything you normally eat in a day and add up the total number of calories . [13] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 March 2020. You can find calorie information for pre-packaged foods on the package, and calorie counts are also available on many restaurant menus. If you eat 3,600 calories a day, you would need to cut 2,100 calories per day to achieve a 1,500-calorie daily diet. However, be aware that this is not enough for you to lose a full 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fat per day. In order to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fat in a day, you’d need to eliminate 3,500 calories from your daily diet. For most people, this isn’t possible to do safely unless you’re already eating an extremely high-calorie diet (about 5,000 calories a day)."

The number of calories you can burn with exercise depends on a lot of factors, like your current weight. For example, if you weigh 185 pounds (84 kg), you can burn about 1000 calories by playing basketball for 2 hours. If you weigh 155 pounds (70 kg), you’d have to play for closer to 2.5 hours.
