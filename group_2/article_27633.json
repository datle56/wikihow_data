      "content": "Mowing lawns and shoveling snow is the perfect side hustle for active teens. Many people are too busy to maintain their yards but don’t want their homes to look unkempt. These people are often willing to spend an extra buck or two to have someone mow their lawn, rake leaves, trim hedges, or shovel away snow. Start by asking your friends and family if they need help, and if you don’t get enough business, post some signs around the neighborhood about your services. Market your services for the season. For instance, rake leaves in the fall, shovel snow in the winter, and plant flowers in the spring. Try teaming up with friends or family members to get more work done and earn even more money—just make sure to split the earnings fairly!"
