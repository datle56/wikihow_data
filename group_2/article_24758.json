      "content": "Get a tank that can house 100 crickets per 1 gallon (3.8 L). Dr. Ramsey says crickets need “space to span out,” so it’s important to “make sure that they are not raised in very heavy density.” Get the largest glass or plastic terrarium or storage container that you can find to house them in. A general rule is to keep no more than 100 crickets per 1 gallon (3.8 L). [1] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. For instance, if you want to keep 500 crickets, get a container that’s at least 5 gallons (19 L). Dr. Ramsey says it’s important not to overcrowd your container with crickets, as “over-density causes them to typically resort to cannibalism.” [2] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021."

      "content": "Ensure the container has plenty of ventilation. While crickets of course need air to breathe, Dr. Ramsey says “striking that right balance between humid but not too humid is really important to keeping your crickets alive and healthy.” Get a lid for your tank or container that has a mesh screen or air vents, or drill lots of small holes through the lid. Just make sure the holes are small enough so the crickets can’t escape. [3] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Too much humidity can lead to mold and bacteria growth, which can harm your crickets. According to Dr. Ramsey, “if you start seeing blue or green mold on things or grayish spots that look a bit fuzzy” that are “starting to develop on food or on the sides of the enclosure, that is a clear sign that things have gotten too humid.” [4] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. If your enclosure is very humid, Dr. Ramsey suggests adding more ventilation or placing hamster bedding on the bottom of the container, as it “can hold a level of moisture while also reducing the amount of it that is just ambient in the air.” [5] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021."

      "content": "Clean the tank with a mild bleach solution to remove bacteria. Before you put the crickets into the tank, make sure that it is clean. Mix 1 part bleach with 10 parts cold water. Then, dampen a rag with the solution and use it to wipe down the inside of the tank. Let the tank completely dry before housing your crickets. [6] X Research source Wear gloves and a mask and work in a well-ventilated area when using bleach. An unclean tank may contain harmful bacteria or chemicals that could make your crickets sick. Do not use other chemical cleaners, as they could be harmful to the crickets."

      "title": "Add egg crates and paper towel rolls to give your crickets shelter.",
      "content": "Add egg crates and paper towel rolls to give your crickets shelter. Get a few cardboard egg crates and cover about ⅔ of the bottom of the tank with them. Then, add 1 or 2 cardboard paper towel rolls or toilet paper rolls. Dr. Ramsey agrees that shelter is important and says, “Crickets should have multiple areas of refuge” because they “are animals that don't like to just be out in the open.” [7] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Adding egg cartons and paper towel rolls also gives your crickets more surface area in the container, allowing them to space out so they aren’t as crowded. Feel free to stack the egg cartons or lean the rolls against the side of the container. If you’re stacking cartons, place a piece of cardboard in between them. Without shelter and enough space, the crickets may fight each other for space."

      "content": "Keep the cricket tank between 75–90 °F (24–32 °C) at all times. Place the crickets’ habitat in a dark area that maintains a steady temperature to keep the crickets healthy. If the temperature in the tank is too cold, the crickets may die or eat each other. If the temperature is too hot, the cricket's lifespan may shorten. [8] X Research source If you live in a cooler area, set a heat lamp over the top of the crickets’ habitat to keep them warm."

      "title": "Place the new crickets in their habitat as soon as you get home.",
      "content": "Place the new crickets in their habitat as soon as you get home. Crickets don’t do well in small, confined spaces. So, don’t keep the crickets in their carrying box for too long, or they may die. Transfer them to the clean tank as soon as you get home. Make sure there are adequate air holes in the top of the box that you use to transport the crickets home. Most crickets come in a cardboard box or plastic bag. Simply tap the box or bag a few times to get the crickets to settle at the bottom. Then, dump the box or bag into their habitat."

      "content": "Feed your crickets oatmeal, cricket food , or fish flakes . Put uncooked oatmeal, cricket food, or fish flakes in a shallow dish in the tank. These foods provide the crickets with enough nutrients to ensure they make a good meal for your pets! And don’t worry, crickets won’t typically overeat. [9] X Research source As a plus, oatmeal, cricket food, and fish flakes are dry, so they don’t spoil very quickly. Crickets are omnivores, so they like to eat lots of different grains, fruits, vegetables, and small insects. Some other food options include non-sugary cereals, cornmeal, carrots, potatoes, oranges, mustard greens, and ground-up dog or cat food. If you have a lot of crickets, add a few dishes of food around the container so the crickets aren’t competing for 1 food source."

      "content": "Add a damp cotton ball or piece of fruit as a water source. Crickets can drown very easily in a small dish of water. For this reason, it’s best to give them water from another source, like a cotton ball soaked in water or a small piece of apple, orange, carrot, or peach. The crickets are able to suck out the moisture from the cotton ball or fruit. [10] X Research source As an alternative, place water gel crystals in a shallow dish to hydrate your crickets. These crystals hold water inside that the crickets can suck out."

      "title": "Keep fresh food and water in the tank at all times.",
      "content": "Keep fresh food and water in the tank at all times. Always have a food and water source inside the tank so your crickets can feed and drink when they need to. Just keep the food fresh by throwing it out and filling it back up once or twice a week. If you’re using fruit or vegetables, replace them every day so they don’t rot and introduce bacteria inside the tank. Crickets won't overeat, so don't worry about overfeeding them. If you’re using water gel crystals, check on and replace them every few days, as they can grow mold."

      "content": "Clean the tank twice a month to keep your crickets healthy. Carefully remove the crickets and place them in another box with breathing holes. Simply wipe down the bottom of the tank, making sure to remove any feces or dead crickets that remain. Then, use your diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts cool water) and a rag to wipe down the inside of the tank to sanitize it. [11] X Research source Dead crickets and feces can make your crickets sick."

      "content": "Cover the bottom of the tank with vermiculite to reduce smells. Vermiculite is a natural mineral that can help reduce moisture and absorb smells in your crickets’ tank. Simply spread a ½ to 1 inch (1.3-2.5 cm) layer on the bottom of the container before adding in your crickets. [12] X Research source Make sure to change out the vermiculite every time you clean the tank. Crickets may have a slight smell, but they tend to smell more when they’re dead. So, keeping a regular cleaning schedule can help with smells, too."

      "content": "Choose a hardier species of crickets, like banded crickets. It’s natural for a few crickets to die in their habitat, as they typically only live for 1 to 3 months. However, some species of crickets may be easier to keep alive. For instance, many reptile owners prefer keeping banded crickets because they tend to notice fewer deaths and they have a longer lifespan. [13] X Research source"
