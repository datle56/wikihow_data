      "content": "Giving your guy a compliment is an easy way to make him feel attractive. Start simple by telling him you think he’s handsome or pointing out your favorite part of his physical appearance.

[3] X Research source Let him catch you staring at him. If he asks what you’re doing just say, “Oh, I’m just staring at this super hot guy I’m dating” or “I’m just looking at the love of my life.”"

      "content": "A massage can be sensual and relaxing. Pick a clean, quiet, clutter-free area for your massage. Then, put on some soothing music, break out the massage oils, and get started. You can keep the massage non-sexual or let it turn into hot foreplay—either way, your guy’s going to feel special. Heat up your massage oils beforehand by placing the bottle in a bowl of warm water or simply rubbing the oil between your palms. Work in circular motions, kneading with your thumbs while applying pressure with other parts of your hands, like the side of your palm, the flat of your palm, and your fingertips. Start softly and gradually apply more pressure. Make sure you ask him what feels good!"
