You also might use \"buenos días\" (boo-AY-nohs DEE-ahs) if you're speaking to the person during the day. [2] X Research source In the afternoon, you can use \"buenas tardes\" (boo-AY-nahs TAHR-days) if you want to greet the person based on the time of day. After the sun goes down, switch to \"buenas noches\" (boo-AY-nahs NOH-chays)."

      "content": "Say your name. The easiest way to introduce yourself is to simply say \"me llamo\" (MAY YAH-moh) after your \"hello.\" This phrase literally means \"I'm called,\" but translates to \"my name is.\" For example, you might say \"¡Hola! Me llamo Maria\" (\"Hello! My name is Maria\"). [3] X Research source You can also say \"mi nombre es,\" which literally means \"my name is.\" If you want a briefer, more casual introduction, you can use the word \"soy,\" which means \"I am.\" For example, you might say \"hola, soy Maria\" (\"Hello, I'm Maria\")."

The most common way to say \"how are you?\" in Spanish is \"¿cómo estás?\" (KOH-moh ehs-TAHS). [4] X Research source For example: \"¡Hola! Me llamo Maria. ¿Cómo estás?\" When you add this question, you've politely introduced yourself to the person and started a conversation."

The ending changes depending on your gender. This is a basic, casual way to say you are pleased to meet someone. [5] X Research source You can also say \"mucho gusto\" (MOO-choh GOO-stoh) to mean \"nice to meet you.\" This phrase works especially well if the other person has introduced themselves first. For example, suppose someone said to you \"¡Hola! Me llamo José. ¿Y tú?\" You could respond \"Mucho gusto, me llamo Maria.\" A more formal way to say \"pleased to meet you\" is \"estoy encantada de conocerla.\" Use conocerle if you're talking to a guy."

[6] X Research source For example, you might say \"Estoy estudiando español. ¿Quieres practicar conmigo?\" (I'm studying Spanish. Do you want to practice with me?\") If the person agrees to continue conversing with you, be sure to say \"gracias\" (\"thank you\")."

If you currently live somewhere other than your hometown, you might also use \"vivo en\" (\"live in\"). [7] X Research source For example, you might say \"soy de Chicago\" (\"I'm from Chicago\"). You could also say \"soy de Chicago, pero vivo en Santiago\" (\"I'm from Chicago, but I live in Santiago\"). To ask the person where they're from, say \"¿de dondé eres tú?\""

[8] X Research source For example, you might say \"soy maestra\" (\"I'm a teacher) or \"trabajo con animales\" (\"I work with animals\").

[9] X Research source For example, you might say \"Me gustan los animales\" (\"I like animals\"). The other person could reply \"¡A mi tambien! ¿Tienes mascota?\" (\"Me too! Do you have a pet?\").

After you say something about yourself, you can ask them for the same information about themselves. [10] X Research source You already know cómo from \"cómo estas\" (\"how are you\"). Cuál means \"which,\" while qué means \"what.\" Just as you might say \"what?\" in English if you didn't hear or understand what someone said, you can say \"¿que?\" in Spanish. Other question words include dónde (where) and cuándo (when). Generally, questions in Spanish are formed the same way they are in English. Simply reverse the order of the subject and verb in your sentence, so that the verb comes before the subject."

Don't use the informal pronoun tú unless the other person has used that pronoun for you first, or if you're talking to a child."
