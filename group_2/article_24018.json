You can do this using various control panels such as phpMyAdmin . See the corresponding documentation. Most web hosting services provide a MySQL database along with your hosting account. If that is the case, use the MySQL credentials provided by your host along with the database name, and then specify something like \"mw_\" as table prefix. This will allow MediaWiki to tell what tables belong to it. Alternatively, ask your hosting service to create an account for, then proceed as above."
