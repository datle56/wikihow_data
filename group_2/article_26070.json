You can also use additional parameters with the dir command to change what you see. Some popular parameters and their uses are: dir /s /a:[attributes] displays files with specified attributes. For example, dir /s /a:h lists hidden files, and dir /s /a:d shows directories. [1] X Research source dir /s /b shows the files in bare format (no headers or summary). dir /s /o:[order] specifies the order to display the files. dir /s /o:n displays files in alphabetical order. dir /s /o:d displays files oldest to newest. dir /s /o:s sorts files smallest to largest. dir /s /o:-s sorts files largest to smallest. Enter dir /s /a:hs /q C:\\Windows > myfile.txt to send the results to a text file instead of viewing them in the Command Prompt window. You can open that file with Notepad to read it, or you can type type myfile.txt . [2] X Research source"
