While they’re technically optional, they’re highly recommended as they can help you strengthen your faith . Nafl or optional. These are voluntary prayers that you can add to some namaz. While they aren’t highly recommended like sunnah rakats, they can help you get closer to Allah . Witr or recommended. Like the sunnah rakats, witr rakats were performed by the Prophet (PBUH), making them a recommended practice. These rakats are only done in odd numbers (1, 3, 5, etc.) and offered between the Isha and Fajr prayers."

      "content": "What do I do if I miss a rakat? If you miss a rakat or an important element of a rakat and you haven’t finished the prayer yet (i.e., haven’t said the tasleem), most Islamic scholars say to add another rakat to cancel out the one you did wrong (or missed). Then, prostrate once or twice for your forgetfulness. [22] X Research source For instance, if you forgot to enter ruku in your second rakat, your third rakat will now become your second. If you finished the prayer (said tasleem), do another rakat, say the tashahhud, recite the tasleem, and prostrate 1 to 2 times. It’s okay if you make a mistake while praying, as everyone is bound to make a mistake now and again. Mohsin agrees, saying, “Allah created us, knowing that we're going to be not perfect.” Remember that Allah is merciful and “he still wants us to come back and repent and to try again and again and again and again.”"

It usually takes people 10 to 15 minutes to complete each namaz (including wudu)."

      "content": "Why is prayer important in Islam? Mohsin says there are “no other acts of worship that we have to do daily, multiple times a day” besides the 5 daily prayers. “There's a reason for that,” he continues, because the “world that we are living in today, it's very fast-paced.” Stopping and praying 5 times each day allows you to take a “spiritual break” and form a “spiritual connection” with Allah. The 5 daily prayers are one of the 5 pillars of Islam. Besides helping you connect to your faith and Allah, praying also helps you: [23] X Research source Ask for forgiveness and receive mercy. Seek guidance, navigate challenges, and receive support on your path. Become more disciplined and keep you away from sinful behavior. Develop important virtues, like charity and forgiveness, and become a better Muslim. Connect with other Muslims and build a supportive, helpful community."
