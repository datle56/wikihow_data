      "title": "Don't respond to annoying behavior.",
      "content": "Don't respond to annoying behavior. When you can't just walk away, the best thing you can do is stay quiet. Staying quiet does not make you weak, and does not make them the \"winner.\" Some people are annoying because they're after a reaction. Don't give them that satisfaction. [3] X Research source In addition, not responding helps you regulate your own emotions, so you won't snap on the person or someone else you meet later."

      "title": "Act like you haven't heard what was said.",
      "content": "Act like you haven't heard what was said. When a person is speaking, don't give any acknowledgment of having heard him or her. Meaning, don't even incline your head to the person or jump if he or she starts talking more loudly. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid giving any kind of response, even nonverbal.",
      "content": "Avoid giving any kind of response, even nonverbal. Even nonverbal responses, such as rolling your eyes or making faces, can egg the person on. Try not to say anything to the person, but also try not to engage the person nonverbally, too. Any kind of gesture that lets them know they're getting to you will only make things worse.

      "title": "Make yourself unavailable.",
      "content": "Make yourself unavailable. If you work with someone who annoys you, it may be difficult to ignore them, especially if you're on a team together. However, one way you can get out of spending time with the person is to put the blame on the work you need to get done. [6] X Research source For instance, you could say, \"I'd love to chat, but I really need to finish this project.\""

      "content": "Report bad behavior. Whether you're being bullied at school or someone at work is affecting your productivity, you can and should speak out. At school, talk to an adult. At work, it's a bit more difficult, but try to address the situation with your boss, focusing on how it is affecting the work environment instead of the person's flaws.

If you want to ignore someone, then follow the maxim \"out of sight, out of mind.\" Don't resort to calling someone names, or being rude in return. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source When you see someone who annoys you, don't make a big deal about it. Don't talk about them in an attempt to get them to leave you alone. Just keep going about your business, and don't think about that person."

To truly ignore someone, you must stop all lines of communication. [12] X Research source Focus your time and energy on being with the people who are important to you.

      "content": "Separate yourself from the person emotionally. If the person is merely bugging you, this step may not be necessary. However, if the person is also criticizing you or getting to you emotionally, you may need to find a way to step back from the person emotionally. In other words, try thinking about placing some kind of mental shield between you and the person. The person may say something negative, but you won't let it reach you. You're not going to take that into yourself. In other words, you hear what's being said, but you reject it's ability to hurt you."

      "content": "Know that ignoring family members can cause damage. Ignoring someone is basically a form of the silent treatment. When it comes to close relationships, you shouldn't employ this tactic very often. In fact, it can be considered a type of emotional abuse. You are trying to punish the person by not acknowledging him or her instead of trying to work out the issue. [13] X Research source Of course, ignoring your whining child or your little brother for five minutes so you can finish cooking dinner is not the same as intentionally employing the silent treatment against your spouse for a day or longer."

With strangers, you can simply ask the person to stop. It may not work. If the situation escalates, don't hesitate to bring in the police if you fear for your safety. With people you know, bring up what the issue is. For instance, you could say, \"I find it difficult to work with interruptions. Would you mind if I took a few hours to focus on this project?\" You must be clear about what you need and how you expect others to treat you. Don't expect others to read your mind and meet your needs."

Just remember to keep it about what you're feeling, rather than blaming the other person. [15] X Research source For instance, you could say, \"I'm feeling frustrated because I can't get enough work done. I love talking to you, but could we maybe meet up after work sometime and have this conversation?\" rather than \"You're very annoying when you keep interrupting me.\" Remember that you are giving information that the other person can choose to ignore or to react negatively. That is their choice, so make sure to reinforce your boundaries."

[18] X Research source When speaking to the annoying person, talk primarily about how you feel and suggest a way to avoid the problem in the future. Avoid blame and criticism for how you feel.
