You may need to brush the cat in short bursts throughout the day, picking times when the cat seems content, to get the cat all the way brushed. [1] X Research source You may get away with brushing every few days if your cat isn't prone to mats.

Also, be sure your cat is calm. You can help the process along by petting the cat and speaking calmly to it. Scratch the cat in the good places it likes to make sure it's content before you begin."

      "title": "Find the right tools.",
      "content": "Find the right tools. For a long-haired cat, the best tools are a wire brush, undercoat combs, and a flea comb. [4] X Research source You can also use wide-tooth combs, if that's all you have, which can help especially when your cat is losing hair due to seasonal shedding. [5] X Research source Undercoat combs have both long and short teeth. They are best for loosening hair in the undercoat. You'll need to start with a less fine undercoat comb and move to a finer one before using a flea comb."

      "content": "Start with the brush and work your way down. If the cat's fur is particularly bad, you'll need to start with the brush or wide-tooth comb first to get the major tangles out of the way first. Once you've worked through that, you can move down to an undercoat comb. Next, you can move to a finer undercoat comb, and then to the flea comb. [6] X Research source You want to start with wider-toothed combs and brushes first because you won't be able to get a fine flea comb through the coat the first time. If your cat's fur isn't too tangled, you may be able to start with a less fine undercoat comb. Use the finer combs on the cat's head and legs."

      "content": "Turn the cat onto its back and hold it down. After you've groomed the cat's back, turn it over so that it is laying on its back with its belly exposed. Lay it slightly on one side, with one front leg closer to the table and one more in the air. Make a \"V\" with your thumb and other fingers. Press down on the underside of the cat with the \"V\" somewhat towards the shoulder and head, pinning the cat's top half down. This helps keep the cat in place, as well as keeping it from biting you. As you move to the underside back end, use your arm and elbow to hold the cat down, while you lift one leg with that same hand and brush between the legs. [7] X Research source"

If you're getting to the skin, you'll see the fur creating a \"line\" of skin where you're brushing the fur. You don't want to dig into the skin, but make sure you are getting the undercoat. [8] X Research source With this type of brushing, start with the cat's back, then move on to the sides, and finally do the undersides. You'll start at the neck and work your way down to the tail. Brush in even strokes, concentrating on areas with tangles. Try to work out any loose fur you see."

Make sure to get the chest and stomach, too. Also, separate the fur out on the tail by moving it to either side. That makes it easier to brush it out.

When the mat is in pieces, it's easier to comb the mat out and pull out the tangles without hurting the cat.

Pull the tangle gently away from the skin. Make sure you can see where the skin is before you cut, and then gently cut as far away from the skin as you can get. [14] X Research source You can also use a mat comb/razor comb for this process. It's a comb designed to cut mats as you brush the fur. [15] X Research source If mats are truly bad, you'll need professional help. The cat may need to be shaved."

Plus, bathing and blow drying the cat helps prevent the hair from tangling. Therefore, bathing your long-haired cat regularly is a good idea. [16] X Research source If you don't feel like you can bathe your cat yourself, take it to a groomer's that accepts cats. Also, always brush your cat before you bathe it to make sure you remove any loose fur ahead of time.

Therefore, it's best to trim the cat's nails before bath time, saving you from pain and blood. Plus, when your cat scratches you, its likely to get away, and you'll need to wrangle it in again. [18] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source To trim claws, you can use a human nail clipper, but clippers made for cats may work a little better. Try to hold the cat under your arm while lifting up each paw one at a time. You can also ask someone to hold the cat down for you. You may be able to work on the claws while a cat is standing on a table. Hold the paw in your hand. Gently press on the back and front of the paw at each pad, causing the claw to extend. Clip off the end of the nail, making sure you don't get the quick, which is the pink vein running down the nail. Trim as much as you can, starting with the front claws. You may need to go back for the rest later. [19] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source"
