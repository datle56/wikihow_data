If this sounds like a lot to manage, think about it in super simple terms: just be yourself ! [1] X Research source You know those quirky habits you tone down around others? Your girlfriend would love to see this side of you. Don’t be afraid to do a silly dance or snort when you laugh! People sometimes think sharing feelings is embarrassing. But that’s not true!

Physical intimacy of all kinds can be a great way to show how you feel. But to really wow her, focus on forms of touch that are more affectionate than sexual.

Maybe your girlfriend loves cuddling on the couch, but only when you ask permission first. Make sure you respect that! Consistently asking about your girlfriend's needs and desires will lessen the chance that she'll fake her orgasms to protect your feelings.
