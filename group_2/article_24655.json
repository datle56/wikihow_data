      "title": "Chop the carrot in half.",
      "content": "Chop the carrot in half. A whole carrot is usually too cumbersome to julienne, so it helps to cut your carrots into smaller pieces. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice the carrot in half horizontally. If a carrot is particularly long, you may want to cut it into three or four pieces. You’ll have the easiest time julienning pieces that are approximately 3- to 4-inches (8 to 10 cm) long or smaller. It’s important to work on a cutting board so you don’t damage your countertop or other surface while you’re julienning the carrots."

      "title": "Slice the halves down the middle lengthwise.",
      "content": "Slice the halves down the middle lengthwise. Take your carrot halves and use your knife to cut them each down the middle lengthwise. Be careful to curl your fingertips out of the way because the round shape of the carrot means it may move as you’re cutting. If your carrot keeps moving as you're trying to cut, you may want to slice a small piece off on one side to create a flat surface to steady it. The safest positioning when holding a carrot for cutting consists of your fingertips bent at the top knuckle, so that your fingernails are vertical to the carrot. You can also apply slight pressure with your fingernails as a means of holding the carrot steady from this position"

      "title": "Cut each carrot piece into four.",
      "content": "Cut each carrot piece into four. Place the carrot pieces with the cut side facing down to steady them. Slice each piece into four equal pieces with your knife. The pieces that you cut should be rectangular in shape."

    {
      "title": "Divide all of the smaller carrot pieces into thirds.",
      "content": "Divide all of the smaller carrot pieces into thirds. Take each of the four carrot pieces and use your knife to cut them into thirds. If you want even thinner pieces, you can cut them into more pieces until the carrot sticks are as thin as you want. The finished julienned carrot pieces should resemble matchsticks."

      "title": "Set the mandoline on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Set the mandoline on a flat surface. While a mandoline is often safer to use than a knife, it is still extremely sharp and can be dangerous if you don’t use it properly. Make sure to set the tool on a flat, even surface, so it doesn’t move around as you’re julienning the carrots. [1] X Research source The best surface to put the mandoline on is a cutting board that is secure on your countertop so it won’t move around either."

    {
      "title": "Choose the julienne or stick blade on the mandoline.",
      "content": "Choose the julienne or stick blade on the mandoline. Mandolines typically come with multiple blades that allow you to cut vegetables and fruits in a variety of ways. For julienning the carrots, you’ll want to use the julienne blade. On some models, it may be called the stick blade. [2] X Research source On some mandolines, you have to attach the julienne or stick blade manually. On others, you simply move the blade into place. Consult your instruction manual to see how to adjust the blade. If your mandoline has multiple julienne or stick blades, pay attention to the thickness to ensure that you julienne the carrot to the right size."

    {
      "title": "Place the carrot on the food guard.",
      "content": "Place the carrot on the food guard. Because the blades on a mandoline are so sharp, you run the risk of cutting yourself if you move the carrot directly over the tool with your hand. Most models come with a food guard, which serve as a barrier between your hand and the blades. Stick the carrot on the prongs on the guard to ensure that it’s firmly in place. [3] X Research source If your mandoline didn’t come with a food guard, you can purchase one separately. If you feel like you don’t have control over the carrot with the food guard, you can also purchase a stainless steel mesh hand glove that protects the hand holding the carrot from the blades."

    {
      "title": "Run the carrot over the blade to cut.",
      "content": "Run the carrot over the blade to cut. When the carrot it firmly on the food guard, run it over the blade to julienne the carrot. It typically takes several swipes over the blade with the carrot to julienne the entire piece. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash the carrots.",
      "content": "Wash the carrots. When you get the carrots home from the grocery store or farmer’s market, they may still have dirt and bacteria on their skins. To prepare them for julienning, rinse them under cool water and scrub them with a vegetable brush under the running water. [5] X Research source If you plan to peel your carrots, you don’t necessarily need to scrub them."

    {
      "title": "Peel the carrots.",
      "content": "Peel the carrots. It’s safe to eat carrot skin, but some people don’t like its slightly bitter taste. Before julienning the carrots, you may want to use a Y-peeler to remove the skin, particularly if it’s very thick. [6] X Research source When you’re running the peeler over the carrots, try to use a single stroke from the top to the bottom to keep the shape of the carrot as uniform as possible."

    {
      "title": "Trim the carrots.",
      "content": "Trim the carrots. To ensure that your carrots are ready for julienning, it’s important to trim them. Use a sharp chef’s knife to chop off the blunt edge at the top of the carrot, as well as the tip. Depending on what method of julienning that you’re using, you may need to chop the carrot further.
