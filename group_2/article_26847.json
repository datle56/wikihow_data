      "title": "Stretch one stick of blu tack in your hands for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Stretch one stick of blu tack in your hands for 5 minutes. Kneading the blu tack helps to warm it up and makes it stretchier! Stretch the blu tack until it breaks and then squish it together into a ball. Continue to repeat this process until the blu tack feels warm and stretchy. [1] X Research source If you don’t have any blu tack, use a non-name brand of sticky tack instead. This recipe makes about one handful of slime. To make more slime, simply just double the recipe."

    {
      "title": "Pump two squirts of liquid soap or shaving foam into the blu tack.",
      "content": "Pump two squirts of liquid soap or shaving foam into the blu tack. Pump the soap into the centre of the stretched blu tack. If your liquid soap isn’t in a pump bottle, measure about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) instead. Any type of liquid soap that bubbles up can be used for this recipe. [2] X Research source If you don’t have any liquid hand soap, use a runny hand lotion instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the liquid soap into the blu tack.",
      "content": "Mix the liquid soap into the blu tack. Knead the blu tack and liquid soap together with your hands until they are completely combined. If you don’t want to use your hands, use a silicone spatula instead. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add another pump of liquid hand soap if the slime isn’t stretchy enough.",
      "content": "Add another pump of liquid hand soap if the slime isn’t stretchy enough. If the slime feels a bit dry, add a little extra liquid soap to make it squishier. Squeeze the soap onto the top of the slime and then use your hands to knead it into the existing slime. [4] X Research source Skip this step if you don’t like sticky slime. Store your slime in an airtight container. The slime normally remains stretchy for about 2-3 days."

    {
      "title": "Add a drop of food colouring to your slime to change its colour.",
      "content": "Add a drop of food colouring to your slime to change its colour. Place one drop of food colouring into the middle of the slime and then mix it in until the slime is an even colour. If you want the slime a darker colour, simply add another drop of food colouring. If you don’t have any food colouring, use a drop of dye instead. If you are using traditional blu tack, the food colouring will mix with the existing blue colour. Add yellow to blu tack slime to make it green or red food colouring to make purple slime."

      "title": "Knead a drop of essential oil into the slime to make it smell nice.",
      "content": "Knead a drop of essential oil into the slime to make it smell nice. This is a great way to make your slime unique! Choose your favourite essential oil, add one drop into the middle of your slime, and then mix it in to disperse the scent through the slime. Purchase essential oils from a pharmacy or health store. Essential oils are really strong, so you don’t need to use very much."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle a little glitter over the slime to make it sparkly.",
      "content": "Sprinkle a little glitter over the slime to make it sparkly. Choose fine glitter to make your slime look metallic or use chunkier glitter to give it a confetti look. Sprinkle 1 pinch of glitter over your slime and then mix it until the glitter is evenly dispersed in your slime. Sprinkle the glitter onto your slime outside or over newspaper to stop the glitter from making a mess."

    {
      "title": "Mix in foam beads or sequins to give your slime an interesting texture.",
      "content": "Mix in foam beads or sequins to give your slime an interesting texture. Different textures in your slime help to make it look and feel unique. Add foam beads to make it feel nice and squishy or add sequins for a glittery look. Mix in a few foam beads or sequins and add more until you get the desired texture. Experiment with other small craft items, such as confetti or wobbly eyes. Keep slime that has small items in it away from children, as these can act as choking hazards."
