      "content": "Use a level to determine where the toilet is unlevel. Johns says that the first step to leveling an uneven toilet is to “find out where it’s not even.” To do this, set a level on top of the toilet tank or toilet seat. [1] X Expert Source Patrick Johns Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 5 Apr 2022. If the bubble is higher on the left side of the level, you need to raise the right side of the toilet, and if the right side is higher, you need to raise the left side of the toilet."

      "content": "Remove the bolt caps and loosen the hex nuts. There are two bolt caps on the base of the toilet that secure it to the floor. Pry off the bolt caps to reveal the hex nuts, then loosen the bolts with a wrench. [2] X Research source Even if you only need to raise one side of the toilet, loosen the bolts on both sides—this will make it easier to insert the shims where you need them. In some cases, the toilet may be wobbly because these nuts are loose. If that’s the case, simply tightening the nuts may be enough to fix the wobble—put the bolt caps back on and you’re finished!"

      "title": "Wedge shims under the base of the toilet to level it.",
      "content": "Wedge shims under the base of the toilet to level it. Push rubber or plastic shims between the base of the toilet and the floor. It can help to gently tap the shims with a hammer to wedge them under the toilet. Start with 1–2 shims on the side that you need to raise—but depending on how uneven the floor is, you may need to use more than that. Continue adding shims until the toilet feels even and level. [3] X Research source Avoid using wood shims—the humidity in a bathroom can cause them to deteriorate, and your toilet will start wobbling again. [4] X Research source If you don’t have toilet shims, stainless steel washers can also work, but you won’t be able to trim them to size. If your toilet still seems wobbly even after adding multiple washers or shims, you may need to make larger adjustments. Remove the toilet to adjust the closet flange if adding washers or shims has no effect on how level it is (more on this below)."

      "content": "Re-tighten the hex nuts once the toilet is steady. Once the toilet has stopped wobbling, tighten the hex nuts again with your wrench. Place the bolt caps on top of the hex nuts to keep them secure so they don't loosen later on. Don’t trim the shims until after you’ve tightened the nuts in case you need to make minor adjustments."

      "title": "Cut any excess material off of the shims.",
      "content": "Cut any excess material off of the shims. Once the toilet is level and the bolts are tightened, use a utility knife and carefully cut the shims down to size along the base of the toilet. Or, if you prefer, mark each shim with a permanent marker, then pull them out one by one and cut them down to size with cutting pliers. If you pull the shims out to cut them, only pull out one at a time—that way, the remaining shims will hold the toilet in place and you won’t have to adjust it again."

      "title": "Caulk the toilet to the floor if the problem is fixed.",
      "content": "Caulk the toilet to the floor if the problem is fixed. If adding washers or shims fixed the problem, Johns recommends caulking around the base of the toilet to get a finished look. [6] X Expert Source Patrick Johns Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2022. Use a caulk gun to squeeze a bead of caulk around the toilet’s base on the front, left, and right sides. Smooth out the bead using your finger, then wipe your finger on a wet rag. Caulking the toilet keeps the shims and washers secure. Leave about a 4–6 in (10–15 cm) space in the back of the toilet where you don’t caulk. That way, if the toilet leaks in the future, the water will spill out onto the floor and you’ll be able to see—and fix—the problem right away."

If the flange is bent or cracked, use a pry bar to pry it out of the drain hole, then purchase a new closet flange in the same size and place it in the same spot as your old closet flange. If the flange has any chips or cracks, it could be causing the toilet to wobble or leak. In newer homes, the closet flange may be fixed to the drain with PVC glue. If that’s the case, buy a repair flange to fit over the existing one. Use a level to make sure the repair flange is level, then screw it into the floor. If the flange is damaged and glued in place, it will need to be cut out. It’s probably best to have this done by a professional. [16] X Research source"

[17] X Research source If the floor is uneven but not damaged, you could cut out a plywood base slightly larger than the toilet.
