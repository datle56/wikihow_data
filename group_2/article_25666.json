      "title": "Touch their face.",
      "content": "Touch their face. This is a really sweet and romantic gesture that will let them know you are leaning in for a kiss. You don’t have to do this step, but it might give you that little extra courage to go in for the kiss. Put your hand on their jaw or push their hair behind their ear. You can even softly angle their face towards yours."

      "content": "Get the “OK.” No, they don’t have to actually say, “Yes, I would like to kiss you, please proceed.” Instead, check out your partner’s body language to determine if they’re comfortable with kissing. If they lean in with you, they want to kiss just as badly as you do. When you touch them and get closer, make sure they seem genuinely interested and happy about these advances. [1] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019. Look to see if they’re glancing at your lips. Finally, see if they’re licking their own lips, as if to prep them for a smooch. Use your common sense to make sure that you have permission to go ahead!"

      "title": "Adjust your height.",
      "content": "Adjust your height. In other words, lean down if your partner is shorter than you, or lift your head upwards if they're taller. If they're much taller, you may even need to get on your tip toes! It can be intimidating to kiss someone who is much shorter or taller than yourself, but it's very manageable. The important thing is to \"meet halfway,\" so make sure you angle yourself so that you're closer to their height. If you're still nervous about a big height difference, Google \"Shaquille O'Neal and Nicole Alexander kiss.\" If the 7'1\" basketball star and his 5'2\" girlfriend can kiss, you won't have a problem.

      "title": "Cock your head.",
      "content": "Cock your head. One of the biggest concerns when it comes to leaning in for a kiss is bumping noses. To avoid this, you need to make sure your face and your partner's face are cocked in opposite directions. You don't need to bend your neck at a ninety degree angle– keep it natural. If their head is already leaning to one side, casually tilt your head to the opposite side. If they are looking straight at you, with no tilt, choose a side, tilt your head, and they will take their cue from you."

      "title": "Relax your lips.",
      "content": "Relax your lips. Despite calling tightly pursed lips the \"kissy face\" in photos, this is not how you should actually kiss. Close your lips, but keep them relaxed. If you form your mouth into a tight pout, you'll look like a cartoon fish coming in for a kiss, and that won't entice your crush. Keep your lips relaxed until they're almost touching your partner's, and then you can slightly purse them. Just try to keep them feeling soft and gentle. It may sound silly, but practice kissing the back of your hand. Practice kissing gently, avoiding a tight pucker."

Keeping your eyes wide open is a rookie mistake. As soon as you know where your mouth is going, shut your eyes. Don’t close them prematurely, or you could end up kissing their chin or their nose."

      "content": "Kiss. Whether it’s a quick peck or a long, movie-quality make-out, you’ve successfully leaned in for a kiss. Congratulations! Once you’ve had that initial kiss, you will probably feel more comfortable reading their signals and leaning in for a kiss in the future."

Just do something to show them that you want to be near them. As you get closer to them, start speaking more softly and more slowly. The idea is to make the situation feel more intimate. By getting closer and talking more quietly, they’ll know that you only have eyes on them. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Touch them.",
      "content": "Touch them. Initiate some sort of physical touch, whether it’s romantic or not. Hold their hand, rest your arm or leg against theirs, or even just find an excuse to touch their shoulder or back. Once you’ve had that first physical contact, you’ll become more comfortable. Think about big kissing scenes in movies: the two actors are typically touching in someway before the kiss occurs. Bridge the gap, and find a way to touch the person you want to kiss. If they react well to your touch, that’s a great sign. Obviously, if they pull away or look uncomfortable, respect that. That’s a great way to know they aren’t ready to kiss, without getting rejected in a bigger way."

      "content": "Look at their lips. This will let them know you’re thinking about kissing them, and that you want to be kissed. Don’t stare like laser beams, without blinking or glancing into their eyes. Just continuously glance down at their mouth as you touch, get closer, and continue talking.

      "content": "Find somewhere private. It’ll be easier to lean in for that kiss if you’re somewhere secluded and quiet. You don’t have to be the only people there, but you shouldn’t be in a large crowd of friends. Go somewhere where you can chat, and there is a more intimate vibe. Even if you’re at a party, try to go somewhere quiet where you can feel alone."

      "content": "Be prepared for the kiss. Make sure your lips are not chapped or cracked– that can be a major kissing turn-off. Keep your breath fresh, by brushing regularly and bringing mints or gum with you. If you’re a lady, you may want to avoid the bold, thick lipsticks. These can intimidate a male who isn’t sure what will happen to that make-up if he goes in for a kiss. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Be obvious, if you need to. If you’ve been eager to kiss your crush for awhile and it’s just not happening, despite following all of these tips, you may need to just throw “hints” out the window. If you really want a kiss, and you know your partner is interested too, say it! They might be shy, but at least it’ll get your intentions out there and you can figure out if it’s going to happen or not. If you’re feeling really bold, say something like, “So, if I haven’t made it obvious, I’d really love to kiss you.” Then, if you get a smile or a “Same!” go for it!"
