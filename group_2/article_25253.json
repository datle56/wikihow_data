      "content": "Notice what movie he wants to see. The movie he suggests you watch can be a big indicator if he wants to kiss you during the movie. A movie that he is very excited to watch might mean he wants to focus more on the movie than on kissing you. If he chooses a movie he does not seem excited about, he might have chosen it so he can kiss you during the movie. If he has seen the movie before, he might want to kiss you more than pay attention to the movie. He might be hoping the movie sparks your interest in kissing him if he chooses a romantic movie. Keep in mind that the movie he chooses might not necessarily be an indicator if he wants to kiss you or not."
