      "content": "Use the Salam greeting when meeting a Muslim. Greet a Muslim as they would greet one another. [1] X Research source Use the phrase \"As-Salam-u-Alaikum\" (\"Peace be unto you\"). [2] X Research source This is pronounced “as-saa-laam-muu-ah-lay-kum.” You might also choose to use the longer greeting of \"As-Salam-u-Alaikum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh\" (\"Peace be unto you and so may the mercy of Allah and his blessings”). The pronunciation is “us-saa-laam-muu-alie-kum waa-rah-ma-tull-laa-hee wa-bara-kaa-tu-hu.”"

      "title": "Do not expect the Salam greeting from a Muslim.",
      "content": "Do not expect the Salam greeting from a Muslim. Traditionally, the Salam greeting is reserved for those of the Muslim faith, so if you are not Muslim, you might not receive this greeting. [3] X Research source Some current Islamic scholars believe that, in the interest of global peace and understanding, it is permitted to initiate the Salam greeting with non-Muslims. If you do receive the Salam greeting, respond with \"wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah.\" The pronunciation is \"waa-alie-kum-us-salam waa-rah-ma-tull-la\" The meaning is \"May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.\" [4] X Research source The longer response is \"waa-alai-kum-us-salam-wa-rahma-tall-ahi-wa-ba-ra-ka-tu\"."

      "title": "Expect a Muslim to return the Salam greeting.",
      "content": "Expect a Muslim to return the Salam greeting. If greeted with the Salam greeting, a Muslim will respond to a non-Muslim with the return greeting (\"wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah\"). It is obligatory for a Muslim to return the Salam greeting, regardless of the religion of the other person. To refuse this is against their religion. According to the Qu'ran (Muslim holy text), the Salam greeting has been mandatory since the creation of Adam and is commanded by Allah. Some Muslims may only return your greeting with \"wa alaikum\". If that's the case, It's their religious matter and has to do with the historic setting of Medina (Holy city of Muslims). It's narrated that in Prophet Muhammad's PBUH time some non-Muslims greeted Muslims with \"assam o alaikum (destruction be upon you); a close Arabic rhyme with salam \", then they returned the greeting with \"wa alaikum\". The practice is still in use today."

      "title": "Shake hands",
      "content": "Shake hands with male Muslims if you are male. It is common for Muslim men to shake hands. There is generally no prohibition against men shaking hands with other men. The exception is some Shia Muslims prohibit shaking hands with any non-Muslims. Do not be offended if a Muslim declines to shake your hand. It isn’t a personal affront but a reflection of their religious beliefs."

      "title": "Do not shake hands with female Muslims if you are male.",
      "content": "Do not shake hands with female Muslims if you are male. While there is debate on the appropriateness of female Muslims shaking hands with men, you should not do so unless she initiates the contact. Many Muslim women do not shake hands with men due to religious prohibitions against a woman being touched by a man outside of her family. Some Muslim women, especially those working in corporate environments, might shake hands with men. Some Muslim women wear gloves in order to get around the prohibition against touching a male who is not a relative."

      "content": "Do not shake hands with male Muslims if you are female. Regardless of your religious beliefs, you should not reach for a male Muslim’s hand unless he initiates the contact. Pious Muslim men do not touch women outside of their family (wives, daughters, mothers, etc.) Refraining from touching a woman she is not related to is considered a gesture of respect and modesty."

This is the minimum required when greeting a Muslim. It is permissible to use the minimum greeting when time is short, such as when passing each other on the street.
