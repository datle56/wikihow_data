      "content": "Understand pregnancy . Every teen should educate themselves about pregnancy before any sexual activity that involves P-I-V sex. [1] X Expert Source Nicole Moore Love & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 6 October 2021. Here are a few basics that sexually active people should know about pregnancy: Pregnancy can occur anytime that semen enters the vagina. Almost all pregnancies result from unprotected penetrative sex, with the penis in the vagina. Pregnancy cannot occur between two vulva-owners. Not just cisgender women get pregnant--when a person with a penis ejaculates inside a person's vagina, they can get pregnant, whether they are trans, nonbinary, cisgender, or something else. Pregnancy is not possible with oral sex, anal sex, or non-penetrative sexual activities. [2] X Research source Semen must enter the vagina to cause pregnancy. [3] X Research source Precum (a fluid the penis releases in small amounts when aroused) typically does not contain viable sperm. Unlike semen, precum is unlikely to cause pregnancy, but there is a small risk. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn about sexually transmitted diseases. All types of unprotected vaginal, oral, and anal sex can spread sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You can only get an STD by sharing fluids or skin-to-skin contact with someone already infected. However, most people infected with an STD have no symptoms (they are asymptomatic) but can still transmit the disease and cause major health problems (such as infertility and cancer) down the road. The US Center for Disease Control recommends annual STD testing. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source People with penises who do not have sex with people with penises are at lower risk, but should still be tested, especially after risky sexual behavior. Some STDs can take six months or longer to show up on a test. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This is known as an incubation period and it varies with which STD and test used. If you and your sexual partner only have sex with each other, you only need to be tested once (although it doesn't hurt to get tested regularly). Get tested again if you suspect your partner has had sex with someone else, or if either of you have used injected drugs with a shared needle. Everyone should get the HPV-9, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B vaccines before becoming sexually active. If you get vaccinated after being infected with these viruses, vaccines will not be effective in treating the conditions."

      "content": "Use condoms when having penis-in-vagina sex. Condoms are the most common method of birth control among teens. They are cheap, easy to use, and protect you from both pregnancy and some sexually transmitted diseases. Make sure you are using them correctly . Male condoms reduce pregnancy chance to 2% per year when used perfectly, but during typical use, mistakes or lapses increases this to 15%. [7] X Research source Female condoms/internal condoms are slightly less effective, reducing the chance to 5% when used correctly. [8] X Research source Do not use a female (internal) and male (external) condom at the same time. Using condoms and one of the methods below is an excellent way to protect yourself and your sexual partner."

Birth control pills are very effective at preventing pregnancy when a female takes one every day. [10] X Research source They do not protect against any STDs. \"The pill\" is available over the counter in many countries. In the U.S., you need a doctor's prescription. U.S. law prevents your doctor from telling your parents/guardian about your birth control. However, they may find out if you pay for it using your parent's health insurance. Birth control typically costs US$15–$50 per month, so you and your sexual partner may be able to pay for it yourselves. [11] X Research source These pills are very safe for most people but may cause health issues if you have serious health issues related to your heart or blood. Smoking increases this risk. Learn about the pros and cons before taking them. Birth control pills make your menstrual cycle more regular and may reduce unpleasant side effects, such as acne and cramping."

      "content": "Track the female fertility cycle . People with vaginas (and not on FTM hormones) are most fertile during ovulation and for a few days afterward. This usually happens on days 11–21 of a 28-day menstrual cycle, where day 1 is the start of menstrual flow. [12] X Research source It's important to realize that most people do not have regular cycles, so you can't predict exactly when this happens in advance. This tells you when pregnancy is especially risky, but you shouldn't skip protection at other times of the month. Sperm can survive for a few days in the vagina, so if you're sex with somebody with a penis and you have a vagina, sex before ovulation can still lead to pregnancy. To track this, keep a menstrual cycle calendar with signs of an approaching period. If you want to be extra safe, track your ovulation ."

For more information, visit a reproductive health center such as Planned Parenthood, or talk to a doctor or gynecologist. Teens are exposed to many myths about birth control and STDs, so don't assume everything you've heard is true. [13] X Research source The withdrawal method, where a person with a penis 'pulls out' before ejaculation in somebody with a vagina, is not recommended by most experts. While it does reduce pregnancy somewhat when followed correctly, there is a risk they will not pull out in time, or change their mind after sex has started. This method also offers no protection against STDs. [14] X Research source"

Ideally, you should answer \"yes\" to all these questions before you have sex: Do you and your partner understand how pregnancy and STDs work? Can you talk openly about the risk, and agree on a method or methods of protection? Do you and your partner trust and respect each other? Would your partner listen if you changed you mind and said \"stop\"? Are your personal values compatible with the sexual experience you're considering? Would your family and community be okay with this if they knew? If you answer \"no,\" are you comfortable accepting that fact?"

This isn't always the reason sex happens, however. Be honest about why you want to have sex, and understand which reasons are no good: [15] X Research source Only have sex when you and your partner genuinely want to. If one of you is pressuring the other, put this to a stop and wait until both of you are ready. Don't have sex because you think everyone else is doing it. Most high school students have not had sex, and the ones that do don't have sex very often. Don't have sex to save a failing romantic relationship. It won't work."

Tell each other why you want to have sex. If you cannot talk to your partner about these topics, you may want to postpone sex until the two of you are able to have the conversation.

Also understand what a typical sexual experience is like, instead of believing what you hear in boasts, porn, or romance novels: The typical person with a penis lasts five minutes during penetrative sex before ejaculating. [18] X Research source Some people with vulvas take longer to orgasm than their partner, or have trouble achieving orgasm from penile-vaginal sex alone.

The best way to deal with this is to take a break and go back to something you're more comfortable with. You can try again when you feel ready, whether that means in five minutes or next month. Continuing intercourse with a partner who asks you to stop is morally wrong, even if it began as consensual sex. In many regions, this is legally considered rape or sexual assault."

This may seem counter-intuitive to an article on having a healthy sex life, but consider this: if 2/3s of teenagers are engaging in sex, that means 1/3 are not. Also, abstinence does not mean not feeling sexual: it means not having sex. If this is the choice you and your partner have made, then do not be ashamed of it. Neither should you be ashamed to have sexual urges with your partner—it would be unnatural not to.

If you find yourself suddenly overwhelmed with passion, but are committed to remaining chaste for now, simply back off a bit and say something like \"wow, that's hot, but I'm not ready to go further right now. Let's go watch a movie.\" If your partner doesn't understand, or is insistent, don't be surprised: they may not be quite as ready to stop as you are, and might be a little confused and flustered.

This doesn't mean you can get pregnant from kissing, of course. What this means is that a large number of abstaining teens lose their resolve and have some form of sex in the heat of the moment, often without protection. Educate yourself about pregnancy and STDs. Understanding these risks can help you stick to your plan, or run out and buy a condom if you change your minds."
