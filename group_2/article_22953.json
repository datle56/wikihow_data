      "content": "People get bird flu from close or prolonged contact with infected birds or animals. Although it’s rare for bird flu to spread from person to person, humans can become infected with bird flu if they come in contact with an infected animal’s body fluid, such as mucus, saliva, or feces. You can also get it by breathing in dust or droplets with the virus, working with or drinking raw milk from infected animals, or by touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands after touching contaminated items or surfaces. [2] X Research source Who’s at the highest risk? People who work with infected animals are at greater risk. This includes poultry, dairy and livestock farmers and workers, veterinarians, public health responders, dairy laboratory workers, food processing workers handling raw milk and hunters. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Does bird flu spread by eating chicken? No, poultry that is properly prepared and cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (73.9°C) is completely safe to eat. Eating uncooked or undercooked poultry can make you sick. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Can humans get bird flu from eating eggs? No, as long as you cook your eggs to an internal temperature of 165°F (73.9°C), you will not get sick. Cooking eggs kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu.

Dairy cows and other animals infected with bird flu can pass the virus through their milk, so choosing pasteurized milk and products made with pasteurized milk is the best way to protect yourself from bird flu.

      "content": "What is bird flu? Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious type of influenza that usually spreads among birds and other animals. Bird flu viruses normally live in wild water birds, such as ducks and geese, but they can spread to domestic birds, like chickens, guinea hens and turkey, and some other wild and domestic animals, like seals, foxes, cats, and cattle. Bird flu rarely infects people, but there have been some rare cases of human infection with the virus. [24] X Research source There are many subtypes of bird flu, but the current strain of bird flu that is spreading in the United States and globally is avian influenza A(H5).

The FDA has approved 3 bird flu vaccines in the past (2007, 2013, and 2020), but health officials say these strains are outdated because the virus is always mutating (similar to the seasonal flu). [26] X Research source The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed candidate vaccines for the current strain, but they will only be used if health officials deem that it’s necessary.

Since the beginning of this most recent outbreak in 2022, there has been a decrease in the number of egg–laying chickens, which is why egg prices have risen and there has been a shortage of eggs.
