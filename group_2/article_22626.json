Place your key inside or tape it to the bottom, then place the rock in an inconspicuous area, preferably somewhere that has a lot of other rocks. The more natural the location, the better. [1] X Research source Many thieves are likely aware of fake rocks, so it’s probably better to choose a real one, if possible. If you do use a fake one, make sure it’s somewhere inconspicuous and not right next to your front door. A fake rock that’s often recommended is the RamPro Hide-a-Spare-Key rock . It’s made to look and feel like real stone, so it may be more likely to fool potential burglars.

Place your key in a lockbox or magnetic key holder and hide it in an inconspicuous location, like under your porch, inside your grill, or in a meter box. [3] X Research source RamPro’s magnetic key holder is a popular key-hiding product, as it’s waterproof and can be hidden on any metal surface. Unlike lockboxes, though, the lid slides right off without a code, so if anyone finds the key, they can easily take it. [4] X Research source If you’re looking for something a bit more secure, the Puroma key lockbox can be mounted on any wall and allows you to set your own code to unlock it. Make sure to use a lockbox code that is hard to guess. Avoid using your address or simple codes like 0000 or 1234."
