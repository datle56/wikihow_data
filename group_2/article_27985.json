[1] X Research source Make sure to remove the label on a recycled jar so you can see everything clearly inside the bottle later. Simply peel it off and wipe away any sticky residue with Goo Gone . [2] X Research source Glass bottles or jars could be used but aren’t recommended, especially if the sensory bottle’s for a child, because they can easily shatter."

[4] X Research source As an alternative, fill the bottle completely with water and add a few spoonfuls of clear liquid glue , dish detergent , or corn syrup . Glue and corn syrup will cause an even longer float, while dish detergent will suspend fine glitter. [5] X Research source"
