      "content": "Find a preferred method for checking the status of the diaper. You could feel the diaper for fullness or \"being squishy\" though sometimes the diaper brand may be so absorbent that you wouldn't be able to feel for the fullness and sometimes you could accidentally squeeze out the very thing you didn't want to come out in the first place (e.g. feces, poop). You could look at the diaper or pants the child is wearing for signs of leakage or stains but by then it would probably be too late and diaper rash would have set in and you would have to rummage through all your baby first aid things only to find the empty tube of diaper rash cream. Look down the diaper. This is easier if you have a mobile child."

      "content": "Put the child on the floor, with something underneath the child that is meant for soaking up urine and feces, and is easy to clean (E.G. A cloth-lined, plastic changing pad, bought at any baby and children store or superstore). If you do not have a changing pad, then a regular towel will do, but make sure it is clean and that afterwards, if there are any stains, that you wash the towel clean immediately in cold water and laundry detergent, and hang to dry."

      "content": "Get the supplies. Now that the baby is on the floor, gather the supplies needed. These include but are not limited to: A clean diaper of your choice, baby wipes of your choice, diaper rash cream, baby powder, a clean change of clothes, a blanket to wrap a tiny baby in when cold, and a toy or book or pacifier to entertain the child with. It is a good idea not to give the child a bottle at this time as the child may associate diaper changes with feeding and that may not work out so well with some parents. It's much easier to gather everything you need in advance than it is to go and grab things once you've already started changing the baby's diaper.

      "content": "Clean the baby. Start removing the diaper. Now that the baby is entertained, proceed in peeling back the flaps of the old diaper, lifting the child’s rear end up a few inches into the air and removing the diaper. Keeping the child’s rear in the air, reach for a baby wipe and wipe the child downward from genitalia to anus. It is absolutely important that when dealing with females, that you always wipe from vulva to anus. NEVER from the anus to the vulva as this can cause a serious vaginal infection if bacteria enter the vagina."

Take this time to unfold the fresh diaper, pulling out the two flaps located at the back and stretching them a bit so they will be more comfortable to the child. If your child is a newborn, now would be a good time to wrap the infant in a blanket to keep him/her warm until their bottom is dry."

If the child is still very young and still has his/her umbilical cord attached, keeping the diaper off the umbilical cord is very important for hygienic reason. Folding over the protruding end of the diaper, or cutting out a hole beforehand can help evade infection."
