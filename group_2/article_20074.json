      "content": "Lock eyes and hold his gaze for a few seconds. Your eyes are your strongest seductive tool, and you can use them in private or when you’re both out in public to send the signal. The more intentional you are, the bigger emotional (and physical) reaction you’ll get from him. Throw in a wink, a raised eyebrow, or a pouty lip to make it extra clear what’s on your mind. If you have a signature dirty look he recognizes, go for it! He’ll love picking up on your horny bat signal. [1] X Research source Don’t lock eyes for longer than about 10 seconds. After that point, it can start to seem a little creepy or jokey."

A familiar smell can stimulate a lot of different sensory reactions in him, including arousal. When he gets a whiff of your perfume, he’ll start thinking about you and all the fun you’ve had together (including in the bedroom!). If you’re feeling extra sneaky, spray a tiny amount of perfume on his pillow. He’ll start thinking about you before you’re even in the bedroom. Scents that remind him of sex, nature, or even food can help grab his attention and put sex on his mind. Try perfumes with hints of sandalwood, bergamot, rose, lavender, vanilla, cinnamon, or citrus scents."

If he loves the way you look in your towel after a shower, let him see you when you strut out of the bathroom. If it’s your lips, “accidentally” brush them with your finger while you’re “concentrating” on something. The idea is to do what you naturally do, just on purpose and right in front of him. Some more ideas might be: Applying lotion to your hands, legs, or chest if he’s into those areas. \"Fixing\" your hair with a sexy hair flip .

[8] X Research source If you want to be more direct, try doing a slow, erotic dance just for him when you’re alone together. Again, you don’t have to be a great dancer.
