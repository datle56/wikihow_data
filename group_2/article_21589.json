Since most Windows 10 accounts use a Microsoft account email address and password to log in, you can't reset a hacked computer's main account password like you could in Windows 7 and down. You will, however, be able to access the files of the main account. If the user you're trying to hack is a local user (e.g., a user added to the computer by a Microsoft account), you can change their password like you could in previous Windows renditions."
