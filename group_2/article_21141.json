      "title": "Gather all the necessary supplies.",
      "content": "Gather all the necessary supplies. In order to groom your Yorkie Poo at home, you'll need to purchase some basic supplies. This includes dog shampoo, a dog brush, nail clippers, and dog hair trimmers. You may also need some other common household items like a hair dryer, towels, and a nonslip mat for your bathtub. Be sure to purchase shampoo that is specially formulated for canines. Human shampoo contains many ingredients that can be harmful or irritating to dogs. You can even purchase dog shampoo that is formulated for your pup's specific needs – like sensitive skin, brittle coat, or puppy formulas. A slicker brush is the most common type of brush used on dogs. It has wire (sometimes plastic) teeth that work well to remove excess hair and work out tangles and mats."

      "title": "Prepare the area.",
      "content": "Prepare the area. Find a safe place in your house where you can perform the grooming activities. Your bathroom is probably the best space for this, especially if it has a door that you can close to keep your Yorkie Poo from running out if it gets scared. Lay out some towels on the floor to help minimize the mess during the grooming process. Save one towel for drying your pup later. [1] X Research source You can also use an outdoor space for grooming as long as it is fully enclosed (like a fenced-in yard or garage) to ensure your dog can't escape. But be mindful of weather conditions. You don't want to groom your Yorkie Poo outside if it is too cold or rainy."

      "title": "Brush the dog.",
      "content": "Brush the dog. Begin with your dog's face and gently work out any tangles in the dog's beard with the brush. Then move on to your dog's back, legs, and belly. Brush smaller sections at a time to keep your pet comfortable. Bring the brush to the base of the coat and comb it through the full length of the hair to make sure you get all of the tangles out. [2] X Research source Brushing your Yorkie Poo regularly is the single best thing you can do to keep up with your at-home grooming regimen and keep your dog looking its best. You can brush your Yorkie Poo as often as every day, but be sure to do it at least once every three days or so. The longer and curlier your Yorkie Poo's hair is, the more frequently you'll need to brush it."

      "title": "Get the dog's coat wet.",
      "content": "Get the dog's coat wet. After you have brushed out your dog's hair, you'll need to dampen its coat with water. Use lukewarm water to wet down your dog's hair in the sink or bathtub. Run your fingers through the dog's hair as you pour the water to ensure that the hair is getting fully saturated all the way to the base. [3] X Research source Use water that is slightly warm – never cold or too hot. Be sure to put down a nonslip surface in the bathtub to help your dog with traction and to prevent slipping."

      "title": "Lather on the shampoo.",
      "content": "Lather on the shampoo. Use a small amount of dog shampoo (probably about the size of a quarter) to lather up your dog with suds. Lather your dog's body first and then the head. Gently rub the shampoo into your dog's hair, making sure to soap up the entire coat. [4] X Research source Be careful to avoid getting shampoo in your dog's eyes, ears, and nose. This can be stressful and uncomfortable for your dog. Again, be sure to only use shampoo that is specially formulated for use on dogs."

      "title": "Rinse with water.",
      "content": "Rinse with water. After you've finished shampooing your Yorkie Poo, it's time to rinse all the soap out. Rinse the soap from your dog's head first and then from his body. Pour warm water on your dog's fur and use your hand to gently rub and get the soap out. Begin with your dog's back, then move to the dog's face. Finally, rinse the shampoo from the dog's legs, belly, and tail. Make sure that you thoroughly remove all of the soap and soap residue. Any remaining on your dog's skin could cause irritation."

      "title": "Dry the hair.",
      "content": "Dry the hair. When you are done bathing your Yorkie Poo, you should use a towel to soak up any excess water remaining on the dog. Gently towel dry the dog and then set it down on the ground so that your pup can shake off some additional excess water. At this point, you can either let your dog air dry or use a hairdryer to fully dry your dog's coat. [5] X Research source Be sure to use the blow dryer on the lowest/coolest setting available to ensure you don't burn your pup's skin. Most dogs are initially frightened by the sound of the hair dryer. But, over time, your dog should grow accustomed to it. Try introducing the dog to the noise slowly at first and building up to longer sessions."

      "title": "Trim your dog's nails.",
      "content": "Trim your dog's nails. Hold your dog firmly so that it doesn't wiggle free or feel nervous. Take the nail clippers and insert each nail into the hole, one at a time. However, do not insert the nail too far and only cut a small amount of the nail at a time. Make a swift cut with the nail clippers to get a clean cut with minimal breakage. Be sure to cut from the underneath side so that you have a better visual of the quick. The pink part is the quick, which is living tissue and will cause bleeding and pain for your pet if you cut it. [6] X Research source If you accidentally make your dog's nails bleed, don't feel too bad. This even happens to professional groomers from time to time. Make sure you have some styptic powder or cornstarch on hand to dip the nails in if they start bleeding. This will help coagulation."

      "title": "Use the hair trimmer.",
      "content": "Use the hair trimmer. If you want to keep your Yorkie Poo's coat short and stylish, you'll need to use some electric dog clippers. A typical Yorkie Poo haircut includes a shaggy face with a slightly trimmed beard and a shaved back that tapers into longer leg hair. You can adjust the style however you like. [7] X Research source Use a Number 10 blade on the clippers to get a short cut. Be careful not to cut your dog's skin as you clip his fur. Be sure to purchase hair clippers made for dogs – they have more teeth than human hair clippers, which works better for the thicker hair in a dog's coat. Make sure your Yorkie Poo is secured to something during the grooming process so that it doesn't fall and hurt itself."

      "content": "Maintain dental health. In order to keep your dog healthy and looking its best, it's important for you to stay on top of the dog's dental health. A well-groomed dog should have healthy looking teeth and steer clear of bad breath. Give your Yorkie Poo doggie treats that are intended for promoting canine dental health. Chewing on these may help clean your dog's teeth each time it eats one. You can also brush your Yorkie Poo's teeth. Some dogs don't like this, but they can grow accustomed to it over time. Use a double-headed toothbrush and toothpaste that is meant for dogs. Do not use human toothpaste as it contains fluoride, which can be toxic to dogs. Additionally, ask your veterinarian to check your Yorkie Poo's teeth at your annual checkup."
