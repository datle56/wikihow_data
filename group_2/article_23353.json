Valve cover bolts are the big bolts on the top of the engine, holding down the plate (usually marked \"Ford\") on top of the valves. The number of bolts corresponds to your engine type, which will help you locate the more useful ID tag. 2 bolts: 239/256/272/292/312 5 bolts: 332/352/360/361/390/391/406/410/427/428 6 bolts: 221/260/289/302/351W 7 bolts: 429/460 8 bolts: 351C/351M/400"

The tag is a series of numbers and letters etched in and used to decipher the year, make, and model of you engine. It is found underneath the bolts on the left or right side of the engine, near the front of the car. You can find the tag here on all six-cylinder engines made after 1964, and on some V8 engines. [1] X Research source The tag is roughly three inches long, half an inch wide, and made of aluminum. If you are unsure what kind of engine you have, think back to the valve cover bolts as you work through the following steps. This will help you narrow down your options."

Luckily, the tags are simple to breakdown. From upper left to bottom right: [4] X Research source Cubic Inch Displacement (CID): The first three numbers, found in the upper left corner, tell you the size of the engine. Manufacturing Plant: The single letter to the right of the CID is where the engine was built. \"C\" is for Cleveland, \"E\" is for Ensite, Canada, and \"W\" is for Windsor, Canada. Year: The next two numbers are for the year the engine was built. 70, for example, would mean it was made in 1970. Month Built: This hyphenated number and letter correspond to the month. The months are in alphabetical order, so A = January and M = December. There is no \"i\" so people don't confuse it the number 1. 0-A would mean January 1970, 5-C March 1975, etc. (assuming the year code is for the 70's). Engine Code Number: This final 3-digit number is the ID of your particular engine. You can look up this code online to see the specs of your current engine. [5] X Research source"

The casting tag is etched into your motor when it is created, and is used to help find the right parts if you need a replacement. This code also packs a large amount of information in it that will help you get to know your engine better. You may need to clean the engine with a rag and some degreaser if it is too dirty to see the letters. This code is usually on the side of the engine, but you might not be able to see it when the engine is in a car with older models. Use a light to scan both sides of the engine to find it.
