If it’s too tight that it makes you uncomfortable as you stand in the dressing room, it will only feel worse when you wear it out. Try on multiple dresses until you find one that feels good. Well-tailored dresses in structured fabrics can help to flatter curves. Avoid clingy fabrics or ill-fitting cuts, even if you like a particular dress style. Keep trying until you find one that fits your shape and proportions—or one that can be easily tailored.
