      "content": "“High eyes” refers to the bloodshot eyes you get after using marijuana. While marijuana is largely a psychoactive drug, it does have some physical side effects—most notably, high eyes. After consuming marijuana (from smoking, vaping, edibles, tinctures, etc.), many people notice bloodshot eyes that look pink or red, droopy or “sleepy” looking eyelids, and slightly dilated pupils. [1] X Research source Your eyes may also feel dry and you may notice mild eyelid trembling or twitching, too. Some people also say their eyes look glassy or “shiny” when they’re high, possibly from irregular blinking or tear production caused by the drug. High eyes are also known as “weed eyes” or “stoned eyes.”"

      "content": "Use over-the-counter eyedrops or artificial tears to clear up your eyes. The best and fastest way to get rid of high eyes is to use eye drops designed to reduce redness and inflammation. Dr. Assil adds, “The best thing to do is to get over-the-counter artificial teardrops that are preservative-free. There are a lot of different brands and you can try different ones to see which one resonates with you the most. You can use that one or two or three times a day.”"

Place a cool compress over your eyes for several minutes up to a few times a day.

[3] X Research source The cold will reduce blood flow and cause your blood vessels to constrict, helping to reverse the effects of high eyes."

      "content": "Stay hydrated. When you’re dehydrated, your eyes can become dry and itchy, which contributes to their redness. To help fight high eyes, drink plenty of water (and avoid caffeine or alcohol) before, during, and after you smoke to keep your eyes hydrated and clear. [4] X Research source To stay hydrated , men need about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day, and women need about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters).

      "content": "Rest your eyes and take a break from weed. High eyes can last for up to several hours, so the sooner you stop smoking, the sooner they’ll clear up! You might be able to speed up the process by resting your eyes. Take a break from screens to reduce eye strain or close and gently massage your eyes for a few minutes. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might also consider taking a nap—this will be especially helpful if you were already feeling a bit sleep-deprived or tired before you smoked or had an edible. Tip: To prevent high eyes, try smoking a low-THC strain of marijuana. This won’t help your current case, but may make it less likely it’ll happen again next time. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "See your eye care provider if your high eyes last longer than a day. In most cases, high eyes are harmless and don’t need any treatment to get better. However, if the redness lasts for more than a day or two (and you haven’t been smoking or eating edibles during that time), make an appointment with your optometrist or doctor to get your eyes checked out. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As Dr. Assil says, “If you [need] to use [eyedrops] more than a couple of times a day, then there's something more significant going on that warrants being examined.”"

      "title": "THC causes blood vessels in your eyes to dilate, turning them red.",
      "content": "THC causes blood vessels in your eyes to dilate, turning them red. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid in weed that binds to cannabinoid receptors throughout your body, including in your eyes. When this happens, the receptors cause your blood vessels to dilate, or widen, which causes an increase in blood flow to the area and decreases your blood pressure. This combination of more blood flow and wider vessels leads to a bloodshot pink or red appearance in your eyes. [9] X Research source The lowered blood pressure may also cause dizziness and lowered eye pressure in some people, too. Some believe that it’s the smoke from marijuana that causes red eyes. While smoke irritation can definitely contribute, vaping, edibles, and tinctures can all cause red eyes too since the THC is the root cause."

      "content": "More research is needed, but cannabis may have negative side effects on your vision. In one study, regular cannabis users demonstrated worse static visual acuity (how clear something looks when it’s standing still), contrast sensitivity, depth perception, and nighttime vision compared to infrequent or non-users. While most people’s vision is temporarily inhibited while they’re high, regular users may have more permanent effects. [10] X Research source Another study showed that cannabis use may also be associated with an earlier onset of macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a cause of blindness in older people, and cannabis may contribute to the decline of blood vessels that leads to the onset of AMD. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, much of this research has conflicting results. For example, the same macular degeneration study showed that marijuana may also reduce your risk of developing AMD in the first place.

      "title": "Cannabis use might make your pupils look a little larger.",
      "content": "Cannabis use might make your pupils look a little larger. Marijuana can cause pupil dilation in some people, meaning that their pupils appear larger and more noticeable than normal. [14] X Research source However, the dilation may be subtle, and not everyone shows this side effect. The THC in cannabis stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system, which controls your pupil dilation. This means your pupils may not always respond as sensitively to changes in light as normal. [15] X Research source Interestingly, some studies have also shown that marijuana can sometimes cause pupils to constrict instead of dilate. More research is needed to understand the link between cannabis and pupil dilation."

      "title": "Other drugs can affect the size of your pupils, too.",
      "content": "Other drugs can affect the size of your pupils, too. Most drugs will have some effects on your eyes, but the effects vary based on the type of drug—some constrict your pupils (make them appear small), some dilate your pupils, and some can give you red eyes just like marijuana does. Often, looking at someone’s eyes alone isn’t enough to determine if they’re high on marijuana. Here are some common eye symptoms and the drugs they’re associated with: [16] X Research source Red eyes: marijuana, cocaine or crack, benzodiazepines, depressants Constricted pupils: heroin, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, codeine, hydrocodone Dilated pupils: amphetamines, methamphetamines, cocaine or crack, hallucinogens, opiates, heroin, marijuana, speed, MDMA/ecstasy Keep in mind that other factors like health conditions, prescription medications, and environmental conditions can also affect whether your pupils are dilated or constricted. Dilated pupils are not indicators of drug use by themselves."

      "title": "Do edibles make your eyes red?",
      "content": "Do edibles make your eyes red? Yes, edibles can make your eyes red. Since edibles contain THC, they’ll have the same effects on your eyes as smoking or vaping. Since edibles take longer to be absorbed into your bloodstream, you may not experience the effects as quickly as when you smoke, though. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "How long does it take for red eyes to go away after being high?",
      "content": "How long does it take for red eyes to go away after being high? Red high eyes usually go away an hour or two after onset. For some people, they can last as long as 3 or 4 hours. It all depends on how quickly your body metabolizes THC and how much of it you had (the more THC you consume, the longer your eyes will be red). [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Do your eyes hurt after being high?",

      "title": "Do everyone’s eyes get red when they smoke?",
      "content": "Do everyone’s eyes get red when they smoke? No. While red, high eyes are a very common side effect of cannabis use, not everyone will get them. This is because everyone’s body is unique and may process THC differently. How often you use cannabis matters, too. Frequent users with a higher tolerance may not show red eyes as easily as someone who only smokes now and then."

      "title": "How do you get rid of eye bags or puffy eyes from cannabis?",
      "content": "How do you get rid of eye bags or puffy eyes from cannabis? Apply a cold compress, rest your eyes, and take a break from weed to reduce bags or puffiness. The cold will constrict your blood vessels, helping reduce the slight swelling that’s causing your bags or puffiness. A gentle massage under the eye may also help drain excess fluid."

    {
      "title": "What else can make your eyes red?",
      "content": "What else can make your eyes red? Dr. Assil explains that “Red eyes just mean that the outer layer of the eye is inflamed. It could be inflamed because there's serious inflammation deeper inside the eye, such as with certain types of immune diseases similar to arthritis that can affect the eyes themselves. They could be red because of diseases that cause inflammation of the muscles around the eye. They could be red simply because you stayed up too late the night before and didn't get enough sleep, or your eyelids don't close all the way when you sleep at night, or you don't drink enough water, or you have too much caffeine that dries you out. So it can be dry or red for a whole host of reasons.”"
