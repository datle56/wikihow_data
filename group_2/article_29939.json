[22] X Research source A simple running stitch works great, or use a backstitch . Keep the distance between the stitches small so the thread is less noticeable on the front of your garment. If you have a sewing machine , feel free to use that instead. If your clothes are double layered, pull the thread through the inside layer instead of going through both. This hides your stitches!"
