      "title": "Join Amazon’s affiliate program.",
      "content": "Join Amazon’s affiliate program. One of the easiest ways to make money on Amazon without selling anything is through affiliate marketing. Joining Amazon’s affiliate program , Amazon Associates, allows you to monetize traffic through social media, blogs, and other channels. Recommending products for sale in the Amazon store allows you to earn up to 10% in associate commissions from qualifying purchases. [1] X Research source Bloggers, publishers, and content creators with a qualifying website or app can participate in the program. Marketing specialist Imran Alavi provides an example of affiliate marketing: “Take an example of an author who wants to sell their book. There’s Amazon, there’s Google Books, but there are also other blog writers or [freelancers] who will post that link on their website. Because they already have a reputation, people can go to their website and buy that book from that link. So [the affiliate marketer] will get a small commission for selling that book as an affiliate.”"

      "content": "Join the Amazon influencer program. If you already have a strong following on social media, the Amazon influencer program may be better for you. This program allows you to earn money by creating content, recommending Amazon products, and earning commission on qualifying purchases. The program accepts influencers from all types of influencers, as long as you have a YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok account. [2] X Research source To boost your social media presence, Alavi says, “The main point is consistency. You want to be able to post content on a consistent basis, and you also want to make sure you are marketing on the right platforms. Let’s say you’re trying to sell shoes; you may want to have more focus on things like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest.”"

      "content": "Publish books with Kindle Direct Publishing. Believe it or not, Amazon started out as a book-selling platform, and it still has a program dedicated to authors. If you write books , publish the text with Amazon’s publishing service, Kindle Direct Publishing (or KDP), to earn up to 70% royalties on books you sell. KDP supports ebooks and physical books, so it’s an excellent way to generate passive income. [3] X Research source Keep in mind you’ll probably have to do some self-promotion to make people aware of your book. However, when you first upload one, Amazon offers a free five-day promotion of your book to boost visibility. Another option is to ghostwrite books. While payment terms vary depending on the contract, usually royalties are split 50/50 between the ghostwriter and the credited author."
