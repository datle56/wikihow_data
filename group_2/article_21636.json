When people talk about being in love, what they're really talking about is feeling an intense attraction and connection to another person. In societies that value monogamy, people tend to believe that you can only truly be in love with one person—but the reality is that people fall in love with more than one person all the time. [1] X Research source For example, most adults have been in a long-term relationship with more than one person, and they fell in love with both of those people. There are different kinds of love, and most people have no problem recognizing that you can have platonic love for more than one friend, or familial love for more than one child. Many people believe that romantic love is no different, in the sense that you can fall in love and have romantic feelings for more than one person without affecting the love you have for either person individually.

[3] X Research source Through the course of thinking about this, you might even decide that you're not really in love with one of them—that you were just mistaking something else for love. You also might open yourself to love because you're feeling neglected or bored in your current relationship. If you've been in a romantic relationship with someone for a long time, it's totally normal that you might start having feelings for someone else. While you might feel guilty, it doesn't mean that you don't love your current romantic partner. The spark of a new connection can often feel like you're falling in love, especially if you've been in a romantic relationship for a long time and haven't felt that \"new relationship energy\" in a while."

If you believe you're in love with two people, Miller recommends that you \"think about what you want in a life partner.\" [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. People have different emotional needs that they expect a romantic partner to meet. From a polyamorous perspective, it's not fair to expect a single romantic partner to meet all of your emotional needs. If you feel as though you're in love with two different people, it could be because they're meeting different emotional needs. [5] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source It's also possible that the two people present different love stories—for example, one might be more of a fairytale romance while the other is more practical. If you're already in a relationship with one of the people, keep in mind that it's possible you might love them but they might not be a great life partner. Miller notes that \"a lot of times people think I am in love, that means this person is right for me, [but] that's not always true.

And if you're currently in a committed, monogamous relationship, you might be clashing with your partner's expectations as well. Typically, your partner's expectations are going to impact your decision more than society's are. [7] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Miller advises that \"you have to get really quiet and basically think about what you want. Do you want a monogamous relationship?\" [8] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. It could be that your partner isn't necessarily that attached to having a monogamous relationship, they're just going along with the standard societal assumption. In that case, the two of you might have a conversation about having a more open relationship. If, on the other hand, your partner values monogamy and fidelity very highly, you won't be able to continue both relationships ethically. But if you feel strongly that you don't want to be monogamous anymore, it might be the right time to let that relationship go."

Coming clean with your current partner can allow you to discuss the needs you have that aren't being met in your relationship. At the same time, though, this can be a really difficult conversation to have. [9] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I've gotten a lot closer to a coworker of mine since we started having to put in extra hours on this urgent project and I've grown emotionally attached to them. I think I might be in love with them. Can we talk about what this means?\" Even if your partner doesn't particularly value monogamy, they might be taken aback that you weren't transparent about this connection you were feeling with someone else. That might limit their ability to support you or have more empathy with what you're feeling. Reassure your partner that you still love them and that this new love interest hasn't lessened your love for them. Tell them what you love about them and that they are irreplaceable in your life."

[12] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Since I've been on this research project, I've been hanging out with Olly a lot and I really like them. Actually, I think I'm catching feelings for them. I wanted to let you know because obviously I have feelings for you too.\" Let the person know that your feelings for the other person don't impact your feelings for them.
