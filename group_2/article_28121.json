      "title": "Use a sugar substitute.",
      "content": "Use a sugar substitute. Stevia is a naturally-occurring alternative to sugar that is growing in popularity since it is healthier than granulated sugar. The taste difference is marginal at best so if you're desperate for a sprinkling of sugar over your strawberries, Stevia is the healthier option. If you're looking for something that's easier to mix into a bowl, agave syrup is another naturally-occurring and tasty alternative that will sweeten strawberries. About 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of syrup would be a perfect amount to cover a handful of strawberries. Make sure to consult a conversion table if you are going to replace sugar with Stevia in any recipe. [1] X Research source Monk fruit sweetener is a great alternative to sweeteners containing sugars. It does not add any flavor or aftertaste. If the strawberries are light pink or red, leave them out of the fridge for a few days to ripen. It will give the sugars more time to develop, and the strawberries will become sweet."

      "content": "Sprinkle strawberries with a pinch of salt to draw out their natural sweetness. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, salt can actually enhance the flavor of fruit. [2] X Research source A small pinch of salt will go a long way to rejuvenate your fruit, but don't go overboard with it or it may override the flavor you're seeking. An alternative method is to soak the strawberries in a bowl of cold water with 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of salt added into the mixture. Let it rest for 30 minutes then rinse and dry the strawberries. The salting process will draw out the natural sweetness within the fruit."

      "content": "Serve your strawberries with dried fruits and nuts to craft a tasty contrast. Dried fruits and nuts have healthy preservatives within them that, when served with fresh fruit, can help draw out the sweetness. Additionally, eating nuts or dried fruit adds a good contrast to the fresher strawberry. Collect 1 ounce (28 g) of almonds, pecans, and walnuts then chop them into small pieces and sprinkle them over a bowl of chopped strawberries for a quick and nutritious snack."

      "content": "Combine strawberries with milk and honey for a sweet breakfast. The ancient Greeks knew what they were doing. Milk is already a great compliment to naturally sweet foods (which is why it goes so well with cookies) so pairing the two together makes sense. [3] X Research source Add 5 fluid ounces (150 mL) of milk and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey to a handful of strawberries in a bowl to make a delicious breakfast. Honey is a natural and comparatively healthy alternative to sprinkling sugar over your strawberries."

      "content": "Drizzle dark chocolate over the strawberries to make a decadent dessert. Choose high-quality chocolate. Heat 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water in a saucepan until it us simmering. Then, put 2 cups (12 ounces) of dark chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl and put the bowl into the saucepan so that the steam rises and heats the bottom of the bowl. Stir the chocolate chips gently as they gradually melt. Meanwhile, dry your strawberries thoroughly. The dryer the strawberry, the easier it will be for the chocolate to stick to it. Then, line a baking tray with parchment paper. Remove the bowl with the dark chocolate and place it on a pot holder beside your strawberries. Lift a strawberry by its stem then dip and swirl into the melted chocolate until it is coated. Lay the coated strawberry on the lined baking tray. Wait for the chocolate to set. You can leave them out in a cool dry place or if you want to speed the process along you can put them into a fridge. Once set, they're ready to eat! Although dark chocolate contains a little bit of sugar, the sweet treat also has a wide variety of health benefits that can make your snack both tastier and healthier. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix it up with applesauce or cinnamon for an autumnal twist. Applesauce is famously one of the healthier sweeteners and so can add a further fruity dimension to your strawberries. [5] X Research source Add several dollops on top of a handful of strawberries then mix with a spoon to make sure they're completely covered. Applesauce topping can be enhanced further with a sprinkling of cinnamon that will not only amplify the flavor of the strawberries, but the applesauce as well."

      "content": "Make a strawberry smoothie for a quick healthy snack. Smoothies are delicious, nutritious and filling. Chop 8 large strawberries into small pieces and put them in a blender. Pour in 7 fluid ounces (210 mL) of cold milk, then add a finely-chopped banana, a handful of mixed berries, and a 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of a natural sweetener like honey or agave syrup. Blend all the ingredients thoroughly then pour the smoothie into a glass for a delicious and filling snack.

      "title": "Roast your strawberries to bring out their sweetness.",
      "content": "Roast your strawberries to bring out their sweetness. Although strawberries are associated with a cool and fresh texture, roasting them in your oven can lend a whole new taste to them. [7] X Research source Lay your strawberries out on a baking tray and put them in a pre-heated oven at 350 째F (177 째C) for about 20 minutes. The heat from your oven will cause the natural sugars within the strawberry to concentrate, making them sweeter to your tongue. The final result will hold a softer, mellower and more refined taste that makes a great post-dinner snack."

      "content": "Create a strawberry jam for a delicious homemade condiment. Mash your strawberries to a pulp with a masher or a rolling pin. Then, once mashed to a pulp, add the mixture to a saucepan with a drizzle of lemon juice and 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of an alternative sweetener of your choice (Stevia, syrup, or honey work best). [8] X Research source Cover the pan and simmer the mixture at a low heat until the sweetener has dissolved thoroughly. Then, boil the mixture at a high heat, stirring as often as you can until the mixture hits 220 째F (104 째C). Once you reach the desired temperature, transfer the jam mixture into small jars then refrigerate them for 2-4 hours. Over time, the mixture will solidify."

      "content": "Stew your strawberries for a Christmas-inspired dessert. Remove the stems of your strawberries then chop them into quarters. Put the strawberries into a bowl then rinse them with cold water. Dry the strawberries off gently then add them to a pot. Place the pot on the stove and cook them at a medium heat. After 5 minutes, the strawberries will begin to release their juices. Keep cooking until a sauce-like consistency emerges with chunks of fruit still within. Turn off the heat and then add 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of a sweetener of your choice (like Stevia, syrup, or honey) for a healthy and tasty snack. [9] X Research source"
