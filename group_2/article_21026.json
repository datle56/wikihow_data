But if you want the inside track on sending the perfect ‘good morning’ text, we’ve got just the thing! Here's some of Jbara's expert advice on the best texts to flatter, uplift, or brighten the day of your bf or husband: Make him feel strong and masculine: If you want to make a guy feel handsome over text, you should “make him feel masculine,” says Jbara. Say things like “you’re so strong” or “I feel so protected by you.” Compliment him on something besides his looks: “Everyone likes to be complimented on their looks,” Jbara points out. “But when you compliment somebody on their looks consistently and they’re used to getting those compliments, it’s not special anymore. Instead, compliment them on how smart, exciting, or adventurous they are.” Express admiration for the things he does: “The most attractive thing a girl can do is actually stroke our egos, as crazy as that sounds,” explains Jbara. “Things like, for instance, ‘I love how many sports you play,’ ‘I like how smart you are,’ ‘I love the fact that you’re able to take initiative.’”"
