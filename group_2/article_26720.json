      "title": "Check the tire condition regularly.",
      "content": "Check the tire condition regularly. You should change the tires when you notice a change in the way the bike handles, as specified by local legislation, or at the very latest when the tread is worn down to the wear bars. Under-inflated tires will overheat and may fail. Over-inflated tires will give less than optimal grip. [1] X Research source Ideally, check tire pressure before and after every journey. Commit to a weekly checking routine. Replace the tires if there is rapid pressure loss. Replace when there is about 1.59mm (2/32” or 0.063 inches) tread remaining all around the tire. Don’t wait till tires go bald. Always change tires in sets. Both tires go through the same stresses and rigors of road riding."

      "title": "Check and top up or replace engine oil.",
      "content": "Check and top up or replace engine oil. [2] X Research source It lubricates your gears and engines; not changing the engine oil will cause damage to the engine. The owner's manual will specify how frequently the oil should be changed and this schedule should be followed. Check for any possible oil leakages. Carbon deposits thicken the oil, creating a drag in the movement of engine. Avoid running your bike on dirty oil. It will increase the consumption of fuel and drastically reduce the engine life."

      "title": "Always keep the air filter clean.",
      "content": "Always keep the air filter clean. [3] X Research source A clean air filter helps your engine breathe, which directly impacts its performance and can contribute to a longer engine life. Always change the air filter at recommended intervals; increase the cleaning frequency in particularly dusty conditions."

      "title": "Adjust the clutch correctly as needed.",
      "content": "Adjust the clutch correctly as needed. [4] X Research source It should have the right amount of free play. Don’t tighten your clutch too much – an over-tightened clutch may cause it to slip without your noticing. It also leads to increase in fuel consumption. Make sure you have the right clutch adjustments in place."

      "title": "Service your engine regularly.",
      "content": "Service your engine regularly. Tune it up to keep the engine running like clockwork and reduce your fuel consumption. Clean the carburetor and maintain valve clearances. Clean out the carburetor, for every 1500 kilometers (900 miles) you travel. [5] X Research source Clean the spark plugs and check the gap every 750 kilometers (450 miles) for an old / antique two-stroke motorbike and every 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) for a four-stroke bike. Spark plugs should be changed as specified in the owner's manual (or if a problem is suspected). It is critically important to use the correct spark plug grade and type. [6] X Research source Keep the choke clean and have it replaced immediately if it is damaged."

      "title": "Maintain the transmission system.",
      "content": "Maintain the transmission system. If your bike chain is not lubricated, it may be damaged due to excess heat, and will wear out. This cumulative wear on all the separate links makes the chain loose, and more likely to fall off the sprockets. This can be very dangerous. [7] X Research source Provide regular lubrication, as well as cleaning and adjustment. Use paraffin to wash the chain. Use a piece of cloth and a soft brush to remove the dirt in the chain. Never use water to clean the chains, as that could rust the chain links. Wipe the chain with a clean dry cloth, once the dirt has been cleaned completely. Use your old engine oil to lubricate the chain links and the chain. Ensure that your bike’s chain has the proper tension and free play. Any variation will not power the rear wheel smoothly."

      "title": "Clean the bike regularly.",
      "content": "Clean the bike regularly. Keeping it clean of dirt (and salt in winter) will not only make it look nice but will help with maintenance, too. [8] X Research source It also makes it easier to notice missing or loose bolts and nuts. Cover the ignition switch unit, ignition coil and silencer using plastic sheets, before you start cleaning the motorcycle. Use a microfiber cloth to clean your bike. Avoid exposing your bike to direct sunlight; try to park your bike in the shade."

      "content": "Maintain your bike's battery . Do periodic maintenance to ensure a long and trouble-free battery life. [9] X Research source Top up the battery with distilled water, whenever required. Examine for any leakages from the battery. Keep the battery fully charged if the motorcycle is not used for long time."

      "title": "Maintain your brakes.",
      "content": "Maintain your brakes. Keep both the brakes holding the tire properly spaced. Brakes becoming too tight, or too loose, can be very dangerous. Tighten the brakes as per your personal style and requirement. Replace the bike’s brake pads in the front if screeching sound persists; this could also be because of a lack of oil. Replace all the front and rear brake oil with recommended (DOT 3 / 4 / 5) specification."

      "title": "Check the fork and fork oil.",
      "content": "Check the fork and fork oil. [10] X Research source Change your bike’s fork oil, for once in every 12000 kilometers. Check forks and spring for rust or damage. Adjust your fork according to your preferences and comfort."

      "title": "Check the sprockets.",
      "content": "Check the sprockets. Replace them when necessary. [11] X Research source The usual wear-out limit for sprockets is 40,000 kilometers (25,000 miles). Change both the driving and driven sprockets, and the chain, at the same time. It's not recommended to change only one part."

      "content": "Check some basics on your bike every day, or every time you read. To perform this kind of regular check/maintenance, you should: Check the fuel level every day to confirm you're not leaking any fuel. Check all your fluid levels - oil, brake fluid and coolant, if applicable. Check the throttle cable play. Confirm smooth operation and that it returns properly to the closed position. Check steering lock and lever notches for any uneven feel or interference with the operation of any cables at full lock. Check brake pedal play, as specified in your motorcycle's manual. Confirm the wear lining indicator is within usable range. Check drive chain slack, as specified in your manual. Check your lights and horn. Check the clutch lever play. Ensure smooth steering movement. Make sure there are no restrictions. Ensure both bike stands return to their fully upright position. Check the correct inflation pressure in both tires. Make sure you have adequate tire tread depth and no cracks or splits. Adjust the rear viewing span of mirror if needed. Ensure kill switch functionality. Check brake hoses for chafing or leakage."

      "content": "Do weekly maintenance. Take care of these checks weekly or every 200 miles, whichever is sooner. Check oil level - does it require topping-up? Top up if so. Check your tire pressure with an accurate gauge. Check the battery. If it's not maintenance-free, then check the electrolyte level and top up with distilled water if necessary. Check the control cables. Lubricate as necessary Check the brakes. Pads and disks should be checked for wear and replaced if necessary. Check and top-up your fluids.
