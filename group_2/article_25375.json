      "content": "Take note of abdominal pain. Patients with gastritis often experience \"epigastric pain,\" or pain in the upper central abdomen. It can be described as a burning, gnawing, or deep boring pain. You may find that it wakes you up in the middle of the night, but it can often be relieved by eating something or taking an antacid."

[5] X Research source You should contact a doctor immediately if you see blood or green bile in your vomit. Excessive vomiting can often lead to dehydration, which can also be dangerous.

      "content": "Be aware of a change in appetite. [7] X Research source People with gastritis often find that they've lost their appetite. You may lose it altogether or simply find that you feel full after a smaller amount of food than usual. Take notice if your clothes feel unusually loose without any explanation. If you're losing weight without purposely dieting, you may be eating less. If your appetite decreases significantly, you may eat little enough to be considered anorexic. See a doctor if you feel woozy or dizzy from a lack of nutrition or fluids."

Heartburn is the result of stomach acid getting up into the esophagus where it doesn't belong. This is often the result of a loose gastroesophageal sphincter. If you overeat, you can apply too much pressure on this sphincter, forcing your stomach contents up past it. [18] X Research source Gelhott, A MD PharmD,Gastroeseophageal Reflux Disease: Diagnosis and Management, American Family Physician 1999 1; 59 (5) 1161-1169) Heartburn can also be caused by simple gravity. When you lie down right after a meal, you encourage stomach fluid to flow up into the esophagus. The first line of treatment for heartburn is with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). The doctor may prescribe Lansoprazole or Omeprazole. The second line of treatment is with H-2 blockers like Pepcid or Zantac."
