      "title": "Ask them if there’s anything they want or need.",
      "content": "Ask them if there’s anything they want or need. A direct approach is the only surefire way to know what that is. Certified life coach Kirin Dejonckheere explains that it’s important for adults to celebrate who they are on their birthday, so you should really focus on what makes them happy. It can be difficult to get inside someone else’s head to know what they want. The quickest way is to just ask! Some people might worry that asking someone what they want means it isn’t a surprise. While that may be true, giving a bad or unwanted gift can be disappointing for you both. Ratson advises that the goal is to make the other person feel unique and special. You don’t have to surprise them to do that!"

      "content": "Find out what they like to do and give a gift to match. According to Ratson, the best way to celebrate someone’s birthday is to do something they love. Giving someone an experiential gift, like going to a concert or amusement park, helps foster a stronger relationship than a material gift. “You could buy them some things that they would really appreciate, but I think more intentional, thoughtful personal things that you can do together would be more meaningful,” Jeney adds. Dejonckheere recommends creating a real experience or doing something new that you can do together to celebrate your bond, like a cooking class or skydiving."

When you choose a birthday gift , remember that many families have unique customs when it comes to choosing and exchanging gifts. [5] X Research source For example, one family might give very practical gifts that someone needs, like a suitcase to allow the recipient to travel more. Others give prank gifts, like socks with pictures of their cats on them."
