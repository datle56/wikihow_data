If you're a parent who is concerned about your child spending too much time on Snapchat, it's a good idea to keep tabs on their Snapscore. Snapscores can indicate the following: Activity Levels : If the Snapscore is high, this indicates your child sends, receives, and/or posts a lot of Snaps. This can be potentially harmful if you want your child to explore other activities that don't involve social media. Communication with peers : While Snapchat is a way to keep in contact with friends, this can lead to trouble if your child is grounded or is communicating with people you're unfamiliar with. Screen time : Excessive use of Snapchat can lead to issues in other areas of your child's life, such as poor sleep habits, screen addiction, and more. Privacy : A high Snapscore shows a lot of engagement and activity from your child. Unmonitored activity can pose a risk for your child. If you're concerned with your child's Snapscore, you can use this opportunity to speak to your child about online safety and set boundaries where you can monitor their activity while still allowing them freedom."
