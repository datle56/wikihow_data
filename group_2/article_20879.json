If you touch base with your feelings and find that you're a wholehearted \"Yes!!\" on this guy, then feel free to accept his offer. If you're lukewarm about him, but you feel bad saying no, consider whether it will be easier to reject him now or later. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find out what he expects from you. Some guys will ask you out on a first date to a park, a dance, or the movies just to spend time with you and get to know you better. [2] X Research source Especially if you're in elementary school, middle school, or high school, guys might ask you to be their girlfriend without arranging a \"date\". This could mean that he wants to eat lunch together, or walk home together, or hold hands, or more. Some guys might just ask you to be their date to a dance or another event. Don't be afraid to ask him what he means. If you like him, but he isn't clear about what he wants from you, it is completely your place to inquire further. If he says something as vague as, \"Will you go out with me?\", you can say, \"Sure! What did you have in mind?\" If it's a group event, make sure that he is inviting you explicitly as his \"date\". If he invites you along with him and his friends, it probably means that he likes you, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he's asking you to be his girlfriend yet. It might be a way for him to get to know you better, or to gauge whether you like him back before he makes a big move."

      "content": "Say yes. Your exact response depends on his question. Think about what exactly he is asking you to do, and accept his request if you feel comfortable with it. You can say something like: \"Yes, I'd love to.\" \"Definitely, that sounds great!\" \"Yes, it's a date!\" \"Of course I would.\" \"Sure, what do you want to do?\" \"That sounds fun!\""

      "content": "Get the details. If the guy asks you out on a first date, make sure that you get the time and place. Figure out whether he is going to pick you up, or whether he plans to meet you there. Find out if it's a group event or just the two of you. Make sure that you're available on that day, at that time, and that you don't have any prior plans. You don't need to get the details before you say yes. The point isn't the event – it's that this guy wants to spend time with you. If you want to spend time with him, simply agree to go to the event, and work out the details later. Don't be afraid to reschedule if you have a conflict. If you really want to show him that you're interested, offer an alternative. Say, \"I'd love to go to the movie with you, but I'm going to a friend's birthday party on Friday night. Could we go on Saturday instead?\" Reader Poll: We asked 139 wikiHow readers how late a date has to be to give them a bad first impression, and 51% of them said they’d be okay with 5 to 10 minutes of lateness.

      "content": "Explain your reasons for saying no. Be honest . You don't need to over-justify your decision; it is enough if you simply aren't attracted to this guy. You may be attracted to the guy, but you can't accept his offer for some reason – maybe your friend likes him, or your parents won't let you date, or you don't feel that you're ready for a relationship. No matter the situation, it's important that you are honest with this guy and with yourself. [3] X Research source If you aren't attracted to the guy, that's all you need to say. Don't be mean about it, and don't insult him. Say, \"I like our friendship, but I'm not attracted to you in that way.\" If your friend likes him, do not spill the secret – unless your friend says that it's okay. Just tell the guy that you aren't interested, and don't hint that there is any other reason behind your choice. If your parents won't let you date , feel free to be honest with the guy. Be careful, however, about leading him on or giving him hope. If you tell him that you have a huge crush on him, but that you can't date him, you may not stop his advances. If you don't feel that you're ready for a relationship , that's okay. You will find someone in your own time, and it will be so much better if your entire heart is in it. This guy might be the first one to ask you out, but he won't be the last. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Be clear and straightforward. Don't make excuses, and don't agree to go on a date just to be nice. No doubt, he'd prefer a \"yes\" over a \"no\" – but odds are that he'd rather deal with an immediate rejection than force you to go on a pity-date."

Say something simple like, \"I'm sorry, but I don't like you in that way.\" You don't need to explain in great detail why you aren't interested; you just need to get the main idea across. Try not to humiliate him with a long, drawn-out speech. If he asks for specific reasons, feel free to explain why you aren't interested. Make sure that you don't let it become a debate, and don't let him talk you into going out with him. Be firm and clear. Do not compromise. If you are friends with the guy, you can cite this as a reason. Say, \"I love our friendship, but I'm not romantically attracted to you. Can we keep our friendship how it is?\""

Make sure that you give him some sort of answer, even if you just explain why you can't give him a more definite answer yet. It takes courage to ask out someone that you really like, and the least you can do is acknowledge that you're thinking about it. This is especially important if he asks you out via text, email, or instant messaging: if you don't reply, he will have nothing to do but speculate!
