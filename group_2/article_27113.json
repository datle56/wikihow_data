      "content": "Get a CO 2 container, work in a ventilated area, and wear safety gear. You can make dry ice using carbon dioxide. However, carbon dioxide vapor can be harmful if you breathe too much in, so it’s best to do this somewhere with plenty of fresh air—like outdoors or in an open garage. To protect yourself from frostbite burns, put on leather or cryogenic gloves , protective eyewear, long sleeves and thick pants, and closed-toe shoes.

      "title": "Wrap a cloth bag or pillowcase tightly around the CO2 nozzle.",
      "content": "Wrap a cloth bag or pillowcase tightly around the CO 2 nozzle. If you’re using a fire extinguisher, put the nozzle horn inside the canvas bag or pillowcase. If you’re using a carbon dioxide canister, attach a horn or nozzle to the canister and wrap the bag around that. Gather the pillowcase material and hold it so it’s wrapped tightly around the hose behind the horn. You don't want any gas to be able to escape from the opening. [2] X Research source Wrap duct tape around the mouth of the bag to make a tight seal if you're worried about the pillowcase flying off. The amount of pressure in the extinguisher shouldn't make it hard to hold on, but extra precaution never hurts. If you plan on making dry ice often, you may want to invest in a dry ice maker attachment, which is essentially a horn nozzle with a fabric bag over the end that can be fastened and removed."

      "title": "Squeeze the extinguisher trigger or open the canister nozzle.",
      "content": "Squeeze the extinguisher trigger or open the canister nozzle. If you’re using a fire extinguisher, remove the safety pin, then squeeze the handle. If you’re using a CO 2 canister, turn the knob on the top of the canister to open the valve. Fill the bag with CO 2 gas for about 5–10 seconds. Carbon dioxide vapor will seep out of the pillowcase—this is normal and safe as long as you're in a well-ventilated area as recommended. [3] X Research source You may not think ice is being produced, but it should quickly start to gather up at the bottom."

      "title": "Remove the pillowcase and open it to see the dry ice.",
      "content": "Remove the pillowcase and open it to see the dry ice. Carefully take the horn out of the pillowcase (you’ll need to unwrap the tape if you used it). Keep the fabric tight against the horn to wipe off any ice sticking to it. You should find a small pile of dry ice at the bottom of the pillowcase—it will be a crumbly white material resembling styrofoam. [4] X Research source Try to keep the bag upright so the dry ice doesn’t spill. Avoid handling the dry ice for more than a few seconds—even if you’re wearing gloves, the dry ice can damage your skin if you hold it for long."

      "title": "Transfer the ice into a sturdy plastic container.",
      "content": "Transfer the ice into a sturdy plastic container. Turn the bag inside out and shake any dry ice into your holding container. Thick plastic coolers or Styrofoam and ice chests are best for storing dry ice since they’re designed to withstand cold, but you can also use a thermos as long as you don’t seal it. Keep the dry ice in a single pile and keep the chunks as big as possible to make it last as long as possible. [5] X Research source Do not seal the container. If you put an airtight lid on, the pressure of the CO 2 gas will build up, causing the lid to pop off or the container to explode. If you do use a lid on the container, leave it propped open. Do not store dry ice in glass, porcelain, ceramic, or metal containers—the cold can cause glass to crack or shatter, and metal containers may warp. Once your dry ice is in a container, store that container somewhere cool, dry, and safe, and well-ventilated. Do not place it in a freezer. Be sure it’s placed somewhere that children and pets can't get to it. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "CO2 fire extinguisher",
      "content": "CO 2 fire extinguisher You specifically need a CO 2 fire extinguisher for this method, not an ordinary home extinguisher. Most home extinguishers use fine powders of a chemical like sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, which won't supply the CO 2 needed to produce dry ice. [7] X Research source CO 2 fire extinguishers are usually used for laboratories, kitchens, and around mechanical equipment. [8] X Research source They usually have a black plastic horn on the nozzle and have no pressure gauge. You can find CO 2 extinguishers at some hardware stores and online specialty retailers."

      "content": "CO 2 canister Rent or buy a commercial tank of pressurized CO 2 , which are sold at welding supply stores and online. Just make sure that it has something called a dip tube, which is sold separately. [9] X Research source Often, dip tube-equipped tanks are marked with two white stripes, while tanks without dip tubes have a black finish. [10] X Research source A dip tube will draw liquid carbon dioxide from the bottom of the tank, which is what you want for making dry ice. Tanks without a dip tube will draw gas carbon dioxide from the top of the tank, which won't make dry ice."

      "title": "Make your own fog.",
      "content": "Make your own fog. One of the most common uses of dry ice is to create artificial smoke or fog. This is as simple as mixing dry ice and water—splashing a bit of water onto the ice creates a hissing noise and produces lots of carbon dioxide gas. This is handy for dances, rock concerts, haunted houses, and other places where you might want to create an eerie, mysterious atmosphere. [11] X Research source If you use a container with a small vent hole, you can produce a geyser-like contraption where fog shoots out in a narrow jet. This can even be powerful enough to power a small motor or turn a pinwheel. Only make carbon dioxide gas outdoors and in well-ventilated areas. Producing lots of carbon dioxide gas in an area with poor ventilation can eventually force the oxygen out, making it impossible to breathe."

      "content": "Use dry ice to carbonate liquids. Another frequent use of carbon dioxide is to make carbonated beverages like soda, beer, sparkling wine, and sparkling water). Putting dry ice in water causes it to release carbon dioxide into the water which eventually gathers in the small bubbles that are the mark of any carbonated drink. [12] X Research source Do not drink your beverage while there is dry ice in it. Wait for the dry ice to bubble away completely before drinking. Swallowing dry ice can cause major internal damage. Some people don't like the taste of dry ice-carbonated beverages. You may want to sample the process with a small amount of your liquid before trying it with the main batch."

      "title": "Use dry ice to keep food and beverages frozen.",
      "content": "Use dry ice to keep food and beverages frozen. Dry ice is much, much colder than regular ice, so it can obviously keep food and drinks much, much colder. This makes it a great way to keep foods frozen—like if you’re shipping frozen foods . You can also put dry ice in an ice chest to help keep your food cold—add a layer of cardboard between the dry ice and the food to keep it from freezing. [13] X Research source To use dry ice in an ice chest , add your cold foods to the ice chest first, then place the dry ice on top and loosely shut the lid (do not seal it completely or it could explode). Cold air sinks, so putting the dry ice on top keeps the chest frozen more efficiently. If there is any leftover space, fill it with wadded-up newspaper (extra air will make dry ice sublimate faster). Dry ice also works well for keeping normal ice frozen in a cooler. Typically, you will want about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9.1 kg) of dry ice for every 24-hour period you need to keep your food items frozen (depending upon the size of the ice chest.)"

      "title": "Use dry ice to store loose food.",
      "content": "Use dry ice to store loose food. Surprisingly, dry ice can be used to keep foods like grains, beans, lentils, and pastas fresh. To do this, first place the dry ice at the bottom of a cooler. Make sure there isn't any frost on the dry ice, as this can introduce moisture and get your food wet. Pour your food products over the dry ice. Let this sit with the lid loosely on (but not sealed or it could explode) for about 5-6 hours—the ice needs to completely sublimate, so wait until there is no solid ice left before you seal the lid. [14] X Research source As the ice sublimates, it forms CO 2 gas, which is heavier than air. As more gas forms, it forces the air out of the container. Without any air in the container, it is very difficult for bacteria or pests to survive, which greatly extends the food's life. For this method, you will want to use about 1 ⁄ 4 lb (0.11 kg) of dry ice per 5 gallons (19 L) container."

      "title": "Use dry ice to shrink solid materials.",
      "content": "Use dry ice to shrink solid materials. As mentioned above, dry ice is so cold that it will actually cause materials like metal and ceramic to shrink slightly when it touches them. [15] X Research source In certain situations, this property can actually be used to your advantage. Fixing car dents: If you have a small \"ding\" on your car's exterior that looks like the metal has been pushed inward, dry ice may be able to help. Use heavy gloves to press a block or sheet of dried ice against the dent. If you can, press it against the inside of the dent as well. Hold the ice in place until frost forms a few inches around the dent, then remove the ice and let the material warm again. Repeat as needed until the dent smooths. Removing floor tiles: This trick is great for removing one or two ceramic tiles from your floor. Place a flat sheet of dry ice centered on the floor tile so that it touches its entire surface. Wait until the entire tile is frosted over. If the tile does not pop out by itself, use a few taps from a hammer and screwdriver to loosen the adhesive along the edges."

      "title": "How long will dry ice last?",
      "content": "How long will dry ice last? Dry ice sublimates (evaporates) at a rate of 5–10 lb (2.3–4.5 kg) a day. You’ll be making far less than 5 lb (2.3 kg) from a fire extinguisher or CO 2 canister. With this project, unfortunately, the dry ice will probably only last a couple of hours if it’s stored properly. [16] X Research source The safest way to dispose of your dry ice is to let it sublimate on its own. Do not pour dry ice into a sink, toilet, or trash can."

      "title": "How do I make a block of dry ice?",
      "content": "How do I make a block of dry ice? You’ll need a dry ice machine. Dry ice blocks can be made from compressed CO 2 , but you’ll need something to hold the ice and press it into a block shape. Dry ice makers are available to the public, but they cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars—typically not a practical purchase unless you’re using the dry ice for business purposes. These machines are typically made of a hose that attaches to a CO 2 canister, plus a box or mold to contain the dry ice and form it into a block. You have to obtain the CO 2 separately."
