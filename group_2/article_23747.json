If you struggle with fully emptying your bladder when you go, try peeing again immediately after you finish. It’s common for your bladder to send incomplete signals when your bladder isn’t completely empty, so give your body a second shot at emptying your bladder.

      "content": "Stop pushing when you urinate. Let your bladder do its thing naturally without straining. If your bladder is healthy, you should not need to strain any muscles to urinate. Some people will push a bit to make sure that they’ve fully emptied their bladder, but this can accidentally train your body to need that straining feeling to urinate. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you do have to push or strain when you urinate in order to fully empty your bladder, see your doctor. If you’re male, this is a symptom of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), a benign condition that causes an enlarged prostate. While not dangerous, it does require treatment."

Women and men alike can benefit from doing Kegel exercises, which strengthen the pelvic floor and improve continence and urinary flow. You can do Kegels anywhere, simply follow these instructions: [4] X Expert Source Robert Dhir, MD Board Certified Urologist & Urological Surgeon Expert Interview. 12 October 2020. While urinating, squeeze the muscles that stop your flow midstream – those are the muscles you want to isolate. You can do the exercise in any position. Tighten those muscles, hold for 5 seconds, then relax. Repeat this several times in a row. Gradually work up to holding the contraction for 10 seconds, then resting for 10 seconds. Try to do three sets of ten repetitions every day. Don’t squeeze other muscles like your abs, legs, or butt. Focus on flexing only your pelvic floor muscles."

      "content": "Avoid antihistamines and decongestants. Cold medication can trigger urinary retention. Antihistamines (like Benadryl or Zyrtec) and decongestants (like Mucinex or Dayquil) can minimize your bladder muscle’s ability to contract and tighten. If you’ve been taking a ton of cold medication and you’re struggling to empty your bladder, switching to a medication that doesn’t contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine.

A daily cup of coffee and a daily beer are no big deal, but overdoing it can toy with your body’s ability to get rid of waste. This is especially important if you have problems with emptying your bladder at night, since alcohol can mess with the quality of your sleep and caffeine can keep you awake.

Caffeine is also a diuretic, which means it makes you urinate more often."

You might be frustrated with your low urine flow and want to avoid urinating as much as possible, but not drinking enough water can make matters worse. Drink water throughout the day and avoid drinking it late in the evening so you won’t have to get up as much during the night.

      "title": "Get regular prostate exams if you’re over 50.",
      "content": "Get regular prostate exams if you’re over 50. In men, weak urinary flow is often due to an enlarged prostrate. The prostate is a gland in men that sits low in the abdomen, and when it gets enlarged it squeezes the urethra. This causes slow flow, difficulty urinating, dribbling, and a weak stream. It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 50. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. If you have urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH.
