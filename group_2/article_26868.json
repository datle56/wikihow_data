      "content": "Cut 6 strands of cord, 2 in each color. Choose 3 colors for your bracelet, such as pink, purple, and magenta. Cut 2 strands of each color, making sure that they are all the same length. The strands should be about 19 inches (48 cm)long. [1] X Research source For best results, use 1.4-milimeter Chinese knotting cord. Rattail cord will also work well. Embroidery thread or embroidery floss are not recommended because they are too thin."

      "title": "Knot the strands together, then tape them to your desk.",
      "content": "Knot the strands together, then tape them to your desk. Gather all of your strands together, making sure that the ends are aligned. Measure down 5 inches (13 cm) from the top of your gathered strands. Next, treating the strands as a single rope, tie them into an overhand knot . [2] X Research source An overhand knot is where you wrap the rope into a loop, then push the end through the loop. Make sure that the knot is below the tape. There is enough length in the tails to prevent the braid from sliding out. You can also secure them together with a clip or with a tie."

      "title": "Separate the strands based on color.",
      "content": "Separate the strands based on color. Divide the strands into 3 groups, keeping the colors together. For example, if your color scheme was pink, purple, and magenta, you'll have 2 pink strands on the left, 2 purple strands in the middle, and 2 magenta strands on the right. [3] X Research source You will be creating a basic 3-strand braid. Treat the 2 strands of each color as a single strand."

Keep them together and make sure that they aren't twisted. [5] X Research source As you bring an outer string over into the middle, alternating sides, it’s best to stop every few steps to detangle any length of string to make sure the piece you are working on is not getting messed up."

If you are an experienced braider, however, you can use fewer colors. The strands need to be 2 to 3 times your wrist circumference. [8] X Research source If you want a wider bracelet, cut 2 strands of each color. Treat the pairs as a single strand for the rest of the tutorial. 1.4-milimeter Chinese knotting cord will work the best, but rattail cord may also work. Alternatively, you can use embroidery thread instead. It is not the same thing as embroidery floss. Instead of being made up of separate strands, it is twisted like a thin rope.

For a vintage look, use 1 velvet ribbon, a thin chain, and lace trim. For a bohemian look, cut 2 different types of fabric into 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) wide strips.
