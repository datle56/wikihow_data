Some will require a cast of thousands, cutting-edge CGI, and Peter Jackson at the helm. If you have the budget, there's no limit to what you can do, but it's up to you to decide which of the artists' ideas to incorporate in to your video. Have a realistic outlook - know which ideas are feasible, which are unfeasible, and which are just plain bad. If you happen to be a member of the band whose music you're using, you're in a position with unique benefits and challenges. You'll have firsthand, personal access to the band's creative process. On the other hand, music video making can be stressful. Your personal and creative relationships might be taxed - beware."

It can be very useful during this process to consult with members of your technical staff - they'll know what's easy to film and what's not so easy. Music video ideas can be straightforward without being ineffective. For instance, an idea for a country song about meeting people on the road like \"following a man driving down the highway, meeting people in small town grocery stores and gas stations along the way in situation reflecting lyrics\" can work great if well-executed. Adding small, specific details can make your video memorable or even iconic. The following notes have much more personality than the somewhat vague description above: \"Main character driving a '57 Chevy convertible on long, straight stretch of highway out west; farmer at roadside grocery in verse 1, soldier in Hummer at gas station during verse two, pretty girl in verse 3 (star cameo?) hops in car and rides away with our hero as song plays out. Comedic side-story: huffy business suit embarrassing himself in each scene: squirts mustard on shirt in v1, bumps into hummer with his Porsche or pours gas on expensive shoes at gas station in v2; clumsily putting moves on girl in v3.\" Odd, abstract ideas for music videos can make for great videos. Footage doesn't necessarily have to closely reflect the lyrics - having a contrast between the visual and lyrical content can make for a striking contrast. Some videos are even bizarre or nonsensical. [3] X Research source Don't be afraid to confuse or shock viewers if you think it's the best choice for your video. It's a great way to fight The Man."

Our How to Be a Location Scout guide has tips for amateur scouts. Talk to the owners or management of any location you want to use. Make sure they are OK with your shooting. If you're lucky, they may also be a perfect fit for a character in your video (if they're willing.) It's also a good idea to notify neighbors about your shoot beforehand. If you don't, they may be confused or distressed by your shoot. Know local noise ordinances beforehand so you'll be prepared if they complain to the police."

One of the most effective video-planning tools at your disposal is a storyboard. Storyboards are shot-by-shot sketches of a video that are consulted to direct the video's action. See How to Create a Storyboard for detailed storyboarding advice. Music videos often employ special cinematic choices [5] X Research source or visual effects [6] X Research source to create a unique experience. If you plan to incorporate either into your video, be sure to incorporate them into your storyboard. Storyboards don't have to be flashy. They can be as simple as the position of actors and props in each scene, or they can be as detailed as individual cutaways, expressions, direction of movement, etc. If you can't even draw a straight line, don't worry: make a text storyboard. As long as you have an idea of what is going to happen in each shot, and you can communicate that to your crew, you'll be good to go. Look to break your video into \"scenes\" that match your vision. You can minimize shooting time if you shoot all the footage in a certain location at once (even if it's out of the order it will appear in as a finished video.) Plan your shooting so that you travel as efficiently as possible."

      "title": "Find your crew.",
      "content": "Find your crew. Depending on the scale of your production, you may be able to rely solely on yourself and your actors, or you may need to create large a crew for the video. If you need to hire actors, look for people who are great at conveying emotion and feelings nonverbally. [7] X Expert Source Travis Page Video Content Specialist Expert Interview. 27 June 2019. Here are some positions you might consider filling based on what work you'll need done: Director: This will most likely be you. You'll be managing all the different parts of the shoot, from sharing your vision to the cast and crew, to mediating disputes between lighting and sound, to making sure there's gas in the car and that all your locations are cleared for shooting. You're the boss, but you're also responsible for more than anyone else. Videographer: The videographer will be in charge of capturing the action on one or more cameras. You'll define the shot, but she will actually frame the scene, work with the gaffer to ensure the set is properly lit, and let the sound guy know when the boom is in the scene. Gaffer: Somebody needs to make sure all the lights are lit, the actors are visible, and everything is right for the shoot. That person is the gaffer. Sound man: On a movie set, he's the guy sticking mics in everybody's faces. For a video, which often doesn't feature dialog, he'll be the guy cuing up the song so the actors have something to work with. In between pressing \"Stop\" and \"Play\" and \"Rewind,\" he'll be running to get Cokes, pizza, and other sundries. Grip: This is the lucky soul who gets to move all the wires, all the lights, all the gear, seating, tables, props, and everything else that is brought on set. It's a lot easier to run a shoot when you have somebody to handle those things while you handle the bigger-picture items. Wardrobe: Depending on the budget, you may simply provide direction to the talent (\"wear jeans and a tight shirt,\") or have costumes made to order for the actors. Whichever way you do it, if there are costume changes involved, make sure somebody can coordinate that between scenes, and that your actors have a bit of privacy for changing. Props: Again, this might be you, but somebody has to find the vehicles used, plus things actors on the set use—mustard bottles that squirt reliably on cue, anything an actor picks up or puts down, or is not part of the location. Continuity: Unless you are going to shoot from start to finish in one take, there will be need for somebody to make sure that where people start is where they stopped previously. That is what continuity does. They make note of positions, usually with the aid of a camera. They make sure the mustard stain on the suit in the first scene it still there 3 days later for the last scene's shoot. (Or, conversely, that the mustard stain is *not* there if shots prior to the staining are done later.) Dancers: This part is unnecessary, but if you are a great dancer you can hire back-up dancers. Choreographer: If you do want dancers and it's in your budget, get a choreographer. They will make sure the dancing is smooth and coordinated."

      "content": "Find the right acting talent. Make a list of all the characters in your video. Your video may or may not include footage of the band performing - if it does, you'll be directing their acting, too. If your video tells a story, write down any characters, making notes about what they look like and how they behave. Hold auditions and choose the talent best-suited for each character. For our hypothetical country music video, we would look for actors to play these parts: The Traveler- He doesn't need to speak, but will need to look cool, confident, and like he belongs driving down a country road in a vintage convertible. Jeans. Shades. Shirt? The Farmer-Older, weathered from the sun. Old hat, jeans and untucked shirt, friendly smile. Brief camera time, so he doesn't need to be a pro. The Soldier- Young, tall, muscular, buzzcut, stronger and more confident than the hero, but also more humble. The Gas Station Attendant- Scrawny? Plump? Greasy mechanic shirt, friendly with a bemused outlook, good at rolling his eyes. The Suit- Metro, almost handsome but not quite. Slicked hair that is un-slicking in heat. Expensive looking wardrobe, car. Socially and physically awkward, has condescending sneer. Unlikeable on first sight. The Girl- Strong, independent woman. Confident with her body and therefore beautiful. Brunette. Confident, carefree, tanned, good sense of humour and constant half amused grin. Never upset by The Suit, only amused. Casually objectifies The Traveler."

Here, The Suit trips all over himself, the Traveler helps him up, and the Pretty Girl hops in the car with the Traveler. Put the vehicles and anything else that's in the scene into position, and have the actors stand on their marks. Set your lighting. Lighting can make a big difference in the overall mood of your video. [8] X Expert Source Travis Page Video Content Specialist Expert Interview. 27 June 2019. As this is an outdoor shoot, if you don't have powered lights you might be able to use a reflector , which is a large piece of white fabric or poster board that reflects the sunlight, softening shadows and brightening a scene. For the most effective way to focus light, use more than one reflector, or even a mirror. Your gaffer will manage this, under your direction, if you have one. Remember, the main person on screen is always the brightest on screen. When outside, always have the main character's back to the sun except when the sun is in the middle of the sky. This way, the reflectors can illuminate the person's face and front. Although there is a lot to do to get efficient lighting, it is worth it when you want a high quality video."

Make minor adjustments to each cut so that everything happens when it should — which will be especially noticeable when you're working with shots of the band playing the song. If using footage of the band performing, be prepared to cover mistakes. For example, if the guitarist was miming \"Stairway to Heaven\" on the video during a passage where he's simply holding a single note on the recording, cut to another band member, or back to a different scene during that moment. Use moderation when editing. Tons of short, choppy cuts can be disorienting, while takes that go on go long can start to look fake. It's usually obvious when a cut looks bad - take your time and use your best judgement."

[11] X Research source This stylistic choice perfectly matches the song's whimsical, smitten tone and makes for an unforgettable visual style. The video for The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army\" (made by directing duo Alex and Martin) employs visual trickery to give the illusion of one four minute long continuously-zooming shot.

[15] X Research source The parody serves two purposes - besides being just plain funny, it also suggests that early 1990s California is a lawless, do-or-die playground where only the strongest survive, similar to the post-apocalyptic wasteland depicted in the Mad Max films. An even funnier parody music video is the video for the Beastie Boys' \"Sabotage,\" directed by Spike Jonze.

[19] X Research source By making very subtle changes to the dancer's moves each time the shot repeats, we're able to see hints of a tragic romance unfolding. The gradualness of the change makes the final shot all the more shocking. OK GO's early videos used imaginative choreography to make instantly memorable viewing experiences on a minuscule budgets. Their video for \"Here it goes again\" (directed by Trish Sie and the band) is great example of a well-done video shot for almost nothing. [20] X Research source The video is done in one static shot in an undecorated room, the only props being eight treadmills. Because of the strength of the choreography and the memorability of the concept, the video was a big viral hit when it was released in 2006."
