      "title": "Plant the propagule.",
      "content": "Plant the propagule. Propagules have a few requirements to grow into a mangrove tree: It must be planted in dirt, grass blocks, coarse dirt, podzol, mycelium, rooted dirt, moss blocks, farmland, mud, muddy mangrove roots, or clay. You can plant a propagule in these blocks even if they're submerged underwater. It requires a light level of at least 9. There must be a 5x5 clear space to plant the propagule, and the tree requires at least 6 empty spaces above the propagule to grow. There must be at least one solid block in the 9x9x9 cube directly underneath the propagule and solid blocks to support the roots 11 or fewer blocks below the propagule in a 9x9 area. Note that mud doesn't count as a solid block."

      "content": "Replant the mangrove propagule if it doesn't grow. If the propagule doesn't appear to be growing after one in-game day (20 minutes in real time), replant it in a more suitable area. Note that once your mangrove does grow, any mud block in the way of its roots will be turned into a muddy mangrove roots block."
