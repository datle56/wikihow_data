You can see your own likes, but they won't be displayed on your profile, and you can't see other people's likes.

      "content": "OldTwitter plugin The OldTwitter browser plugin reverts X back to the 2015 Twitter layout, with an option to switch to the 2018 layout instead. While this won't make your likes public globally, you will be able to see the likes of other users. Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and other Chromium browser users can install OldTwitter directly from the Chrome Web Store . Firefox users must download the plugin from the OldTwitter GitHub and install it manually. To ensure the plugin isn't removed when you close out of Firefox, download and install the Firefox Developer Edition browser and follow these steps: Download the latest OldTwitter release from the GitHub Releases page .

      "content": "According to X, likes were made private in the interest of the site's users. The chief interest that X seems to be protecting is the privacy of its users, according to the Engineering on X account. [2] X Research source Private likes were previously only available to X Premium subscribers. Haofei Wang, the director of engineering at X, stated that \"public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior.\" [3] X Research source Wang said that public likes discourage users from liking edgier content because they're afraid of retaliation, trolls, or tarnishing their public image. Despite this, many X users were unhappy that likes became private. In response to X CEO Elon Musk's post about increased likes analytics following the switch, some users pointed out that many of these likes were from bots liking pornographic material or users farming for engagement.
