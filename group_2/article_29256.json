To make a jelly roll quilt, you will need: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source a jelly roll quilt strip roll (you can find one in any craft store) a sewing machine plenty of thread scissors a tape measure backing material batting for the inside of your quilt safety pins straight pins iron (optional)"

      "title": "Separate the jelly roll quilt strips.",
      "content": "Separate the jelly roll quilt strips. A jelly roll quilt is named for the pre-cut strips that you use to make the quilt. These strips are usually arranged by color and come wrapped up in a roll. You can sew the strips together in the order they are in, or you can go through the stack and separate the colors a bit more. [4] X Research source Separating the colors will result in a more random color pattern for your quilt. If you prefer a blocky color look, then do not separate the strips. Just sew in the order they are in. Unroll your strips and then divide the strips into piles of similar colors. Then, you can take one strip from each pile in a sequence as you sew the strips together."

      "title": "Begin sewing the jelly roll quilt strip ends together.",
      "content": "Begin sewing the jelly roll quilt strip ends together. Next, you will need to sew the ends of your strips together to start making the quilt top. Take two different color strips and sew the short ends together. Make sure that the right sides (print or color sides) of the material are facing each other. Then, take a third strip and sew the short end to the short end of the second strip. Then, take a fourth strip and sew the short end to the short end of the third strip. [5] X Research source Continue sewing the strips together in this fashion until you have connected all of the strips. When you are done, you will have one long, thin strip made up of all of your small jelly roll strips. Do not worry about trimming the strings in between strips as you sew. It will be quicker and easier if you trim these strings after you finish sewing."

    {
      "title": "Trim the strings between strip ends.",
      "content": "Trim the strings between strip ends. After you have finished connecting all of the strips, go back through and cut the threads between each of the strip ends. Cutting this thread will allow you to extend the long strip you have created to its full length. [6] X Research source Cut 18 inches off of the last strip. Cutting 18 inches off of your last strip will help to ensure that the seams are not side-by side when you sew your strips together. [7] X Research source Measure from the end of the strip and then use your scissors to trim off the last 18 inches of the end strip. Discard the piece that you cut off. [8] X Research source Fold and sew the two short ends together. Fold the right sides of your strip together so that the two short ends meet. Then, start sewing along the long edge of your strip. Sew about 1/4” from the edge. You will need to sew along the entire edge of the long strip. [9] X Research source Make sure that the long edges are lined up and even as you sew. You can tug the fabric now and then to ensure that it is taut. Cut the fabric at the fold. After you have sewed along the entire edge of the fabric and reach the other short end, you will need to cut along the fold on the short end. Cut just until you reach the seam that you have just sewn. Then, open up the fabric to its new width. [10] X Research source Continue to fold and sew the ends together. You will need to continue to fold the strip so that the two shortest ends meet, sew along the long edge, and cut along the fold until your quilt top has 32 rows and is about 50 inches wide. [11] X Research source Each time you sew an edge, it will be half as short as the last edge you sewed, so after the first couple of edges, the sewing will start to go more quickly. [12] X Research source Each time you fold and sew, you will be doubling the width of your quilt top. For example, you start with one row and then double to two rows, then four rows, then eight rows, then 16 rows, and, finally, to 32 rows."

Make sure that that the surface you use is flat, clean, and dry. Smooth out the quilt top. If the quilt top is bunching up then you can use some duct tape to secure it at the corners and ensure that it is fully extended."

      "content": "Measure the dimensions. Use your tape measure to find the dimensions of your quilt top. Your quilt’s width should be about 50 inches, but this may vary. Measure the width and length of your quilt top to be sure how much fabric your will need for the batting and inner facing fabric."

      "content": "Cut your batting and additional fabric. Once you have the measurements of your quilt top, you can measure and cut your batting fabric, inner facing fabric, and border fabric to match your quilt top’s dimensions. Cut the batting fabric and the inner facing fabric to the same dimensions as your quilt top. Cut two three-inch wide strips the same length as your quilt top and two three-inch long strips the same width as your quilt top. Your batting fabric will go inside of the quilt, directly behind the quilt top. Then, your inner facing fabric will be on the underside of your quilt, directly over the batting on the other side. Your border strips will go on the outer edges of your quilt."

Lay the batting fabric down on the wrong side of the quilt top. Then, cover the batting with the inner facing fabric for the underside of your quilt. If your inner facing fabric has a print, then make sure that the print is facing upwards."

      "title": "Pin the materials together.",
      "content": "Pin the materials together. It is a good idea to use safety pins rather than straight pins because you have to make sure that the materials stay put while you sew. If they shift while you are sewing then it can throw off the entire design. Pin through all three layers of your fabric. Start pinning in the center and move outwards. Make sure that you smooth out the fabric as you go. You can also place binder clips on the outer edges of the quilt to help keep the edges together."

      "title": "Begin sewing from the center out to the edge.",
      "content": "Begin sewing from the center out to the edge. Starting in the center will help to ensure that there are no lumps in the center of your quilt. Start in the center and sew in a straight line out to the edge of the quilt. Then, return to the center and sew out towards another edge. Smooth out the quilt often and hold it taut as you sew to prevent lumps and bumps. Continue to sew from the center out to the edges until you have covered all areas of your quilt with stitches that are about three to four inches apart. Sew around your safety pins or remove them right before you sew over an area that has a safety pin in it. Remove any remaining pins when you are finished."

      "title": "Add a border.",
      "content": "Add a border. Take one of your three-inch wide strips that is the same length as your quilt top. Then, fold over about ¼” to ½” of the border fabric on one of the long edges. If you want to ensure that this edge will be nice and straight, then you can iron it. However, you can also pin it straight onto your quilt edge and begins sewing. Pin the folded edge of your long strip to the long edge of your quilt beginning about one inch in from the edge. Use safety pins to do this and make sure that the fabric goes all the way through the materials. Then, start at one end and sew along the edge of the quilt to secure the border in place. Make sure that you hold the fabric tight and smooth it out as you go. Remove each the safety pins right before you sew over them. Repeat the same process on the other side of the quilt edge. Fold over the fabric, pin it, and then sew it into place. Add borders for the other three edges when you are done with the first edge. After you have added the borders, your jelly roll quilt is complete!"
