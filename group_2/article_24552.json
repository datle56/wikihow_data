[18] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source To check if a jade bracelet is real , follow Ehrenwald's expert tips: Check the interior to see if it has veins or other irregularities . \"Any irregularities, such as fibrous veins,\" says Ehrenwald, may indicate the jade is legitimate. If you see any bubbles, though, that's probably a sign it's \"not natural.\" Gently scratch the jade's surface with scissors . According to Ehrenwald, \"If the scissors left a mark that cannot be wiped off, then you know your jade is not authentic.\" Check the temperature of the jade bracelet . \"Hold the stone in your hand and see how it feels,\" says Ehrenwald. \"Jades are naturally ice cold and take a while to warm up. If it heats up pretty quickly and doesnâ€™t feel very cool when holding it, then your jade is most likely a counterfeit.\" Send it to an accredited gemologist if you still have doubts . If you want to be 100% sure your bracelet is made of real jade, sending it to an expert is your best bet. \"An accredited independent grading laboratory such as IGI [the International Gemological Institute] can analyze the stone and provide a report that clearly states whether the stone is natural or synthetic,\" says Ehrenwald. The laboratory will also provide other details \"describing its shape, cut, weight, measurements, color, and major optical characteristics.\""
