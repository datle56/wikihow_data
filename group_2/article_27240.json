      "title": "Wash your potatoes with cool, clean water.",
      "content": "Wash your potatoes with cool, clean water. Place your potatoes in a colander or wire strainer and give them a good dousing, or hold them under the faucet and rinse them off one-by-one. Use the pads of your fingers or a stiff-bristled brush to scrub away clinging dirt and debris. When you’re done, shake off the excess water. [1] X Research source If you’re a stickler for food safety, you can also soak your potatoes for 2-5 minutes in your own all-natural vegetable wash made from water, white vinegar, and lemon juice. [2] X Research source Remember, potatoes grow in the ground, so it’s always a good idea to make sure they’re nice and clean before cooking with them."

      "title": "Cut the potatoes in half down the middle.",
      "content": "Cut the potatoes in half down the middle. Lay out your potatoes on a cutting board or scratch-resistant surface and run a sharp knife through the center of each. Be sure to cut them lengthwise rather than widthwise to ensure that your fries don’t come out short and stubby. [3] X Research source There’s no need to peel your potatoes unless they’re particularly dirty, or you prefer them without the skins. If you do decide to peel them, use a veggie peeler with a wide blade to save time. [4] X Research source Longer potatoes tend to make for better French fries."

      "title": "Cut the halves into 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) slices.",
      "content": "Cut the halves into 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) slices. Rest each bisected potato against your cutting board flat-side-down and slice it longways 3-4 times. Doing so will reduce it to more manageable sections that you can then easily cut into individual fries of your preferred thickness. [5] X Research source For especially large potatoes, you may need to make 1 or 2 extra cuts to simplify the task of slicing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice the sections",
      "content": "Slice the sections into 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) strips. Work your way down the line turning each piece into 6-8 fries. Try to keep your cuts as consistent as you can. Once you’ve sliced your last potato, gather up the fries and transfer them to an empty, spacious serving or mixing bowl. You can also cut your fries smaller, if you like. This will require making finer, more precise cuts, though, so watch your fingers. It’s okay if not all of your fries are exactly the same thickness. Just make sure there’s not such a size difference that they cook unevenly. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Soak your sliced potatoes",
      "content": "Soak your sliced potatoes in cold water for 30 minutes to an hour. Fill the bowl with fresh water until the potatoes are completely immersed. Keep an eye on the clock as they soak. Once they’ve sat for half an hour or so, it will be time to drain them and get cooking. [8] X Research source Alternatively, you can soak your potatoes for 2-3 hours or even overnight the day before you fry them, though this isn’t a necessity. Giving your potatoes a good soak is optional, but it will reduce the amount of starch in the potatoes, preventing them from browning prematurely in the deep fryer."

      "title": "Fill your deep fryer up about 1/3 of the way with your preferred frying oil.",
      "content": "Fill your deep fryer up about 1/3 of the way with your preferred frying oil. Pour in the oil until it reaches the indicated fill line. Deep fryers are designed to get real hot real fast, so it’s important to use an oil with a high smoke point. Peanut, canola, vegetable, and sunflower oil are all good choices. [9] X Research source If you use an oil with a low smoke point, such as extra virgin olive or avocado, there’s a chance that it could burn before you cook time is up, ruining your fries in the process."

      "content": "Heat your oil to 275–300 °F (135–149 °C). Turn on your deep fryer and let it begin warming up. If your machine has a lid, make sure it’s on and secure at this point to help lock in heat. Most electric deep fryers will get to their target temperature within 10-20 minutes. [10] X Research source Different deep fryers have different designs, settings, and functions. Follow the instructions in the owner’s manual that came with your fryer to make sure you’re using the device safely and correctly."

      "content": "Dry your potatoes thoroughly. While you’re waiting for your oil to heat up, drain the water from your sliced potatoes and dump them out onto a layer of folded paper towels. Use a separate towel to pat them dry on all sides, making sure that there’s as little lingering moisture left behind as possible. [11] X Research source It’s a well-known fact that oil and water don’t mix. For this reason, adding wet food to hot frying oil a recipe for disaster. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your potatoes in a fry basket, if your fryer came with one.",
      "content": "Place your potatoes in a fry basket, if your fryer came with one. Arrange the potatoes so that they're sitting level inside the basket. This will help ensure that they cook more evenly. Avoid filling the basket more than 2/3 of the way full, as this is likely to result in inconsistent heating and could even be a potential fire hazard. [13] X Research source If you plan on preparing a large quantity of French fries, you may need to do it in multiple batches, depending on the size of your deep fryer or fry basket. If you don't have a fry basket, you have the option of either buying one (it's sure to come in handy if you do a lot of deep frying) or using a metal skimmer or pair of metal tongs to move them in and out of the oil.

If you're using a fry basket, attach it to the edge of the fryer so that the potatoes are completely immersed in the oil. Otherwise, use your skimmer or tongs to lower the potatoes in carefully and avoid splashing. [15] X Research source Remember to set a timer so you’ll know exactly how long your fries have been cooking. In order to achieve the optimum flavor and texture, you’ll be cooking your French fries twice . The point of this first round is just to heat them through. Your fries should still be relatively soft by the time you take them out. If they begin to brown or crisp during the initial phase of frying, either your oil is too hot or you’ve left them in for too long. [16] X Research source"

Once the first 5 minutes are up, remove the basket by taking hold of the insulated handle or carefully retrieve the loose fries using your skimmer or tongs. Set the partially cooked fries on a large plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels and allow them to cool off slightly as your oil climbs to its new target temperature. [17] X Research source Cooling your potatoes briefly will prevent them from becoming overdone. Some chefs even chill par-cooked French fries before frying them a second time. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook your fries for 3-6 more minutes, or until crisp and golden. Put your fries back into the fryer for their second and final round of frying. Monitor them closely this time so you can pull them as soon as they’re done. You’ll know they’re ready to come out when they just start to brown around the edges. [19] X Research source Plan on removing your fries out shortly before they reach the desired doneness. They’ll continue to cook for a few moments after you take them out of the fryer."

      "content": "Remove the fries and allow them to cool to a safe temperature. Let your fries rest on a fresh layer of paper towels to absorb the excess oil on the outside. Needless to say, they’ll be blistering hot when they first come out of the deep fryer, so hold off on eating them for at least 5 minutes while they cool off. [20] X Research source If you’re too eager to get a nibble, you could end up burning your fingers, your mouth, or both, which would certainly make the whole experience less enjoyable. Consider keeping some absorbent fiber food trays on hand if you’re trying to cut down on your paper towel consumption."

You can also dress them up a bit by hitting them with a dash of cracked black pepper or other choice spices, such as seasoned salt, ground garlic, or onion powder. [21] X Research source For new take on classic French fries, try combining 1/2-1 teaspoon each of black pepper, garlic powder, onion salt, paprika, and dried parsley, oregano, thyme, and basil and shaking it onto your fries.
