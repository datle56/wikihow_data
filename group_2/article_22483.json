      "content": "Give her energy through food. After giving birth and feeding puppies, the mother is going to be noticeably tired and she will need good food to keep her energy up. A food meant for nursing mothers is best, though a high quality food may suffice. Either way, now is not the time to limit food. Let the mother eat what she needs to keep feeding her babies. [1] X Research source The mother may not show interest in food for about a day after giving birth. A nursing dog needs a different diet than her pre-puppy food. Choose a food with a higher fat content to make sure she is getting sufficient calories to meet the needs of milk production, and look for a food that is high in calcium and protein to help provide the puppies with more complete nutrition.

Producing milk takes a lot of her body's liquid, so to keep up, she needs to drink more than she normally does. [3] X Research source Not getting enough water can make her more tired."

For that reason, you may need to pick up your dog and take her outside to use the bathroom. [4] X Research source However, if she becomes aggressive, it's better to wait until she's more comfortable"

      "title": "Pay attention to signs of infection and other problems.",
      "content": "Pay attention to signs of infection and other problems. After birth, you should watch your dog to make sure she doesn't develop one of several common problems. For instance, she could get an infection in her uterus or in her teats. Another common problem is low calcium. [5] X Research source If you notice any of these symptoms, take your dog to the vet. Some drainage from your dog's uterus is expected. However, it shouldn't be pale or gray. It also should flow freely and not smell bad. If it is smelly, thick, and pale/gray, she may have an infection. Normal discharge should be red, greenish, brownish, or black. With her teats, look for signs of infection, which include pain, swelling, irritation, and redness. The milk should stay white (and flow freely); if the milk turns green, red, or yellow, that's a sign of infection. You should also check for mastitis, which is an inflammation of the mammary glands. Look for swelling, red or hot areas, discoloration in milk, and changes in attitude such as lethargy or depression. If you suspect mastitis, contact your vet immediately. [6] X Research source Low calcium shows up in various ways. Generally, your dog will show less interest in her puppies, and she may be disoriented or nervous. She may pant, whine, have stomach problems, or develop a fever. Finally, she'll start to walk differently, and she may get muscle tremors. One clear indication of low calcium is laying on her side with her legs extended straight out. If you suspect your dog has low calcium, contact your vet immediately."

However, you should do it only through pictures. If you let everyone traipse by where the puppies are, giving each person a chance to hold a puppy, you'll put more stress on the mother, who's sole job right now is to protect and care for the puppies. Instead, stick to letting one or two people care for her. [11] X Research source You should also keep her away from other pets in your home. [12] X Research source"

For instance, you could take her for a short walk around the neighborhood. [14] X Research source However, follow her lead. if she really doesn't want to leave her puppies, don't make her."
