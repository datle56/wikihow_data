      "title": "Set up the bed or couch with clean, soft sheets and pillows.",
      "content": "Set up the bed or couch with clean, soft sheets and pillows. If you’re giving a massage at home, chances are you don’t have a massage table, but that is okay! Pick a spot that is clean and clear of clutter, and lay down a set of clean sheets for your partner to lay on. Don’t forget to grab 1 or 2 pillows for beneath their head, back, or knees as needed. [1] X Research source If the room isn’t clean, take 10 minutes to tidy up and put away clutter. Both you and your partner will feel more relaxed if the space is neat. Use 2 sheets—one for your partner to lay on top of, and 1 for them to put over themselves at the beginning of the massage in case they’re chilly."

      "title": "Adjust the temperature in the room to a comfortable setting.",
      "content": "Adjust the temperature in the room to a comfortable setting. This will depend on your partner—if they always run cold, turn the temperature up a little bit so the room is warmer than usual. If they’re usually warm, turn it down so they’ll be cool and comfortable. [2] X Research source A space heater or fan can help make a big difference in the room’s temperature if you don’t have much time."

      "title": "Dim the lights and set up a few candles for romantic mood lighting.",
      "content": "Dim the lights and set up a few candles for romantic mood lighting. Glaring overhead lights won’t do much for the mood, so turn those off and use candles for lighting instead. If you need more lighting, turn on a lamp. You could even cover a lamp with a sheer scarf to dim the light even more. [3] X Research source For a special touch, light your partner’s favorite scented candle."

      "title": "Turn off your phones and all electronics so you won’t be interrupted.",
      "content": "Turn off your phones and all electronics so you won’t be interrupted. If you don’t want to turn your phone off, put it on “do not disturb” or airplane mode so that you won’t get any notifications during the massage. Put it off to the side or in a drawer so you won’t be tempted to check it. Ask your partner to do the same.

      "title": "Play ambient music to create a relaxed and calm atmosphere.",
      "content": "Play ambient music to create a relaxed and calm atmosphere. Avoid music with a fast or heavy beat. Instead, opt for instrumental or ambient music for a calming effect. [5] X Research source Check out whatever streaming service you use—many have pre-made playlists or stations that are made for relaxation. Search for “relaxing music” or “ambient music” to see what is available. “Zen,” “yoga,” and “meditation” are other keywords that could help you find the right music for the occasion."

      "content": "Spend time connecting with your partner before you begin. You could enjoy a nice glass of wine or take a bubblebath together. Or, simply spend a few minutes holding hands and talking.

      "title": "Rub a natural oil or cream between your hands before you begin.",
      "content": "Rub a natural oil or cream between your hands before you begin. Sweet almond oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil are good options that shouldn’t irritate your partner’s skin. Use 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) to start and add more to your hands when they get dry. You must rub it between your hands to warm it up before you begin. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Add a few drops of essential oils to the carrier oil or cream to give it a pleasing scent. Lavender, peppermint, bergamot, and sandalwood are great options."

      "title": "Use long strokes with gentle pressure, starting at the neck and shoulders.",
      "content": "Use long strokes with gentle pressure, starting at the neck and shoulders. Have your partner lay on their stomach so you can work on their shoulders and back first. Remember, your goal isn’t to give your partner a deep-tissue massage or work out their sore muscles. It’s to awaken their body and gently touch them all over. [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Check in with your partner to see if the amount of pressure you’re using is good. They may want a deeper massage or prefer less pressure. Let your hands glide over their skin. Count slowly in your head to 20 for each section that you massage, like their neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, the middle of the back, etc."

      "title": "Spend time massaging their lower back.",
      "content": "Spend time massaging their lower back . Stand or sit so that you and your partner are facing the same direction. Put your hands flat on their lower back, near their hips, and push forward toward the middle of their back. Count to 20 as you massage this area, but feel free to do it for longer if your partner likes it. [9] X Research source If your partner is comfortable with it, you could also give them a gentle butt massage. Use your elbow to gently put pressure on your partner’s butt, starting at the top and working your way down to the bottom. Repeat on the opposite side."

      "content": "Massage their arms and legs so that every part of their body is relaxed. Part of the romantic massage is making your partner feel very relaxed but also aware of their body. Gently rub your hands up and down their arms and longs with long, firm movements. Have them start on their stomach as you massage the backs of their legs, then ask them to flip over to their back so you can massage their arms and the fronts of their legs.

      "content": "Remember to give their feet some TLC. Add more cream or oil to your hands, and gently rub the bottom of their feet in large circles. Make small circles around their ankles, and gently massage between your partner’s toes. [11] X Research source Depending on how ticklish your partner is, you may have to skip this part. But if they enjoy it, it’s worth spending some time on."

      "content": "Work on their inner thighs with a firm but gentle pressure. The inner thighs are very sensitive and are also a sensual area for both men and women. Focus on the area between the knee and the groin. Use gentle but firm strokes and count to 20 on each side. [12] X Research source How high up toward the groin you take the massage is between you and your partner. If they give you any non-verbal signs, like putting their legs together or moving away from you, you may be moving too high up their leg."

      "content": "Take your time before massaging their more sensitive or sensual places. A romantic massage can be just that, or it could be fantastic foreplay before something more sexual.

      "content": "Let your partner relax after the massage and take their time getting up. Chances are, your partner is going to be in a state of maximum relaxation and won’t want the lights flipped on and the door flung open as soon as it’s over. Allow them to lay still for a while, and take that opportunity to do some relaxing yourself! If your partner fell asleep during the massage, let them rest!"
