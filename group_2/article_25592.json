      "content": "“La ilaha illahllah” roughly translates to “There is no god but Allah.” The word “la,” meaning “no,” is a complete negation, so the phrase translates to “There is none worshiped in all of existence except Allah.” This isn’t true because people all over the world worship different deities, so the actual meaning is “No god is rightfully worshipped at all in existence except Allah.” [1] X Research source Some also say that the true translation of the phrase is “There is no deity of worship or unconditional obedience except Allah.” [2] X Research source"

[9] X Research source The Prophet Muhammed says “The most fortunate of people to receive my intercession on the Day of Resurrection are those who said ‘la ilaha illallah’ purely and sincerely from the heart.” [10] X Research source"

Saying “la ilaha illallah” reaffirms your commitment to your faith and acts as a reminder that your soul, body, and mind are not subservient to anyone except Allah. [11] X Research source This is why repeating “la ilaha illallah” can help you ward of laziness that prevents you from performing your prayers and other duties. [12] X Research source While belief in Allah’s oneness is fundamental, it’s the demonstration of your faith through good deeds and actions that may tip the scales during the Day of Judgement.

When the Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) was asked how they could renew their faith, he said “Excessively repeat La ilaha illallah.” Repeating “la ilaha illallah” every day can protect you from shirk and remind you of Allah’s power and your own limitations. [14] X Research source In the same way, repeating this powerful dhikr also renews your intentions to submit to Allah."

      "content": "Say “la ilaha illallah” throughout your life in every single setting. “La ilaha illallah” is the only dhikr you can recite with your lips closed—this means that you can say it anywhere, at any time, without anyone noticing. When you say “la ilaha illallah” every day, you pray that Allah will forgive your sins and you will be guaranteed Jannah. [15] X Research source The best type of dhikr is “la ilaha illallah” because it reminds you of your commitment to Allah and his right to be worshiped. [16] X Research source It may also help to repeat this dhikr after Allah fulfills His promises to you. It is said that reciting “la ilahah illallah” 70,000 times throughout their life will be safe from the fires of Jahannum."
