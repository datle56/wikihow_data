      "content": "Choose your outfit . The most important thing with clothes is that you wear something that’s comfortable and that makes you feel good. However, there may be dress codes you have to abide by, so look into what kind of dance it is before deciding what to wear. [1] X Research source For a casual dance, you don’t have to wear anything special. You can wear whatever clothes you like, such as jeans and a t-shirt, slacks and a blouse, a skirt or dress, or even shorts and running shoes. To really make an impression at a casual dance, consider wearing something that nobody else will be wearing, like a bold new fashion, or a themed outfit. For ideas about what fashions are currently in, take a look a what people around you are wearing, pick up a teen fashion magazine, or check out what the celebrities and trendsetters are wearing on TV. Semi-formal dances will have a slightly stricter dress code, and you may have to dress up a little more (no ripped jeans, no casual shorts, etc.) Appropriate semi-formal wear includes nice pants, dresses, skirts, blouses and sweaters, button-down shirts, and shoes other than runners/sneakers. If you're going to a formal dance, you may have to buy a new outfit, or pull out something you don’t wear very often. This could include a formal dress or a suit. Make sure that it is comfortable enough for dancing (for example, that your gown has no train that can get stepped on all night, or that it has straps and won't be slipping down)."

If you haven’t washed your hair in the last couple days, be sure to give it a wash with a mild cleanser or shampoo. [2] X Research source Keep your hair moisturized and healthy looking by applying conditioner every time you shampoo. It helps to shampoo your hair just every other day- the natural oils are good for your hair and washing too often can actually make your hair unhealthier."

      "content": "Clean your nails. Take off old nail polish. Trim and file your nails, and use a nail brush or pick to clean dirt out from underneath your fingernails. This is important for overall hygiene and appearance, and for your own self-confidence. If you want to wear nail polish to the dance, now’s the time to apply it. It looks good to have it match with your outfit- but the choice is yours. Doing nails is time-consuming, so make sure not to delay it until the last moment."

      "content": "Comb and style your hair. Hair is an important part of an overall look, but how you wear it is totally up to you, and this should be dictated by how you're comfortable. You can wear your hair curly (use a curling iron), straight (use a blow dryer or flat iron), natural (however your hair is), up in a ponytail, in a braid, bun, or twist, or just hanging loose and free. Especially if you're trying to look cool for the dance, don’t be afraid to experiment with different hair styles. Try parting your hair differently, off to the side, or at a new angle, for instance. You can even get a fresh new haircut if you like. Popular hair care products to help you style your locks include mousse, hair spray, serum and oil, and gel."

[3] X Research source Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow to make your eyes pop. Lipstick and lip gloss to give color and shine to your lips Foundation and concealer for blemishes and an even skin tone Blush to give your cheeks some color.

      "content": "Make a good entrance. They say first impressions can last a lifetime, and walking into a dance for the first time can have a huge impact on the others there. Whether you arrive alone or with a group of people, walk in boldly with your head held high (this shows confidence) and don’t hesitate. To avoid hesitating when you walk in, pick a spot and walk directly to it with purpose. For instance, you can walk to the drink table, to a group of people, or right to the dance floor if you're already feeling the music! Be sure to smile a lot, as this exudes confidence."

Be sure to stretch before you get to the dance so you don’t pull anything when you're working your moves. [5] X Research source You may feel like the center of attention on the dance floor, but remember that everyone else if feeling just as self-conscious, and most people will be paying more attention to their own feet than yours.
