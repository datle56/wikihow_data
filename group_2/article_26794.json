      "title": "Cut an avocado in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Run a sharp knife around the middle of the fruit, then gently twist the two halves apart. If it’s your first time working with an avocado, the seed will be that big, round, light brown thing sticking out of the soft, pale green fruit. [1] X Research source Avocado seeds are quite large. You should be able to feel the seed pressing up against the blade of your knife when you slice through."

      "title": "Work the seed out with the tip or edge of your knife.",
      "content": "Work the seed out with the tip or edge of your knife. The simplest way to do this is to tap the dead-center of the seed and lift it out clean. If you don’t think your knife is sharp enough for this kind of finesse, you can always just scoop it out with a spoon, though this will be slightly more messy. [2] X Research source Once you’ve successfully extracted the seed, stick the rest of the avocado in an airtight food storage container or plastic baggie and try to use it within a day or two."

      "title": "Rinse the seed under a stream of warm water to remove any lingering fruit.",
      "content": "Rinse the seed under a stream of warm water to remove any lingering fruit. If necessary, rub the surface of the seed lightly with the pads of your fingers to dislodge any stubborn bits. When it’s nice and clean, pat it dry with an absorbent cloth or paper towel. [3] X Research source For a spotless shine, you can also scrub the seed with a soft-bristled vegetable brush. Avoid washing or soaking your seed with soap, vinegar, or any other type of cleaner. Not only will this strip away some of its healthy fats, it could also impact its final flavor."

      "title": "Leave the seed exposed to air until it’s thoroughly dry.",
      "content": "Leave the seed exposed to air until it’s thoroughly dry . If you’re not in any particular hurry, simply slide a plate under it and let it sit out on your countertop or in the refrigerator overnight. For crunch-time projects, you can speed things along by setting the seed in a warm, sunny spot or placing it on a baking sheet and popping it in the oven at its lowest heat setting for 2-3 hours. [4] X Research source You’ll know your seed is sufficiently dry when the thin outer skin cracks and begins to flake off. Atmospheric moisture will increase the seed’s overall drying time, so keep it out of humid rooms and away from frequently-used water sources like sinks and dishwashers."

      "title": "Crush the seed with a mallet, tenderizer, or rolling pin to break it up a bit.",
      "content": "Crush the seed with a mallet, tenderizer, or rolling pin to break it up a bit. Wrap the dried seed up in a paper towel or plastic bag and give it a few good whacks with your instrument of choice. This won’t actually turn it into a powder, but it will reduce it to smaller chunks more suitable for quick and easy grinding. [5] X Research source Watch out for your thumbs here! It’s safer to pin down the edges of the paper towel to prevent the seed from moving than to hold onto the seed itself. Any high-powered blender or food processor will chew right through a whole, intact avocado seed, you can skip this step if you don’t want to bother with it. Just keep in mind that it will take longer to break the seed down if it’s still in one piece."

    {
      "title": "Grind the seed to the desired texture in a blender or food processor.",
      "content": "Grind the seed to the desired texture in a blender or food processor. For a coarse grind, pulse the machine 4-5 times for a couple seconds at a time to pulverize the chunks a bit. If you’d prefer a finer powder, let it run uninterrupted for 10-20 seconds, then check the seed’s progress and repeat as many times as needed. [7] X Research source A basic coffee grinder will also work nicely for this task."

      "title": "Grate whole seeds with a kitchen grater if you don’t have a blender.",
      "content": "Grate whole seeds with a kitchen grater if you don’t have a blender. For this method, your seed will need to be in one piece. Take a firm grip on the seed, hold it against the smallest set of holes on your grater, and rake it back and forth repeatedly. It will take longer and won’t produce quite as delicate a powder, but you’ll still end up with pieces small enough for any number of uses. [8] X Research source It’s possible to get the job done with a handheld mini-grater, as well. Just hold on tight and be extra careful. Keep your knuckles and the tips of your fingers clear of the grater blade. This project shouldn’t require any blood, sweat, or tears to be shed!"

      "title": "Keep the powder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Keep the powder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. When you’re happy with your powder’s consistency, transfer it to a mason jar or lidded storage container and stash it in the refrigerator. A tightly-sealed container and cool environment will ensure that it stays off-limits to moisture. [9] X Research source You can probably get away with storing your avocado seed powder at room temperature if you need to, so long as it remains sealed whenever you’re not using it. The smallest amount of moisture could cause the once-dry powder to clump or stick, making it harder to portion out."

      "content": "Add your avocado seed powder to all your favorite dishes and treats. Blend about a teaspoon (5 g) into a refreshing fruit smoothie, or sprinkle it over a fresh green salad or Greek yogurt parfait. The tangy, slightly bitter powder can also be used to enhance the flavor and up the nutritional value of various soups and sauces. Just add to taste. [10] X Research source Some sources claim that up to 70% of an avocado’s total antioxidant content can be found in its seeds, along with loads of vitamins, fatty acids, and other beneficial nutrients. Ground avocado seeds may also be an excellent source of dietary fiber. And since it’s a breeze to add to other foods, you won’t have to adjust your weekly menu. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Incorporate the powder into a homemade facemask or body scrub . In addition to its culinary uses, avocado seed powder can also make a great all-natural exfoliant. After preparing your product, spoon in roughly 1-2 teaspoons (5-10 g) of powder and blend thoroughly. The combination of vitamins, minerals, and residual oils will help to nourish and restore your skin without the need for harsh chemicals. [12] X Research source For extra scouring power, it may help to go with a coarser grind. Try working some of your avocado seed powder into a batch of lip or cuticle scrub to give your whole body some much-needed TLC."
