      "title": "Drink fluids",
      "content": "Drink fluids . The amount of semen that is released during orgasm is related to the volume of fluids that are ingested. That's because semen is water-based, and semen is the fluid that helps lubricate the way for sperm. The body needs two to three liters of water a day to function properly. [1] X Research source Drinking more fluids should therefore increase your ejaculate. If you enjoy a couple rounds of drinks after work and a couple more before the deed, you're doing your ejaculate a disservice. That's because alcohol dehydrates your body, leaving it less like a slip'n'slide and more like a deserted water park. In addition to dehydrating your body, alcohol lowers sperm count and affects the quality of your sperm."

      "content": "Keep the heat away. Your mini-mes are delicate, like a flower in the tundra. They're so delicate that they wilt when they're exposed to excessive heat. [2] X Research source This may help answer one of the burning questions of your youth — why are testicles outside of the body? In fact, testes are housed outside of the body instead of inside because they need to be able to maintain a lower temperature than 98.6 °F (37.0 °C), which is the temperature at which your body regulates heat. What does this mean, practically speaking? If you enjoy long rides in cars with heated seats, or steamy shifts in the sauna/steam room, or even trips to your very own hot tub time machine, give them a break. They're not worth sacrificing your little cadets for."

      "content": "Avoid sitting with your legs crossed. This philosophical posture also affects the sperm and semen volumes to a great extent. By squashing the scrotal area against the warm body, you risk increasing its temperature above the normal range. That's a red alert, right there."

      "content": "Abstain from orgasm (for a day or two). Your body produces sperm at an astonishing rate of more than 1,500 every second , on average. That works out to anywhere from 130 to 200 million sperm cells a day. [3] X Research source Still, whenever you orgasm, you lose a hefty portion of your serial soldiers. Try to wait a bit to increase the size of the army. Abstaining from orgasm for one or two days is all it takes, in fact, for the body to replenish its army. Beyond one or two days, your sperm is just sitting and getting old, like tuckered out reserves."
