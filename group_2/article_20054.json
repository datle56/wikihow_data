      "title": "Unlock the Engineer glove.",
      "content": "Unlock the Engineer glove. You’ll need the Engineer glove to collect the UberCharged badge, which is, in turn, tied to the Wrench glove. Engineer is a slap-costing glove; it costs 9,000 slaps to unlock—so you may need to grind for a little while to get it. Ensure the Engineer glove is in your inventory before going to the next step! [1] X Research source The Engineer glove has an ability called “Sentry,” which creates a metal stand and plain white glove that spins counterclockwise, gradually gaining speed as it goes. Sentries created by the Engineer glove last for 30 seconds total. You’ll need this ability to unlock the Wrench glove!"

      "content": "Get onto a private server with someone who has the Thor glove. For this next step, it helps to have a friend who owns the Thor glove—because you’ll need another Slap Battles player to use Thor’s ability on you. Once in the private server, have the Thor user strike you with Thor’s lightning (the \" Volt \" ability). [2] X Research source “Volt” summons lightning that strikes down, dealing knockback to anyone nearby and applying a “zap” effect that slows them down. You can do this on a public server, too—it’s just easier to do on private servers (since there’s less danger of random players getting in the way)."

      "title": "Slap a sentry while you’re slowed by Thor’s lightning.",
      "content": "Slap a sentry while you’re slowed by Thor’s lightning. You can summon a sentry using the Engineer glove right before getting zapped by Thor—or summon the sentry immediately afterward instead. The summoning order doesn’t matter as long as you slap the sentry while affected by Thor’s lightning, because that will unlock the Wrench glove! [3] X Research source You should be able to hear the sentry being supercharged after slapping it if you did everything correctly. As mentioned above, the Wrench glove is tied to the UberCharged badge. So, when you get the badge (by slapping the sentry after being struck by lightning), you’ll get the glove, too."

      "title": "The Wrench glove has a passive ability called “Turn This Way.”",
      "content": "The Wrench glove has a passive ability called “Turn This Way.” When you slap someone with the Wrench glove, they’re locked into facing a random direction for 10 seconds. That initial slap won’t deal any knockback—but slapping them while they’re locked into that random direction will deal knockback, tossing the other player away. Affected players will regain the ability to turn after 10 seconds. [4] X Research source This makes the Wrench glove ideal for setting up a combo or catching another player off-guard. You can also use the Wrench glove to speed up summoned sentries temporarily (by slapping them)."

    {
      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros The Wrench glove is a great choice when you’re playing in teams; you can set enemies up for devastating hits by using the “Turn This Way” ability before your teammate swoops in with a finishing move from a one-shot glove (like OVERKILL or God’s Hand). It’s also a decent glove on its own, with good slap power and the ability to counter gloves that require facing a specific way (like Santa or Tableflip). [5] X Research source The Wrench glove is ideal for use with Engineer since it can speed up allied sentries. You can use the Wrench glove to avoid flickers, turn Replica’s clones around, and temporarily stop Spy users from going between front stab and backstab. If an enemy player is using the Detonator glove, you can use Wrench to force them to use the “Blast Tag” ability only within a specific field of vision (since they’ll be locked into a direction)."

    {
      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons One of the Wrench glove’s main drawbacks is that its first slap doesn’t knock your opponents away at all—meaning an opponent who acts faster could counter you with their own slap before you can follow up with a second attack. Plus, the Wrench glove locks enemies in a random direction, so they might still end up facing you after getting slapped! [6] X Research source Some gloves can counter Wrench more easily. For example, Reverse and el gato have abilities that will let them force-face you, even after getting slapped. Additionally, gloves like Boogie and MEGAROCK have abilities that can stall until the direction lock expires, and ranged gloves like Tableflip and Santa can target you while outside of striking distance. Basically, while the Wrench glove’s passive is useful, it won’t take effect until after the first slap—which can leave you vulnerable before the passive is applied."

That said, there are absolutely some gloves that most players agree are hard to get their hands on! These include the bob , rob , Detonator, Kraken, Fish, Megarock, Counter , and Boogie gloves.

Beyond that, a few other gloves are also considered pretty easy to get, including Spin (which is right above the lobby and Killstreak Only portal), Acrobat (which you can get by joining a Slap Battles group), and Plague (which comes with the Infected badge, obtained by exposure to the poison effect)."
