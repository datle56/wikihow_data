      "content": "Yes and no—Jesus is God, but He and God the Father are separate Persons. Christianity revolves around the belief that Jesus is the divine Son of God who died on the cross for all of humanity’s sins. [1] X Research source In a literal sense, Jesus is God—but through the Trinity, he exists separately from God the Father , the Creator of the universe who is present throughout the Old Testament of the Bible. Jesus was born from Mary, a virgin, through the power of God. Because of this, Jesus is considered completely human as well as completely divine. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The Trinity is the concept that God lives as 3 Holy forms. Christianity centers around the principle that there’s only one sovereign God—the Trinity is just the idea that this one God exists as three Persons: God the Father (the Creator and God from the Old Testament), God the Son (Jesus, who died on the cross), and God the Holy Spirit (the form of God who lives within practicing Christians). [3] X Research source When you break it down, Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit are all God. However, Jesus is different from the Father, the Father is different from the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is different from Jesus. [4] X Research source It may help to think of the Trinity as ice, liquid water, and steam. Ice, liquid water, and steam are all H2O; however, ice is not liquid water, liquid water is not steam, and steam is not ice."

      "content": "The Trinity is not 3 separate deities. A common misconception is that God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit are 3 different gods that rule together. Instead, it’s better to view the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three Persons of God—each distinct, but ultimately the same. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The Trinity does not represent an evolution or transformation of God. Some people incorrectly believe that God the Father transformed into Jesus, who eventually transformed into the Holy Spirit. This belief is false—according to the Bible, God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit have all existed at the same time: [6] X Research source “In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. He existed in the beginning with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him.” - John 1:1-3 In these verses “The Word” is another name for Jesus. “Now I am departing from the world; they are staying in this world, but I am coming to you. Holy Father, you have given me your name; now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be as united as we are.” - John 17:11 “After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.” - Matthew 3:16-17"

      "title": "God the Father",
      "content": "God the Father God the Father is the sovereign God first introduced in the Old Testament of the Bible, where He also comes to be known as the God of Israel. As the creator of the entire universe, he’s called “Father” due to His relationship with His followers (also known as God’s “children”). Here’s how the Bible describes God the Father: “And don’t address anyone here on earth as ‘Father,’ for only God in heaven is your Father.” - Matthew 23:9 “And yet, O Lord, You are our Father. We are the clay, and You are the potter. We are all formed by Your hand.” - Isaiah 64:8 “Are we all not children of the same Father? Are we not all created by the same God? Then why do we betray each other, violating the covenant of our ancestors?” - Malachi 2:10"

      "title": "Jesus the Son",
      "content": "Jesus the Son Jesus Christ sits at the cornerstone of Christianity—as God in human form, the Bible tells how Jesus was killed for the sake of humanity’s sins, and how He rose from the dead 3 days later. According to the Bible, believing in Jesus and accepting Him as one’s Lord and Savior is the only way to attain salvation and have eternal life in Heaven. [7] X Research source Here’s a closer look at how Jesus is described in the Bible: “Then He asked them, ‘But who do you say I am?’ Peter replied, ‘You are the Messiah sent from God!’” - Luke 9:20 “Jesus came and told His disciples, ‘I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.’” - Matthew 28:18 “Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.” - John 14:6"

      "title": "The Holy Spirit",
      "content": "The Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit lives in every single person who accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior. Like Jesus and God the Father, the Holy Spirit is a distinct Person with Its own will and purpose in a practicing Christian’s life. As a believer grows in faith, the Holy Spirit assists them in becoming more like God. [8] X Research source Take a look at how the Bible describes the Holy Spirit: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.” - Genesis 1:1-2 “But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative—that is, the Holy Spirit—he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.” - John 14:26 “We are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit, who is given by God to those who obey him.” - Acts 5:32"

      "content": "Christian beliefs center around the Trinity and Jesus’s gift of salvation. Jesus Christ and God the Father are both considered God because of the Trinity, but they exist in distinct forms from one another. Similarly, the Holy Spirit is also a form of God that exists separately from Jesus and the Father. [9] X Research source Remember—the Trinity is not a single person who juggles 3 different roles.

      "content": "Christians can pray to both God the Father and Jesus the Son. According to the Bible, it’s perfectly fine to direct your prayers to Jesus or to God the Father. At the end of the day, your prayers are reaching the same place! [11] X Research source Here’s a little advice that the Bible gives about prayer: “Jesus said, ‘This is how you should pray: Father, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon.’” - Luke 11:2 “You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, so that the Son can bring glory to the Father.” - John 14:13"
