      "title": "Fast Travel to the city of Markarth.",
      "content": "Fast Travel to the city of Markarth. Markarth is on the far west side of the map. It has an icon that resembles rams horns on a shield. Open your map and select Markarth, a pop-up screen will ask if you want to Fast Travel there. Select “Yes,” and you’ll instantly get to Markarth from wherever you were. Once you get to Markarth, head out of the city through the main gate at the south. Right outside Markarth, you’ll see some stables. This will be your starting point. If you have not been to Markarth, you will not be able to Fast Travel to it. Instead Fast Travel to the nearest location and them make your way to Markarth. Alternatively, you can Fast Travel to Dushnikh Yal, Purewater Run, or Hag Rock Redoubt, if you've been to any of those locations. They are a little closer."
