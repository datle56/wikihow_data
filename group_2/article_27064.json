      "content": "Peel the ginger. You need to remove the skin from the ginger before crystallizing it, and one of the easiest ways to do this is with a spoon. Place the side of the spoon against the ginger root, and gently scrape away the skin. [1] X Research source You can use a knife or vegetable peeler for this job instead. Vegetable peelers can be awkward to maneuver around all the knobs and bumps on ginger, and knives often take off too much flesh."
