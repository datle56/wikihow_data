      "title": "Test your soil",
      "content": "Test your soil . Broccoli prefers soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. You can test the soil and add different nutrients to adjust its acidity. Be sure to test the soil periodically throughout the growing process. In addition to pH, the soil test results will tell you if your soil lacks any important nutrients, which you can add with soil amendments. Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags and instructions available. If your soil's pH level is below 6.0, add acid compost or planting mix. If your soil's pH is above 7.0, mix in granular sulfur."

      "title": "Make sure the soil drains well and is very fertile.",
      "content": "Make sure the soil drains well and is very fertile. If your soil test reveals you have low quality soil, or if your soil drains poorly, there are several things you can do to ready your garden for planting broccoli: If your soil is prone to flooding, consider building a garden planter box to raise your soil above the ground. If possible, use cedar wood to build your planter box, as it does not rot when exposed to water. To increase the fertility of your soil, mix up to four inches of mature compost into your soil. If your soil is in particularly poor condition, also add a high-nitrogen organic fertilizer to enrich the soil. Organic fertilizers like alfalfa, cottonseed meal, and manure are good choices for planting broccoli."

      "title": "Direct-sow your seeds outdoors.",
      "content": "Direct-sow your seeds outdoors. For a summer harvest, sow seeds two to three weeks before the last spring frost. For a fall harvest, direct sow seeds outdoors 85 to 100 days before the first fall frost. Alternately, start your seeds indoors. If you choose to start your seeds indoors, plant them in peat pots or other small seedling pots. Keep them in a sunny room. If sowing seeds indoors, you can plant them earlier and transplant them to the garden 2 or 3 weeks before the last frost. If you plant them in separate pots or tray containers, you won't need to thin them later."

      "title": "Plant the broccoli seeds in widely spaced rows.",
      "content": "Plant the broccoli seeds in widely spaced rows. Organize your plot into rows about 36 inches (90 cm) apart. Dig holes every 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) along each row. Place a few seeds in each hole and cover with soil. Optionally, you can sow seeds every 6 inches (15 cm) instead and thin out the smaller or less healthy plants as they grow. Use a rake to lightly smooth the soil over the seeds if you are planting outdoors, but be sure not to disturb the seeds themselves. Simply pat the soil over your seeds with your fingers if planting in peat pots."

      "title": "Regulate the soil temperature.",
      "content": "Regulate the soil temperature. If direct sowing outdoors, apply an organic mulch made of mature compost, leaves, or bark to keep soil cool. Alternately, if you are planting in cool temperatures, apply a black plastic covering to heat the soil. You can buy plastic coverings at your local garden supply store, but any semi-sturdy black plastic such as a tarp will work."

Remove smaller or unhealthy-looking plants until the survivors are 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) apart. This will prevent overcrowding as the broccoli plants continue to grow. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Water your broccoli plants regularly.",
      "content": "Water your broccoli plants regularly. Allow your plants between one and one and a half inches of water per week. Broccoli likes moist soil. You can use a rain gauge to see how much water the plants are getting naturally, and make up the difference with irrigation. Make sure not to get the budding broccoli crowns wet when watering. Doing so causes them to mold. In particularly hot or dry conditions, increase the amount of water you feed your plants."

      "content": "Fertilize your plants about three weeks after planting. Use an organic, nitrogen-rich fertilizer when your broccoli plants begin to form new leaves. Fish emulsion works well for fertilizing broccoli plants. You can continue to fertilize the plants about once a week until they are ready for harvest."

      "content": "Avoid digging or turning the soil. Broccoli plants have very shallow roots. If you disturb the soil you may accidentally break roots and damage your broccoli plants. If weeds develop around the plants, suffocate them with mulch instead of plucking them from the ground to avoid disturbing the roots. [3] X Research source If you choose not to grow organically, you can also use a chemical pesticide to remove unwanted weeds from your garden without disturbing the broccoli roots."

Avoid waiting until the buds begin to flower into light green or yellow flowers. Cut the crown where it meets the stem using garden shears. See \"Choosing a Variety\" above for exact growing times for specific varieties. Avoid breaking the crown off. A clean cut will better encourage new growth. With a healthy cut, the broccoli plant should grow small shoots from the side of the stem. You can continue to harvest the small shoots, and the plant should produce more. [4] X Research source"
