      "content": "This method lets you get around Bumble’s location sharing requirement. Instead of hiding your location, a spoofing app will create a fake location using false GPS data. Install the app of your choice and follow the instructions to activate it and keep making matches without showing your real location. Some popular location spoofing apps include: Fake GPS Location, Mock Locations, Fake GPS, and GPS Emulator for Android devices. Virtual Location for Mac, which you can use in combination with the Magellan app on your phone or tablet to create fake locations on iOS devices. Unfortunately, there are very few reliable location spoofing options for iOS devices. Always use caution and read the reviews carefully before trying one of these apps."
