[1] X Expert Source Jeanine Hattas Wilson Professional Painter Expert Interview. 5 May 2021. This will work with all types of paint, whether you're oil painting , watercoloring, or acrylic painting . If you’re using a nice set of paints with different shades of each color, try mixing Aureolin Yellow, Rose Madder Genuine, and Cobalt Blue to get a soft black.

      "content": "Put equal amounts of each color on a palette. It works best to put the colors on the palette one at a time before you mix them. For a basic black, equal amounts of each color is a great place to start. [2] X Research source Using slightly more of one or two of the colors will give you a different shade of black. Don’t be afraid to play around with the colors! If you use a paintbrush to dab paint onto the palette, use a different brush for each color so you don't mix the paints except on the palette."

Add a little brown or green to the black to paint pine trees at night, or add some yellow for the sun reflecting off of black metal. Mixing paint by hand usually won't give you an exact black, but your black will have more character than pure black."
