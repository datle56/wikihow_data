The different alters may create disarray in your sense of self. You may be confused and you may feel like you don't know what you are doing or what may happen next. That could be very hazardous for yourself and others around you.

The switch between personality states will take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours, and the time spent in an alternate state of consciousness will vary from person to person. Outsiders can sometimes determine when a switch has occurred based on the presence of: [7] X Research source A change in the sound/timbre of voice. Rapid blinking, as if adjusting to light. A general change in demeanor or physical state. Changes in facial features or expression. Change in train of thought or conversation, without any warning or reason.

People with Dissociative Identity Disorder do not always remember when they experience a certain state of consciousness. [12] X Research source Due to this, people with DID may not be aware of their alters so self-diagnosing can be particularly challenging. Don't try to self-diagnose. You must see a professional to determine whether or not you have DID. Only trained psychologists or psychiatrists are qualified to diagnose the illness. Find a psychologist or therapist who specializes in assessing and treating the disorder. If you have been diagnosed with DID, you can consider whether you want to take medication for it. Ask your psychologist for a referral to a psychiatrist."

      "content": "Rule out medical issues. Sometimes people with DID experience memory issues and agitation, which can also be caused by certain medical conditions. It is important that you are also evaluated by your doctor (primary general practitioner) to eliminate any of the possibilities. Also, rule out any substance use issues. [13] X Research source DID is not caused by blackouts due to alcohol consumption or other substance intoxication. If you experience seizures of any kind, consult with your doctor immediately. This is a medical condition and not directly associated with DID."

      "title": "Be patient when seeking professional help.",
      "content": "Be patient when seeking professional help. Know that it can take time to diagnose DID. People with DID are sometimes misdiagnosed. The primary reason for this is that many sufferers of DID also have other mental health diagnoses such as: depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorder, sleep disorder, panic disorder, or a substance abuse disorder. The combination of these illnesses present themselves in a way that the symptoms of DID overlap with the other disorders. As a result, the doctor may need some time to get to know the patient before making a clear diagnosis. Don’t expect an immediate diagnosis on the first day you meet with a mental health professional. These assessments can take several sessions. Make sure you tell the mental health professional that you are worried you might have DID. This can make it much easier to diagnose because this will help the doctor (Psychologist or Psychiatrist) ask you the correct questions and observe your behaviors appropriately. Be honest about your experiences. The more information the doctor has, the more accurate the diagnosis."

Although the other symptoms may not all be necessary for a diagnosis, they are likely to appear and are closely related to the illness. Make a list of all of the symptoms you encounter. This list will help shed light on your condition. Bring this list to your psychologist when you go for an evaluation."

      "content": "Take an account of your trauma. DID typically arises as a result of years of extreme abuse or repeated trauma. [14] X Research source Unlike movies like \"Hide and Seek,\" which portray a sudden onset of the disorder as the result of a recent traumatic experience, DID typically occurs because of chronic abuse in a person’s life. An individual will typically experience years of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse as a child, and develop DID as a coping mechanism to deal with the trauma. [15] X Research source The abuse suffered is generally very extreme, such as being raped regularly by a parent or kidnapped and abused over a long period of time. A single (or a few unrelated) abuse events will not cause DID. The onset of symptoms may begin in childhood, but will not be diagnosed until a person has reached adulthood."

      "content": "Keep track of time loss and amnesia. The term \"time loss\" refers to a person suddenly becoming aware of their surroundings, and having a period of recent time (such as the previous day or that morning’s activities) completely lost from their memory. This relates closely to amnesia, in which an individual loses a specific memory or set of related memories. Both can be quite traumatic for the sufferer, as they are left confused and unaware as to their own goings-on. [16] X Research source Create a diary of memory problems. If you suddenly come to and don’t know what you’ve just been doing, write it down. Check the time and date and write an account of where you are and the last thing you remember. This can help identify patterns or triggers for dissociative episodes. Share this with your mental health professional if you feel comfortable."

Everyone experiences dissociation to some degree (e.g. when you are sitting in a boring class for a long time, and suddenly come-to when the bell rings with no memory of what happened over the past hour). However, someone with DID might experience dissociation more regularly, as if they are in a \"waking dream.\" This person may explain that they do things as if they are watching their body from the outside."

Knowing the exact criteria to maintain a DID diagnosis may help you identify whether or not you need a psychological evaluation to confirm your suspicion. According to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5), the primary diagnostic tool used in psychology, there are five criteria that must be met for a person to be diagnosed with DID. All five must be verified before a diagnosis can be made. They are: [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There must be two or more distinct states within a single individual, which is outside societal and cultural norms for the individual. The person will have recurrent memory issues such as gaps in memory of everyday activities, forgetting personal information, or traumatic events. The symptoms cause significant impairment in functioning (school, work, home, relationships). The disturbance is not part of a widely recognized religious or cultural practice. The symptoms are not the result of substance abuse or a medical illness."

However, recent studies suggest that between one to three percent of the population actually suffer from the illness, putting it in the normal range for mental illness diagnoses.

Whether as a result of social conditioning or because of a general increased likelihood for women to suffer significant traumatic abuse as children than do men, women are three to nine times more likely to be diagnosed with DID than are men. Further, women tend to manifest more states/personalites than do men, having an average of 15+, while men have an average of eight+."

However, psychologists and scientists alike have come to the conclusion that the disorder is indeed real, albeit misunderstood. [19] X Research source Popular movies like \"Weirdo,\" \"Fight Club,\" and \"Sybil\" have added confusion to many people’s understanding of the illness, as they show fictionalized, extreme versions of the disorder.

Although there have been several cases of people who experience false memories as a result of ill-trained psychologists asking leading questions, or while under hypnosis, sufferers of DID will very rarely forget all of the abuse they experienced. Because suffers typically have to go through such traumatic abuse over an extended period of time, they may not be able repress or suppress all of the memories; they may forget some, but not all of the memories."

An alter-ego is an invented/created second personality that a person uses as a way to act or behave in a way different from their normal personality. Many people with DID are not completely aware of their multiple personality states (due to the amnesia that occurs), while people with an alter-ego are not only aware of their second personality, but they worked hard to consciously create it. Celebrity examples of alter-egos include Eminem/Slim Shady and Beyoncé/Sasha Fierce."
