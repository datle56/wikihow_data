Wait until your pubic hair is about a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long before waxing, so the wax can grab onto the hair follicle and be easier to remove. Follow the instructions of at-home wax kits carefully. Some kits require prepping a pot or cup of wax, while others have premade strips ready for use. Test the temperature of the wax before applying it to your pubic area. A burn down there can be extremely uncomfortable. Apply a bit of wax to the inside of your wrist. The wax should be hot enough to spread over your skin but not hot enough to burn. Wear cotton underwear and clothing after waxing to help your skin to breathe and avoid irritation. If needed, try soothing the skin by applying petroleum jelly to the area with a cotton swab ."
