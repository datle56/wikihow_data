      "title": "Apply aloe to your lips.",
      "content": "Apply aloe to your lips. Use fresh aloe juice from a cut leaf of the plant, or buy a commercial aloe gel. Smear some of the juice or gel onto your sunburned lips, and let it dry. You should feel some cool relief, and the aloe will also help to heal the burn. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can purchase aloe leaves from the produce section of some grocery stores, if you don’t have a plant at home. To get at the juice, just cut the outer green layer of the plant to reveal the wet, gel-like inner portion. Do not use an aloe gel on your lips if the instructions do not recommend it. Apply aloe as often as needed. Store your aloe or gel in the fridge for added cooling relief."

      "title": "Use some lip balm.",
      "content": "Use some lip balm. Many regular lip balms are very effective at healing sunburned lips. Look for one with shea or cocoa butter along with SPF protection. That way, the balm will help clear up the sunburn and protect your lips from further sun damage. [2] X Research source Lip balms come in a variety of forms--tubes, sticks, and pastes. To apply lip balm, rub the tube or stick on your lips (or use your finger to rub on the paste) until they are evenly coated in a thin layer. Apply new lip balm whenever the previous layer wears off."

      "title": "Rub on a layer of antibiotic ointment, if you have any open blisters.",
      "content": "Rub on a layer of antibiotic ointment, if you have any open blisters. Look for an ointment that is specifically designed for use on lips, since many topical antibiotics (and hydrocortisone creams) are not safe to ingest. Simply rub a layer of the ointment onto your lips once a day. [3] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source"

      "title": "Apply an oatmeal paste.",
      "content": "Apply an oatmeal paste. Cook some oatmeal as you normally would. Let it cool. Dab it on your lips once a day like you would a sponge, then rinse it off. Oatmeal is a traditional skin healer that heals sunburns, so this may help heal your lips."

      "title": "Don’t use petroleum jelly or pain-relieving lotions.",
      "content": "Don’t use petroleum jelly or pain-relieving lotions. Petroleum jelly or products containing it can cause further damage to sunburned skin, so avoid these. In addition, lotions containing pain relievers like benzocaine or lidocaine can actually irritate sunburned skin instead of providing relief, so don’t use them either."

    {
      "title": "Take pain-relieving medication.",
      "content": "Take pain-relieving medication. Use an over the counter pain reliever medication, such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. The medication will ease the discomfort caused by the sunburn while your lips heal. [4] X Research source Use pain relievers according to their package instructions. Do not overdose. Even over-the-counter pain relievers may interact with prescription drugs or other medications. If you are currently taking any other medications, ask your doctor about which pain relievers are safe for you."

      "title": "Put on a cold compress.",
      "content": "Put on a cold compress. Take a clean cloth and let it soak in a container of ice water for a few minutes. Wring out the excess water, then hold it to your lips for as long as the cloth stays cool. Doing this while your lips heal will provide some quick and simple relief. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Relieve the pain with chamomile. Steep some chamomile tea bags in hot water, then take them out and let them cool. Hold the bags directly to your lips for as long as they stay cool. [6] X Research source Chamomile is a natural way to relieve pain from burns, so as long as the bags are cool, they’ll be effective on your sunburned lips."

      "content": "Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water while your sunburn is healing. Your skin needs lots of water to stay healthy, especially when your body is trying to rebuild the skin damaged by overexposure to the sun.

    {
      "title": "Stay out of the sun.",
      "content": "Stay out of the sun. Stay indoors as much as possible while your lips heal. If you have to go outside, try to stay in the shade or wear a hat to keep the sun off of your lips. If your lips are already sunburned, exposing them to more sunlight can potentially make the problem worse and slow the healing process. [8] X Research source Wear lip balm with SPF 30 protection or higher if you must go outside."

      "title": "Don’t pick at the burn.",
      "content": "Don’t pick at the burn. Keep your hands off of your lips, and stick to balms and ointments for relief. Peeling skin or popping blisters on sunburned lips can be tempting, but this will only make the problem worse. Picking at the burn exposes your skin to bacteria, which can cause infection.
