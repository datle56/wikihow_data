      "content": "You might see an OE error code or no code at all. Here are some of the most common reasons: Blocked/Clogged filters. Drain hose blocked/clogged. Kinked hoses. Faulty lid switch. Unbalanced or overfull load. Faulty drive belt or motor."

      "title": "Clean the drain pump filter.",
      "content": "Clean the drain pump filter. Lint and debris can clog your filter and prevent it from draining properly. If you want to look for foreign objects as well, they can be the culprit (think of missing chapstick or money).To clean this filter, follow these steps: Find the access door for the drain pump filter on the front of your washing machine (usually in a lower corner). Get a towel and shallow dish ready to collect any water that comes out when you open this door. Either press on the door or use a small, thin tool, like a coin, to pull the door open. How you can open the door depends on the model of washer you have, so check your manual for instructions on opening it. Pull out the emergency drain hose and position it over your shallow dish, then remove the cap on the hose and wait for it to stop draining. Replace the cap on the hose and put it back into the door. Turn the drain filter anti-clockwise to remove it from its housing. Remove debris from the filter. You can wash it in warm water to clean it. Wipe the inside of the housing with a damp cloth to make sure nothing is building up inside the filter. Look in the back, use a flashlight if the lighting isn't great, to make sure nothing is stuck inside the propeller unit (small thread can get wound up in it and prevent it from working). Replace the filter and turn it clockwise to tighten it into place. Close the access door."

      "title": "Check the drain hose for blockages.",
      "content": "Check the drain hose for blockages. Blockages prevent your washer from draining. To check your drain hose: Turn off the power to your washing machine from your circuit board and unplug it from the wall. Remove any laundry from the drum. Pull the laundry machine away from the wall so you can comfortably fit behind it. Find the drain hose. It's usually the thickest hose and is connected to a drainpipe instead of a tap. Detach the drain hose from the washing machine. You might need a screwdriver to do this. Detach the drain hose from the other end. Use a long, thin tool like a straightened-out hanger or a plumber's snake tool, to remove material and debris that's creating the blockage. Reconnect the hose at both ends, push the washer back in, turn the power on, and run a test load to see if you fixed the error."

      "title": "Make sure your washer is level.",
      "content": "Make sure your washer is level. An uneven washer means it won't be able to drain completely. You'll spot water that hasn't drained sitting on one side of the washer or hear a loud thumping noise during the spin cycle if your washer isn't level. Many newer washers have adjustable front and back legs so you can make the washer level. Even without adjustable legs, you can use objects like flat pieces of wood to level your washer."

      "title": "Check that the drain hose is correctly positioned.",
      "content": "Check that the drain hose is correctly positioned. A kink in the hose can prevent the washer from draining. You should ensure that the hose does not exceed 6 cm from the floor; a height greater than this can prevent proper water drainage. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the lid switch.",
      "content": "Check the lid switch. If the lid switch on your GL washer doesn't work properly, the washer will not drain or spin. You can test it by following these steps: Press the lid switch down with your fingers. If your washer starts to drain, you need to adjust or clean your lid switch since your lid doesn't trigger it. If your washer doesn't respond to your test, replace the switch."

    {
      "title": "Adjust your laundry loads.",
      "content": "Adjust your laundry loads. A load that's too big or is unbalanced can prevent the washer from draining. If you've just washed a large load but it's not draining, here's what you can do: Move items from one side of the drum to the other side so that the items inside are even. Take out large items, like thick blankets, hoodies, and pants. Close the lid again and press Start to see if your washer will drain."

      "title": "Replace the drain pump, drive belt, or motor if needed.",
      "content": "Replace the drain pump, drive belt, or motor if needed. If you've done everything else in this list and the washer still won't drain, you might need to call for a professional repair. Go here to contact LG. You might even qualify for a free repair if your washer is new and still under warranty! According to Storey, you should be able to find the model number for your washer under the lid or behind the control panel of a top-load washer."
