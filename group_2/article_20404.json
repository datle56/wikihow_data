      "content": "Respect his needs by backing off. Everyone needs space sometimes, even from people they're into. Maybe your guy needs a break from your relationship, or maybe it has nothing to do with you. Either way, if he tells you he needs some time, give it to him. [1] X Research source It's understandable if this hurts your feelings. But it's important to respect other people's feelings, so ease up on trying to talk to him all the time. You can say something like, \"I know you need space, so I'll leave it up to you to reach out when you're ready.\" You're more likely to get him to talk to you again by showing that you are mature and respectful than by crossing his boundaries. Reader Poll: We asked 1592 wikiHow readers how they’d handle a partner pulling away, and 53% agreed that they’d give them space to come to a decision on their own . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "If he's upset with you, let him know that you are sorry. Maybe the reason that he's not talking to you is that you got in an argument or you did something to offend him. If you feel remorseful, tell him that you are sorry. Be genuine and only say this if you mean it. [2] X Research source Try saying, \"I'm really sorry that I argued with you about your brother. I know you guys are close, and I shouldn't have said what I did.\" Give him time to process and accept your apology. It's okay if he doesn't forgive you immediately. Just back off and let him heal on his own time."

      "content": "Don't expect things to get back to normal immediately. If you've been on a break or he just hasn't been responding to you lately, he clearly needed a little time for himself. To start talking again, don't text or call him every day. You can reach out to him, but don't follow up if he doesn't immediately respond. Start by being casual and see how things go. [3] X Research source Try sending a message that says, \"Hey, I was just checking in to see how you're doing. Let me know if you feel up to chatting or hanging out sometime.\" It might feel hard to not talk constantly, but it's really important to go slowly. This lets him know that you care about his feelings, and also shows that you're not needy."

Give him a call and let him know that you’re working on something and would love his help. Or make the request if you happen to bump into him around town. [4] X Research source Try saying, “Hi! I’m so glad I ran into you. I’m looking to buy a new bike and I know you love to ride. Would you mind giving me some pointers on what to look for?” It will be a bonus if he offers to head to the bike shop with you!"

To get things going again, suggest doing something that you both enjoy. Just try to keep it casual and low-stakes, so that you can sort of ease back into things.

      "content": "Ease up on trying to get his attention to give him time to miss you. It sounds counterintuitive, but sometimes the best way to reignite his interest is to be a little unavailable. Keep yourself busy with your friends and hobbies and resist the urge to reach out to him for a week or two. Hopefully, this will pique his interest again. [7] X Research source If he reaches out, be a little nonchalant. You could try, “Oh, hey! It’s good to hear from you. I’ve been so busy lately I hadn’t thought to touch base.”"

      "content": "Confidence is a really attractive quality, so let yourself shine. If he’s stopped talking to you, your confidence might have understandably taken a hit. But use positive self-talk to remind yourself how great you are. Instead of texting or calling and asking why he’s not talking to you, show that you’re okay. Only reach out when you have something to actually tell him. [8] X Research source If you recently scored a big promotion, let him know. He might be really into how proud you are of yourself."

And add some social media posts to show him what he’s missing. That doesn’t mean you need to go overboard, though. Any more than a post a day might make him just scroll on by.

Just keep living your authentic life and do the things that you enjoy. If they overlap with his interests, even better. Don’t try to act fake or change yourself to grab his attention. [10] X Research source If he’s not into you the way you are, you might not be missing that much by not talking to him. Try to spark up a genuine conversation. If he doesn’t respond, he’s the one that will be missing out."
