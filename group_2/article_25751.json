      "title": "Start with Romanian vowels.",
      "content": "Start with Romanian vowels. Romanian has a total of 7 vowels. Of these, the letters a , e , o , and u will likely give you the least trouble, so those vowel sounds are a good place to start. Pay attention to the position of your lips and tongue – this will help you pronounce unique Romanian vowel sounds. [2] X Research source A sounds like the a in the English word \"father.\" As you make this sound, keep your lips open and unrounded, with your tongue lying in the bottom of your mouth. E sounds like the e in the English word \"bed.\" Your lips are slightly open, less open than when you made the a sound, with your tongue up slightly and stretched towards the front of your mouth. O sounds like the aw in the English word \"yawn.\" Your lips should be rounded when you make this sound, the same as they would be if you were making the o sound in English. U sounds like the oo in the English word \"boot.\" Your lips should be rounded, the same as they would be when making this sound in English."

      "title": "Practice unique Romanian vowel sounds.",
      "content": "Practice unique Romanian vowel sounds. The i in Romanian may be more difficult for you to pronounce, as it has a unique sound that doesn't exist in English. The Romanian alphabet also has 2 more vowels: ă and î or â (which both make the same sound). [3] X Research source The letter i makes an ee sound, similar to the ee in the English word \"free.\" Ă , also called a schwa or an A-breve, makes an uh sound, similar to the a in the English word \"about.\" Â and Î , also known as A-circumflex and I-circumflex, are pronounced exactly the same way. Typically, î is used at the beginning of a word, while â is used in the middle. There is no equivalent sound in the English language, but it sounds similar to the u sound in the French word \"rue.\""

      "content": "Move on to Romanian consonants. Most Romanian consonants sound the same in Romanian as they do in English or in other Romance languages. There are also 2 consonants that are unique to Romanian: ţ and ş . [4] X Research source The ş makes an sh sound, similar to the sh in the English word \"she.\" The ţ makes a ts sound, similar to the ts in the English word \"cats,\" or the zz in the Italian word \"pizza.\" The letter g usually sounds like the g in the English word \"goat.\" If it is in front of an e , however, it sounds like the g in the English word \"general.\" The letter j always makes a zh sound, similar to the s in the English word \"pleasure.\" The letters k , q , w , and y are foreign letters, so they are pronounced the way the foreign or imported word would be pronounced in its original language. The letter h is silent if it falls between the letters c or g and e or i , as in the combinations che , chi , ghe , and ghi ."

      "content": "Memorize groups of letters that make a unique sound together. There are some combinations of letters in Romanian that make a different sound when they appear together than the individual letters that make up the group. These sounds aren't particularly tricky – you just have to remember that those letters combine to produce a different sound. [5] X Research source Ce and ci are pronounced with a ch sound, similar to the ch in the English words \"check\" or \"chin.\" Ge and gi are pronounced similarly to the ge in the English word \"gem,\" or the gi in the English word \"gin.\" Che and chi are pronounced with a k sound, similar to the k in the English word \"kit.\" Ghe and ghi are pronounced similarly to the g in the English words \"guest\" or \"give.\""

(sorry; excuse me – also used when getting someone's attention). Mersi (thank you – pronounced just like merci in French). Cu plăcere (you're welcome/my pleasure – response to \"thank you\").

Especially if you're in Romania, native speakers may start speaking rapidly to you in Romanian after you manage to start a basic conversation. If you want to continue practicing, you might encourage them to speak to you in Romanian. However, you still need to be able to tell them when you don't understand what they're saying. [10] X Research source Nu înțeleg means \"I don't understand.\" Nu is the Romanian word for \"no\" ( da means \"yes\"), so this phrase is constructed similarly to the Spanish no entiendo . If you're having a hard time understanding the person, you might say poți să repeți, te rog? which means \"please say that again,\" or poți să vorbești mai rar? which means \"please speak more slowly.\" You might also say nu vorbesc bine românește , which means \"I don't speak Romanian well.\" [11] X Research source If you don't think you're going to be able to communicate any further in Romanian, you can always say vorbiți engleza? which means \"do you speak English?\""

Romanian vocabulary is 77 percent similar to Italian, and 71 percent similar to Spanish. If you speak either of those languages, you likely already know quite a few Romanian words and phrases. [13] X Research source For example, the Romanian word for \"city\" is cetate . Compare this word to the English word \"city,\" the French word \"cité,\" the Italian word \"città,\" the Portuguese word \"cidade,\" and the Spanish word \"cuidad.\" There are thousands of cognates among all Romance languages and English if you look at combinatorial forms – words that end with a suffix, such as -tion , -ent , or -able . For example, any English word that ends in -tion has a cognate in a Romanian word that ends in -tune . By learning these forms, you can add thousands of words to your vocabulary.

Search online for free films and television shows that you can watch. You may also be able to find Romanian films in the foreign language section of your favorite video-streaming service. You likely won't pick up a lot of Romanian just by passively watching a movie or a television show. It can help to start with English-language captions, so you understand what's going on. Through time and repetition, you'll start understanding more Romanian words. At that point, you can turn the captions off. You can also turn on closed-captioning in Romanian to learn more about what the spoken words look like when written out."
