      "title": "Intense itching",
      "content": "Intense itching Sarcoptic mange usually causes frantic itching. The dog will usually scratch or chew at their skin relentlessly to relieve the itch. Often, this excessive scratching and chewing can lead to a secondary bacterial infection. The itchiness can distract the dog from eating, drinking, or sleeping. [1] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. Severe cases of mange that result in infections from bacteria or yeast can cause a white, crusty surface to form on the dog's irritated skin. Dogs suffering from bacterial infections may also often suffer weight loss, run a fever, and/or have enlarged lymph nodes. The first sign you’ll notice in the early stages of mange is ear itching. Your dog will spend an atypical amount of time trying to scratch their ears."

      "title": "Hair loss",
      "content": "Hair loss Localized demodectic mange, which is the least serious version of mange, usually results in a few bald patches where there’s missing hair. Usually, this small patch will not appear inflamed or irritated and will not cause serious itching. Sarcoptic mange will cause hair loss all over as the dog itches excessively. [2] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. With demodectic mange, the hair will typically fall out on its own. Dogs with sarcoptic mange will scratch so hard their fur gets pulled out in clumps."

      "title": "Spreading bald spots",
      "content": "Spreading bald spots If a case of localized demodectic mange does not go away on its own, it may eventually spread to the rest of the dog's body, resulting in generalized mange. The dog subsequently develops numerous bald spots. With sarcoptic mange, the dog’s bald spots will continue to spread as they scratch and itch. [3] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. The skin surrounding the bald spots may become red, scaly, and/or crusty. This irritation will cause the dog to scratch at their skin, which can lead to additional infections. This is why mange needs to be treated, it keeps causing additional problems if it’s left untreated. [4] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 June 2021."

      "title": "Swollen feet",
      "content": "Swollen feet Inspect your dog's feet to see if they're swollen or irritated. Some cases of demodectic mange cause a condition called demodectic pododermatitis. This occurs when the mites that cause mange become deeply embedded in the dog's feet, where they are very difficult to remove. This condition most often presents itself in the form of swollen, irritated feet.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source This swelling will usually be worse around the nailbeds, and it’ll often be accompanied by a secondary infection. Dogs with sarcoptic mange may also develop swollen paws from the excessive scratching."

      "title": "Poor grooming and self-care",
      "content": "Poor grooming and self-care Mange causes itching sensations and the longer the condition goes untreated, the more annoying and painful these sensations become. Eventually, a dog with mange will focus almost exclusively on soothing their itchiness, which can cause the dog to neglect normal activities like eating, drinking, or sleeping. [6] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. This is why dogs with mange often lose weight. They forget to eat when they’re hungry."

      "content": "Perform the pinnal-pedal scratch test to check for mange. The pinnal-pedal test is a classic reflex check used to determine whether a dog may have mange or not. To do it, grab one of your dog's ears. Hold the loose, floppy part of the ear between your thumb and index finger. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Wear gloves while handling a dog with mange and wash your hands thoroughly when you’re done. The mites that cause mange in dogs can irritate humans, but the irritation won’t be permanent (the mites can’t thrive on people), so don’t worry too much."

      "content": "Presume the dog has mange if they try to scratch. When you rub your dog’s ears, what do they do? If your dog has sarcoptic mange, they’ll move their back leg repeatedly like they’re trying to scratch an itch. If they don’t try to scratch, they probably don’t have mange. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Wash your hands with soap and water when you’re done. The mites that cause mange always love to gnaw on a dog’s ear. When you rub the dog's ear, it feels similar to the irritating itching sensation caused by the mites. So, if the mites are present, the dog will instinctually try to scratch."

      "content": "Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptic mange is what most people think of when they hear the word “mange.” It’s caused by a few different species of mite, and it can affect any dog regardless of their age, breed, or health. Sarcoptic mange typically causes intense itching that impacts the entire dog’s body (although it starts at the ears most of the time). [11] X Research source The different forms of mange are caused by different species of mite. These mites are related to the same species that cause scabies in people. Mange on its own isn’t deadly, but it will almost always lead to potentially lethal conditions if it’s left untreated."

It’s caused by a mite that lives on every dog, but only causes mange in dogs with immune systems that react strongly to the bugs. It’ll normally cause isolated or minor itching and slow hair loss. [12] X Research source Demodectic mange may also be called Demodex, which is the genus of mite that causes the mange."

If unresolved (possibly because of suppressed immunity, allergies, or endocrine issues), the condition may spread. This can lead to a whole body reaction, which is generalized mange. [13] X Research source Localized demodectic mange is most common in puppies. In about 90% of cases, localized demodectic mange in puppies disappears on its own without treatment in a month or two."

      "content": "Demodectic pododermatitis There is technically a third type of demodectic mange. If a dog has the classic symptoms of demodectic mange but they’re isolated to the dog’s feet, they have pododermatitis. Treatment of pododermatitis can be time consuming and often involves administering antibiotics and frequently dipping the dog's feet in a medication called Mitaban. [14] X Research source This is a pretty rare presentation of mange. Most of the time, a dog with itchy feet has allergies."

You may need to clip your dog’s hair if it’s especially long to make the treatment more effective. Because mange is almost always easiest to treat before it becomes severe, seeing your vet as quickly as possible is important. Cases of sarcoptic mange require a veterinarian more urgently than demodectic mange."
