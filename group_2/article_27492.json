There are sugar-free options as well. [1] X Research source Instant pudding mix is different from cook-and-serve pudding mix. It doesn’t need to be heated, and it takes less time to prepare . [2] X Research source This is because it contains modified cornstarch. [3] X Research source"

Set a timer for 5 minutes and leave the pudding to set on your counter. Or, put it in the fridge to chill it, especially if you won’t be serving it right away. If you want the pudding to be chilled before you serve it, refrigerate it for at least an hour. [5] X Research source"

Make sure you’re using Cook & Serve Jell-O pudding mix —instant pudding mix doesn’t need to be heated. [8] X Research source Check your package to learn the exact amount of milk you need to add for the amount of pudding mix you purchased. Usually, it’s 3 cups (750 ml) for a 5-oz box of pudding mix. If you’re using multiple Jell-O pudding mix pouches, multiply the amount of milk you need by the amount of packages you’re using. For example, if you use two 5-oz boxes, use 6 cups of milk."

Swap the 3 cups (750 ml) of dairy milk for 2 cups (500 ml) of chilled, unsweetened almond milk. Use the refrigerated almond milk, not the shelf-stable kind, since the additives in the latter interfere with the pudding’s texture. Prepare as usual. [13] X Research source There’s sugar in the pudding mix, so sweetened almond milk isn’t needed. Another alternative to almond milk is using 1 ½ cups (375 ml) of vanilla rice milk to prepare Jell-O Cook & Serve pudding."
