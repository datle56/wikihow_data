      "title": "Smooth out early pregnancy bloat with shapewear.",
      "content": "Smooth out early pregnancy bloat with shapewear. Hormone changes early in your pregnancy can cause bloating, so you may notice your waist expanding a little even before you get a true “bump.” Try putting on some slimming undergarments, like Spanx or control-top stockings, to tuck in your belly and help you fit into your pre-pregnancy clothes a little longer. If you’re concerned about what the pressure of shapewear might do to your growing baby, don’t worry. The protective layer of amniotic fluid in your womb will keep them nicely cushioned. [1] X Research source You might find tight garments more uncomfortable as your body grows, however."

      "title": "Hide your growing bump with a new slouchy style.",
      "content": "Hide your growing bump with a new slouchy style. Try tops that are loose, ruffled, or flouncy—like a flowy tunic or a blouse with ruching along the sides. Tops or dresses with empire waists are also a good way to go since they skim your figure without accentuating its curves. Avoid any form-fitting or tight pieces of clothing. [2] X Research source In cooler weather, big, slouchy sweaters are a comfy and fashionable way to conceal your baby bump."

      "title": "Distract the eye by adding volume and bulk to your outfit.",
      "content": "Distract the eye by adding volume and bulk to your outfit. Try putting on a loose blazer or a drapey cardigan sweater over a blouse or tunic. If you feel brave enough to try layers with contrasting prints or patterns, this can also minimize the appearance of your belly. [3] X Research source For example, you might wear a black-and-white polka dot blouse with a colorful floral blazer."

      "title": "Create a streamlined look to avoid a bulky appearance.",
      "content": "Create a streamlined look to avoid a bulky appearance. Create a slimmer silhouette and balance out your top half by wearing something more form-fitting on your legs. For example, you might try wearing a baggy tunic sweater with a pair of comfy leggings or skinny jeans. [4] X Research source In cooler weather, you could match a flowing blouse or shirt-dress with some tights or stretchy slim-fit jeans."

      "title": "Flashy prints are a great way to draw attention away from your changing shape.",
      "content": "Flashy prints are a great way to draw attention away from your changing shape. Experiment with colorful floral tops or geometric patterns like houndstooth and chevron. Or, stick to more conservative patterns like spots, checks, and stripes. [5] X Research source While conventional wisdom has it that vertical stripes are more slimming, studies have shown that wearing horizontal stripes is actually better for minimizing the appearance of width. Horizontal stripes are very popular in maternity wear, however, so be careful not to clue people in with too many striped outfits!"

      "title": "Take the attention away from your bump with a lower neckline.",
      "content": "Take the attention away from your bump with a lower neckline. Wear V-neck or scoop-neck shirts. You don’t have to wear anything so revealing that you feel uncomfortable, but drawing a little attention to your chest will take away any focus around your stomach."

      "title": "Eye-catching accessories can draw attention away from your baby belly.",
      "content": "Eye-catching accessories can draw attention away from your baby belly. Wear a long, oversized scarf and drape it on so it hangs down in front of your torso. Add bright or colorful accessories around your face to create a new point of focus for your outfit. Try a big pair of hoop earrings or a sparkly necklace. [6] X Research source Scarves in dark colors, like black or navy blue, may create an extra slimming effect."

      "content": "Combat morning sickness with small snacks. Keep crackers and ginger candy on hand to stave off nausea . Eating ginger candy or sipping ginger-based drinks (like ginger tea or old-fashioned ginger ale) can help settle your stomach and make your symptoms less obvious to others. Bland foods like plain crackers or dry cereal can also help combat nausea. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure to sip plenty of water throughout the day, too—getting dehydrated can make morning sickness worse. Another way to ease nausea is to wear an acupressure bracelet. These bracelets, which you can find at most drug stores, hit pressure points on your wrist to relieve some of your nausea. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you do feel the need to vomit, try going into the bathroom or finding another secluded spot where you can sit with your head between your knees for a few minutes. This may help the feeling pass or at least buy you time to find some privacy before you have to throw up."

      "title": "Say you're not feeling well.",
      "content": "Say you're not feeling well. You can use food poisoning or a standard stomach flu as a cover the first time this happens. Make an excuse like, “My partner had a stomach bug, and I must have caught it,” or “Oof, something from lunch isn’t sitting right.” If someone observes you throwing up or being sick multiple times, they may begin to catch on. After the first incident, try to be more careful or come up with new excuses."

      "content": "Disguise your frequent bathroom trips by drinking a lot of water. Start carrying around a large water bottle and proclaiming your new daily hydration goals. No one will suspect a thing when you start having to run to the bathroom once an hour. For closer friends and family, you could also explain away your constant bathroom breaks by claiming to have a urinary tract infection. If you’re trying to stay under the radar at work, try to use the bathrooms when your colleagues step away from their desks or go on lunch."

      "content": "Frequent doctor visits raise much more suspicion than the dentist. Make up a minor dental procedure that would require multiple visits. Use these visits as an excuse to cover up your recurring visits to the doctor. [9] X Research source For example, you could say that you’re getting a root canal, having a teeth whitening procedure, or filling a row of cavities."

      "content": "Pregnant people tend to stroke their stomachs subconsciously. Avoid touching your belly when you’re around people who aren’t in on your news. Try sticking your hands in your pockets instead. If you’re wearing a dress with pockets, this trick may also help disguise the growing bump under your hands. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Have an excuse prepared for social drinking situations. Try discreetly ordering a mocktail or virgin version of your favorite drink next time you’re out. Offer to mix the drinks yourself if you’re socializing at home—that way, you can mix your own alcohol-free cocktail without anyone noticing. [11] X Research source Alternatively, you can claim that you’re on a “cleanse” or are cutting back on drinking for health reasons—both of which are unlikely to prompt any additional questions. If you’re out with your significant other or a friend who knows your secret, you can both order the same drink. Pretend to sip yours, then sneakily switch drinks when their drink starts to get low. Other people drinking with you are unlikely to notice. You can also offer to be the designated driver on a night out, which gives you a great excuse to refrain from drinking—your friends will be so grateful that they won’t even question it!"

      "content": "Claim a new diet or cleanse. You can pass it off as a lifestyle change or health issue unrelated to pregnancy. [12] X Research source For example, if someone offers to buy you a cup of coffee, you could tell them you’re trying to cut back on caffeine to improve your sleep at night. If you have to turn away a soft cheese hors d’oeuvre, you can say something like, “My stomach’s been upset a lot lately, so my doctor recommended I try going dairy-free.”"

      "content": "Try to capitalize on the times when you don’t seem pregnant. If you know that you tend to feel more tired and queasy at particular times of the day, avoid planning exercise or other tiring activities with friends at those times. Figure out when you’re at your most energetic, and make time then. For example, if you feel too tired and sick for a morning jog with a workout buddy, you might suggest doing some afternoon yoga instead. Try saying something like, “I’ve been wanting to check out this new yoga class for a while. Want to give it a shot?” You can also make an excuse if necessary. If you’re too exhausted or nauseated to participate in an activity, you could say that you’ve got a mild stomach bug or that you’re busy trying to catch up on work deadlines."

Go to bed early and nap whenever you can. Look into a work-from-home or hybrid option with your employer. If you can, join meetings virtually rather than attending in person."

If a friend or family member invites you on a trip, make up a reason to regretfully decline. For example, you could claim that you’re trying to save money or you have a prior commitment that weekend."

      "content": "Holidays can be one of the hardest times to hide a pregnancy. Between rowdy festivities and loads of family time, you’ll have to come up with lots of excuses to get through the winter months. If you’re truly not feeling well or feel like you won’t be able to hide your pregnancy belly, you can tell your loved ones that you’re not up for this year’s holiday extravaganza. If you’re invited to a party you can’t get out of, show up early and get a bit of face time before ducking out early (you can blame your early exit on a sore stomach or holiday fatigue). While you’re at the party, make friends with the bartender or waitstaff. Explain your situation to them so that they know to serve you only non-alcoholic “mocktails” without you having to explicitly order them. You can also offer to host this year’s parties at your own home, which will give you the opportunity to mix your own drinks, select your own foods, and remain within your comfort zone."

Ask them to respect your desire for privacy until you’re ready to tell others. Try saying something like, “I wanted to let you know that I’m pregnant, but I’m not ready to share the news with anyone else yet. Please don’t talk to anybody about it without asking me first.” If you know that one of your close friends or family members can’t keep a secret to save their life, then you may want to hide your pregnancy from them until you’re ready to tell everyone."
