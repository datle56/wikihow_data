It makes your house smell like the holiday season, but without the mess!"

Have other family members help with the tree."

      "content": "Realize that some of your lack of feeling the Christmas spirit may be related to feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the seasonal festivities and preparations. Take time out. Go and do things for yourself now and then, to relieve the pressure of always preparing and being around frantic activity. You cannot please all of the people all of the time, so do not even try; by taking breaks, you will feel refreshed and able to cope with difficult people all the more constructively."

      "title": "Have reasonable expectations of the Christmas season.",
      "content": "Have reasonable expectations of the Christmas season. If you expect too much, you may feel disappointed. Instead, expect things to be low key and easy and you will feel a lot calmer and happier about the season, being able to enjoy the experience more. Realize that the commercialized version of Christmas is the marketer's dreams, not yours. Don't try to live up to that version and don't fall for thinking that you can buy happiness at Christmas time. Enjoyment does not mean expense."

      "title": "Be jolly.",
      "content": "Be jolly. Laugh more, see the funny side of things, even more so when things don't go to plan. Be genuine in your mirth; forcing jolly feelings will feel artificial. That might just mean watching something that makes you laugh for real or taking time out to watch a frolicking puppy or your children at play."
