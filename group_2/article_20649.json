      "title": "Create a fun video",
      "content": "Create a fun video introducing everyone and upload it. This is technically optional, but Family Feud is pretty adamant that this will make a huge difference. Use a camera to shoot a 3- to 5-minute video. Include each of your family members and have them introduce themselves, share a fun fact about themselves, and explain why they want to be on the show. [6] X Research source You can shoot the video with all 5 people together in the same room, or shoot separate vignettes and then edit the footage together . When making your introduction, state something interesting about yourself. You can talk about your place within the family, your job, your hobbies, or anything else that makes you stand out. The idea is to be informative, but unique! Do your best to make yourself stand out. Consider playing a mock round of the game or using props. Be energetic, but also be yourselves. You need to let the casting directors know how enthusiastic your family is about being on the show!"
