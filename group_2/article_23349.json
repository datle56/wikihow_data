If someone chats you from an unrecognized number pretending to be someone you know, it could be a scam—especially if they claim they've lost their phone and need money to buy a new one. [2] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source Scammers often find phone numbers and family/associate names on the dark web and use that information to scam WhatsApp users. If someone you know is trying to talk to you on WhatsApp from a different number: Call or text that person directly (using their real phone number) to ask if the person who is messaging you on WhatsApp is really then. Ask the person to video chat with you so you can confirm that they are who they say they are."

While there are many reasons why someone might have a phone number from a country other than the one they live in, if you're already doubting that the person is who they say they are, this should be another sign that the person isn't being honest with you. [4] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source There are many apps that allow users to create fake or temporary SMS phone numbers which can be used to register for WhatsApp. These apps might have country codes from all over the world, but a lot of them use the +1 (US) and +44 (UK) country codes. If you're not in the US or the UK and you see one of these country codes, someone might be using a fake number from one of those countries."
