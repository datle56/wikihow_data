      "content": "Start making contact slowly. If you want a specific guy to talk to you, start by making regular eye contact and smiling to show him that he's caught your attention. If he responds positively, but doesn't approach, go up to him instead. It's the 21st century. You don't have to wait. Just start saying \"hi\" and using his name on a regular basis. Give him a little wave. He'll get the message."

      "content": "Have a plan. All guys are different, and different situations call for different approaches. If you want to get a really social guy to notice you, try talking to him in a big group by cracking on him with some jokes. If you want to get a shy guy to notice you, that'd be a terrible idea. Try to talk to him one-on-one in private instead. But don't make it too obvious that you had a plan in the first place. Just be yourself. If you get tongue-tied when you approach a cute guy, make sure that you plan out the basic things that you're going to say before you try and say them. This will help calm you down and make you seem more natural while you're talking. Don't memorize a script. Even if you're feeling really nervous, it's a whole lot better to go in naturally and have a normal conversation than to try and recite something as if you're in a movie."

      "content": "Talk about something you have in common. Find out what he likes. Lots of guys like gaming, sports, and music, but all guys are different. Friend or follow him on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, any social media site that he has and try to figure out what he's interested in. Once you do this, you know if you have anything in common, and if you do, then you have a conversation topic. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 11 March 2021. Even if you're not particularly knowledgeable about a particular game or a particular sport, ask him some questions about it to try and get him to open up. Guys are usually a lot more comfortable talking about \"subjects\" instead of talking about themselves. Once you've got a conversation topic, you can start with a simple question about this topic, and this may lead to a wider conversation. For example, \"Hey, I heard you like (fill hobby in here) and was wondering if you could help me with (fill area in here).\""

      "content": "Have a partner in crime. Have one of your friends start you off, if you're feeling nervous. Probably one that already knows this guy. If you don't know anyone who knows him, I'm sure one of your friends will be happy to get to know him. You don't want to start out talking to him straight up. That will be awkward and uncomfortable. Have your friend talk you up. When your friend talks to him, have him/her bring you up in a few conversations. Tell your friend to explain how you are funny, and love to laugh, and how you have a great smile. Don't be afraid to talk yourself up while asking your friend to talk you up. Have your friend introduce you to him, and have her introduce him to you. Now is when it gets fun."

He'll find out sooner or later how you feel and he might feel the same. Just worry about initiating the conversation and keeping it fun and casual so he'll want to be the one to start it next time. Because a guy won't just talk to you out of the blue, that's not how relationships work. So you have to put a little effort in, and then he'll pull his weight too."

If this guy says something funny, cute, or smart, tell him what you thought. Say explicitly, \"That was really funny.\" Guys love it when you compliment them. [3] X Research source Guys also appreciate sarcasm often. Try going the sarcastic route and be like \"That wasn't funny at all,\" if your guy has a sense of humor. These guys go crazy when a girl is funny and she can joke around with him."

If they are, you should probably wait to flirt. If he's single, and only has a crush on someone else, make sure to be better friends with him than this other person. Try and get closer with him to win his affections."

Find out where his locker is, so you can bump into him in the hallway before class starts. Or just \"accidentally\" sit at his table during lunch. This can seem creepy if it becomes obvious. Don't start stalking this guy through the hallways. Don't bump into him more than a few times a week, if you go to school together. If you just live in the same town, no more than once a week."

Never try to change your personality to make yourself \"cooler\" or \"more noticeable.\" You may see other girls doing this and it might work for them, but those girls will be replaceable because they're not authentic. You are one of a kind. Be yourself, so when you do reel this guy in, he'll definitely want to keep you. Who wants to be someone they're not for the sake of a relationship? It doesn't matter how good-looking or \"perfect\" the guy is. If you have to compromise on your values, beliefs, ideals, worldview and personality to attract him, then he's not worth it."

The only secret is that you need to dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable and confident. The more confident you feel, the more attractive you'll be to a guy. Guys are attracted to confidence, because confident girls are not clingy, and do not need anyone to complete them. Being someone's other half is a big responsibility. What you're looking for is someone to complement you, not to complete you. [5] X Research source Make-up isn't always necessary, but if it helps you feel confident then go for it. A guy might think that if a girl believes that she is worth the time and effort to groom herself and to look pretty, then she is probably worth his time too."

[6] X Research source To stay out of the friend zone you have to keep flirting with him, if it's obvious he's not getting the hints, flirt more seriously. \"Accidentally\" bump his hand when you guys are walking, lean in a little closer than you need to when you're talking. and if you really want him to like you, or at least know if he does, just tell him. Make sure it's at the right time and place though, and do it with a flirty tone. Being friends is a good way to get to know someone first. The \"friend zone\" is kind of a myth in a lot of situations. Many close friendships turn into relationships later. If you like each other, you like each other. Simple as that.

They appreciate knowing that someone likes them (who doesn't?) and it'll make things a lot easier to get that out of the way. Just ask him if he likes you, and tell him you like him.

It can be a little awkward letting someone know that you like them. That's OK. It's a good idea to reach out via text or via DM on Instagram to chat a little bit outside of your one-on-one interactions. This can be much less awkward, and let you continue getting to know each other even better. Text him often, but not obsessively. and make sure he feels comfortable with texting you all the time. If not, take it back a step. Still just be friends for a while. If he is comfortable with it, then that's great!"
