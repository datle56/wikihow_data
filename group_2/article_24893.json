      "content": "Crank up the thermostat before your shower. You want to make sure that your bathroom and all adjacent rooms get as warm as possible, so remember to turn up the heat around 30 minutes before your shower. You won't need to keep your heat on full blast all day--just long enough to avoid becoming chilled when you're done."

      "title": "Add a space heater to your bathroom.",
      "content": "Add a space heater to your bathroom. Sometimes your regular heating system just doesn't cut it. A small space heater can add extra warmth. Find a place to put it that's as far from any water source as possible. Make sure it's facing the shower and enjoy your extra toasty bathroom! If you want to splurge on a fancier option, you can look into having overhead heat lamps installed in your bathroom."

      "title": "Place a draft stopper under the bathroom door.",
      "content": "Place a draft stopper under the bathroom door. If you have a large gap under your bathroom door, heat can escape since heat energy flows from warmer to colder spaces. You can stop this flow of precious warmth by purchasing a “draft stopper\" or “door sock” at a home improvement store. Or you can simply keep an extra bathmat or towel next to the door, and when it's time for your shower, roll it up and place it in front of the gap. [1] X Research source While not necessary for all bathrooms, blocking drafty door gaps can be especially important for small bathrooms or bathrooms that open into very cold rooms and hallways."

      "title": "Use separate towels for your hair and body.",
      "content": "Use separate towels for your hair and body. The best way to protect yourself from the cold is by removing excess water as quickly as possible. Drying your hair can leave a towel wet, soggy, and without enough absorbency to get your body dry fast. Having at least 2 towels ready will ensure that both your hair and body will benefit from a dry towel experience. If you have short hair, a small hand towel should be sufficient for drying your hair. However, if you have super long locks, feel free to use multiple towels for your hair. On a very cold day, it's worth it! Super-absorbent, microfiber towels are also good options for long hair. Consider washing your hair less frequently, if you're concerned about using too many towels. Most people don't need to wash their hair daily."

      "content": "Warm your towels. A warmer towel guarantees a warmer you! If you have a clothes dryer at home, toss your towels in for a few minutes on a hot cycle before getting in the shower. Alternatively, you can purchase a towel warmer or heated towel rod at most home improvement stores. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hang your towels as close to the shower as possible.",
      "content": "Hang your towels as close to the shower as possible. If you can drape them over the shower curtain without them getting wet, that's a great option, but a nearby towel rack works too. Not only will the proximity to the shower keep them warm, but it'll also ensure that they are close at hand, so you can dry off quickly after your shower. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the hottest water that you can tolerate. You want your shower to be at a hot—yet safe—temperature. The hotter the shower, the more steam you will generate. Water vapor retains heat well, so the shower steam will keep the surrounding air warm. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Open the shower door or curtain a bit towards the end of your shower.",
      "content": "Open the shower door or curtain a bit towards the end of your shower. By creating this small opening, you can let more steam seep into the rest of the bathroom. You may feel a little colder at first, but it will prepare your body for the colder room you're about to enter. Additionally, it helps to warm that room ever so slightly, helping to protect you from the shock of cold air. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Flip your towel around midway through drying off. Don't make the mistake of continuing to dry off with a damp towel. When you towel dry, the side you are using gets wet much faster than the outer side that isn't touching your skin. When you're about half through drying off, just flip the towel around to enjoy the dryer side!"

You can use that time in the bathroom to do other things like brush your teeth. By the time you leave the bathroom, you'll be ready to face the winter. [6] X Research source"
