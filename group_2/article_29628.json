Paint the front first, let it dry, then do the back. This will \"seal\" your pin and protect it. If you are using a decoupage glue, you may need to apply 3 to 4 layers. Let each layer dry before you apply the next one. Acrylic sealers come in brush-on and spray-on form."

[1] X Research source You can use any sort of image you like, but simple outlines (like those from a coloring book) might be easier to work with. If the image is on your computer, you will need to print it out onto regular printer paper. You can resize the image using an image editing program or a photocopier."

If the shrink plastic moves around too much, you can tape it down to the table. If you can't find shrink film, you can use any type of number 6 plastic. It is usually found on take-out containers. Look for the recycling symbol on the container. There should be a number inside of it. If it is a 6, you can use it."
