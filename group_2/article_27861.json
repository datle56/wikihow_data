      "content": "Prepare a double boiler. To create beeswax hair pomade, you first need to melt the beeswax so that it can easily mix with the other ingredients. Begin by placing a double boiler on the stovetop over medium low heat with about one inch (2.54 cm) of water in the bottom pot. If you don’t have a double boiler, you can make a makeshift double boiler by placing a small pot on the stove, pouring an inch (2.54 cm) of water inside, then placing a heat safe bowl on top of the pot of water. Use a bowl that is wide enough so that it can sit on the top of the pot rather than inside the pot."
