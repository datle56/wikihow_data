Marketing specialist Imran Alavi compares the process to a book’s index, with pages that contain certain pieces of information. [1] X Expert Source Imran Alavi Marketing Expert Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. Think of the internet as a massive book/encyclopedia, and search engines like Google are the indexes for it. Here are a few ways to check if your site is indexed: If you’re already logged into Google, click/tap here and switch your SafeSearch settings to “Off.” This ensures that your website isn’t being excluded by mistake. Type site:[your site URL] or site:[link to a specific page on your site] to search for a specific website or webpage on your site. If Google shows your site/page in the results, it’s successfully indexed. If your website/page doesn’t pop up, it isn’t indexed. Search your website on Google’s URL Inspection Tool . If you’ve set up your website with Google Search Console, check and see if Google has given your site a manual action (a flag that your website is spammy or suspicious in some way) or if any security problems were detected. These issues can affect your search engine ranking, but Google will outline how you can fix these issues in the provided report. [2] X Research source If you haven’t set your site up with Google Search Console yet, go here . Why isn’t my site performing well? Different factors can play into your website’s search engine performance, like its age and previous ownership. For instance, if the website was previously managed by someone unreliable, Google may have given the site a manual action in the past."

Alavi describes a sitemap as “multiple pages” that are “within a website.” [3] X Expert Source Imran Alavi Marketing Expert Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. Creating a sitemap essentially provides Google with a clear roadmap to the pages to “crawl” and index, which can help you to appear on Google. [4] X Research source You might not need a sitemap if your website is pretty tiny (less than 500 total pages). [5] X Research source For instance, a young professional’s small-scale portfolio website wouldn’t necessarily need a sitemap, while a large website like wikiHow definitely does. “Crawling” is when Google’s system finds, downloads, and inspects new web content for indexing purposes.

Try to design your website to be as intuitively navigable as possible—for example, a home menu bar with static buttons is easier to navigate than a menu the user needs to hover their mouse over. Google will have an easier time indexing websites with simple and intuitive navigation. [7] X Research source Take a closer look at your webpage URLs and make sure they’re easy to understand. Does the page use something skimmable, like “/example,” or is the URL parameter-based (e.g., “fakewebsite.com?page=1204”)?

This can be helpful to keep in mind as you start researching keywords for your site!

Conway explains how your content should be “at least 1,000 words at a minimum.” While 350- and 500-word blog posts could cut it back in the 2010s, short word counts just aren’t enough anymore. Ideally, you should try to “shoot for 2,000 words” or more to put yourself ahead of your competitors. [24] X Expert Source Ryan Conway Marketing Expert Expert Interview. 17 March 2021.
