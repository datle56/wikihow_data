This is especially important in terms of how you conduct yourself in relationships. If you know yourself to be a jealous person or you are insecure in relationships, then strive to understand why you feel this way. What lessons have you learned from previous relationships that you can apply to the new relationship? Remember: confidence is one of the most desired traits that a man will look for in a partner.

This might be someone who is manipulative, physically or verbally abusive, controlling, jealous, chronically angry, or isolating. These types of unhealthy relationships will not allow you to flourish or be happy, and they will erode your self-respect. A good boyfriend should not make you afraid, tense, or stressed. Rather, this person should help alleviate these feelings."

Plus, you have the added benefit of your friend knowing you well and being able to assess the compatibility between you and someone else. Ask your friends if they know anyone who might be a good match for you. If you think it's appropriate, ask a few co-workers if they have single friends who are looking for a relationship."

When you're on a first date, positive body language will signal your interest to your date. Try these steps for conveying positive body language: For example, maintain eye contact with your date. This demonstrates your interest in his company, and his interest in yours. Smiling will convey that you feel easygoing, open and relaxed. Don't stand too far away.

Unless they're deal-breakers, like he made really racist comments all through dinner, think about giving him a second chance.

      "content": "Think back to your first impression of him. First impressions will often mark the success of a relationship, even if we're not deliberately thinking of first impressions in this way. When we meet someone new, especially a potential partner, we are evaluating whether this initial interaction is positive or negative. If it is positive, we will likely seek more information about the person. If it is negative, we may find that the relationship will be too much effort. Similarly, we may be subconsciously looking for similarities between ourselves and this potential partner. We are more likely to pursue a relationship with people who are similar than those who are dissimilar. [13] X Research source"

Get a sense of what your potential boyfriend is like with others. Pay attention to how he treats you in front of his friends. If he is rude or indifferent to you, this is a problem.

Observe how he interacts with other women when he's with you. Is he overly flirtatious, or does he only have eyes for you? Does he comment about how attractive other women are?

      "content": "Make sure he turns off his phone. A good boyfriend will pay attention to you, not his phone. It's okay to check messages once in a while, but if he is constantly checking sports scores or social media updates from friends, his attention is wandering away from you. A gentle reminder to put away his phone may be warranted, but if you have to constantly remind him, there might be a larger conversation about why he is choosing to ignore you. Make sure you also turn off your phone. He needs to feel like you're paying attention to him too."
