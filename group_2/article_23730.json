If you're using the desktop version of Microsoft Outlook for Windows and have Office 2016 or earlier, you can increase your mailbox size for PST and OST data files beyond the 50 GB limit by editing the registry. To open the registry editor, press the Windows key, type regedit , press Enter , and click Yes to confirm. It is not possible to increase the mailbox size in Outlook 2019, Outlook 365, or any version of Outlook for Mac. We don't recommend increasing the size much higher than 50 GB, as too large of a file puts you at risk of corrupting the entire mailbox. Before you edit the registry , we recommend making a backup so you can undo your changes if needed. To make a backup, go to File > Export , choose a location, name the backup, and click Save .
