      "content": "Put yourself out there more. As a loner, your tendency is likely to hole up at home, which means you don't have as much practice interacting with other people as social butterflies. The more you put yourself into social situations, the better you'll get at interacting with people. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Know your limits. Yes, you should try to socialize more. However, it's fine to stick to the types of gatherings you feel most comfortable in. For instance, you may find that you don't like loud, raging parties. On the other hand, you may find small parties, especially ones that include a couple of your friends, are more to your liking. Pick situations your comfortable in."

      "title": "Ask people to introduce you.",
      "content": "Ask people to introduce you. If you feel like you're not meeting enough people, try asking someone you know to introduce you to someone new. This technique works very well in social gatherings where you may not want to run up to someone by yourself to start an introduction. Most people are happy to introduce you to someone else, especially if they know you're shy or introverted. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try an activity where socializing isn't the main focus. That is, if you go to a party, you're there to socialize. If you go to a club meeting or hobby enthusiast group, your focus is on the issue or the hobby. You may find it's easier to socialize with a group of people when you have a topic to focus on and when the setting is a bit more rigid. [3] X Research source Another activity you could use to meet people is volunteering. Try volunteering at your local library, food bank, or homeless shelter."

One way you can use this person expertise is to propose different interactions you've found yourself in that puzzle you. Maybe an extrovert can help you talk your way through them.

      "title": "Pick several subjects.",
      "content": "Pick several subjects. If you find you're often at a loss about what to talk about when you meet new people, try coming up with topics before a social gathering. You could pick something in the news (though you may want to skip anything too controversial), a book you've read recently, or a movie you've seen. You could also decide to talk about some of your favorite restaurants or your hobbies. Just try to pick something you think other people might have an interest in. Come up with several talking points for each topic ahead of time. That way, you know exactly how to respond if someone else brings the topic up."

      "title": "Add details.",
      "content": "Add details. When someone asks you a question, try to make your answer longer than a word or two. If you just answer \"I'm okay,\" that doesn't give the other person any chance to respond. Instead, try something such as \"I've been doing pretty well. I just got a new laser cutter machine at home, so I've been enjoying my time trying to figure out how it works.\" [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Enunciate your words. Sometimes as a loner, you may find that people don't always hear or understand what you're saying. Introverts and shy people naturally tend to speak more softly or sometimes even mumble their words. If you find yourself in a conversation where a person is constantly asking you to repeat yourself, trying slowing down and enunciating your words more. You may not even need to speak louder, just more distinctly."

      "content": "Get past your feelings of awkwardness. Many shy or introverted people feel a bit awkward in groups. It's fairly normal, in fact. Nonetheless, you should forge ahead. Over time, social interactions may come to feel less awkward for you, and anyway, you shouldn't let those feelings stop you from interacting with people, if that's your desire. [6] X Research source If you're having trouble working up the nerve, try reducing your stress first. For instance, you can try a short meditation before you approach someone. Find a quiet place, and take a moment to focus on your breathing. Try counting to four as you breath in through your nose and to four again as you breath out through your mouth. Focus on your breathing until you feel some of your anxiety calming down. Another way you can help yourself is to decide what you're going to say before you approach the person. That way, you are prepared ahead of time. However, try not to think about what you shouldn't say, as it may pop out of your mouth."

It says, \"I think you're interesting, and I want to talk with you some more.\" If you can make eye contact with the person, even better. Eye contact shows you're listening and that you are engaged in the conversation."

It may be tempting to think about what you want to say next, but it's more important to actually hear what she has to say.

I wish I wasn't allergic.\" Another way to show you're listening is to ask relevant follow-up questions."
