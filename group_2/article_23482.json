      "content": "Spend time with the person, if possible. When you spend a lot of time with someone, you begin unconsciously imitating things like their voice. [5] X Research source Making an effort to be around the person you're imitating will naturally make you speak and act more like them. If you admire a friend or classmates, try to make plans with that person regularly. Meet for coffee every Tuesday, for example. If you don't have a personal relationship with this person, you can do things like watch interviews with them online. While it is likely not as effective as spending one-on-one time with someone, you may take on some of their behavior if you watch videos of the person."

      "content": "Be intentional about imitating the person. Do not be shy about the fact you're imitating someone.

      "content": "Dress like the person. Dressing like someone you admire can help you feel more like them. Take a shopping trip and purchase the type of clothes and accessories the person would normally wear. A change in your wardrobe can result in a change in your attitude. However, don't copy their look exactly, especially if it's someone you know. If you wear the exact same clothes as a classmate, for example, they may take offense. [7] X Research source Instead, strive to pick clothes that resemble the general sense of the person's style. For example, say the person wears a lot of bright colors. Pick brightly colored clothing instead of seeking out the exact same striped sweater a person wore to class one day."

Instead of getting angry, make a joke about yourself."

      "content": "Add your personal eccentricities to your imitation. As you get more adept at imitating your role model, you can start adding some of your own unique charm to your imitation. Make the imitation your own. [10] X Research source For example, you admire that the person uses a lot of references when talking. Branch away from using their specific references.
