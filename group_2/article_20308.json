If you're finding lots of negative reviews calling that organization a scam, that's a red flag. On top of that research, look into the offer's details.

Chances are high that if you pay that fee, you won't get the laptop and will lose out on $600. Reputable sites ship the item to you first before collecting any fees. Collecting an upfront fee is a classic scam and no merchandise ever ships after the upfront cost is collected."

      "content": "Beware of phishing and malware. On top of the upfront fee scam, you also don't want to fall victim to other schemes! Watch out for phone calls or ads that promote free laptops, as they could simply gather your information without sending you a laptop. You don't need to download any software to get a free laptop and you should NEVER provide your social security number for one either. Make sure to look at the links closely in your email. Is it from a trusted source? These links may redirect you to pages packed with malicious code that look identical to the site you believe it's from, then hackers end up stealing your personal information! To avoid these fake online pages , make sure that the address bar shows a green lock icon. If you believe you've fallen prey to a scam, there are ways that you can report it so others don't make the same mistake!"
