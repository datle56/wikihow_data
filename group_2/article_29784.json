      "content": "Place a sturdy rubber band over your left thumb and index finger. Put the rubber band near the end of your fingers and stretch your fingers out slightly so the rubber band stays taut. Turn your hand so that your palm is facing you. [1] X Research source Choose a rubber band that's not too wide, as wide rubber bands are more difficult to stretch. Also, pick a slightly longer rubber band than normal. There's not a set width and length, but if you're having trouble stretching it around your fingers, it probably won't work."

      "content": "Lift the band closest to you over the top band and pull the top band out. When holding your palm toward you, you'll see 2 bands. Push your right index finger underneath the first one and hook your finger over the second band, pulling it out. It should go underneath the first band and out toward your palm.

      "content": "Twist the loop over itself and hook it on your pinkie. Use your right hand to twist the band you just pulled out to the right over itself. [3] X Research source It should make a little teardrop-shaped loop that you can hook over your pinkie. [4] X Research source You should now have a triangle shape stretched between your index finger, thumb, and pinkie. The rubber band should twist around each finger to make a teardrop-shaped loop, and the triangle should be on the inside edges of your fingers, not the outside."

Insert your right index finger near the inside of your left thumb in the loop made by the rubber band, going down as you do. Go up through the middle triangle (with the thumb loop over your finger) to grab the band that's between your left index finger and your pinkie. Draw the band out the way you came in, through the thumb loop. [5] X Research source You should now have a square in the middle. Keep holding on to the loop you pulled out with your right index finger."

[7] X Research source Your right index finger and right middle finger will be holding on to 2 points of the star."

[8] X Research source The double star is a continuation of the single star, so get your hands in position with your left index finger, left thumb, left pinkie, right index finger, and right middle finger each holding a point of the star. [9] X Research source You will need a long rubber band that's not too wide. You should easily be able to stretch it between 2 hands. However, it should be small enough to maintain tension over 3 fingers on one hand."
