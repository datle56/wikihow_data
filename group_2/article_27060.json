You will get a flatter, thinner, and crispier cookie without eggs. You can substitute applesauce instead of an egg, but applesauce also has a lot of moisture in it.

Because they will melt a lot when they cook, try to keep at least four inches between each cookie. [11] X Research source If you want more evenly distributed and uniform cookies, use an ice cream scoop. Using parchment paper will make sure that the cookies do not stick. It also helps your baking sheets last longer. If you are not going to cook all of the cookies, pop the remainder off of the parchment paper and place them in a freezer bag.
