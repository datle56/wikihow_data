You don't need to get a full makeover, but more often than not, a little basic grooming will do the trick. [1] X Research source Throw on some fresh clothes, take a peek in the mirror, and make sure you’re looking your best. For guys: Give yourself a good, close shave beforehand. Stubble often feels rough and uncomfortable to the other person and could take away from the pleasure of the kiss. A dab of cologne can also be a good idea, but don't bathe yourself in it. For girls: Applying an appealing scent can also be a powerful tool. Focus mostly on lotions since these make your skin look smoother while providing a more subtle hint of fragrance. Add a hint of body spray or perfume on top of that."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source That goes for you too, guys! Nobody likes kissing dry, cracked lips, so throw on some lip balm. Consider glosses, lip stains, and lipsticks as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Avoid sticky glosses or lip products that contain glitter. Something with a little sheen can make your lips seem more kissable, but you don't want your lips to look unnaturally wet, either. If you don't have time to moisten your lips before the kiss, quickly run your tongue over your lips to add a little more moisture right before the kiss. Keep in mind that doing this too much can actually dry out your lips, though."

When in doubt, just ask! Asking can be super hot. Say, “I want to kiss you, can I?” or just, “Can I kiss you?”"
