      "title": "Align the jacket shoulder seams with the edge of your shoulders.",
      "content": "Align the jacket shoulder seams with the edge of your shoulders. A fitted shoulder gives you a crisp look. Put on the jacket and check that the shoulder seam ends just before your shoulder does. If it’s perfectly aligned with your shoulder, that works, too. If it goes beyond your shoulder, try a different jacket that fits better. [1] X Research source Nailing the shoulder width is very important because it can’t be tailored afterward. To test the shoulder width, lean against a wall. If your shoulder hits the wall before the jacket shoulder, then the width is right. If the jacket shoulder pad hits the wall first, then it’s too big."

      "content": "Get a jacket with high arm holes that are even with your armpits. Low arm holes make the suit look droopy and restrict your range of motion. so get a jacket with arm holes that rest even with your armpits. Test the jacket by moving your arms up and down.

      "content": "Check that your knuckles line up with the jacket's bottom hem. Put the jacket on, stand up straight, and droop your arms to the side. On a well-fitting jacket, the bottom hem should be just about even with your knuckles. This way, it won’t look too long or too short. [3] X Research source Some men prefer a shorter jacket, which is also acceptable. This works well for less formal occasions and a slim-fitting jacket. Trends for jacket length change, and a lot of it is up to personal taste. Feel free to play with this rule if you see a jacket you like that isn’t quite the right length."

      "title": "Confirm that the sleeves reach just above your wrist.",
      "content": "Confirm that the sleeves reach just above your wrist. A standard jacket sleeve should show about half of your shirt cuff. For most men, this means the sleeve should stretch to just about your wrist. Hold your hands at your sides to check if the sleeve length is right for you. [4] X Research source The sleeve length is very variable, and some men prefer them lower or higher. It’s not a make-or-break feature for most suits. It’s easy for a tailor to adjust the sleeve size, so you can always make changes later on if you decide you don’t like the fit."

Button yours up and make sure the lapels are resting flat against your chest. If they're pushing up or bunching, then the jacket is too big. Also push your thumb between the button and your stomach. It should feel a little snug. If not, then get a jacket that fits a big tighter. [5] X Research source If the jacket sits too loose on your chest or torso, a tailor can make alterations to fix this. Don't reject a suit for these issues if you really like it."

A peak lapel juts out and points toward your shoulders. This is a bit flashier and more common at fancy parties and events, but a notch lapel will work just fine for these events too. There are also shaw lapels, that are straight the whole way down. These are more common on tuxedos though."
