      "content": "Fill a pot with water and a cinnamon stick. Pour 1 ½ cups of water into a medium saucepan. Add 1 cinnamon stick, and cover the pot with a lid before placing it on the stovetop. [1] X Research source You can use a glass tea kettle instead of a saucepan if you prefer. If you want a stronger tea, break the cinnamon stick into several pieces."

    {
      "title": "Bring the pot to a slow boil.",
      "content": "Bring the pot to a slow boil. The cinnamon flavor comes out of the stick when it’s slow boiled, so set the stove’s burner to medium low. Allow it to come to a boil, which should take approximately 15 to 25 minutes. [2] X Research source Don’t be alarmed if the water’s only a pale yellow color even when it comes to a full boil. It takes some time for the tea to darken."

    {
      "title": "Allow the tea to steep for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the tea to steep for 15 minutes. Once the water and cinnamon mixture has come to a complete boil, remove it from the burner. The tea must cool slightly for the rest of the cinnamon to be released from the stick, so let the tea steep for approximately 15 minutes off the heat. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source As the tea steeps, it will start to darken, turning a golden red color."

    {
      "title": "Strain the tea into a mug and serve.",
      "content": "Strain the tea into a mug and serve. After you’ve allowed the tea to steep for a while, pour it through a very fine strainer into a mug. The strainer will remove any bits of the cinnamon stick that might have broken off during brewing. Serve or drink the tea right away. [5] X Research source During the steeping and straining process, the tea will cool. If it’s not as hot as you’d like it when it’s finished, pour the strained tea back into the pot and reheat it."

      "title": "Combine the cinnamon stick and boiling water in a mug.",
      "content": "Combine the cinnamon stick and boiling water in a mug. Place a cinnamon stick in a mug or teacup. Next, pour 1 cup (237 ml) of boiling water over the stick so that it’s fully submerged. Using filtered water usually results in better tasting tea."

    {
      "title": "Cover the mixture and let it steep.",
      "content": "Cover the mixture and let it steep. When the cinnamon stick and water are combined in the mug, cover it with a saucer. Allow the mixture to steep for 10 minutes so the cinnamon stick starts to release its flavor. If you don’t have a saucer to cover your mug, you can use a piece of foil."

    {
      "title": "Add the tea bag and steep for several more minutes.",
      "content": "Add the tea bag and steep for several more minutes. When the cinnamon stick has finished steeping in the water, add 1 bag of black tea. Allow the tea bag to steep in the mug with the cinnamon for another two to three minutes. You can use regular or decaffeinated black tea, depending on your preference. If you aren’t a fan of black tea, you can substitute rooibos tea or honeybush tea."

      "title": "Mix in some sweetener and serve.",
      "content": "Mix in some sweetener and serve. After the tea bag has steeped for a few minutes, remove it and the cinnamon stick from the mug. Add sugar, stevia, or the sweetener of your choice if desired, and drink immediately. If the tea has gotten cold while you waited for it to steep, reheat it in the microwave. Heat it on high in 10 second intervals until it reaches the desired temperature."

Cover the pan, and place it on the stovetop. [6] X Research source For a stronger cinnamon flavor, break the sticks into several smaller pieces."

      "content": "Allow the mixture to simmer. Turn the burner under the pot to medium low, and bring it to a gentle simmer. Let the mixture continue to simmer for at least an hour to ensure that all of the flavor from the cinnamon and ginger is released. [7] X Research source You’ll know that the tea is simmering when you see gentle bubbling in the pot. Watch it closely to keep the tea from coming to a full boil."

      "title": "Serve with honey.",
      "content": "Serve with honey. The recipe makes 3 quarts (2.8 l) of tea, so pour it into individual mugs or teacups for serving. Mix in some honey to taste, and serve. [9] X Research source You can prepare the cinnamon ginger tea several hours ahead of time, but be sure to reheat it before serving."
