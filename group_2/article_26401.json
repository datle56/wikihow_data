      "title": "Opt for full-length, flared jeans.",
      "content": "Opt for full-length, flared jeans. If you don't mind the flare style, look for jeans with a flare around the leg rather than straight-leg varieties. This draws attention to your bottom half, making your legs look longer. [1] X Expert Source Alison Deyette Professional Stylist Expert Interview. Make sure that the flare jeans do not drag on the floor as this can make you look shorter rather than taller."

      "title": "Go for high-wasted, form-fitting dresses.",
      "content": "Go for high-wasted, form-fitting dresses. If you like to wear dresses, consider dresses that cinch at the waist just above the hips. This makes your body look well-proportioned, lengthening your frame overall. Avoid dresses that are long and loose as this can make you look like you're drowning in them, drawing attention to your height. [2] X Research source For example, go for a dress with a pencil line skirt that cinches at the waist. Take a pass on the baggy maxi dress."

      "title": "Pick high-waisted pants or skirts.",
      "content": "Pick high-waisted pants or skirts. A higher waist helps make your legs look longer, stretching out your figure overall. When selecting pants or skirts, look for ones that are meant to be buttoned and zipped at the waist. Bottoms that fall at the hips are much less likely to lengthen your frame. [3] X Expert Source Alison Deyette Professional Stylist Expert Interview. If you are having trouble finding high-waisted garments, look for vintage styles. Many of them tend to have higher waists."

      "title": "Make sure the crotch doesn't drop.",
      "content": "Make sure the crotch doesn't drop. If you find your pants sag near the crotch, either have them tailored or find another pair. Saggy pants in general are unfashionable and can be especially un-flattering if you're on the shorter side. If your pants look like they're sagging, this will make you look shorter overall. If you can't get new pants, pull them up so that they don't sag, and wear a belt to keep them up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the legs of pants at your ankles.",
      "content": "Keep the legs of pants at your ankles. This is a must if you're trying to look tall, as saggy legs draw attention to your shorter frame. If you really struggle to find a pair, you can always have a pair tailored or cuff the legs yourself."

    {
      "title": "Go for v-necks.",
      "content": "Go for v-necks. For any top you wear, go for a V-necks whenever possible. V-necks work great to add height and stretch out your frame, so always be on the lookout for v-necks when shopping. [4] X Research source For example, go for a v-neck t-shirt with flared, high-waisted jeans. When wearing a button down, leave a few buttons undone and fold the corners of the shirt over to create a v-neck."

    {
      "title": "Tuck in your tops.",
      "content": "Tuck in your tops. If your torso looks shorter and your legs look longer, you're going to look taller. To lengthen your frame, make a habit of tucking in your shirts whenever you can. This works particularly well with pants that are already high-waisted. [5] X Research source For example, if you're wearing a dress shirt and dress pants to work, tuck in the shirt for a professional look that lengthens your frame."

    {
      "title": "Opt for slimmer sleeves.",
      "content": "Opt for slimmer sleeves. If your arms are hugged too tightly against your body, this can create sight lines that shorten your overall look. Slimmer sleeves are a great choice if you want to look taller, as they make your arms look distinct. This lengthens your entire frame. For example, go for a suit with a slim, form-fitted jacket that's tighter around the sleeves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick form-fitted tops.",
      "content": "Pick form-fitted tops. The bulkier your top looks, the more your figure drowns in your clothing. This makes your figure look smaller and shorter overall. Go for tops that are a little tighter and more form-fitted to elongate your frame. For example, stay away from big, bulky sweaters in the winter. Instead, go for sweaters that hug your figure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear shoes that stretch out your frame.",
      "content": "Wear shoes that stretch out your frame. High heels, or shoes that simply have a higher lifting heel, are the obvious choice. If you feel uncomfortable in heels, go for sandals or nude-colored shoes that blend into your feet and legs. Knee-high boots can also work to stretch out your frame. [6] X Research source When choosing heels, opt for nude-colored ones, or match them to your tights. This will help stretch your legs out even more."

    {
      "title": "Pick short jackets or cardigans.",
      "content": "Pick short jackets or cardigans. If you're wearing a jacket, cardigan, or something similar with an outfit, keep it shorter. Shorter tops help your torso look shorter and your legs look longer, creating the illusion of height. Go for jackets and cardigans that fall above your bottom. For example, if you wear a suit to the office, look for one with a shorter jacket that comes down just to your hips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Match your socks and pants.",
      "content": "Match your socks and pants. If you wear socks that are clearly visible, make sure the socks don't contrast too sharply from your pants. A more monochromatic look will stretch out your body, making you look taller overall. For example, black pants can be paired with black socks."

    {
      "title": "Wear hats or scarves.",
      "content": "Wear hats or scarves. Drawing attention upward, towards your face, can make you look taller by balancing out your top and bottom half. Try wearing a hat or wrapping a scarf around your neck. Also, pick clothing that compliments your facial features like eye color. This will direct attention upward. For example, if you have big, brown eyes, opt for a brown scarf or hat."

    {
      "title": "Try a slim belt.",
      "content": "Try a slim belt. Belts can be great to cinch pants, skirts, or dresses at the waist, making your legs look longer and more defined. For the best results, wear a skinnier belt. Anything big or bulky will make your frame look smaller and shorter in comparison. For example, if you have a dress that's a little looser around the middle, cinch it at the waist with a slim-fitted belt."

    {
      "title": "Match all your tones or go for a monochromatic look.",
      "content": "Match all your tones or go for a monochromatic look. Regardless of the accessories you choose, keep them in the same color family as your outfit. Wearing different colors divides a person’s body into separate segments. Wearing the same color, or tones that are within the same range, creates one solid line for an observer’s eye to pick up. For example, if you're wearing a black sweater with black dress pants, pair it with a skinny black belt and scarf."

    {
      "title": "Wear accessories higher up.",
      "content": "Wear accessories higher up. Wear a pocket square or bright tie to add detail to a suit, or look at casual shirts with epaulets and upper pockets. When you wear details higher up, it encourages an observing eye to move up from your feet toward your head, causing the eye to take in more height."

      "title": "Stand up straight.",
      "content": "Stand up straight. Standing up straight can make you look taller. To stand straight, lift you head slightly forward. Lengthen your torso and spine. Widen your shoulders and keep your feet planted firmly on the ground, supporting your body and propelling it upward.

      "content": "Sit up straight. You can look tall when sitting by maintaining proper posture. Keep your spine straight and you shoulders dropped when you're confined to a desk. Be aware of your posture each time you're sitting to make sure you're maintaining good posture. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Stretch your hips and chin at your desk.",
      "content": "Stretch your hips and chin at your desk. Doing stretches at your desk can make it easier to maintain good posture. Work on stretching your chin and hips during moments you're working at a desk or sitting during the day. To stretch your chin, do chin tucks. Sit straight with your shoulders held back and pull your chin straight back to give yourself a double chin. Hold this for 30 seconds. Repeat this process three times. To work your hips, take a break from your desk to get up. Kneel on one knee an arm's length away from a wall. Press onto the wall and press down on the knee on the floor. Hold for several seconds and then switch knees and repeat."

Continue stretching for as long as is comfortable. Then, relax and take 10 deep breaths. Repeat this process for five to ten minutes. [9] X Research source"
