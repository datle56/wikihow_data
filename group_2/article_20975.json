      "content": "Take the ARL to Phaya Thai from Suvarnabhumi Airport. If you're heading to Asiatique straight from Bangkok's international airport, start your journey by taking the Airport Rail Link (ARL) into the city center. Its final stop is at Phaya Thai Station, which directly links to the BTS Sky Train (the city's elevated mass transit line). If you're already in Bangkok, ask at your hotel for directions or use a Sky Train map to plan your route. You can find Sky Train maps online. Transport signs and maps are usually printed in both Thai and English throughout Bangkok, especially in tourist areas. When you're planning your trip to Asiatique, keep in mind that it's open daily, but only from 5 pm to 12 am (17:00 - 24:00) local time."
