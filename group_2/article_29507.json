      "content": "Choose a sewing pattern for basic elastic-waist pants. Look for the keyword \"pull-on pants\" and a pattern with no zippers or pockets. Ideal patterns can be found in the Pants and Skirts, Sleepwear, and Men's/Unisex sections of most pattern catalogs."

      "title": "Choose a fabric for your pants.",
      "content": "Choose a fabric for your pants. The pattern envelope will include recommendations on the kind and amount of fabric you will need. Fabric store employees are always happy to make recommendations, as well. Generally, woven fabric with 1-2% spandex is great for pants. Try wool, cotton, polyester, a silk and cashmere blend, or a silk and wool blend. Choose a fabric that is easy to work with for this project. Fabrics without much stretch are easier to work with than knits. A cute flannel or a cotton print would make a great choice for a pair of pants. Be sure to note the care instructions for the fabric you choose; these will be printed on the end of the fabric bolt."

You will usually need between 2.5 to 3 yards (2.3 to 2.7 m) of fabric, depending on the width of the fabric. Purchase a spool of thread that will match or coordinate with your fabric. Look for a variety marked \"all purpose\" or \"sew-all.\" Purchase a package of 3/4-inch elastic for the waistband."

      "title": "Prewash your fabric.",
      "content": "Prewash your fabric. It is important to prewash the fabric before you begin to cut and sew to minimize shrinkage, and to remove fabric sizing and excess dye. Make sure to prewash new fabric separately from other garments to avoid staining your clothes! Machine sew a quick straight stitch 1/2 away from each cut edges of the fabric before washing to prevent loosely-knit fabric from unraveling. Wash and dry the fabric according to the care instructions. For cotton fabrics, including flannel, machine wash in warm water using your normal detergent, and machine dry on high.

If you have your materials ready and your sewing station set up and ready to go, the actual construction of the pants will be a breeze! Read the pattern instructions included in the envelope. Thread your sewing machine and load the bobbin with the thread you plan to use. Set up your ironing board, or prepare an ironing surface. You can lay out several layers of towels on the floor or table to iron on in a pinch. Prepare a surface for cutting out the pattern and fabric. Remember that scissors can leave dents on wooden surfaces, so you may want to use a sheet of cardboard or a tablecloth to protect your dining room table."

If the tissue paper pattern is heavily creased or wrinkled, you can iron it with a dry iron on low heat to smooth it out before cutting. Diamonds or triangle tabs on the edge of the pattern will be used later to match up pieces of fabric. Take care not to cut them off."

The \"right\" side of the fabric is the side that is worn outside the body, i.e. the part that people will see. Align the edges and all notches, and pin together the inside and outside seams. Completely pin up both legs before you start sewing to make sure that everything is matched up correctly. You should end up with two inside-out fabric tubes that are mirror images of one another."

If the unfinished pants are more than an inch longer than you'd like them to be, trim off the excess material at the bottom. Fold the bottom of each pant leg over 1/4\" and press, then fold them over another 3/4\" and press again. Pin the hems, and sew 1/2\" from the bottom of the pants.
