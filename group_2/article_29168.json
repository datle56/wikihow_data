      "content": "Set aside time to read every day. It may be just 5-10 minutes that you have to spare, but crack a book open at least once a day. Try to anchor your reading habit to something else you do every day. For instance, read while you eat or have a cup of tea. Reading before bed is also a great way to develop your reading habit. If you can, read at the same time every day so your brain starts to associate that time as “reading time”.

If you travel a lot, read on the plane, bus, or train instead of watching a movie or scrolling through social media. There's no right or wrong when you're choosing what time you should read each day. If you enjoy reading before bed, for instance, you might sit down with a book for the last 30 minutes of your day. However, if you prefer reading during the daytime, you might set aside a few minutes on your lunch break or after work. [3] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 30 June 2020."
