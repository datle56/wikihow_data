      "title": "Find a jungle biome.",
      "content": "Find a jungle biome. Cocoa beans only grow in jungles, which are most likely to appear next to other medium-temperature biomes like plains, forest, and swamps. Jungles are easy to identify from their extra-tall trees, but it can take a long time to find one in some worlds. Sailing along the coast is a good way to look for new biomes. Set the render distance as far as you can so you can see jungle trees from a distance. If you're having no luck, download a mapping tool such as Amidst (for Computer Edition only)."

      "title": "Break cocoa pods.",
      "content": "Break cocoa pods. Search for cocoa pods on the sides of jungle trees. These have three stages of growth. The small, green cocoa pods only give you one bean. If you wait for them to grow into large, orange-brown pods, you can get two or three beans. [1] X Research source One cocoa bean makes eight cookies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Farm more cocoa pods.",
      "content": "Farm more cocoa pods. Before you craft the cookies, save a couple cocoa beans and chop down a few logs of jungle tree wood. Once you're back at your base, use the pod on the side of a jungle wood block and wait for it to grow larger. This will give you an infinite source of cocoa beans."

    {
      "title": "Make farmland to grow wheat.",
      "content": "Make farmland to grow wheat. Use a hoe on a patch of dirt or grass to turn it into farmland. If you already have wheat, make cookies by placing these ingredients in a horizontal row: wheat, cocoa bean, wheat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Supply water and light.",
      "content": "Supply water and light. Place water within four blocks of the farmland, on the same horizontal level or one block higher. The farmland will turn a darker color to show that it's been watered. You'll also need to keep the farmland bright so the crops can grow, using sunlight or torches. [2] X Research source Leave the water there while the wheat grows. Wheat will still grow if the farmland dries out, but it will take longer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plant seeds.",
      "content": "Plant seeds. Use seeds on the farmland to plant the wheat crop. Tall grass has a chance to drop seeds each time you break it. The fastest way to gather your first seeds is to pour water on a field of tall grass, breaking it all at once. Each seed will give you one wheat. You need two wheat for every cocoa bean to make cookies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Harvest the wheat once it's fully grown.",
      "content": "Harvest the wheat once it's fully grown. After two or three Minecraft days, the seeds will turn into tall, yellow wheat stalks. Break these to put wheat in your inventory. [3] X Research source Breaking them before they're finished growing will only give you seeds. Wheat has seven stages of growth in the Computer edition, and four stages in Pocket edition."

      "title": "Craft the cookies.",
      "content": "Craft the cookies. Each recipe takes two wheat items and one cocoa bean, and makes eight cookies. If you are playing an edition with the full crafting mode, place the ingredients in one horizontal line in this order: wheat, cocoa bean, wheat."

      "title": "Eat your cookies.",
      "content": "Eat your cookies. Watch the crumbs fly! Each cookie restores 2 hunger and 0.5 saturation, or 1 hunger on Pocket Edition. [4] X Research source"
