      "title": "Borax is a classic, go-to slime activator.",
      "content": "Borax is a classic, go-to slime activator. Slime expert Summer Ames says, “Borax cross-links the polymers in glue, turning it from a liquid into a holdable, non-sticky material.” In a small bowl, dissolve 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of Borax into 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of water. This is your activator. To use this activator, slowly add it to a mixture of 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of warm water and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of glue. Stir well, then knead the mixture until it forms slime. [1] X Research source Although Borax is likely safe in the small amounts used in slime, there can be health concerns involved with prolonged exposure to Borax, including skin irritation and dry skin. [2] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Swallowing slime that contains Borax can lead to serious side effects, including abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, lethargy, and seizures. If you suspect a child has swallowed Borax, call Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222. Some Borax slime substitutes, like contact solution and liquid starch, actually contain borates. They may be gentler on your skin than using regular Borax, but slime made with these substitutes can’t really be called “Borax-free.”"

      "title": "Contact solution is a gentler alternative to borax.",
      "content": "Contact solution is a gentler alternative to borax. To use contact lens solution as slime activator, start by mixing 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of water and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of glue. Stir in 1/2 tsp (3 g) of baking soda, then add 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of contact lens solution. Stir it thoroughly, then knead the mixture by hand. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source For this to work, you have to use contact lens solution that contains sodium borate and boric acid, so be sure to check the ingredient list. Slime expert Shellisa Ruvalcaba says, “Contact solution is a good alternative for people who are allergic to Borax.” The results are very similar to classic slime. Add 1 1/2 cups (375 g) of shaving cream to this mixture to create a fluffy slime. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Using liquid starch as an activator makes an extra gloopy slime.",
      "content": "Using liquid starch as an activator makes an extra gloopy slime. For this slime, all you need are glue and liquid starch. Pour about 1 cup (240 ml) of glue into a large mixing bowl, then slowly add up to 1 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (7.4 ml) of liquid starch, a little at a time. Stop adding the starch when the mixture forms a slimy mixture. [5] X Research source This is a gloopy slime that looks really cool if you use clear glue instead of opaque. Liquid starch contains sodium borate, which is why it can’t be considered a Borax-free activator. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use fragrance-free laundry detergent to avoid skin irritation.",
      "content": "Use fragrance-free laundry detergent to avoid skin irritation. To use laundry detergent as an activator, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of glue into a bowl, then slowly add 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 ml) of laundry detergent at a time, up to 3 ⁄ 4 tsp (3.7 ml). When the mixture starts to come together, use your hands to knead it. Add more detergent if the slime is too sticky. [7] X Research source Many laundry detergents contain borates, which is why this works to create the slime reaction. While laundry detergent slime is a common option, exposure to laundry detergent can cause skin irritation, rash, or blisters. Consider using a gentler laundry detergent, like a fragrance-free option or one made for baby clothes—or just try another activator recipe."

      "content": "Fiber gel makes a thick, taste-safe slime. Mix 4 tbsp (48 g) of fiber powder and 2 cups (0.47 l) of water in a microwave-safe bowl, then microwave the mixture on high for 3 minutes. Stir, then microwave again for 1 more minute. Stir the mixture for about 2 minutes, then spread it on a cookie sheet and refrigerate it for 20 minutes. [8] X Research source As the mixture cools, it will thicken into a gloopy slime. While this mixture is safe to taste, the high fiber content means it shouldn’t be eaten as a snack."

      "content": "Make a sticky, skin-safe slime with cornstarch and glue. Slowly add 3/4 cup (95 grams) of cornstarch to 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of glue, mixing well between additions. Once the mixture starts to firm up, put a little cornstarch on your fingers to keep the slime from sticking to your hands. Then, knead the slime until it’s stretchy. [9] X Research source Slime expert Angelina Ly says that using cornstarch won’t give you quite the same texture as regular slime. But it’s a safe option that’s still a lot of fun to play with. Try adding 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of glycerin to the mixture to make this slime more stretchy. [10] X Research source"

Add 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of water at a time, stirring well after each addition, for a total of 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 ml) of water. Stretch and knead the mixture until slime forms. [11] X Research source This works best with a clear gel shampoo, rather than a creamy opaque one."
