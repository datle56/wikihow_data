      "content": "Find out if you know anyone who’s connected to Pixar. The most common way to get a tour of Pixar Studios is to have a personal connection. If none of your immediate family members work at Pixar, ask your parents if any of your extended family does. Also, ask all of your closest friends if they know anyone who works at Pixar. [1] X Research source Consider posting a question about touring Pixar Studios on social networking sites, such as Facebook, to reach a larger audience of family, friends, and acquaintances."

      "title": "Go to a family and friends day.",
      "content": "Go to a family and friends day. Pixar sometimes has days that are designated for family and friends to come visit and tour the facility. On these days, employees are often allowed to invite a guest to come to the studio. If you have a connection with someone at Pixar who’s very important, you may be able to get a private, unscheduled tour, but it’s usually easier to get a tour on the family and friends days. To respect your personal connection’s time and space, consider calling them instead of approaching them in person. When asking about family and friends day, try saying “Hi! I was hoping to ask you something about Pixar. Do you have a moment to talk?” If they seem eager to speak with you, say something like, “I’m such a big Pixar fan. Is there a family and friends day at the studio some time soon that I’d be able to attend with you?” If you get to attend the studio on family and friends day, you can expect to tour the Steve Jobs Building, tour the Brooklyn building, and also check out the interesting outdoor features, such as the big model of the Luxo lamp and ball. [2] X Research source While many areas are off limits during family and friends day tours, you should still be able to see the screening room, the mail room, the gift shop, the cafe, as well as recent Pixar artwork and Pixar awards.

      "title": "Check out a private screening.",
      "content": "Check out a private screening. Pixar shows private screenings of their movies a few months before they’re released in theaters. Pixar often allows employees to invite guests to come to the studio to see these films. While you may or may not be able to tour the studio if you get into the facility this way, you’ll at least get to see some of it and you’ll also get to see a movie before it comes out. Be sure to politely and appropriately ask the person you know who is connected to Pixar for this opportunity. For example, you might say, “I’m really excited for that new Pixar movie that’s coming out soon. It looks incredible. Is there any way that I could see it with you before it’s shown in theaters?”"

      "content": "Participate in charitable auctions that are posted online. Go online to Pixar news sources, such as https://pixarpost.com/ and https://pixarplanet.com . These websites typically post about different charitable auction opportunities that happen from time to time. The purpose of these is to raise money for different organizations, such as the LA Food Bank or the Singing Stones School. Follow the directions on the website in order to place your bid, as you may get a tour if you have the highest one. [4] X Research source While this is a good way to get a tour, it can be extremely expensive."

      "content": "Purchase tour tickets for special charity events. Another way that Pixar uses charity fundraising to offer tours is by temporarily giving the public an opportunity to buy touring tickets, usually just before a film premier. Check out https://www.charitybuzz.com/ to see if any charity ticket opportunities have been posted. This is another pricey option. For example, tickets for a charity event in 2011 that included a black tie dinner, a screening, and an exclusive tour were $1,000 USD each."

      "content": "Participate in contests that are posted online. While it may be harder to get a tour by winning a contest, it’s a great option to pursue if you don’t have any personal connections and you also don’t want to spend a lot of money. Check out https://pixarplanet.com/blog/category/competition/ regularly to see what contests are posted. Contest entry requirements range in difficulty from answering a prompt with a short essay response to creating a trailer for a film. The prizes also vary, from special edition Blu-Ray disc sets to tours of the studio."

If you don’t have an interest in working for Pixar and you’re more experienced in journalism, search for a press job that covers Pixar and/or movie exclusives. Then, send your resume and portfolio to the news organization that’s looking to fill the position. Some news organizations that frequently cover Pixar include The Hollywood Reporter, The Guardian, and The Vancouver Sun."
