      "content": "Assess the situation. Make sure the person is choking and determine whether it is a partial or total airway obstruction. If a person is experiencing mild choking, or partial airway obstruction, you are better off letting him cough to remove the obstruction himself. Signs of partial airway obstruction include the ability to speak, cry out, cough or respond to you. The person will also usually be able to breathe, though it may be slightly labored and the person may grow pale in the face. In contrast, someone experiencing a total obstruction of the airway will not be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In addition, you may notice the person making the \"choking sign\" (both hands clutched to the throat) and his lips and fingernails may turn blue due to lack of oxygen. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask the person, \"Are you choking?\". [2] X Research source If the person can respond to you verbally, wait. Someone who is really choking will not be able to speak at all, but they may shake their head yes or no. It is important that you do not use back blows on a person who has partial airway obstruction because there is the risk of lodging the previously semi-loose object more deeply and potentially causing a total obstruction. If the person responds: Reassure the person. Let him know that you are there and ready to help if need be. Encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage. Do not use back blows. Keep monitoring the situation and be prepared to help in the case that the person's airway becomes fully blocked or the choking becomes severe."
