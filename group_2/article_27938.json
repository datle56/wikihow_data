      "content": "Reduce your speed to 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph). Do this by placing your foot on the brake pedal. As you reduce your speed, glance at your rear view and right-hand mirror to see if the cars behind you are slowing down. [2] X Research source If you notice that the cars behind you are not slowing down, tap your break pedal a couple times to signal that you are braking."

      "content": "Check for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, and other vehicles. Do this by looking into your right-hand mirror and by looking back over your right shoulder. Once your path is clear, make the right turn by turning your steering wheel to the right. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Turn into the right lane.",
      "content": "Turn into the right lane. Not the left lane if you are turning into a two-lane street. Try to make your turn as tight as possible without hitting the curb. In other words, do not make a wide, sweeping turn. Making wide turns may cause you to go into the lanes of oncoming traffic. [4] X Research source Do not make a right turn from a left lane."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to the road signs.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the road signs. You want to do this because left turns aren’t always allowed. If you see a sign saying that a left turn is illegal, then keep driving until you can make a legal left turn. [5] X Research source For example, some traffic lights and intersections prohibit left turns."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn on your blinker.",
      "content": "Turn on your blinker. Do this at least 100 feet (30 meters) before the actual turn. As you approach the turn, reduce your speed to 10 to 15 miles per hour (16 to 24 kph) by pressing the break pedal. Get as close to the centerline or median as possible. [6] X Research source Use the center left lane if one is available to make your left turn. Do not attempt to make a left turn from a right lane."

      "content": "Come to a complete stop and yield to oncoming traffic. As you are yielding, keep your wheels straight by holding your steering wheel straight. If your wheels are slightly turned to the left while waiting, you may be shoved into oncoming traffic if a car hits you from behind. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn left once the oncoming lanes are clear.",
      "content": "Turn left once the oncoming lanes are clear. As a rule of thumb, do not turn if oncoming vehicles are less than 200 feet (60 meters) away from you. Once the lanes are clear, you may turn into either the left or right-hand lane if you are turning into a two-lane street. [8] X Research source If you are turning into a single-lane street, make sure to not cut the corner of the oncoming traffic’s lane. In other words, do not make your left turn too tight."

      "title": "Check for signs prohibiting U-turns.",
      "content": "Check for signs prohibiting U-turns. You may make U-turns only if you are crossing a double yellow line, there is a “U-turn Only” sign, you are in a residential area, and if you are in the far left lane and no sign is prohibiting U-turns. [9] X Research source hhttps://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/pages/online_manual/study-section_3.aspx You may also make a U-turn on a divided highway if there is an opening in the center divider and the opening is not reserved for law enforcement or emergency vehicles."

Observe the traffic and check for oncoming vehicles and motorcycles, as well as pedestrians and bicycles.

      "content": "Avoid making illegal U-turns. U-turns are prohibited when there is a “No U-turn” sign, you are on a one-way street, and when you cannot see 200 feet (60 meters) in either direction (because of hills, curves, rain, snow, fog, and other obstacles). [12] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source Additionally, do not make U-turns on highways that are split by curbs, two sets of double yellow lines, and other dividing mechanisms."
