If you have access to good public transportation where you live, take advantage of it. Since you won’t have to worry about keeping your eyes on the road, you can take advantage of the time to read, catch up on news, or just relax."

      "title": "Consolidate your trips.",
      "content": "Consolidate your trips. Making lots of little trips over the course of a few days contributes more pollution to the environment every time you hop in your car. Instead of running your errands over the course of a few days, try to consolidate them into one round trip. Consolidating your trips into one long trip will also save you money since starting your car when the engine is cold consumes 20% more fuel than driving your car."

      "content": "Carpool to school or work. Long commutes to school or work are just part of life for many people. If walking and public transportation are not good options for you, consider joining a carpool to your school or place of work. By taking turns driving and riding with others, you will reduce carbon emission and you will also save on gas money each week. Carpooling is also a great way to develop friendships with your coworkers and reduce the stress of your commute. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider purchasing an electric or hybrid car for your next vehicle. Electric cars run on electricity alone, so they are zero emission vehicles and the best at not releasing emissions. Hybrid cars use a combination of electricity and fuel to run. While electric cars are the least polluting, both options will help stop pollution. Although they still use some gas to run, hybrid cars have much better fuel economy than regular cars and emit fewer greenhouse gases than traditional cars. They also require less maintenance than gas powered cars. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that the purchase price of electric and hybrid cars is higher than most conventional cars. Electric cars can be charged at home, which is advantageous for those who have solar panels at home."

      "content": "Choose local food whenever possible. Transporting food from across the country and around the world requires a considerable amount of fuel. This excessive fuel use contributes to air pollution. Instead of purchasing food that has traveled thousands of miles to get to your table, choose food that comes from nearby farms and that has been grown using sustainable methods. Before you buy, ask the farmer or grower about their techniques to learn about their efforts to stop pollution. [6] X Research source Visit a local farm stand or farmers’ market to get fruits and vegetables straight from the people who grew them.
