      "content": "Choose a ball of chunky yarn and a large pair of knitting needles. Yarn comes in a wide range of textures, weights, and colors, but we recommend that beginners start with a medium to heavy weight yarn (often called “worsted”) and wooden or bamboo needles that are 7–10 mm (0.28–0.39 in) in diameter. Larger yarn and needles makes things easier to handle and see. You can knit with straight needles or circular needles . Circular needles are helpful for holding a large number of stitches, such as for a blanket, and you can also knit in the round with circular needles.

      "title": "Make a slipknot",
      "content": "Make a slipknot to begin casting on. To make your first stitch, loop the yarn around your index and middle finger 2 times. Then, pull the first loop over the second loop. Tug on the tail (or end) of the yarn to tighten the knot around the base of the loop. Then, slip the loop onto a knitting needle and tug the tail more to secure the knot. [2] X Research source The slipknot counts as your first cast on stitch, so make sure to include it if you are counting stitches."

      "content": "Loop the long end of the yarn around your left hand. Holding the needle in your right hand, position the slipknot about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the tip. Take the long end (or “working end”) of the yarn, and wrap it clockwise around your left hand so that the working end hangs off your palm, below where the yarn meets the needle. [3] X Research source Grip the needle securely (but not too tightly) near the first stitch with your right index finger and thumb. Wrap your other 3 fingers loosely around the body of the needle to make it easier to control."

Then use your left hand to tug on the working end to tighten the loop and create your second stitch. Don’t pull it too tight—just enough to wrap snugly around the needle. [4] X Research source"

Continue to repeat the same process to cast on additional stitches, looping the yarn around your hand, threading the needle up through it, and pulling it taught. For this beginner tutorial, we’ll just cast-on a total of 12 switches to make a small swatch. [5] X Expert Source Gregory Patrick Knitting Specialist Expert Interview. 10 January 2019.

      "title": "Transfer the needle with the cast-on stitches to your left hand by turning your work around clockwise.",
      "content": "Transfer the needle with the cast-on stitches to your left hand by turning your work around clockwise. Always start a new row by transferring your knitting needles to the opposite hands. The needle in your left hand will have all of the stitches on it ( the “loaded” needle) and the needle in your right hand will be empty. Hold the working end of the yarn in your right hand, threaded over the top of your right index finger. [6] X Research source Left-handed knitters tend to learn to knit with the loaded needle in their left hand, as well, though if you prefer you can hold the loaded needle in your left hand, mirroring these steps as you go. Use the same grip as you used to cast on your stitches. Holding the yarn in your right hand is known as English knitting or English throwing. There is also continental knitting [7] X Research source or combination/combined knitting [8] X Research source where you hold the yarn in the left hand. Both styles are said to be easier for people with previous crochet experience."

Push the tip of the needle through by about 0.5 in (1.3 cm), approaching from the underside of the stitch. If you have difficulty pushing it through, your cast-on stitches may be too tight—in this case, re-cast your stitches, making the new stitches a bit looser.

Then, continue knitting in the same way as you knit the last row. [13] X Research source Do your best to keep the yarn at an even tension, to make all the stitches equal in size. It’ll take some practice, but that’s what this first knitting exercise is for! A knit stitch is denoted on patterns with a “K”, for example: K1, K2, K3, etc., which mean “knit 1 stitch, knit 2 stitches, knit 3 stitches,” and so on. A “garter stitch” is made by using this stitch to create every row."

Then loop the working yarn over and behind the tip of the right-hand needle, and bring it through the stitch using a pushing motion. [20] X Research source Purl is usually represented by a “P” in patterns followed by the number you need to purl, such as P1, P2, P3, etc., which mean “purl 1 stitch, purl 2 stitches, purl 3 stitches,” and so on. A “stockinette stitch” is made simply by knitting 1 row then purling 1 row, alternating as you work. A “seed stitch” is made by alternative knits and purls within the same row."

To increase , knit through the same stitch 2 times (without slipping it off between knits) to add a stitch. To decrease , knit through 2 stitches at once to remove a stitch. [21] X Research source If you are using a pattern, make sure to follow the instructions for increasing and decreasing carefully. These stitches are important for ensuring you get the desired results."
