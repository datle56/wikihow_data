Next, cut your lemons in half and press them onto a lemon press over a pitcher or measuring cup. Twist the lemon halves over the press to get as much juice out as possible. [2] X Research source Microwave your lemons for 10-20 seconds to soften the pulp and get more juice. If you don't have a lemon press, squeeze the lemon to get most of the juice out. Then, press a fork or mixer beater into the lemon pulp and twist it to release the rest of the juice. You can get a lemon press at your local grocery or department store or online."

If you don’t like pulp, hold a strainer over the pitcher and pour the lemon juice over the strainer to catch the pulp. Then, empty the strainer into your compost or trash. [3] X Research source Make sure your pitcher can hold at least 8 cups (1.9 L) of fluids."

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (225 g) of sugar into the lemon juice and stir to dissolve it. Since lemon juice is acidic, it can dissolve your sugar for you, which saves you a lot of work! Add the sugar directly into your lemon juice, then stir until the sugar dissolves. This should take about 3-4 minutes. [4] X Research source If you don’t want your lemonade to be as sweet, you can add less sugar. Try adding just 1/2 or 3/4 cup (112-165 g) of sugar. Don’t add your water until the sugar dissolves so that the lemon juice isn’t diluted. It will take the sugar longer to dissolve in diluted lemon juice."

However, you don’t have to miss out on this refreshing treat! Simply replace the sugar in the recipe with your favorite sugar substitute. For instance, try 1 of the following: Use 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of liquid stevia.

Pour the carbonated water slowly so it won’t bubble over. Then, stir your ingredients to combine them. [13] X Research source Try plain sparkling water or use flavored sparkling water to create a unique blend. For instance, strawberry sparkling water could make strawberry-lemonade, peach seltzer will make peach-lemonade, and lemon-flavored sparkling water will enhance the flavor of your lemonade. If you’re making simple syrup, use regular water to make it. Then, replace the rest of your water with sparkling water."

Then, strain the water over your pitcher to remove the lavender. [14] X Research source The lavender-infused lemonade will not be purple. If you want to create a lavender color, add 1-2 drops of purple food coloring and stir. If you do not have purple food coloring, add 1 drop of red food coloring and 1 drop of blue food coloring. Be sure to stir the lemonade well to blend all of the colors."

Alternatively, mix 2 cups (400 g) of pureed strawberries into your lemonade after you mix it. Stir until the strawberries are well-blended. [15] X Research source If you're adding strawberries to your lemonade after you mix it, you don't need to replace any of the water. Just add the strawberries to the prepared lemonade.

Drop 2-3 fresh mint or basil leaves into the lemonade. Cut a slit into lemon or lime slices, then slide 1 onto each glass. Slice the bottom of a strawberry and push it down onto the rim of the glass. Serve the lemonade in mason jars and add a colorful paper straw for a rustic touch. Serve the lemonade in a tall glass with a paper umbrella and a maraschino cherry for a tropical refreshment."
