      "content": "Pick up a piece of yarn about 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) from the end. Pinch the yarn with 2 fingers so it drops down into a U-shape as it falls under your fingers. You don't need to measure the yarn precisely; just give yourself enough extra yarn to work with. [1] X Research source This U-shape is called a \"bight\" in knot tying. Choose your yarn based on the project you’re working on. Consider the yarn’s weight, gauge, and drape."

The working yarn is the line that leads back to your ball of yarn. The shorter side, leading to the end, is called the tail. Pulling the working line halfway through the loop forms another bight or U-shaped bend in the yarn. [4] X Research source You only need to pull a few inches or centimeters of yarn through."

Just pull on the tail piece of yarn to bring the knot closer together and clean it up. You’ve made the slip knot! It should look a bit like a noose, with a knot on the bottom of a yarn loop."

A slip knot almost always goes around something, as the beauty of the knot is how easily it tightens and loosens. If you’re knitting or starting to crochet , just insert your needle or hook into the loop on top of the knot. Pull both the tail end and working yarn simultaneously to tighten your slip knot. To loosen the slip knot, simply pull up on the loop while gripping the knot. When you’re ready to knit or crochet, start by casting on ."
