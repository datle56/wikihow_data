      "content": "Remove any old lattice with a flat pry bar. Be careful not to damage the porch, deck, or support columns when removing the existing lattice. Cut the lattice into pieces with a reciprocating saw if you are having trouble removing it. This will make it easier. [1] X Research source You can also use a small carpenter's cat's paw, which will help pry off small nails. If the old lattice is stapled, find a screwdriver with a blade just wide enough to fit onto the staple. Gently pry it off."

      "title": "Make sure nothing is living under your deck or porch.",
      "content": "Make sure nothing is living under your deck or porch. Do not install a new lattice without making sure no animals are living underneath your deck. If you find animals, encourage them to leave by allowing as much light in as possible. Also, let your water hose run next to the deck. This will encourage the animals to leave because they like dark, dry, and quiet areas to nest in. [2] X Research source Avoid using traps or poison as that may kill any non-target animals or kill an animal in an unreachable place. You may be able to find a volunteer group that will relocate wildlife. Call your local or state fish and game office or city animal control to learn about options in your area. If you can't find a volunteer, you may be able to hire a professional wildlife removal service."

      "content": "Calculate the dimensions of the lattice frames. Measure the openings between the support columns or posts of the deck or porch. The completed frames should be 1/2 inch narrower than the overall width and 1 inch shorter than the height of the openings. [3] X Research source If you install the lattice flush to the ground, the framing can buckle and snag leaves. [4] X Research source"

Attach the hardware approximately 1/4 inch from the edges of the frames using 3/4-inch flathead screws. [5] X Research source Make sure you work on a flat, sturdy surface to put together the frames"

      "content": "Attach a center stile to each frame. Use two 4-inch T-plates, making sure that the plate is centered on the support piece. Position the T-plates about Â¼ inch from the edge of the frame. Use 3/4-inch screws to secure them. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the lattice panels to fit each frame using a sabre or circular saw. Lay the frames face down. Attach a piece of lattice to each frame using 1-inch pan head screws driven through washers. Allow a 1/ 4-inch gap on all sides between the edge of the frame and lattice. This lets the lattice to expand and contract when the weather changes. This will prevent the lattice from buckling."

      "content": "Secure the seam between two pieces of lattice. The two pieces of lattice will form a seam on the center stile. Screw 1-inch (2.54 cm) pan head screws with washers to each of the lattice panels where they meet at the center stile. Make two rows of screws, drilling them at each point the lattices meet."

      "content": "Open and shut the lattice frames to make sure they shut properly. If the lattice frame drags on the ground or doesn't close all the way, use a shovel or garden hoe to remove some of the dirt in front of and underneath the frame. If there is too much space beneath the lattice frame, add and compact more dirt. Distribute the dirt evenly so that the ground will be flat."
