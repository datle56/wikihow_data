    {
      "title": "Make a creative but descriptive username.",
      "content": "Make a creative but descriptive username. Once your Instagram becomes famous, people will refer to it by your account's username; for this reason, your username should be memorable, distinctive, and easy to say out loud. Your username's style should reflect your content theme; if you're an artist, for example, you'll probably want to stick to some derivative of your real name (or your artist alias)."

    {
      "title": "Flesh out your bio with pertinent information.",
      "content": "Flesh out your bio with pertinent information. There are a variety of things you might have readily available for users here: A rich but concise description of your content, motives, and/or intent. A link to your website if you have one. Your work email address. It's worth setting up a dedicated email address for your Instagram account. Usernames for any pertinent social media accounts (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Usernames for any IM services you'd like to share. Your PayPal or Venmo ID for donations. A resume. Posting this on a static blog page and then linking the blog page in your bio is the best way to display your resume."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on a theme for your content.",
      "content": "Decide on a theme for your content. Unlike your personal Instagram or Facebook page, anything you post here needs to fit a singular theme (e.g., fitness or food). In a pinch, find something you believe society doesn't have (or something it would benefit from having more of) that correlates with your talents. Make sure your content adheres to the Instagram Terms of Use ."

      "title": "Fine-tune your posts and their descriptions.",
      "content": "Fine-tune your posts and their descriptions. This process includes making the photos aesthetically pleasing through use of filters and other editing options as well as placing pertinent information in the photo's description. If you're advertising, for example, a short sentence describing the product or service you're promoting in relation to how it betters your life followed by appropriate links should go in the photo's description. Posts tend to be best-received at around 2:00 AM and at 5:00 PM. Make sure you're around these times for your target demographic's specific timezone. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Post several times a day.",
      "content": "Post several times a day. While it is important not to inundate your followers with content, providing quality posts a few times per day will keep them satisfied. Try to vary your content within its thematic scope; you don't want to deviate too much from the kind of stuff you normally post, but you shouldn't be posting the same thing every day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read your posts' comments.",
      "content": "Read your posts' comments. Users will generally give you feedback--whether explicitly or implicitly--that can help you tailor your future posts to the majority of your followers. You won't be able to incorporate every user's suggestions; instead, focus on common themes from the bulk of your Instagram followers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain an active presence on Instagram.",
      "content": "Maintain an active presence on Instagram. This will both promote your account name and increase your overall likability: Respond to comments often. Once you reach a certain follower amount, you'll no longer be able to respond to all comments; still, try to respond to a couple of users per post. Favorite posts from brands, users, or accounts with which you'd like to work. This is a way to practice Instagram altruism while simultaneously promoting your account name."

    {
      "title": "Complement your Instagram account with other social media accounts.",
      "content": "Complement your Instagram account with other social media accounts. Links to your pertinent social media accounts should already be in your bio, but it's important to keep these pages updated with relevant content: Facebook - Create and maintain a dedicated Facebook page for your Instagram content. You can then promote this page on Facebook. Twitter - Create a specific Twitter account for your Instagram content. You can cross-post Instagram content to Twitter, though you should endeavor to post unique content here too. Other sites that will depend on your intended demographic include Tumblr, YouTube, and Pinterest."

      "content": "Set a follower number goal. This should be contingent on your content's theme; if you plan on applying to collaborate with brands for advertising campaigns, for example, most brands will require you to have around 10,000 followers before you can advertise for them.

    },
    {
      "title": "Use relevant hashtags in your posts.",
      "content": "Use relevant hashtags in your posts. If you are attempting to reach a specific demographic--which you should be--use hashtags for which that demographic might search. For example, if you have several photos of landscapes from the Pacific Northwest, you might tag your photos as \"#pnw\" and #\"pacific northwest\". [3] X Research source Only use hashtags relevant to your post, since using clickbait or wayward keywords will both frustrate potential followers and get your account flagged as spam."

      "title": "Like and comment on photos from other accounts.",
      "content": "Like and comment on photos from other accounts. This exposes your account name, making it easier for anyone who sees your likes and comments to check out your profile. Ideally, you'll do this for users whom you would like to have following you. You can do this on many random accounts to attract followers. While this process may be time-consuming, it's a good way to earn a few followers here and there."

      "title": "Promote your account",
      "content": "Promote your account on social media. Your other social media accounts should already be fairly present on Instagram thanks to your bio; make sure your Instagram account is equally present on these social media accounts. Even just posting a link to your Instagram account on your Facebook or Twitter page is a good way to promote your content."

      "title": "Facilitate engagement.",
      "content": "Facilitate engagement. Requesting feedback or action from your followers will get them involved; if your requests are interesting enough, they will draw in more followers as well. You can facilitate engagement in a few ways: Hosting give-aways for products or services. Make sure you require your users to \"Like\" and/or share your post to qualify. Asking questions. Doing this will encourage users to respond, which curates interest in your content. Taking requests. Especially if you're using Instagram to showcase photos, taking requests from users will get them personally invested in your future content."

      "content": "Use promotions. Try hosting a giveaway on your page to generate customer interest.

      "content": "Like and comment on your followed brands' posts. If you do this often enough, you will capture your brands' attention; this can show them that your account is a potentially valuable asset.

      "content": "Be patient. If your account is active and constantly growing, a brand will want to work with you at some point, if only for minor marketing in exchange for free products.

      "content": "Differentiate between stock and premium content. Stock content--lower-quality photos that business and websites can use for advertising--should go directly to your chosen photo-selling app, but you should sell your premium photos--e.g., incredibly high-quality pieces that command a higher price--individually from your Instagram page. This is where having a large follower base becomes crucial. Note that stock content shouldn't actually be low-quality; rather, it should be generic or otherwise applicable to a wide variety of situations. Premium content should be more geared toward individual consumption."
