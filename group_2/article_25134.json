      "content": "See a doctor to determine if you're allergic to hornets. If you haven't been stung by a hornet before, schedule an allergy test with your primary doctor before you try to take down the nest. They will test to see if you have any severe reactions to hornet venom. If your doctor confirms you aren't allergic, you can consider removing the nest on your own.

      "content": "Determine what kind of hornets you're dealing with. Hornets build their nests the same way, but some species are more aggressive than others. Look at the appearance of each hornet to determine what type you're dealing with. Bald-faced hornets are the most common hornets in North America. The hornet's body is mostly black with white markings on their abdomen and head. Their nests are usually found at least 3 feet (0.91 m) off the ground and are primarily gray in color. [2] X Research source European hornets are common hornets in North America and Europe. Their bodies are yellow and red, and they can grow up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) in length. Their nests are usually in a hollow tree or wall void 6 feet (1.8 m) off the ground. [3] X Research source Asian giant hornets/murder hornets are the largest hornet species that are primarily found in Asia and are extremely aggressive. Their bodies are orange and brown and can grow up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length. The Asian giant hornets' nests are usually underground or in tree cavities. [4] X Research source"

Wear long sleeves and pants to keep hornets out of your clothes. Wrap a scarf around your head or tighten a hood around your face to protect your neck. Cover your face with safety goggles and a facemask. Tuck your pant legs into your socks or boots and wear thick gloves to protect your hands. [7] X Research source Wear a beekeeping suit if you have access to one. These will protect you the best from hornet stings."

If the nest is on a high branch or near your roof, don't attempt climbing up to reach the nest. Call a professional service and let them know about the hornet problem you're having. They will have more experience and be able to handle the nest. [11] X Research source Don't stand on a ladder to remove the nest. If you fall off the ladder, you could hurt yourself and get stung."

Insecticidal dust coats the hornets in a water-repellent killer that prevents them from flying. The chemicals are then absorbed into their bodies to kill them in a short amount of time. Find an insecticidal dust meant for hornets or wasp control. Insecticidal dust is typically sold with a hand duster and can be purchased at your local yard care or gardening store."

      "content": "Locate the entrance hole on the bottom of the nest during the day. Look for a hole near the bottom of the nest that hornets are entering and exiting. This should be the only entrance on the nest and will be the area you want to focus on when you apply the dust. See if you can find another area on the nest where hornets are entering and exiting. This may indicate a second hole that you should spray."

Don't forget to wear your protective gear in case the hornets sting. Aim the duster directly at the hole. Don't aim your flashlight directly at the entrance hole or else you could disturb the hornets inside."

      "content": "Squeeze the duster's bulb to coat the hornets. Use the bulb on the end of the duster to make the dust come out. Spray the outside of the entrance hole first before putting the tip inside. The dust will coat the hornets and the inside of the nest so it's more difficult for the hornets to move around. Once you've spread the dust, leave the area to prevent any stings. Some hornets will escape before they're covered in dust but they will return to the nest eventually."

Make sure the nozzle is pointed at the hole in the bottom of the hornet's nest since this is the main entrance and exit.

After a few days, look for any activity around the nest. If there are no hornets flying around the nest, it's safe to remove. If you still notice hornets around the nest, use another application of your insecticide to kill them."
