      "content": "Visit a library, hospital, or college campus. Even if you're not a current student, most college campuses offer free wireless access to anyone on the premises. The same goes for hospitals, even if you aren't a patient. Most libraries have computers with internet access that anyone can use, but you may also find a library that offers free Wi-Fi. Some libraries/schools have daily use restrictions or content restrictions, so make sure you know what you can and cannot do before using these resources. Look for a Wi-Fi network called \"Guest\" or \"Open\" when searching. If a password is required for guests, ask someone at an information desk how to proceed."
