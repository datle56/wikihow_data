      "content": "Add a music bot to Discord. You'll need to be the server owner or have admin permissions to be able to add a bot. [4] X Research source Many bots don't offer the music functionality anymore because of the YouTube cease and desist letters it sent out recently. But you might be able to find one that's still working. For example, we're using Nekotina to play music in Discord while playing Roblox. The website is in English, but the bot responds to you in Discord in Spanish. If you need to, you can easily translate the web page or use Google Translate for the bot. Go to this link and click Add to Discord to add the bot . Enter the command to start playing music. For example, you'd enter \" /play (Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, or Deezer link to a song or playlist) \" if you're using the Nekotina bot. You can't use a YouTube link, however, and will get an \"I'm sorry\" message. You can get a playlist link to make sure the music keeps playing. Find a list of music commands at https://docs.nekotina.com/es/slash ."
