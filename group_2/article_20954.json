Slip-on shoes will be easier to remove quickly. Of course, make sure they are comfortable enough for standing in long security lines. If you're under 13 or above 75, you can wear any types of shoes, as long they don't set off the metal detector or millimeter wave scanner.

The same applies to metal items in your pockets. Package liquids and gels appropriately. All liquids in your carry-on bag must be in bottles of three ounces or less, and all these bottles must then be placed in a clear, quart-size, zip-style plastic bag. There are a few exceptions to this rule, including milk for infants and liquid medications, but be sure to check before you pack anything. Pack your belongings in an organized way, so that if there is a problem, they can open your bag, check things out, and move on. Avoid contraband. Check beforehand to make sure that anything you will bring along, whether in your checked luggage or your carry-on, is allowed on the plane. Otherwise, you may be forced to throw these items away or even face questioning and/or prosecution.
