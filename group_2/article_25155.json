      "title": "Pull away slightly while kissing.",
      "content": "Pull away slightly while kissing. This is a great technique for romantic kissing. [1] X Research source As you are kissing normally, pull back just slightly and see how the other person responds. If they follow you then you can continue kissing, and potentially even push them forward very slightly back in the other direction. However, this maneuver works best if you create a slight separation between your lips. [2] X Research source This manufactures of a moment of romance, with your lips only slightly apart and your bodies close together."

      "title": "Try softly biting or sucking on your partner's lower lip.",
      "content": "Try softly biting or sucking on your partner's lower lip. This should be a natural position. While you are kissing your lips are generally slightly parted and you aren’t always meeting your partners lips directly head on. Aim for the lower lip and then before pulling away suck on it a little bit or give it a tiny bite. This will feel new and exciting for your partner and it also adds some sensation."

      "title": "Peck softly.",
      "content": "Peck softly. Sometimes less is more. By pecking softly, you are setting the stage for more to come and it can also be very romantic if you pause on your partners face during one of the pecks and breathe out slowly that can add to the romance. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Kiss at certain times of the day.",
      "content": "Kiss at certain times of the day. Greeting with a passionate kiss can be a nice surprise and lead into passionate kissing. The same goes for a good morning kiss or a goodbye kiss. Really there is never a bad time for a kiss, but these times can help punctuate a kiss and make it more passionate than it otherwise would have been. Try to think of romantic occasions to kiss your partner."

      "title": "Don’t rush.",
      "content": "Don’t rush. There is no rush! [4] X Research source The great part about kissing is that you’re taking time away from the world to enjoy your partner. You don’t need to scramble into things like the world is about to end. In all honesty, you will probably find it to be much more romantic and rewarding if you take the time to explore each other than if you kiss super fast and chaotically. Try it. Look at the kiss like puzzle pieces. Mimic the other person's movements, because if you're not fitting together like a puzzle, the kiss probably won't be as pleasurable as it could be."

    {
      "title": "Kiss your partner’s eyes one by one.",
      "content": "Kiss your partner’s eyes one by one. Then go back to kissing their lips. This is romantic and passionate and if you pause slowly in between each kiss you’ll only add to the anticipation. This can help you to break up the monotony of kiss after kiss and it also leaves you free to explore and kiss other areas around that area. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Kiss your partner’s earlobe or cheek.",
      "content": "Kiss your partner’s earlobe or cheek. Breathing into your partner’s ear can help make the earlobe kiss even more passionate. Don’t blow - a little breath will do the trick. You can even say their name softly for added emphasis, but make sure you say it quietly because everything is very amplified when you’re talking that close to their ear. You can kiss their cheek softly on the way back to their mouth if you want to. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Kiss your partners neck and under their chin.",
      "content": "Kiss your partners neck and under their chin. Kissing the neck is a classic move, but there’s a reason for it. People really seem to enjoy this, and it’s a nice break from kissing the lips because it’s so close. Try biting or sucking on the skin around the neck lightly for extra emphasis – you don’t want to leave your partner with an embarrassing mark. You don’t need to use your tongue at all in this scenario though, that will probably end up looking messy and wet. [7] X Research source Kissing the back of the neck is a great way to build up to regular kiss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kiss everywhere!",
      "content": "Kiss everywhere! There really isn’t a bad place to kiss someone as long as they feel comfortable. It will just look like you are exploring their body and show your partner that you like all of them – even enough to kiss it. [8] X Research source Kissing your wife’s stomach when she is expecting is a great example of this technique."

    {
      "title": "Try running your hands through your partner's hair.",
      "content": "Try running your hands through your partner's hair. Male or female, this is very romantic and passionate. If they have really long hair don’t follow it all the way down, obviously. After all, you’re stroking their hair – not brushing it. This technique works best if you keep your hands moving from their neck up to the back of their head. You can also explore other times of their head, tracing their ears with your finger or whatever else you think of."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push your body into the other person.",
      "content": "Push your body into the other person. Slight nudges from your pelvis or chest while your kissing can be a huge turn on for the other person, and it also pushes you closer together. Don’t get too dramatic about it, just a slight pressure is enough to get the point across. This is something that you can do sitting down or standing up and it will have the same effect regardless.

    {
      "title": "Put your hands on their hands, their hips, or their lower back.",
      "content": "Put your hands on their hands, their hips, or their lower back. You can use this hand position to pull them toward you, or to squeeze their hand, or to rub their lower back, or anything else you can think of. There are a lot of options and each of these positions offer the opportunity for you to express your passion through small pressures and touches with your hands. Plus, it makes the kiss more of an embrace."

    {
      "title": "Caress their neck while you kiss.",
      "content": "Caress their neck while you kiss. The idea behind this is that you’re giving a mini neck massage while kissing. This will show that you really care about how your partner is feeling and adds another skin on skin component to a kiss. Don’t try for a deep tissue massage, just stick to light kneading. You can combine the caress with touching their hair."
