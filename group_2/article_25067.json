Read more about what to do in a carbon monoxide emergency below . Rarely, this may be a non-emergency alarm. If you have confirmed this is not a carbon monoxide emergency, you can use the Hush feature on your carbon monoxide detector to stop the beeping. Read more about this below."

Kidde states that after seven years of use, their carbon monoxide detectors will start chirping every 30 seconds. [3] X Research source If you hear this sound, you likely need to replace your CO detector. If you own your own home, replace your CO detector immediately. If you rent, contact your landlord to let them know the detector is dying and you need a replacement as soon as possible."

[4] X Research source First, check to make sure the batteries in your CO detector are new and properly placed in the battery casing. If the batteries are okay, consider the following to determine if the beeping is due to environmental factors: The area around your CO detector is often humid or steamy, and may even form condensation. There's an air conditioner, heater, fan, or breezy open window near your detector. The room is consistently under 40 째F (4 째C) or over 100 째F (38 째C). If any of these are true for you, your CO detector may be in a bad spot. Try moving it to a different location. The manual that came with your carbon monoxide detector will suggest the best spots to put your detector."

If you call 911, the dispatcher will most likely send the fire department and an ambulance to your location, so you don't need to call the fire department separately. However, if no one in your family is showing signs of CO poisoning, you can avoid calling 911 and just contact your local fire department's non-emergency number. Once you speak to someone at the fire department, explain the situation, especially if you know the reason why your CO detector is beeping or not."

If your unit is not beeping 4 times and then pausing and/or you've confirmed via the unit's screen that there's a non-emergency issue occurring, you can proceed with resetting it. If you aren't sure why your CO alarm is beeping, it's always safest to evacuate and call for help, even in the case of a false alarm. Try fixing the root cause of the beep before resetting it. Use this step above to determine what the cause of the beeping is (i.e. a dead battery, a dying unit, etc.). If fixing the root cause doesn't stop the beeping or the beeping isn't caused by something you can figure out (but it's not an emergency), you can continue with resetting the device."
