Even if you are good at English, with good grammar and a large vocabulary, native English speakers may have trouble understanding you if your pronunciation is not correct. [3] X Research source Correct pronunciation is needed if you want to improve your English. Listen carefully to how native English speakers pronounce words and sounds and do your best to copy them. Pay attention to any sounds that you don't know. For example, some people have trouble pronouncing the \"r\" sound, as it does not exist in their native language, while other people have difficulty with some consonant combinations, such as the \"th\" sound. Be aware that the pronunciation of English words varies a lot depending on where it's spoken. For example, American English is very different from British English. If you want to travel to or live in an English-speaking country, this is something you should consider when learning how to pronounce words."

Although reading, watching English TV and listening to the news is also helpful. Once you learn a new word or phrase, you should use it in a sentence -- this is the best way to memorize it. Another way to memorize words is to make labels for everyday household items and attach them to those everyday items. Then every time you use the kettle or look in the mirror, you will see the English word for these items. You should also start a notebook of idioms that English speakers use all the time. Some examples include \"it's raining cats and dogs\" (raining heavily), to be on \"cloud nine\" (to be very happy) or saying something is a \"piece of cake\" (when something is very easy). Using these idioms in your conversation will help you improve your English."
