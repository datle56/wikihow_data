If you can find nothing dry, use bits of your own clothing, the contents of your wallet or purse, or anything which you may have on you which will take fire.) Other tinder materials: Dry milkweed fluff (found in the fall) Paper gum wrappers Frayed wooden stick Dried moss or lichen (found on the ground or on rocks) Pine bark or pine needles (very flammable) Pine cones Cotton ball, may have petroleum jelly, chapstick (it's mostly wax), or alcohol on it to help it burn Dried leaves or grasses Waxed paper from food or candy bars Birthday candles, especially joke candles that don't blow out"
