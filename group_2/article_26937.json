      "content": "Apply neutral or light eyeshadow from your lash line up to your crease. Dip your brush into a neutral, nude, or light eyeshadow, then brush it across your lid, working from your lashline to the crease. The eyeshadow will prime your lid and allow for a smoother application of eyeliner. It will also give the eyeliner something to cling to, so it will stay put and won't smudge or rub off. Because cat eyes are so dramatic, darker eyeshadow colors can look overdone. Instead, consider using a color that matches your skin tone or is slightly lighter. Don't use a cream eyeshadow. The eyeliner won't stick to it, and both the liner and eyeshadow could easily wipe off."

      "content": "Angle a brush from your nose to your outer brow to find your end point. Hold a slim makeup brush against the side of your nose and angle it until it points to the end of your eyebrow—this is the line you want your wing to follow. You want your wings to be as identical as possible—different lengths, widths, and angles will look off. [1] X Research source If your eyelids are hooded, make the angle less upward and more horizontally straight. This will extend your lash line and open up your eyes. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use eyeliner to make a dot just above your crease to mark the tip of your wing. The higher you make your dot, the thicker and more dramatic your cat eye will be. Make sure the dots are at the same angle and height on both eyes before moving on. [4] X Expert Source Nini Efia Yang Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 27 August 2019. It's much easier to erase a dot and move it than to erase an entire wing. If you aren't happy with the placement of your dot, use a cotton swab dipped in eye makeup remover, primer, or moisturizer to wipe it away. Then, lightly dab your foundation onto the clean spot and try again."

      "title": "Draw a line connecting the dot to the outer corner of your eye.",
      "content": "Draw a line connecting the dot to the outer corner of your eye. Don't pull on your skin while drawing the wing. Instead, tilt your head back slightly and lower your gaze so that you can see your lash line. This will help you see what you're doing as you create your cat eyes. Although pulling your skin taut may make it easier to draw your line, when you release the skin, your wing will change shape and it may look sloppy."

      "content": "Draw a line connecting the dot to the middle of your upper lash line. Gently pull your eyeliner from the corner of your eye to the middle of your lid. Position your line as high as you want your cat eye to go. It's okay if you have eyeshadow peeking out below the line, as you will fill it in later. [5] X Research source Don't make the line too thick if you don't have a lot of socket space, or else you'll completely lose the eyelid space that you have. [6] X Expert Source Cassandra McClure Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 7 March 2019. If you have a round eye, try a thicker wing and line. For instance, you might make your line about 2-3 mm thick. [7] X Research source If you want to extend your lash line and make your eyes look bigger, draw a curved line instead of a straight one. Make sure that the line is curving downwards."

      "content": "Fill in the outline you have made, if necessary. Depending on how you angled your initial lines, and how thick you drew them, you may or may not need to fill the outline in. Use your eyeliner to fill in any areas where eyeshadow is peeking through. [8] X Research source If you drew your top line right at your lash line, then you may not need to add any filler. If you're using pencil eyeliner, make several layers to fill in your cat eye."

[9] X Research source You can also dip the cotton swab in primer or eye cream and use that to gently remove any excess eyeliner. Avoid using makeup remover. It might do the job too well and remove any eyeshadow that you put on earlier. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw a line to connect the inner corner of your eye with your cat eye. Position your eyeliner at the corner of your eye, then slowly pull the liner toward the cat eye. Continue across your eye until you reach the outer corner of your lid. This will make the top of your cat eye look even. Try your best to do this in a single, fluid motion. Otherwise, the line may look jerky and uneven. Again, avoid pulling on your eyelid. Instead, tilt your head back slightly and lower your gaze so that you can see your lash line. You can try tightlining your eyelid, which means you get the liner between your lashes and up against your waterline, but this can be difficult to do and may irritate your eye."

It will stabilize your hand and make it easier to get a smooth, straight line instead of a shaky one. If you are using a felt-tip liner, hold it closer to the middle of the tube so you have more control."

The powder will smooth out your lid and help the eyeliner go on smoother. Because cat eyes are so dramatic, consider using a color that matches your skin tone or is slightly lighter instead of a darker color, which can look overdone. Avoid using a cream-based eyeshadow. The eyeliner won't stick to that very well, so it could slide right off. Avoid putting on under-eye concealer just yet because the tape will take it off. Also, the tape may remove any eyeshadow in that area."

This will make the tape less tacky and gentler on the delicate skin around your eye.

Then, use the pad of your finger to lightly tap it down so that your eyeliner doesn't bleed under the tape. [14] X Research source For a more dramatic look, angle the tape towards the end of your eyebrow instead. This will result in a thicker line. If your eyelids are hooded, position the tape at less of an upward angle and closer to a horizontally straight line. [15] X Research source"

Apply your liquid, felt tip, or gel eyeliner as you normally would, but make the line thicker as it goes towards the outer corner of your eye. However, don't draw past the corner or onto the tape just yet. [16] X Research source If you are having trouble applying the eyeliner smoothly, don't tug on the outer corner of your eye. Instead, tilt your head back slightly and lower your gaze to see your lash line. Alternatively, rest your pinkie finger against your cheek to steady your hand as you draw. When you're doing cat eyes, it's best to use liquid, felt tip, or gel eyeliner. If you only have pencil eyeliner, you can layer it to create a similar result, but it won't look as smooth."

As you reach the end of the tape, taper the line to a thin point. Follow the tape line as smoothly as possible, and don't worry if you get some eyeliner onto the tape. [17] X Research source You can make the \"flick\" of your cat eye as long or as short as you want. The longer it is, the more dramatic your cat eye will be. When you first start doing a cat eye, it's easiest to make a very short flick by extending your eyeliner slightly past your eye, over your crease."

When you pull the tape off, you will see a nice, crisp line. [18] X Research source If the tape removed any eyeshadow, carefully patch it up with more eyeshadow. If you usually apply any under eye concealer, you can do so now. If you used a pencil eyeliner, you may need to do several layers of eyeliner to get a cat eye look."
