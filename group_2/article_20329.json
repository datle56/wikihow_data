      "content": "Make meaningful eye contact whenever you’re together. Let your crush know that you’re focused on her by keeping your eyes centered on her. While you don’t want to just stare at her, focused eye contact can demonstrate your interest and investment in a conversation, especially if you nod periodically.

      "title": "Determine if you both have similar values.",
      "content": "Determine if you both have similar values. Pay attention to the girl and see what kinds of personality traits and personal values appeal to her. Does she prefer the studious, serious, and morally grounded individuals, or the carefree, impulsive, and brash people? Do her preferences line up with your own values? If not, you might be setting yourself up for an incompatible relationship. [3] X Research source For instance, if she prefers to spend her nights inside but you prefer going to parties, you both might have some difficulty arriving at any common ground. Don’t change your personality and interests to better mesh with the girl that you like. While it’s great if you want to get involved with her hobbies and interests, it’s far less great to build a relationship on the foundation of a fake shared interest."

      "content": "Act chivalrously when you spend time together. See if she prefers it when you act in a traditional, chivalrous manner, like holding the door. If she seems to like this kind of behavior, make an effort to dish out the formalities. Whenever you act chivalrous, do your best to act subtly, instead of making your romantic gestures obvious. [4] X Research source Some girls don’t like acts of chivalry. Make sure you know your crush’s opinion on this before you do anything."

      "title": "Don’t be afraid to make the first move.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid to make the first move. Take a chance and ask her if she’d like to grab a meal or see a movie with you. While this can seem like a risky romantic maneuver, you can clearly show your intentions without anything getting lost in translation. Only ask her once, and accept her answer after she gives it to you. If she doesn’t want to go on a date, respect her decision. [5] X Research source Try and come up with a fairly specific plan for your date. The term “hang out” might be too ambiguous for some girls. For example, say something like: “Hey! I was wondering if you’d like to meet up for dinner on Friday. I know a great Italian restaurant in town. Would you be interested?” You can ask her out in-person, online, or over text."

      "content": "Make an effort to get along with her friends. Pay attention to the people she hangs out with. While you don’t want to come off as a stalker, you can end up appearing very friendly and genuine by trying to meet and get along with her closest mates. Start with basic conversation when talking to her friends and being as cordial and genuine as possible. [6] X Research source This can be a trickier route to navigate if you do most of your chatting and messaging online. Keep your distance by messaging her friends with a basic and friendly greeting, if you choose to contact them at all. Make it clear that you’re not trying to flirt with her friends, as this could give her the wrong idea. Whenever you talk with her friends, keep your conversations completely casual without any hint of romantic interest."

      "content": "Go out of your way to remember her favorite things. Pay attention to what she likes, such as her food preferences and favorite color. The next time you see her, bring a snack or drink that’s in a flavor she really enjoys. Additionally, try asking for or offering different music recommendations, as this could give you both something fun to talk about. [10] X Research source For example, try asking her something like this: “I was listening to the radio the other day and heard a song by this new indie band. Are you into indie music at all?”"

As you speak, make the compliment as heartfelt as possible, whether it’s about her new haircut or about the kind way she treats others. [11] X Research source For instance, try saying something like: “You’re such a kind and caring person. I really admire how you always put everyone else first.” While physical compliments can be flattering, avoid making any remarks that might seem objectifying.

Think about your own goals and accomplishments, and where you’d like to be in the future as an individual. Remember that these interests will always be yours, and that they won’t be compromised if a romantic relationship doesn’t pan out with the girl you like. [12] X Research source No one likes an arrogant person; in fact, arrogance usually indicates that a person is insecure. Instead, try living your life in a calm, self-assured way—girls will find this much more attractive. Don’t feel the need to boast about your accomplishments. Any worthwhile achievement can speak for itself."

      "content": "Keep a patient attitude while you get closer with her. Always remember that your potential relationship won’t take shape in a single day. Take things slow whenever you talk and interact with her, and pay attention for signals that she might be interested in you. If you try and rush into a relationship, you might turn the girl off and ruin any future chances of dating. [13] X Research source For example, don’t immediately try asking her out. Wait several weeks or months to see if she likes spending time with you. If a girl expresses a lot of interest in hanging out later on, it’s a very good sign that she enjoys spending time with you."
