      "content": "Understand that there are many types of learning disabilities. Each of these disabilities affects an individual in different ways and can produce different types of symptoms. LDs can affect the way the brain processes audio, visual, or speech-related information or stimuli. LDs are the result of neurological-based problems that affect the way that the brain receives, processes, stores, and responds to information: the brain's cognitive functioning. LDs are not curable, they are lifelong. But, they can be managed with the proper help."

For example, poor-handwriting skills can be the result of difficulties processing symbols (dyslexia); or from poor spatial organization skills (dysgraphia). The most common LDs are: [2] X Research source Dyslexia is a reading disability that affects how one interprets sounds, letters and words. It can affect general vocabulary skills as well as one's reading speed and efficiency. Symptoms of dyslexia include late speech, difficulty with handwriting, and difficulty rhyming words. Dyscalculia affects math and \"number sense.\" Traits include trouble with memorization, difficulty with learning to count and other math skills, difficulty measuring things (e.g. when cooking), and trouble with concepts like judging distance and time.

Handwriting tends to be clumsy and hard to read, with issues with spelling and capitalization. Communicating through writing is difficult and takes a long time.

Take well-detailed notes if necessary, and look for the most obvious symptoms of a LDâ€”poor memorization, delayed social skills, and frustration with academic tasks like reading or writing.

Think about life circumstances and other conditions that could be influencing your or your child's life. Life circumstances like poverty, grief, food insecurity, bullying, abuse/neglect, health issues, discrimination, and family conflicts can make it harder to focus on learning. Mental health issues like anxiety and depression can impact learning.
