      "content": "Go to the grocery store. Stay on the perimeter of the store and buy mainly fruits and vegetables. Over 1/2 of your plate should be filled with vegetables at each meal. Aim to replace processed foods, such as bread, with complex carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables. High-carb vegetables include squash, beans, sweet potatoes, green peas, carrots, beets and corn. These vegetables will fill you up and keep you full longer than bread or pasta. Mix in low-carb vegetables, such as avocado, green beans, tomatoes, bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, chard, asparagus and summer squash. Swap out rice, couscous, and potatoes with quinoa, which is higher in protein and fiber. [1] X Expert Source Tara Coleman Clinical Nutritionist Expert Interview. 2 March 2021. Get a variety of colors into your diet. Buy red, green, orange, brown, blue and any other color of fruit and vegetable you can get your hands on. Colors indicate different nutrients and a balanced diet."

      "content": "Make these changes for the next 4 days; however, consider making them into lifestyle changes. Doctors agree that low-carb and yo-yo dieting leads to weight gain when diets return to normal. It is also hard on your body. The best way to lose weight is to change your eating habits to include produce, lean protein and whole grains. Recent studies have shown that eating low-carb just 2 to 3 days a week can help you achieve weight loss goals. After your first 4 days, you can add whole grains in, but replace processed carbohydrates with low-carb vegetables every other day."

Although actual weight can fluctuate throughout the day, if you are losing inches on arms, legs, stomach or chest measurements, you are making good progress toward healthy and substantial weight loss. After you try on clothing or measure yourself with a fabric measuring tape, you can weigh yourself. Try to weigh yourself only once each week, at approximately the same time during the day. Keep in mind that while you burn fat, you may also be gaining muscle. Muscle building may keep the scale from dropping for a few days; however, muscle tissue burns more calories than fatty tissue, and you will see greater weight loss in the long-term."
