      "content": "Stay calm and do not panic. There's some truth to the adage that dogs and other animals can smell fear, and dogs are less likely to attack if you’re laid back and low energy . If you become agitated and run or scream, the dog is more likely to attack. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Do not wave your arms around or kick with your legs; the dog may perceive these actions as threatening. An attacking dog isn’t always behaving aggressively. A lot of the time, they’re attacking because they’re scared or confused. So, the less you do to spook or confuse the dog, the less likely they’ll be to lash out."

      "title": "Look away, be motionless, and make yourself rigid.",
      "content": "Look away, be motionless, and make yourself rigid. When a dog approaches, stand completely still with your hands at your sides and avert your eyes. In many cases, the dog will lose interest and walk away if you ignore them. Locking eyes or making a lot of movement can send the signal that you’re ready to fight. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Eye contact in particular can send the message to a scared or aggressive dog that you’re challenging them. Stand sideways to the dog and keep them in your peripheral vision instead of facing them. This will signal to the dog that you are not a threat. Don't open your hands and arms up to a bite by extending them. Keep your fingers curled into fists to avoid losing a finger. The dog may come quite close (they may even sniff you) without actually biting."

      "title": "Do not make a run for it unless you’re certain you can get away.",
      "content": "Do not make a run for it unless you’re certain you can get away. Running away can awaken the dog's prey instinct to chase and catch animals. They may pursue you vigorously even if their initial intent was just playful. Additionally, you won't be able to outrun most dogs if you're on foot. Even if you are on a bicycle, many dogs will be able to catch up to you. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If the dog is sprinting and barking at you from a distance and you’re 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) from your car, go ahead and run to the vehicle and get inside."

      "title": "Distract or confuse the dog with another object.",
      "content": "Distract or confuse the dog with another object. If the dog continues to threaten you, offer them something to chew on, such as your backpack or water bottle. This may distract or bewilder the dog long enough to give you time to escape. [4] X Research source You may want to carry treats or toys when traveling in areas known to be home to dangerous dogs. If approached by an angry dog, throw your treats or toy away from you. The dog may go after these instead of you."

      "title": "Walk away slowly after the dog calms down.",
      "content": "Walk away slowly after the dog calms down . If an aggressive dog finally cools off a bit as you’re standing stiff and ignoring them calmly, it’s a sign you’ve got a window to leave. Shuffle sideways away from the dog as slowly as you reasonably can to get away without turning your back or making any sudden movements. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Fight back if the dog leaps at you and won’t stop.",
      "content": "Fight back if the dog leaps at you and won’t stop. If the dog starts biting you, you've got to defend yourself . Hit or kick the dog in the throat, nose, and back of the head. This will stun the dog and give you time to get away. [6] X Research source Raise your voice at this point. Yell for help as you're fighting back. Hopefully, others will hear and come to your aid. If you have a stick or another weapon, you can (and should) use it to hit the dog. If available, mace or pepper spray also work as a good defense against an attacking dog. Fight as though your life depends on it because it does. Dog attacks can be fatal, so don’t take it easy on them. If you hurt the dog, that’s okay."

      "title": "Use your weight to your advantage and wrap the dog up.",
      "content": "Use your weight to your advantage and wrap the dog up. If the dog is medium-sized, bring your entire body weight to bear on the animal, specifically pushing down with the hard points of your knees or elbows. Dogs are vicious biters but they’re pretty bad at wrestling, so wrap them up and hold on. Get on top of the animal and concentrate force on their throat or ribs. [7] X Research source If it’s a smaller dog you can manhandle a bit, straddle the back of the dog with your body weight and apply forward pressure to the back of the neck. They’ll be forced to let go to breathe. Don’t put your weight on the dog if they’re larger or they’re a breed known for jaw strength (like rottweilers, pit bulls, or German shepherds)."

      "title": "Get on the ground and protect yourself if it’s a larger, stronger dog.",
      "content": "Get on the ground and protect yourself if it’s a larger, stronger dog. If you can’t realistically hurt the dog, just defend yourself. Cover your face, chest, and throat. Wrap your body up and lie down with your vital areas protected. The dog will be more likely to stop attacking you if they get the impression you’re no longer a threat. [8] X Research source Resist the urge to scream or roll away, since this will just encourage the dog to keep attacking. If the dog doesn’t stop attacking, at least you’ll buy some time by covering up—hopefully, someone will come to help."

      "title": "Leave the area slowly and carefully.",
      "content": "Leave the area slowly and carefully. Once the dog loses interest in you, leave the scene of the attack slowly by backing away without sudden movements. Staying calm and stationary can be a real test of your nerves in such a stressful situation, but it's the best thing to do as long as the dog isn't biting you. [9] X Research source"

Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze pad. If bleeding is serious or if it won't stop after several minutes of applying pressure, seek professional medical attention immediately.

Look closely for signs of infection, including redness, warmth, increasing tenderness, or oozing pus. See a doctor if any of these symptoms arise."

Call the authorities immediately after a dog attack so that the dog can be prevented from harming anyone else and be tested for diseases.

Removing them from the area is the best way to ensure the safety of yourself and others. For dogs with owners nearby, how you handle the situation after the attack has been diffused is up to you. If you've been hurt, you may want to take legal action. Many states have laws holding owners responsible for the actions of their dogs."

      "content": "Look for warning signs a dog is ready to attack. Most dogs are not aggressive, but, rather, just curious or defending what they perceive as their territory. Thus, to avoid unnecessary conflict, it is important to be able to tell if a dog is just playing or is being truly aggressive. Any dog can bite, so do not ignore warning signs because you think a certain breed is harmless or friendly. Watch for common signs of aggression (and non-aggression) such as raised back hair, tail up high, bared teeth, and raised ears.

      "content": "Avoid aggravating a dog by accident. Most dog attacks are the result of insufficient containment of the dog, poor training, or taunting. Unfortunately, the world will never be rid of bad owners, so it is wise to be prepared. Use common sense to avoid aggravating any kind of animal. [14] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Never pet a dog without the owner’s permission. Never irritate a dog who's eating or caring for her pups. Dogs are extra-protective during these times. Avoid smiling at the dog. You may think you are putting on a friendly face with a big toothy smile, but an aggressive dog sees you baring your teeth for a fight. Dogs that are chained or tethered to a stationary object for extended periods are more likely to be aggressive, so do not come within their reach."
