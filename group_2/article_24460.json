      "content": "Yes, Cider is a safe and legit website for buying fashion apparel. It has a 4.5 out of 5-star rating on Trustpilot , a website where customers rate and review businesses. Customers on Trustpilot haven't complained about getting their payment information stolen by using the site, and most of them report receiving their orders (though not always in a timely manner). They're mixed on the product quality, though. While some customers love the items they bought, others say theirs came damaged or came apart after they were worn. Despite being legitimate, it's worth noting that Cider is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) . Its current rating on BBB is 1.2 out of 5 stars from 5 customer reviews."

This means you won't get reimbursed the full amount you paid for your order. They do provide a pre-paid return shipping label, so you don't have to cover the shipping cost out of pocket â€” for the first item, that is. If you return more than one item from your order, however, you have to pay for shipping for those additional products..

Cider cautions that some orders may be delayed because of extended customs clearance times. [9] X Research source Track the shipping status of your order by logging into your Cider account here . Some people on the internet suspect that Cider actually drop-ships their inventory instead of ordering them directly from factories. Dropshipping is a business model in which a company doesn't hold inventory. Instead, they place bulk orders from suppliers like AliExpress, who then ship the product to the customer. [10] X Research source If true, this would mean that Cider doesn't have any original designs. It would also explain why some customers' orders get delayed or lost, since they would have to order the product from a supplier. However, there's no real proof that Cider uses dropshipping."

      "content": "Yes, Cider is fast fashion like Shein or Princess Polly. A major clue is the fact that Cider adds dozens, if not hundreds, of new items to their website every week. The company can expand their catalog so often because they focus on producing as many products as they can using the cheapest materials. This allows them to charge much lower prices than luxury brands, but the quality of the products is extremely low, and customers have to spend more money over time to keep replacing them.

Their website shows a Zero-Tolerance Policy outlining how they want factory employees to be treated in areas like Human Rights, Safety, and Environment. [16] X Research source But the language is vague on how (or if) the policy is enforced. Even if it is enforced, Cider's requirements may not make much of an impact. For example, the policy specifies that the workers' wages shouldn't be lower than the minimum wage. However, in Guangzhou, where the factories the brand uses are located, the minimum wage is 23.7 RMB. [17] X Research source That's equivalent to $3.26 in US dollars, which isn't nearly enough to make a comfortable living."

Keep in mind that most of the items you purchase through Cider have to travel all the way from China where they're manufactured. Then, once they arrive in the US, they must be cleared for entry by Customs. This process can take several weeks from beginning to end."

This means you might be waiting several weeks for your order to be delivered, only to have to send it back because it has holes or rips in it.

Not only do you have to pay a $3.99 restocking fee for every parcel, but if you're returning more than one item from the same order, you have to cover the shipping cost, as well. That's a total loss of $9.98, which is a hard pill for most consumers to swallow."
