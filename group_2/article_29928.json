      "content": "Print and cut out a hooked, triangular template to use for your project. Search online for a downloadable template of a small easel or stand that you can trace onto some cardboard. Try to print the design on cardstock or some other type of sturdy paper, as regular paper may be too flimsy. [1] X Research source You can find a template for download here: https://www.sophie-world.com/sites/default/files/easel%20template%20copy.pdf . This stand isn’t very big, so it’s best for frames that around 6 in (15 cm) or so wide."

      "content": "Cut off at least 1 edge from a cardboard box. Set out a mat, board or other sturdy surface that can absorb any scratches from a box cutter. Lay a flattened cardboard box on top, and slice along the edge of the flaps with a box cutter. Feel free to remove all the flaps, or just 1. [2] X Research source You’re only going to be using a corner of the cardboard box, so you need to remove a minimum of 1 flap. If you’re using the sample template, the cardboard stand’s total length will be 22 in (56 cm). If you’re creating that kind of stand, make sure you’re cutting from a cardboard box that’s large enough. You don’t need to use any of the flaps you cut from the box."

      "content": "Trace the template along the edge of the box. Find the edge of the flattened box where the cardboard is folded and stacked on top of itself. Since most templates are designed to be cut on a folded edge, arrange the shorter, vertical side of the template along the folded edge of your cardboard. After this, trace around the template with a permanent marker. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that the sample template is designed to be cut on a folded edge."

Since you’re working with multiple layers of cardboard, it might take a few tries before you’re able to cut through the box completely. Just keep working at it until you succeed!

Arrange your photo frame along the 2 front grooves, leaning it against the back portion of the stand. If your frame is really bulky and thick, this stand might not be sturdy enough to hold it up. If you’re using a template that’s different from the sample, check the website you found it on for further instructions."

Jot down the frame measurements on a separate piece of paper so you can remember them later on. [6] X Research source For instance, if your picture frame is around 8 by 10 in (20 by 25 cm), the top arm can 5 in (13 cm) and the bottom arm can be 4 1 ⁄ 4 in (11 cm). It’s important to note that each arm is made with 2 pieces of wood. Your leg piece can be"

Note that the 1 ⁄ 2 by 2 in (1.3 by 5.1 cm) section of wood for your top arm needs to be 4 in (10 cm) thicker than the width of your picture frame, while the section of wood for the bottom arm only needs to be 3 1 ⁄ 4 in (8.3 cm) thicker.

You’ll need a 1 by 2 in (2.5 by 5.1 cm) plank for the leg, as well as a 1 ⁄ 2 by 6 in (1.3 by 15.2 cm) sheet of wood for the base. The top and bottom arms will be secured to the leg, which will then be secured to the base. [8] X Research source For the stand to work properly, note that the plank for the leg needs to be 3 in (7.6 cm) taller than the total height of your picture frame. For instance, if your photo frame is 6 in (15 cm) tall, your stand only needs to be 9 in (23 cm)."

Squeeze a line of wood glue on top of the thicker piece, then push the 2 sections of wood together for several seconds. Repeat this process again so you have both the top and bottom arms for your frame. [9] X Research source The flat, wide portions of wood should be glued together, creating a thicker section. Follow the recommended drying time listed on the bottle of wood glue. For instance, if your picture frame is 8 by 10 by 1 in (20.3 by 25.4 by 2.5 cm), the top arm would be 5 in (13 cm) long and the bottom arm would be 4 1 ⁄ 4 in (11 cm)."

Arrange an L-bracket along the corner of the 2 wood pieces, where they form a 90-degree angle. Use 2 small screws to connect the bracket to the rest of the stand. [12] X Research source If possible, try to use the screws that came with the L-bracket. Don’t use super long screws for this, or else they might stick through the wood. Instead, use screws that are about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long or so."
