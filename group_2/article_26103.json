      "title": "Pay attention to basic grooming.",
      "content": "Pay attention to basic grooming. Vulcans stay clean and tidy. Shower regularly, and keep your hair, face, and teeth in good shape. Vulcans dislike strong smells. Apply sufficient deodorant, and avoid overpowering perfumes or colognes. You do not want your odor to bother other people. Pay special attention to dental care. Brush your teeth regularly, and use mouthwash. Dental problems can be very painful, and they are important to avoid. Some Vulcans wear makeup. (For instance, Spock wears eye shadow.) However, makeup is not necessary regardless of your gender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try wearing your hair short.",
      "content": "Try wearing your hair short. Vulcans usually wear short, practical hairstyles. This way, their hair is easy to care for, and is unlikely to ever get caught in something. If you prefer to keep your hair longer, try keeping it in a ponytail or bun so that it won't get in your way. While Vulcans tend to have straight dark hair, there is no need to change your natural color or texture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress practically.",
      "content": "Dress practically. Vulcans tend to wear simple clothing, and often prefer dark colors (though this is not always the case). Wear clothes that are comfortable and don't restrict your movement. Dress appropriately for the weather. Wearing layers (such as a sweater over a short-sleeve shirt) is often practical for unpredictable weather. Avoid flashy clothing, clothing that advertises a brand, or any writing. A plain shirt (Blue, red, yellow, grey, white, ect.) is perfect. If you require a certain clothing for any occasion then obviously wear it. Uniforms are required in some places, so use them. Wear comfortable shoes that are easy to move around in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get adequate sleep.",
      "content": "Get adequate sleep. Your brain needs to be well-rested to be at its best. Sleep for 7-10 hours each night, based on your body's individual needs. If waking up in the morning is difficult, then you likely need more sleep."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create an exercise routine.",
      "content": "Create an exercise routine. Exercise has many health benefits, making it a logical activity. Try to exercise for 30 minutes at least three times a week. A daily exercise habit is easier to follow. Light exercise is better than no exercise. Even simple activities like walking can be beneficial."
    },
    {
      "title": "Meditate",
      "content": "Meditate . Vulcans meditate daily, often before bedtime. Meditation helps them manage their emotions and stay in good health. Experiment with different types of meditation and see what suits you. Vulcan meditation is documented online. [1] X Research source You can also try human meditation styles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat like a Vulcan.",
      "content": "Eat like a Vulcan. Vulcans are vegetarian, and they avoid touching their food with their hands. Choose to eat healthy foods, and minimize or eliminate meat from your diet. Cut down on simple sugars. Check with a doctor before making any major dietary changes. Harming your health through uninformed decisions is illogical. Vulcans will eat meat if it is necessary. If you have a health condition or other circumstances that make going vegetarian difficult or impossible, then eating meat may be the most logical decision. Eat when you are hungry, and listen to your body if it is craving a specific food group. Starving yourself, yo-yo dieting, eating restrictive diets, or eating when bored are all illogical. If you are bored, chew gum. If you find that you are hungry between meals, get a healthy snack."
    },
    {
      "title": "Refuse to make unhealthy choices.",
      "content": "Refuse to make unhealthy choices. Say no to things that could harm your body or mind. If someone offers you something unhealthy, say \"No, thank you. I'm not interested.\" Vulcans tend to avoid alcohol. If you do drink, limit yourself to one drink so that you are not significantly impaired. Never drink and drive. Minimize sugars and trans fats in your diet. Avoid drugs. Do not smoke, vape, abuse medication, or try drugs. If you have a drug habit, work on quitting. The only \"drugs\" in your system should be prescription medication (if recommended by a doctor). Follow any advice from your doctor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get medical advice when you have a health problem, if possible.",
      "content": "Get medical advice when you have a health problem, if possible. Suffering in silence without treatment is illogical. Instead, tell the doctor what is going on. Getting appropriate treatment early on will help keep the problem from getting worse. If your symptoms are complex, or if you think it will be hard to communicate them, consider writing them down. You can show the doctor what you wrote. Doctors are human and fallible. If you think that the doctor may be overlooking something, speak up. If they refuse to listen or treat the problem (e.g. lecturing you on your weight instead of listening when you say that you have a problem with your hand), you may need to find a better doctor. Get a check-up every year, if possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice confident posture.",
      "content": "Practice confident posture. Stand or sit up straight. Make eye contact with other people, if appropriate. Try to avoid slouching or crossing your legs too often, as these can harm your health over time. Eye contact is rude in some eastern cultures. People with disabilities like autism and social anxiety may be uncomfortable with eye contact. If you have a disability like this, try looking at people's eyebrows or mouths. (Most people can't tell the difference.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Enjoy your solitude.",
      "content": "Enjoy your solitude. Vulcans value their time spent alone, and use it to work on achieving their goals (whether they are pursuing learning, exercising, meditating, or doing something else)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adapt the Vulcan lifestyle to your own circumstances.",
      "content": "Adapt the Vulcan lifestyle to your own circumstances. It is illogical to engage in any habits that are unhelpful, or even harmful in your unique circumstances. Take a logical approach to your life, and make adaptations based on what suits you best. Keep in mind that you are human. A Vulcan lifestyle may not be perfectly suited for a human, and your emotional needs may be different. If you find that your needs are not being met, work on meeting them, even if it involves doing things (like hugging people or crying) that Vulcans typically do not do. A Vulcan lifestyle suits some people better than others. If it does not suit you, this does not mean that something is wrong with you. Vulcans appreciate diversity, so value what makes you unique, and find the lifestyle that works best for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on your studies.",
      "content": "Focus on your studies. Vulcans are always learning and studying new things. If you are in school, pay attention and take good notes. If you have a job, continue learning as you work. Find out what you specialize in, and work especially hard at building skills in those areas. Try spending some of your free time learning new things on sites like Khan Academy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cultivate curiosity.",
      "content": "Cultivate curiosity. When you don't understand something, say \"Fascinating,\" and start investigating. There are always new things to learn. Recognize that everyone has something to teach you. See if you can learn from them. Pride is illogical. Don't let jealousy consume you if you see someone who is more skilled in an area than you are. Instead, see what you can learn from them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Increase your vocabulary",
      "content": "Increase your vocabulary . Vulcans often like to be precise in their speech, so use the word that best fits the situation, especially if you are talking with educated people. Politely adjust your vocabulary when speaking to small children or people with a limited education. It is illogical to speak in ways that other people cannot understand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pursue artistic opportunities.",
      "content": "Pursue artistic opportunities. While many Vulcans pursue STEM fields, they also don't overlook the value of the arts. Music, painting, and other artistic activities are all suitable for Vulcans. Leaning how to play a musical instrument is beneficial to the brain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try puzzles in your spare time.",
      "content": "Try puzzles in your spare time. Vulcans often play games like chess and Kal-toh to practice their patience and logic. On Earth, you might choose to play games like chess, checkers, Sudoku, and logic puzzle games that you can download on a phone or tablet. Accept defeat gracefully when it occurs. A Vulcan understands that true perfection is virtually impossible, and it is highly probable that you will lose from time to time. Instead of seeing a loss as a sign of personal failure, recognize that it is a natural occurrence and a learning opportunity. Learn, and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Base your opinions on evidence.",
      "content": "Base your opinions on evidence. A common human issue is that people base their opinions on feelings, even when the evidence is contradictory or weak. Look at what the data and the scientists are saying. Base your views in fact, and be open to changing your mind if you receive better information. If you see evidence that contradicts your opinion, examine it thoroughly. Learn what you can. Be open to changing your mind and saying that you were wrong before. A logical person is open to new information. If you haven't researched something, try to avoid forming an opinion. Say \"I don't know enough about the subject to speak thoughtfully on it.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn something new every day.",
      "content": "Learn something new every day. Learning should be a lifelong habit. Keep exploring new ideas and learning about new perspectives."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop yourself when you feel an emotional reaction.",
      "content": "Stop yourself when you feel an emotional reaction. Vulcans are not unemotional; they have strong emotions that they choose not to publicly express. When you notice yourself experiencing emotion, take a moment to pause and reflect. This can stop you from reacting emotionally or irrationally. Labeling emotions can help you handle them. For example, tell yourself \"I'm experiencing frustration\" or \"I'm feeling sad.\" Mentally acknowledge the emotion. You do not have to react to things right away. Instead, pause, feel the emotion, and let it pass. Then think of how to react logically."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a logical way to approach a problem.",
      "content": "Look for a logical way to approach a problem. Focus on seeing problems as difficult challenges to be solved. Be willing to approach a problem from multiple perspectives, and get other people's insights on the issue. (They might notice something that you have missed.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Deal with your emotions quietly if necessary.",
      "content": "Deal with your emotions quietly if necessary. Vulcans do experience emotions, and they find ways to manage them. If you find yourself getting overwhelmed, excuse yourself, and go somewhere quiet. Do something that calms you. Crying can release chemicals and help you calm down. While Vulcans do not typically talk about their emotions, many humans find it helpful to discuss their feelings with a mentor or a good listener. The person can listen to you, offer comfort as needed, and then help you find a solution to any problems you are facing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice patience.",
      "content": "Practice patience. Vulcans understand that success takes time and effort. You may not always get your ideal outcome, and it likely won't happen right away. Be persistent. Take failure in your stride. You will not succeed every time you try. Learn from it, and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show respect for other people's emotions.",
      "content": "Show respect for other people's emotions. Vulcans interact with emotional species like humans all the time, and never become disrespectful. Emotions do not make other people inferior, just different. Appreciate diversity, and acknowledge their emotions without dismissing them. If someone is distressed, try validating their feelings by saying something like \"I can tell you are sad about this\" or \"Your frustration is understandable.\" This technique is often very effective at calming them. While Vulcans usually avoid touching others, sometimes physical contact is a logical way to comfort a distressed person. You might put a hand on their back or place an arm around them. Understand how human emotions work. Most humans need to express their feelings first, and listen to someone who validates their feelings. Once they are done letting out their emotions, they are usually calm enough to discuss solutions. Keep this order in mind. It is illogical to propose solutions before you have calmed the person, because they will not be ready for solutions yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be courteous.",
      "content": "Be courteous. Vulcans strive to be polite to everyone, including those who are different from them. Treat other people with respect and courtesy. Good manners are always logical. Vulcans can partake in gentle friendly teasing, at times. If a friend teases you, you may quietly tease them back (as long as it stays civil). Never tease them about their insecurities, as this may hurt their feelings. Some Vulcans can come across as too blunt, condescending, or rude. Try to avoid these pitfalls. They harm relationships and will not help you achieve your goals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect people's boundaries.",
      "content": "Respect people's boundaries. Vulcans respect people's privacy, personal space, and boundaries in general. If someone voices discomfort with something, apologize and stop immediately. Ask before touching. For example, instead of spontaneously hugging your crying friend, ask \"Would you like a hug?\" and see how they respond."
    },
    {
      "title": "Appreciate diversity.",
      "content": "Appreciate diversity. Vulcans value \"infinite diversity in infinite combinations,\" and this includes human diversity. Show respect and courtesy to everyone, regardless of race, gender, disability, religion, LGBTQ+ status, culture, body type, and more. Discrimination is illogical. Voice disapproval if someone makes an inappropriate remark, or decides to mock or disrespect someone who is different. Different people have different preferences. Recognize that your preferences don't define what's universally good or bad, just what works best for you. Similarly, other people's general preferences aren't a threat to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put no faith in gossip.",
      "content": "Put no faith in gossip. Vulcans don't gossip, nor do they have any interest in it. Refuse to participate in spreading rumors or talking negatively about people behind their backs. If people invite you to partake in gossip, decline. You might say \"I wouldn't want to say anything about [person's name] that I wouldn't say to their face.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Refuse to play a role in the mistreatment of others.",
      "content": "Refuse to play a role in the mistreatment of others. Vulcans have strong values, and won't cave to peer pressure. If you witness bullying, intervene. Here are things you can do: Give the bully a firm look and say \"That's enough\" or \"Stop.\" Talk to the victim. Strike up a pleasant conversation, while ignoring the bully. The victim will likely be grateful, and if you continue long enough, the bully may get bored and leave. Get an authority figure for help. Be willing to testify about what happened."
    },
    {
      "title": "Involve yourself in a cause bigger than yourself.",
      "content": "Involve yourself in a cause bigger than yourself. Spock has stated that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Spend time working towards the greater good. You might volunteer, take political action (e.g. by protesting harmful policies or supporting the environment), or even do something as simple as editing wikiHow articles. Harming yourself by neglecting your own needs in the pursuit of your cause is often unnecessary and illogical. If you are working too hard, stop. Mediate, exercise, rest, or do something else to restore your energy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize when an emotional display can be the logical course of action.",
      "content": "Recognize when an emotional display can be the logical course of action. Being logical doesn't have to mean denying all your emotions. Sometimes, emotional displays are effective at conveying the importance of something. Showing people how much you care about them can strengthen relationships. Communicating disgust or unhappiness can signal to people when their behavior is very inappropriate. Showing passion for an issue signals its importance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wish others well.",
      "content": "Wish others well. Vulcans tell others to \"live long and prosper.\" Communicate your positive intent to other people."
