      "title": "Clean the crystal.",
      "content": "Clean the crystal. Wash by hand in warm-to-hot water with mild dish soap. Prevent spotting by also washing with a 1/4 cup of ammonia. Use a soft cloth or sponge to avoid scratching, which may occur with scouring pads. Rinse the crystal and allow it to air-dry. If you dry it with a cloth, be sure the cloth is lint-free. To clean vases or decanters or any other piece that you can't reach inside of, fill them halfway with warm-to-hot water and a few drops of dish soap. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar or ammonia. Then add 1 cup of uncooked rice. Swirl the mixture around to clean the inside of the piece. Rinse it out with warm-to-hot water and then set it upside-down to air-dry. For tougher stains, fill the piece all the way with warm water. Add a denture-cleaning tablet. Wait for the mixture to remove the residue. Rinse the crystal thoroughly and set it upside-down to air-dry. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the crystal up to the light. Use a magnifying glass to search for the acid stamp. Start at the base, where it is most often located. [3] X Research source Search the grooves next if you don't find it on the base. Be aware that excessive washing, usage, and age may affect the acid stamp's visibility. [4] X Research source If you find none, have the crystal examined by an expert to authenticate it."

      "title": "Look for a paper or foil sticker.",
      "content": "Look for a paper or foil sticker. If your crystal is older or from a limited run, check for a gold sticker featuring Waterford's green seahorse emblem. [5] X Research source Be aware that stickers may have been removed over time, whether intentionally or not."

    {
      "title": "Compare stickers.",
      "content": "Compare stickers. Search online for images of authentic Waterford stickers to verify that the design matches your own. If possible, visit a retailer or collector in possession of Waterford pieces featuring stickers to compare them in person. If you're in doubt, seek an appraiser to judge your piece's authenticity."

    {
      "title": "Be wary of stickers.",
      "content": "Be wary of stickers. Remember that a sticker may be transferred from a genuine Waterford to another piece. Although older pieces may not have had one to begin with, check the crystal anyway for an acid stamp for further verification. If there isn't one, have the crystal examined by an expert to confirm that it's a true Waterford. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make sure it isn't glass.",
      "content": "Make sure it isn't glass. If you're unable to find an identifying sticker or acid stamp, check to see if it's made of genuine crystal or just glass. Find a piece of glassware that's about the same size and shape for comparison."

    {
      "title": "Hold the piece up to a light.",
      "content": "Hold the piece up to a light. Make sure the piece acts as a prism. Twist it slowly in front of the light source. Look for a rainbow to appear when the light disperses. [7] X Research source Do the same with the glassware and note that it does not produce a rainbow."

      "content": "Hold the piece up to your ear. Tap the rim. Listen for a musical chime that's high in pitch. To contrast, do the same with a piece of regular glassware and listen for the dull thud that comes when you tap it. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Judge the weight.",
      "content": "Judge the weight. Hold the glassware in one hand and your crystal in the other. If your piece is truly crystal, it should feel significantly heavier due to its higher lead content. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Research the design.",
      "content": "Research the design. If you're satisfied that your piece is truly crystal, have it examined by an expert to confirm whether its design matches one of Waterford's, or research it on your own with a book identifying Waterford's various designs. However, due to the high value of Waterford crystal pieces and the high number of counterfeits out there, [10] X Research source seek out a professional opinion for better peace of mind."
