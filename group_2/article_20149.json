This will help you realize when you’re spending too much time on something, and will quickly snap you back into focus when you get distracted.

If you get distracted or go off-task, don't make excuses for yourself. (e.g. \"I won't be able to focus until I do this anyway.\" or \"I'm sure it will only take a minute or two.\""

As you write assignments down in your planner throughout the week, make sure to write an “A” next to high priority tasks, a “C” next to lower priority tasks, and a “B” next to tasks that fall somewhere in between. An assignment that has to be completed by the next day would probably take priority over one that’s due next Tuesday. Also prioritize bigger assignments over smaller ones. A ten page essay that’s due in a week that you haven’t started should be labeled an “A” or “B” while a short five question worksheet due in three days may be labeled a “C”. Make sure you don't wait until the last second to get assignments done."
