If you’re hanging the flag parallel to a street, have the union point north if the street runs north to south, or east if the street runs east to west. If you’re hanging the flag over the street so the flag and street are perpendicular to each other, have the union point east if the street runs north to south, or north if it runs east to west.

The grommets are the small metal rings used to fly the flag on a flagpole. If you’re hanging a large, heavy flag, use nails instead so it’s more secure."

Run the rope through the 2 grommets on the flag and then tie the ends of the rope to 2 neighboring street lights or tall objects.

The flagpole needs to be parallel with the ground so the flag hangs vertically on it.
