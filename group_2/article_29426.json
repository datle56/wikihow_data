Generally, plant cells are larger than animal cells and are rectangular or cube shaped. [1] X Research source There are several good images of the parts of a plant cell online. The main distinguishing feature of a plant cell is that unlike an animal cell, it is surrounded by a thick, rigid cell wall. [2] X Research source Plant cells contain chloroplasts that produce food and energy for the cell while animal cells do not. [3] X Research source"

Most of the cells range in size between 1 and 100 micrometers and are only visible with the help of a microscope. [4] X Research source There are also several good images of the parts of an animal cell online. [5] X Research source Animal cells have smaller vacuoles that store food and nutrients while plant cells have 1 large vacuole that takes up most of the cell's mass. [6] X Research source"

Add the same amount of cold water to the mixture. If you are using unflavored jello, add fruit juice to the jello in place of water so the jello is a light, bright color.
