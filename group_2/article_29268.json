      "content": "Choose a tartan by clan. Clans and large families of Scottish origin often have their own tartan patterns since the early 1800s. You can wear a clan pattern only if your family has current or ancestral ties to that clan. Find out which clan you belong to. As long as you know your surname or a surname connected to Scottish ancestors, you can search online for your clan name. You can search for your clan name here: http://www.scotclans.com/scottish-clans/clans-a-z/ Locate information about your clan. Once you know your clan name, you can look up more information about your clan in order to find out the tartan pattern or patterns associated with it.

      "content": "Take hip and waist measurements. Take a tape measure and measure the distance around both your hips and your waist. These measurements will determine how much material you need for the kilt. For women, measure around the thinnest part of your waist and the widest part of your hips. For men, measure around the upper edge of your hip bones and the widest part of your buttocks. When taking measurements, make sure that the tape measure is taut and parallel to the ground."

If you plan to wear a wide kilt belt over your kilt, you should add 2 inches (5 cm) to this measurement for a high-rise waist."

      "title": "Calculate how much material you need.",
      "content": "Calculate how much material you need. Since you need to form pleats out of your material, you will need a much greater length of material than the distance around your waist. Measure the width of the \"sett\" or pattern on the plaid or tartan material. Each pleat will consist of a full sett with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of exposed pleat. In other words, if the setts on your material are 6 inches (15.25 cm) wide, each pleat will use 7 inches (17.75 cm). Calculate the amount of material you need by multiplying half of your hip measurement by the amount of material needed for each pleat, and add this value to your full hip measurement. Add an additional 20 percent for additional pleating and centering to get your total number of inches needed. Divide this value by 72 to determine how many yards you need at double width.

The cardboard guide should give you an idea of where to fold your first few pleats. After you begin folding, however, you may find that you do not need the guide since it should become a simple matter of matching the patterns together."
