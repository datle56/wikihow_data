      "content": "Scrub your hands with antibacterial hand soap and cold water. Wash with plain water for a few minutes before adding any soap or detergent. Make sure to get underneath your fingernails, too (try cutting them or using an old toothbrush to make it easier). [1] X Research source Try washing your hands first for everyday smells like garlic or onions. For chemical smells like gasoline, use an anti-grease soap . Rub the soap into your skin with a dry towel first, then wash as normal with water. Using cold water keeps your pores small and prevents the smell from sinking deeper into your skin.

Coat your hands in the mixture and leave it on for 30 seconds before rinsing it off with water. [3] X Research source Moisturize afterwards if the salt soap mixture dries out your skin. The dish soap kills germs and removes smelly particles while the salt and baking soda lightly exfoliate your hands."

      "content": "Wash your hands, then splash your palms with rubbing alcohol . Rub it all over your hands until it evaporates away. If the bad smell lingers, try another splash and rub again until the scent is gone. [4] X Research source Try using scented hand sanitizer or alcohol wipes to mask any faint, unwanted smells that might linger. Use 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of vodka if you don’t have rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer on hand. Alcohol can dry out your skin, so moisturize your hands after trying this method. If it doesn’t work after a splash or two, try another strategy."

If any smell still lingers after you rinse it off, follow up with another method like soap, lemon juice, or vinegar. [7] X Research source Use toothpaste for food smells, like fish, on your hands. You can even use it on any utensils or equipment that smells, too. Toothpaste is slightly abrasive and lightly exfoliates the top layer of your skin, helping get rid of bad smells effectively."

This trick works great for kitchen smells like fish, onions, or garlic. Do your best to get in between your fingers. Depending on the shape of the stainless steel you’re using, it might be hard to get every nook and cranny. Try keeping a bar of stainless steel “soap” in your kitchen to use after preparing pungent recipes. Sometimes referred to as \"faux soap,\" this can come shaped like an egg, a garlic bulb, etc.and is a decorative as well as useful addition. Keeping this handy can make it easy to clean your hands of odors quickly."
