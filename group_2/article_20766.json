If \"Getting Windows Ready\" is stuck on the screen after you reboot your computer, it's likely running an update that requires downloading a large file. There may still be update files that need to be installed and configured. It's important to give Windows ample time to complete the update process before moving on to other steps, as stopping the process can lead to file corruption. Check for a flashing light on the side of your laptop or desktop computer that indicates hard drive activity. If you see a flashing light, it's a good indicator that the update is still in progress. If the flashing light is stopped, it could mean Windows is stuck."
