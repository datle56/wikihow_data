      "title": "Prepare the ube.",
      "content": "Prepare the ube. Fresh ube has the strongest flavor, but frozen grated ube is easier to find in Asian markets outside the Philippines. Whichever you choose, get it ready for cooking: Fresh ube: Simmer whole or in large chunks until soft but not mushy, about 30–45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Peel the ube (throwing away the peel), then grate the rest of it. Frozen grated ube: Leave it at room temperature until it thaws, then press it hard to squeeze out water. Pour out the water."

      "title": "Melt butter in large pan.",
      "content": "Melt butter in large pan. Find a wide, deep pan large enough to hold all your ingredients. Heat the pan over medium-heat, then melt ½ cup (125g) butter or margarine."

    {
      "title": "Add the milk and coconut milk.",
      "content": "Add the milk and coconut milk. Pour in 1 can each of evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and coconut milk. You can also try these variations instead: Make it extra sweet with a second can of condensed milk instead of the coconut milk. Try a less traditional, vegan recipe by leaving out the milk and using just one can of coconut milk. [2] X Research source (Using less liquid isn't a problem, since the mixture is supposed to boil down anyway.) If you're not nostalgic for the taste of evaporated milk, you might prefer fresh milk instead. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add the other ingredients.",
      "content": "Add the other ingredients. Add all of the grated ube plus 1 tsp (5mL) vanilla extract. Most cooks also add 1 cup (200g) sugar. You can skip this if you prefer a stronger ube taste, since there's already sugar in the sweetened condensed milk. You can use white granulated sugar, brown sugar, or caster sugar."

    {
      "title": "Stir for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Stir for at least 30 minutes. Simmer the mixture over medium-low heat. Stir constantly to prevent it burning on the bottom of the pan. The ube halaya will gradually get thicker and thicker. It's ready once it's thick enough to cling to the spoon, about the consistency of thick cake batter. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Prepare for an arm workout, since this usually takes 30–50 minutes. If the coconut milk starts to curdle, reduce the heat and stir more slowly."

      "content": "Add some of the extra butter. In the last five minutes of cooking, add an extra tablespoon (15mL) butter to make the ube halaya shiny. [6] X Research source Mix it in for a couple minutes, then turn off the heat and let cool slightly. Use coconut oil instead if you've made latik, as described below."

      "content": "Start with coconut cream or milk. Latik is made from coconut curds, which separate from the fat. You can use coconut milk, but the recipe is faster and makes more latik if you use the thicker, fattier coconut cream skimmed from the top of the can. You can also make coconut milk from fresh or shredded coconut. To make coconut cream, follow the same recipe, but use 4 parts coconut meat to one part water. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Simmer the coconut cream until it thickens. Pour the coconut cream (or coconut milk) into a non-stick pan. Heat over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer, then reduce to medium-low heat. Let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens. This takes about an hour. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep heating until the curds and oil separate.",

      "content": "Serve on top of ube halaya. You can use the oil instead of butter in the ube halaya, or brush it on top once the halaya is finished. Sprinkle the latik on top of the ube halaya before serving Store latik in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one month. [11] X Research source Store coconut oil in an airtight container away from light and heat. It should last for at least a few months either in or out of the refrigerator, but homemade coconut oil may have traces of curds that cause it to spoil faster."
