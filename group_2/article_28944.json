      "content": "Cut a single piece of duct tape to 9 inches (23 cm). Pull some of the duct tape off the roll and lay it against a ruler with the sticky side up. Cut the strip off at 9 inches (23 cm) using sharp scissors. Try working on a piece of parchment paper or a plastic cutting board, which are resistant to the adhesive. [1] X Research source Lay the strip sticky-side up in front of you."

      "content": "Place a second piece of duct tape on top of the first one lengthwise. Cut another piece of duct tape to the same length. Turn it so the sticky side is down, and then lay it halfway up the first piece. You're overlapping the 2 pieces along the long edge, meaning you should still have half a strip of the sticky side exposed. Half a strip along the top will be stuck to the parchment paper below."

      "title": "Fold the sticky part of the first strip up over the second piece.",
      "content": "Fold the sticky part of the first strip up over the second piece. The sticky part is at the bottom of your strip. Fold it up along the edge created by the second strip, then seal it in place by smoothing it out with your fingers. [2] X Research source This will create one of the edges of the wallet."

      "content": "Continue flipping the duct tape and adding strips to extend the length. Repeat the process of peeling the duct tape up, flipping it over, and adding a new strip of duct tape overlapping the sticky part. This will add length to the wallet a little bit at a time. [3] X Research source Keep going until you have about 8.5 inches (22 cm) in length."

      "title": "Trim the edges of the duct tape.",
      "content": "Trim the edges of the duct tape. Cut along the sides of the duct tape to even out the edge. Use a ruler to help guide you and make a straight edge. Don't cut too much off, as that will make your wallet too small. [5] X Research source For a shorter wallet that will more snugly fit skinny American dollar bills, make your rectangle no smaller than 6 by 8 inches (15 by 20 cm)."

Place 1 piece with the sticky side up on your surface. Set the other piece on top, sticky side down with just 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) or so of overhang. [9] X Research source You're using almost the same process as you did to make the main part of the wallet, except you're not letting the second piece of tape hang over the edge as much."

Fold those over on top of the rest of the duct tape, making single strip with no sticky edges. [10] X Research source You should now have a strip with no sticky sides that's small enough to fit on 1 of the interior sides of your wallet. Create 1 strip for each pocket you want. These pockets will hold cards."

Cut out pieces of duct tape just wide enough and long enough to tape the sides and bottom of the pocket to the wallet. [11] X Research source The strips you use to tape the pocket in place should only be 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) or so wide and just long enough to cover the complete edge on each side, except the top. Try to keep the strips of tape out of the middle crease, as the crease could cause the strips to pull up over time."

Tape it in place with small strips of duct tape on the sides and bottom of the pocket, leaving the top exposed. [12] X Research source If you need to, trim your pockets as you go along so they're all the same size. Keep going down until you reach the bottom of the wallet. The last pocket should be about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the bottom so you have room to tape it in place."

Do it the same way by making strips of duct tape and taping them in place in layers. However, if you'd like a large pocket with an ID holder, don't put card pockets on the other side.

Use the flip-and-fold method (like you did to construct the body) to make a slightly oversized rectangle, then trim it down to size on the edges. [14] X Research source It should be about the same size as half your wallet when it's open, though slightly smaller so you can tape in place. This is for an internal pocket with an opening facing the central crease of the wallet."

Place 1 piece over the edge on one end, using your fingers to smooth it into place. This will seal off the pocket you just made and make sure all the strips on the card pockets stay in place. [18] X Research source On the side with the card pockets, you may need to trim the width of the tape so it doesn't block the openings along the top of each pocket. You might want to use a different color here or decorative duct tape."
