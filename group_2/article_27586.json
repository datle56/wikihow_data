      "content": "Create your character profiles. Start by writing down some of the character's personality characteristics and physical attributes and then draw from there. Ask yourself questions. Does your character have powers? Friends? Relatives? Siblings? Are they a main character or a side character? Use your favorite manga characters for inspiration. [1] X Research source According to professional writer Grant Faulkner, a character profile should include their drive, motivations, desires, and what’s standing between them and their desire. If you have a visual character idea, start with that and then move on to writing the character's personality traits next to it. When finding the plot, professional writer Lucy Hay says to first look for a concept. Then think about how the plot will work within that context. Think about what obstacles are in the way of what the character wants or needs to achieve. Hay says these obstacles can include the antagonist or the circumstances of the story."

      "content": "Draw your characters. Create a basic face shape to start and then start drawing the ears , eyes , nose , and mouth . Remember that manga characters have very expressive eyes—experiment with their size and shape. [2] X Research source Give the eyes light reflections in the form of 2 ovals: a small one near the top of the eye mainly covering the iris and a bit of the pupil, and another smaller oval on the other side of the eye covering the spot where the iris touches the white part of the eye. [3] X Research source Try giving males a smaller iris, as it typically creates a more masculine look. [4] X Research source Sketch your characters in pencil before inking them. That way, you can erase any mistakes before finalizing your illustration. Go through several designs of your characters and compare them to see which style fits your liking and their personality."

      "content": "Choose a setting for your story. If you're having trouble, start drawing a map of the world you want to create. For example, if you're creating a post-apocalyptic shonen, start writing down some town locations. Afterward, mark off some forests, mountains, and other locations where you can place some fight scenes. [5] X Research source Always consider your genre before creating your setting. Look at other similar manga and see what kinds of settings are commonly used. Consider your characters as you create your world. For example, ask yourself where each character currently resides and where they were born."

      "content": "Create a story outline for the basic plot. Change your characters' goals, personalities, and motivations as you flesh out the story. Start with your setting and genre, then get specific. Decide who the important characters are, the main plot, and how it relates to your setting. Determine the main conflicts, mysteries, challenges, and twists. [6] X Research source Mention your characters’ facial expressions and Don't be afraid to change story points and characters as the story develops. body language in your script so you don’t forget about them once you start drawing."

      "title": "Flesh out the story outline with scripting.",
      "content": "Flesh out the story outline with scripting. Make sure that everything your characters do and say advances the story while keeping the reader engaged. Stick to your characters’ personalities and spice up your wording to avoid repetitive dialogue. Avoid big chunks of narration, as it can take readers away from the story. [7] X Research source To avoid stereotypes and embrace diversity when writing interesting characters, Hay says to look at what’s been done before and look at the stereotypes society says exist. Then, make your character the fundamental opposite."

      "title": "Break your storyline into manga volumes.",
      "content": "Break your storyline into manga volumes. Each manga chapter is about 19 pages, although the introduction chapter is usually 15. A volume of manga is about 150 pages, which is around 5 chapters. Since there are about 4 pages per scene, that gives you about 5 scenes per chapter. [8] X Research source Start writing down all of the main events of your story and points you want to make, then group them into specific scenes. Afterward, group the scenes into chapters, and the chapters into volumes. Faulkner says that if you’re looking to get your work complete and published, set a goal and deadline, like 50,000 words a month and 1667 words a day. This way, you’re breaking the huge work into small chunks."

      "content": "Create an action manga if you want to focus on fight scenes. Also known as shonen or shounen, which refers to a boy at high school or elementary age, these comics are best known for brief dialogue, lots of character movement, and plenty of battles. If you prefer to draw more than create a story, start with an action manga. [9] X Research source Some of the most well-known action manga are Naruto , Dragon Ball Z , One Piece , and Bleach . [10] X Research source Narratives in action manga are often told through flashbacks. Action manga speech is often characterized by intense, fast words such as character names and attack names. If you're writing a Japanese manga and have a limited understanding of the language, make an action manga. In recent years, shonen with female protagonists have become more common."

Typically, these girls are prepubescent or just entering womanhood. Although they feature fight scenes and lots of action, they also focus strongly on themes of friendship, life lessons, falling in love, and growing up. [11] X Research source Magical girl manga fall into the shojo category, which means they are aimed at a young female audience. Popular magical girl manga include Sailor Moon and Powerpuff Girls Z ."

      "content": "Craft a seinen manga if you prefer a focus on dark, mature stories. Seinen manga are counterparts to shonen. While some share similarities to shonen, seinen typically focus on darker stories and themes like politics, action, fantasy, science fiction, sports, relationships, and comedy. They are more violent and psychological than typical shonen action manga and sometimes have pornographic content. [12] X Research source Try a seinen if you want your fight scenes mixed with dark storylines and characters. [13] X Research source When it comes to themes, Faulkner says sometimes they’re planned, “and sometimes they’re not planned. Sometimes they emerge from the story.” When putting together a theme, Faulkner suggests you write the story, explore where it goes, and identify the themes as you write it. That way, it isn’t grafted onto the story and instead emerges from it. Popular seinen manga include Ghost in the Shell , Tokyo Ghoul , Berserk , Gantz , and 20th Century Boys ."

The pacing of speech bubbles is faster, but much more relaxed than action anime due to the focus on conversation rather than short, emotional bursts. [14] X Research source Select the jokes you want to focus on: clean jokes, parody jokes, romance/comedy jokes, and/or dirty jokes. Comedy manga can take place anywhere you like, but are most often in real-life settings, such as high school. If you'd rather a more magical setting, consider an action manga with comedic elements.

You can do lots with this kind of manga—comedy, horror, action—but if it has a setting or plot with pilotable robots at the center, it's considered a mecha.

[17] X Research source Ask yourself who your audience is. For example, if you're writing your manga in Japanese, consider making your comic read right-to-left.

      "content": "Create 3 speech bubbles per panel and 5 panels per page. Manga is much faster-paced than traditional Western comics. This means there are more pages with fewer panels and less text. In general, you should have no more than 3 speech bubbles in each panel and an average of 5 panels per page. [18] X Research source In general, stick to about 4 pages per scene. Always separate panel groups by a space of 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm), which is called the panel gutter. Be sure that the small panel gutters within each panel grouping don't align with the gutters in other panel groupings."

It works best when trying to create simple humor, although it can be used for any scene that requires a uniform and basic presentation. [19] X Research source When using this layout, use the first panel to set the scene, the second to create the event that creates the climax, the third for the climax, and the fourth as the reaction or conclusion of the scene."

      "title": "Increase the number and variety of panels for action scenes.",
      "content": "Increase the number and variety of panels for action scenes. Since action scenes have more character movement and changes in direction, you should use an increased number of panels and variation in shape to give them a dynamic feeling. For example, use 3 small panels for a punch: the first showing the character's angry eyes, the second showing his arm pulled back, and the third showing his fist hitting the opponent. You can even make the third panel a zig-zag border to add emphasis. [20] X Research source Replace square and rectangular panels with triangles or unique zig-zagging borders to create a dynamic feeling. Use smaller panels to focus on the action rather than the setting, which is typically unimportant for these scenes."

Use simple, large panels to capture all the words while keeping the reader's focus on the characters. Make sure the panels are big enough to show character faces and reactions. [21] X Research source Change viewing angles to make the conversation dynamic and keep the reader interested. Minimize the number of dramatic changes between panels to keep the focus on the words. Don't use speech bubble tails to indicate the character speaking. Instead, place the bubbles close to the speaker and—if necessary—use slang and change the tone to make it obvious who is speaking.

Any image that spans 2 or more pages is usually used to show a detailed image or setting, like a final blow landing or where a fight will take place. Use these scenes to give the reader a broader sense of characters or settings. For example, an action manga that starts with a fight between 2 characters can begin with a 2-page spread that shows the giant forest or mountain the characters are battling in. [23] X Research source Use large panels to start your manga or break up a fast-paced fight with small panels.

You can also use diagonal lines, hazy outline patterns, or characters that break free from the panel. [24] X Research source Fade your panels in and out for dramatic storytelling. Read your favorite manga and emulate their dynamic panel layouts. Think of each panel as a camera angle. Use dynamic panels to showcase different viewpoints , bird's-eye viewpoints, and low-to-high panel angles. If you’re getting your manga professionally printed, be mindful of what you want cut off and what you want to stay. Communicate this to your printer so they don’t accidentally misprint your panels."

For example, if one of the characters in your magical girl manga is having thoughts of her crush, make the background flowers to express budding romance. In terms of visual grammar, you can use drops of sweat to express nervousness. [26] X Research source If you're making a shonen, make the background flames during a power-up or scene where the character is angry. Create swirling knots and black shadows if your character is in a psychologically dark place. Use a hash mark on the forehead for someone angry or a group of spirit wisps when a character is sad.

Inking your manga is one of the most important things to do before it can be considered complete, as it sets the illustrations into the paper and helps them look crisper. After you’ve finalized your sketches, trace over them using an ink pen to bring them to life. Make sure you’ve gotten rid of all of the mistakes in your sketch beforehand, though. Use a 0.7mm ink pen for the bold details, like character bodies, and use a 0.5mm or smaller ink pen for the finer details, like fingernails, mouths, and small background elements."

Then, shade the characters and background based on where the light is coming from. This will make your manga look more polished and professional.
