You don’t have to call it “date night” if that sounds too cheesy, but you should make a goal to spend some quality time together without anyone else around at least one night a week. [1] X Research source You can do this same thing during date night, such as cooking dinner together and then going to the movies, or spice it up and do something new every time. If you’re staying in, maintain a romantic atmosphere by lighting some candles and playing some soft music. [2] X Research source Whatever you do, make sure you have time to really talk during your special time together. You won’t be able to talk much if you’re just going to a loud concert together. Learn to say no to others during “date night.” Your girlfriends may be begging you to come out to the bars, but if you’ve scheduled a date night, tell them you can’t make it and make plans for next week. Things will break down if “date night” is the thing you’re always willing to give up. You should always look nice, tell each other how much you love each other, and compliment each other throughout the night."

You can set aside time to talk during dinner, or to talk over the phone if your loved one is away. [4] X Research source Make a habit of knowing what your loved one’s day was like. Though you don’t have to bore each other with every little detail of your lives, you should become comfortable with each other’s routines.

[5] X Research source To keep your relationship strong, you should be able to be open and honest with your special someone. [6] X Research source You should be able to share your most intimate thoughts and feelings with your loved one, or you’re not really communicating. [7] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. Don’t be afraid to tell your loved one if they disappointed you. Being honest about your feelings will help you work through the problem, and is far better than being passive aggressive if you’re upset about something. Share your feelings with your loved one. If you’re really upset about something that happened at work or something your mother said, then don’t keep it all inside. Know when not to say something. Though honesty is almost always the best policy, you don’t have to share every little feeling with your loved one. For example, if you don’t like his new shirt or think one of his new friends is kind of annoying, you may want to keep it to yourself. Time your honesty. If you want to open up about something important, make sure you do it when your loved one has time to talk and is relatively unstressed. Your news will be better received if he has time to listen."

Here’s how to do it: [9] X Research source When you’re making a decision, have your loved one rate how important it is to him on a scale of 1 to 10, and then state how important it is to you. Then talk about why it’s so important to both of you, and what you can do to make it matter less. Be thoughtful. When the two of you are making a decision, take the time to discuss the pros and cons and what you can do to meet halfway.

You should find ways of keeping your relationship fresh so your love doesn’t become just a part of your routine. One way of doing this is to find new interests that you can pursue together, so you have something to be excited about as well as a shared passion. Take a weekly dance class together.

Make love in new positions. Don’t do the same old thing you’ve been doing, even if it works. You can even look up new positions together, which will be great for foreplay. Make love in new places. Don’t always go for the bedroom—try the couch, the kitchen table, or even check in to a hotel in the middle of the day. Try going to a sex store to pick up some kinky items to bring into bed."
