It should be enough to trigger your antivirus scanner. EICAR.ORG-TXT: This is the same file as the first file, but with a different file name. If you experience problems downloading the first file, you can download this file instead. Then you will need to rename the file \"eicar.com\" EICAR.ORG-ZIP: This download contains the main test virus file in a ZIP file . You can use this download to see if your antivirus scanner can scan viruses within a ZIP archive. EICAR.ORG-ZIP.2: This download contains the test virus within a zip file inside another zip file.

Ensure that your test environment is contained so that the viruses you are testing cannot spread to computers that you don't want infected. You'll also want to make sure that your computer doesn't have any sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, social security identification, payment records, etc.) on it just in case your virus can copy the contents of your hard drive. Make sure that the computer or computers you are testing on are not connected to the Internet when you open an infected file. For greater security, test viruses using a virtual machine on a physical computer that is not connected to the internet."

Torrents are a very popular way to share these files. When browsing torrent sites, look for torrents with low ratings and comments from other users warning about viruses. These are the ones you want. P2P sharing programs are another popular way to spread viruses. Programs like Kazaa and Gnutella are some of the more popular options. Many websites, known as \"warez\" sites, will offer \"free\" downloads for virtually any program. These are almost always infected with viruses and adware, and the program itself rarely works."
