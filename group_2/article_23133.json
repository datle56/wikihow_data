      "title": "The literal translation of “hyung” is “older brother.”",
      "content": "The literal translation of “hyung” is “older brother.” “Hyung” (pronounced h-YUH-ng) is primarily used by men and boys to refer to an older boy or man. In most cases, the male speaker is close to the man or boy in some way, like a brother, cousin, or friend. This term is casual and friendly – almost like slang. [1] X Research source Depending on the context of the conversation, “hyung” refers to a male speaker’s older biological brother, male cousins or other male relatives, male friends, or male schoolmates. In some situations, young women call a male friend “hyung” because “oppa,” the traditional way for women to refer to close male friends, has become a flirty way for women to refer to attractive men. “Hyung” is not used romantically, so these women use it to emphasize their platonic friendships. “Hyung” is the male equivalent to “unnie,” which is what women and girls call an older sister."

      "content": "“Hyung” is often used among male K-pop idols to show respect. Many K-pop idols become close to the other members of their groups during the intense training period they go through. Then, after they debut, they live together for the early part of their career. This forges strong bonds between many of them. Because of their close relationships, they frequently call each other “hyung” or by name with “hyung” attached to the end. For example, “Su-Jin hyung writes all the lyrics for our songs” or “We’re very lucky to have hyung as a leader.” Male idols also refer to other male idols who have debuted before them as “hyung” to show respect for their greater experience. This is especially true of groups that debuted with the same company."

      "content": "Use “hyung” as a male to refer to a close older male. The literal translation of “hyung” is “older brother,” but it’s also an affectionate and respectful way to talk about or address other male family members, like cousins. Here are a few examples of how to use “hyung”: “Would you like banana milk with dinner, hyung?” “Hyung, let’s watch that new movie after school.” “My hyung is the best! He always watches out for me.” “I’m so proud of my hyung for starting law school, but I never get to see him anymore.” “I’m going out to pick up some fried chicken. Can you give me directions, hyung?”"

[2] X Research source “Oppa” is the more traditional Korean honorific title used by most women and girls to refer to older brothers and male friends. However, “oppa” has started to be used by younger women to flirt with handsome men. Female K-pop fans also use it to show their appreciation for male idols. “Hyung! Why are you so late? I’ve been waiting an hour!” “We’re just friends. I think of him as my hyung.” “Hey, hyung! Can you give me a ride home after school?” “What are you doing tonight, hyung? My mom is making bibimbap, and I know it’s your favorite.” “Ji-ho is my hyung! I can ask him if he’ll take you to the movie.”"

      "content": "Show respect in Korea by using the proper gendered title. In the Korean language, many honorific titles reflect the gender of the speaker and the person they’re speaking to. For example, “hyung” is customarily used by men to refer to other men. Here are a few other honorific titles used in South Korean culture: [3] X Research source Oppa (오빠): Females use “oppa” to refer to an older male they are close with. It translates to “older brother.” Unnie (언니): Females use it to refer to an older female they are close with. It also translates as “older sister.” Noona (누나): Males use it to refer to an older female they are close with. It translates to “older sister.” Sunbae (선배): This translates as “senior.” Younger males and females use it to refer to anyone who is older or has more experience. In some cases, an older person may refer to a younger person with more experience as “sunbae.” Hubae (후배): “Hubae” translates as “junior,” and older people use it to refer to younger people in a university setting or in business. They also use it to refer to someone with less experience in a field. Dongsaeng (동생): Males and females use it to refer to a younger person they are close with. It translates to “younger sibling.” Yeodongsaeng 여동생: This translates to “younger sister” and both males and females use it. [4] X Research source Namdongsaeng (남동생): Both males and females use this word to talk about a younger brother. The translation is “little brother.” Chingu (친구): “Chingu” means “friend.” Use it to refer to someone who is the same age as you. [5] X Research source Donggab (동갑): “Donggab” means “same age.” Use this word to identify that you were born in the same year as the other person, so you don’t have to observe the obligations and responsibilities to an older/younger person. [6] X Research source Eomeonim (어머님): This is the formal way to say “mother” in Korean . More commonly, Koreans would call their mother eomma (엄마), which means “mom.” [7] X Research source Abunim (아버님): This is the formal way to say “father.” Koreans would more commonly use appa (아빠), which means “dad.” Ajumoni (아주머니): This is translated as “middle-aged woman” and is a respectful way to address a woman in her 40s-60s. Ajusshi (아저씨): This is translated as “middle-aged man” and is a respectful way to address a man in his 40s-60s. Halabuji (할아버지): This is translated as “grandfather” and is a respectful way to address a man older than 70. This is a generic term that’s not necessarily used for your biological grandfather. Halmeoni (할머니): This is translated as “grandmother” and is a respectful way to address a woman older than 70. This is a generic term that’s not necessarily used for your biological grandmother. Agassi (아가씨): This is translated as “young lady” and is used to refer to an unmarried woman, similar to the English word “miss.” Imonim (이모님): The literal translation is “my aged aunt” and refers to a woman in her 50-60s in a casual setting. This is a generic term that’s not necessarily used for your biological aunt."

      "title": "Add “ssi” (씨) or “nim” (님) to the end of a name to show respect.",
      "content": "Add “ssi” (씨) or “nim” (님) to the end of a name to show respect. In Korean culture, the suffixes “ssi” or “nim” are similar to Mr. and Ms. in English-speaking countries. These suffixes are gender neutral, so they’re appropriate to use for anyone. When adding them to a name, place them at the end of the full name. For example, Park Hoseok-ssi in Korean would be Mr. Hoseok Park in English. [8] X Research source Place the “ssi” after the given name for a more casual title that still shows respect. For example, Hoseok-ssi in Korean would be Mr. Hoseok in English. The suffix “nim” is slightly more formal than “ssi,” so use it in more formal or professional settings. Koreans customarily list their surname first and the given name second."

      "content": "There are 7 levels of politeness in Korean speech. However, only 4 are commonly used today. For formal speech, Koreans use hasipsioche . The most commonly used level is haerache , a plain yet formal way of speaking. Koreans use haeyoche , an informal but polite way to speak with strangers, colleagues, and those of higher rank or older age. When speaking with friends or younger people, Koreans use haeche . Here are descriptions of all 7 of the speech levels from the most casual to the most formal: Haeche (해체): This is the most casual and informal level of speech. Only use it with siblings, close friends, relatives, and younger people. Haeyoche (해요체): This is an informal but polite way of speaking that Koreans use in everyday life. Haerache (해라체): This is a plain style that’s still formal. It’s commonly used in newspaper or magazine writing. It’s also how close friends or family members of a similar age speak to each other. Hageche (하게체): This is a slightly outdated way of speaking to those of a similar or lower rank. It’s mostly used by older people. Haoche (하오체): This is a formal level of speech used with those who have a similar or lower social status. It’s more commonly used in historical dramas than in real life. Hasipsioche (하십시오체): This way of speaking is 1 step down from hasoseoche and is often used in public speeches, business, and by those in the service industry. It’s also the type of speech used with elders, strangers, and those of higher rank. Hasoseoche (하소서체): The most formal and polite way of speaking is hasoseoche (하소서체). It’s the language used when speaking to a king, queen, or high official. It was mostly used in the past but is commonly seen in historical dramas. [9] X Research source"

One of the first things Koreans ask each other when they first meet them is, “How old are you?” They use age to figure out the appropriate way to speak and act toward one another. [11] X Research source For example: Older people take responsibility and be a leader for younger people. They also often buy meals. However, they may ask younger people to perform tasks. Younger people bow more deeply, set the table, or pour drinks for older people."
