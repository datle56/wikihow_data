      "title": "Formulate your concerns in advance.",
      "content": "Formulate your concerns in advance. It's often difficult to keep track of your thoughts during difficult conversations, so it's helpful to plan your main points in advance. In the heat of the moment, you don't want to end up blurting out something you don't mean. You might try writing an imaginary letter to your relative expressing all your concerns. Then, read that letter, imagining that you're in your relative's position. This will help you to frame your concerns in a constructive way. [1] X Research source Try to imagine your relative's objections will be. Develop respectful, thoughtful responses to those objections. Include reasons why your family member's behavior has a negative impact on others, including on you. Share your concerns with a trusted third party. Don't rehearse the conversation, but be clear about what you want to express and what you hope to achieve."

Planning a conversation in advance will help you address your concerns with out making your relationship worse. Plan the conversation in advance. Don't wait until a crisis to bring up what's bothering you. Let your relative know you'd like to speak with him seriously. Avoid springing a heavy conversation on your relative. Instead, give him time to prepare. Choose a comfortable setting. You might demonstrate your good intentions by taking your relative out to lunch. Avoid settings that evoke the problem: for instance, don't talk about problem drinking in a bar."

      "title": "Ask what is making your relative choose not to take care of herself.",
      "content": "Ask what is making your relative choose not to take care of herself. What looks like stubbornness to you might be covering up many different emotions or issues. You will need to phrase this question carefully. You want to convey that you are genuinely interested in hearing the answer. In addition, you want to avoid asking the question in a way that sounds like nagging or pressuring. For example, you might say: “I know that we don't always agree on this issue, but I'd love to know more about your perspective.” Or, ask: “What scares you most about reaching out to a therapist?” Don't imply judgment with your question. For example, don't ask: “Why do you refuse to eat healthy food?” Instead, ask: “I'd like to understand your decisions around food better. Can you tell me more?” Some people are angry about needing help or guilty about the burden their situation imposes on others. Others might be frightened about their condition and seeking reassurance through making their relatives and loved ones take on too much responsibility for their care. They might be lonely and see failing to take care of themselves as a way to get attention from you."

      "content": "Listen and respond without judgment. Let your relative talk, and don't rush to interrupt or provide solutions. Although your relative's words might bring up many feelings for you, don't express them all at once. Reacting with anger and resentment will only make the situation worse. Instead, practice non-judgmental listening. Put yourself in your relative's shoes. Listen to what he is saying about his own experience, and try to be empathetic. Accept that your relative's feelings, judgments, and perspectives might be different from your own. That's ok. Be genuine. You don't have to pretend to think that your relative's decisions are great. Instead, be calm and honest. For example, you might say: “I understand that taking medication for your depression is frightening for you. I don't agree with your decision, but I can accept that you feel that way.”"

Be aware of mental health issues, memory loss, or other factors that might make it hard for your relative to take care of themselves or even to understand and remember why she should take care of herself. If you observe changes in your relative's behavior that make you suspect dementia or other cognitive issues, you will need to get your relative evaluated by a professional.

Even if you haven't been able to achieve all your goals in the conversation, close it by telling your relative something that you value about her.

In addition, hearing the same message from more than one person might help your relative to understand the seriousness of the situation. For example, you could reach out to a pastor or rabbi whose opinion your relative respects. They might be able to explain why it's damaging to family relationships not to take responsibility for one's own health and well-being. If you have a relative battling addiction, you might choose to stage an intervention. This should be carefully planned in consultation with a doctor or licensed drug counselor.

[11] X Research source In reality, you may be feeding into a cycle of dependency; your relative may be better at seeking help from others or at taking responsibility for herself than you realize.
