      "title": "Consider the ways you'd like to leave.",
      "content": "Consider the ways you'd like to leave. If you're certain that you'll never want to re-join the church, write a letter to your ward or branch's bishop and request to have your name removed from church records. [1] X Research source If you think you might want to come back, or if you don't feel like contacting your bishop, you can simply disassociate from the church without any paperwork."

      "title": "Write out a list of reasons why you are leaving the church.",
      "content": "Write out a list of reasons why you are leaving the church. Make sure you want to do this permanently.

      "title": "Do some research on the doctrines and practices of the church over time.",
      "content": "Do some research on the doctrines and practices of the church over time. Many people find answers to questions or doubts, but many more people find additional questions and doubts through research. Read the Book of Mormon if you haven't. That will give you huge insights into the core beliefs of the church. If you have a concern with the church, you could search for a resolving answer and see if there is one."

      "content": "Reach out to family and friends, especially those well-versed about the Mormon church. They can support you as you try to figure things out. Many find it helpful to have a support network as they make big decisions."

      "title": "If people ask why you left the church, you are under no obligation to explain yourself.",
      "content": "If people ask why you left the church, you are under no obligation to explain yourself. However, if you would like to, simply mention one of the reasons you listed earlier. There is no need to create an argument or hostile atmosphere. Those who care about you can hold a polite conversation about it, and those who don't care about you aren't worth talking to.

    {
      "title": "Limit attendance at church activities.",
      "content": "Limit attendance at church activities. The church hosts a wide variety of activities. You should not feel pressured to continue going to these even if you have friends who do. If it is something you enjoy and want to attend, go. If not, don't."

      "title": "Tell those who ask about you that you appreciate their concern and that you are searching your heart to make decisions that are right for you.",
      "content": "Tell those who ask about you that you appreciate their concern and that you are searching your heart to make decisions that are right for you. Be friendly, but firm about what's in your heart. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Find something to do that makes you feel good. Talk to friends about your feelings if you're feeling guilty, betrayed, or otherwise upset. Ask yourself why you feel that way. Search for ways to enhance and grow your life. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "If you made a final decision, write a letter to Church Records.",
      "content": "If you made a final decision, write a letter to Church Records. Make sure to include your full name, your date of birth, your current address, and todayâ€™s date. Address your letter to: Member Records Division, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 50 E North Temple Room 1372, Salt Lake City UT 84150-5310. Or, you can just e-mail the records division here: msr-confrec@ldschurch.org. You do not need to address it to the Bishop of your ward, no matter what church headquarters says. Salt Lake may well refer you back to your bishop, but you can ignore that. They will try to get you to jump through their hoops, but there is no legal requirement that you do so. An example letter is written below: [5] X Research source This letter is my formal resignation, effective immediately, from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I hereby withdraw my consent to being treated as a member and I withdraw my consent to being subject to church rules, policies, beliefs, and 'discipline'. As I am no longer a member, I want my name permanently removed from the membership rolls of the church. I have given this matter considerable thought. I understand the 'seriousness' and 'consequences of my actions. I am aware that the church handbook says that my resignation \"cancels the effects of baptism and confirmation, withdraws the priesthood held by a male member and revokes temple blessings\". I also understand that I will be \"readmitted to the church by baptism only after a thorough interview\". (Church Handbook of Instructions) My resignation should be processed immediately, without any 'waiting periods'. I have made up my mind and cannot be dissuaded. I expect my request to be handled promptly, respectfully, and with confidentiality. Sincerely, your signature followed by your printed name."
