      "title": "Use a shirt that is 100% cotton.",
      "content": "Use a shirt that is 100% cotton. Cotton is more absorbent than most synthetic fibers, so it makes a better material to use for a cloth diaper. Use a short sleeve or three-quarter-length sleeve for best results. A three-quarter length sleeve may make it easier to pin the diaper on larger babies and toddlers, but may be more material than you need for smaller babies. Choose a size based on the size of your child. An older baby or toddler may need a large or extra-large shirt, but a newborn would likely only need a small."

      "content": "Lay the shirt flat. You can do this on the floor or on any other large working surface. Lay it so the sleeves are at the top."

      "title": "Fold one side of the shirt over.",
      "content": "Fold one side of the shirt over. The bottom of the shirt should be folded over about 1/3 of the way, and the seam where the sleeve meets the body of the shirt should be just below the center of the neckline. Keep the sleeve of the shirt pointed outward."

    {
      "title": "Fold the other side of the shirt over.",
      "content": "Fold the other side of the shirt over. This side should be identical to the fold made on the first side, so that the shirt is folded into thirds. Keep the sleeve pointed outwards. At this point, you should be left with a \"t\" or cross shape."

      "title": "Fold the top of the shirt down.",
      "content": "Fold the top of the shirt down. Bring the part of the t-shirt extending above the sleeves down over the sleeves. The upper part of the lowercase \"t\" shape should be folded all the way over, creating a capital \"T\" shape."

      "title": "Fold the bottom of the shirt in half.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom of the shirt in half. Take the bottom portion of the shirt and draw it up to the bottom sleeve line. Essentially, you are making a fold that shortens the length of the shirt by half. You will still have a capital \"T\" shape, but it will be a shorter \"T.\""

      "content": "Wrap the diaper around your baby. Sit the baby on the part of the shirt that starts just below the sleeves. Bring the bottom portion of the diaper up and over the front of your baby, and wrap the sleeves around the back and to the front. Secure the sleeves to the front using diaper pins or Velcro closures.

      "title": "Place a diaper cover over the diaper.",
      "content": "Place a diaper cover over the diaper. A waterproof diaper cover is essential for preventing leaks. If you have one, add a diaper cover to increase the absorbency of the diaper. The fabric for these types of diapers are thin so they get soaked pretty quickly, and you need to plan to change them frequently."

      "title": "Use a 100% cotton receiving blanket.",
      "content": "Use a 100% cotton receiving blanket. Receiving blankets are cheap, and cotton is fairly absorbent. You can also use other rectangles of fabric made from terry cloth, flannel, or other absorbent materials. Make sure you use a square receiving blanket. If you're using another fabric other than a receiving blanket, cut it into a square that's 34–36 inches (86–91 cm) on each side."

      "content": "Fold one corner to make a triangle shape. Take the top layer of the bottom left corner and pull it towards the right. The corner should lie to the right of the rest of the blanket, and this should form a triangle shape. The blanket should now look like a wide triangle with a square layer underneath the left side."

      "content": "Fold the square part of the blanket. Grab the two edges on the left of the blanket that make up the square shape. Fold this into a rectangle that lies in the middle of the triangle by folding it over two or three times. This is your diaper shape."

Fold both sides of the triangle in to meet the front of the diaper and pin them all together over the baby's waist.
