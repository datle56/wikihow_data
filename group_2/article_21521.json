      "content": "Collect healthy, mature acorns in early autumn. Acorns are best harvested in early to mid-autumn after they’ve fallen from the tree—this is a sign that they’re mature and can germinate. Simply choose acorns that are free of holes, cracks, worms, and fungus. Suitable acorns are brown, though the appearance of acorns can vary based on the type of oak tree they come from. A good general rule that acorns are mature and ready for germination is if the cap is easy to remove. [1] X Research source Collect the second round of acorns that fall to the ground, if possible. The first round of acorns that fall are often immature and many may not be viable to germinate. Look for suitable trees in the summer and monitor their acorn development. You want to act quickly, as squirrels, deer, rabbits, and pests like to eat acorns that drop on the ground. Tip: Collect twice as many acorns as you actually want to plant. Every acorn won’t germinate, so this ensures that you get at least 1 that does. Note that the cap is not part of the acorn, but a (separate) protective covering. Removing the cap from the acorn doesn’t damage it, unless you tear the acorn itself. Some oak varieties, like red oaks, have acorns that take 2 years to mature, rather than 1. As you look for trees in the summer, keep this in mind—the acorns on some oaks will be ready in the fall, while others won't be ready until the following year."

      "content": "Determine what type of oak tree the acorns are from. The acorns from different species of oak trees germinate differently, so it’s important to know what type of oak tree you collected them from. In North America, the 2 main types of oak trees are white oaks and red oaks. Registered professional biologist Dr. Michael Simpson says, “white oak leaves typically have lobes with rounded tips (like rabbit ears)” while “red oaks leaves have lobes with pointed, bristle-like tips (like those on a holly leaf but not sharp to the touch).” Dr. Simpson also advises identifying oak tree species based on their acorns . For instance, look at their shape, size, length, and color."

      "content": "Perform a \"float test” to find out which acorns are viable. Put the acorns that you harvested, without their caps, in a bucket of water. Allow the acorns to settle for 1 to 2 minutes. Then, discard any acorns that float—these acorns are bad. [2] X Trustworthy Source Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Iowa State University's Extension and Outreach program dedicated to educating and engaging communities Go to source An acorn may float because its embryo didn’t fully develop or a worm or grub burrowed into it, creating an air hole. Similarly, a fungus can make the acorn float. If, at any point, you notice that an acorn is soft to the touch, discard it as well. Soft, mushy acorns are rotten. Besides showing you which acorns are viable to germinate, the float test also rehydrates the viable acorns (the ones that sink) and prepares them for germination. Dry off the viable acorns and germinate them as soon as possible. If you can’t germinate them within a few days, place them in a plastic storage bag, seal it shut, and set them in your fridge. Aim to store them for no longer than 2 months.

      "content": "Sow white oak acorns in a pot full of potting soil . White oak acorns start to germinate in the fall as soon as they hit the ground, so immediately fill a 1-foot (30 cm) deep pot that has drainage holes with regular potting mix. [4] X Research source Place the acorn sideways (lengthwise) on top of the soil. Then, cover it with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil and water them thoroughly. [5] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Tip : Mix about 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of slow-release fertilizer into the soil. This can boost the success rate of germination and encourage the acorns to grow strong. [6] X Research source If some of your white oak acorns have already grown a root, sow it into the soil with the root facing down. Alternatively, sow the acorn in the yard where you want the tree to grow. If the acorn has a root, bury it in a shallow hole and gently tuck the acorn to one side on top of suitable rich, soft soil. This works best if the taproot is already well established, long, and has detached adequately from the acorn. Just be warned—this leaves the seedling vulnerable to mice, squirrels, deer, etc. It's best to wrap a cage around the seedling to protect it from animals."

      "content": "Expose red oak acorns to cold temperatures for 30 to 60 days. Unlike white oak acorns, red oak acorns don’t germinate until the spring—they need to experience cold temperatures to “tell” them it’s time to germinate. You can simulate this with a process called cold stratification. Simply add damp sand and peat moss to a large plastic bag. Then, add your acorns to the bag without sealing it closed. Just place the bag in your refrigerator for about 30 to 60 days. [7] X Trustworthy Source Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Iowa State University's Extension and Outreach program dedicated to educating and engaging communities Go to source Don’t overfill the bag—ensure the acorns don’t touch each other and are each surrounded by the sand/peat moss mix. Alternatively, sow the red oak acorns directly into the soil where you want the trees to grow. In most areas, the winter temperatures are cold enough to tell the acorns it's time to germinate. Just remember, the acorns won’t germinate until the spring, so it likely won’t be until late in the season that you see any seedlings start to sprout."

      "content": "Keep red oak moist in your fridge. Ensure the medium remains moist, but not overly wet. Too moist, and the acorns may rot. Too dry, and they may not grow. Even when stored in the refrigerator, most acorns will begin to germinate in the presence of moisture. The root end may begin to crack through the shell around early December (late fall, early winter). Whether or not the root has cracked through, the acorn is ready to be planted after about 30-60 days of storage. Handle your seedlings with care—the emerging roots are easily damaged."

Place them on a southern windowsill, where they can absorb the winter sun. You may not notice rapid above-ground growth right away. This is because, during the first stage of its life, the plant is developing its taproot below the surface of the dirt. [10] X Research source If you live in the southern hemisphere, place your seedlings on a northern windowsill instead. If your seedling isn't getting much sun, use a supplemental indoor grow light to provide more sunlight. Alternatively, keep your acorns outside . Just keep them in a place safe from animals, like an unheated garage or shed. For both white and red oak acorns , it usually takes 6 to 8 weeks from sowing to see any sprouting and growth."

Gardening sources differ about the next steps to take—some recommend planting seedlings directly into the ground after a few weeks of growth in a pot or cup, [11] X Research source while others recommend gradually increasing the amount of time each day that the plant is exposed to the outdoor weather before finally planting it in the ground. Still, others recommend transplanting the seedling to a larger pot, allowing it to grow further, and then finally planting it in the ground. Though there is no single right way to decide when to transplant a seedling into the ground, there are qualities to look for that can inform your decision to transplant your seedling. Good candidates for transplanting : Are about 4 to 10 inches tall (10-25 cm), with small leaves. [12] X Research source Have white, healthy-looking roots. Appear to be outgrowing their container.

      "content": "Choose a site for planting. Location is everything—pick a location for your oak tree where it has room to grow and won't be a hindrance when it’s grown large. When choosing the site for your oak tree, some things to consider are: [14] X Research source The availability of sunlight . Oak trees need 6 to 8 hours of full sun to grow. So, don't plant them in shaded areas. The soil quality . Ensure the soil is well-draining (doesn’t accumulate standing water). Most oak trees grow well in all soil types, though they tend to prefer loamy soil. The available space . Most species of oak trees grow at least 40 feet (12 m) tall with a canopy that spreads around 40 feet (12 m) wide. The root system is also extensive and can spread double the length of the tree. [15] X Research source The location of nearby sidewalks, water lines, buried pipes, etc . You don't want to have to move or cut back your tree if work needs to be done in your yard. Your tree’s roots can also potentially disturb any structures nearby. The shading effect of the full-grown tree . If you would like your oak tree to eventually provide shade for your home, plant it to the west or southwest of your home to maximize the shading effect it will have in the summer, while minimizing its shade in the winter. [16] X Research source Note—in the southern hemisphere, plant your tree to the west or northwest side of your house to get the shading effect. Nearby vegetation . Plants compete with each other for sun, moisture, and other resources. Don't plant your young oak right next to any substantial vegetation, or it may not reach maturity."

Make sure the hole is deep enough to accommodate the oak's roots. Replace the dirt around the plant, packing it in lightly. Then, water your seedling. [19] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Pack soil around the oak seedling, sloping the soil away from the seedling so that water does not sit at the trunk of the tree, which can be damaging. Tip: Lay a circular ring of mulch about 1 foot (30 cm) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm) thick around the tree to help the soil retain moisture and discourage the growth of weeds. Just make sure the mulch does not touch the trunk of the tree—leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space. [20] X Research source To increase the chances of a successful planting, you may want to place several acorns in the same area. In this case, plant young seedling acorns directly into the ground by clearing a 2x2 foot (61x61 cm) area and placing 2 acorns into that space, with 2 or 3 inches (2.5-5 cm) of soil on top."

Acorns are a frequent snack for squirrels and mice, who can easily dig them up. Small seedlings are also vulnerable to rabbits, deer, and other animals that like to eat leaves. To ensure your young oak trees aren't devoured, take steps to protect them. Cage your young trees with chicken wire or sturdy plastic fencing around their stem to prevent animals from reaching them. [21] X Research source If you live in an area where deer are common, you may even want to consider caging the top of the tree. You may also want to use pesticides to protect your tree from a variety of pests, including aphids and June bugs.

During the winter and wet months, it's not usually necessary to water your oak trees. However, when oaks are young, hot and dry weather can be damaging. A drip irrigation system is a useful way to get water to young oak trees when they need it most. Irrigate your tree with about 10 gallons (38 l) of water via a drip irrigation system every week to 2 weeks. Irrigate during the hottest and driest months for about 2 years, lessening the irrigation frequency as the tree grows. [23] X Research source Wait to water your tree until the soil is dry. [24] X Research source Remember not to allow water to collect around the base of the tree. [25] X Research source Arrange your irrigation system so that water drips around the tree, not directly onto its base, where it can cause rot."

Eventually, it will be big and tall enough that animals won't be able to kill it and its roots will be deep enough for it to survive the summer without any watering. Slowly, over several years, reduce the amount of care you give your tree (which, aside from watering during dry months and protecting it from animals, should not be all that much). [26] X Research source Eventually, your tree should be able to thrive on its own without showing any signs of distress. Enjoy the lifelong gift you've given yourself and your family! If you haven’t received rain in a few weeks, check your tree’s soil to see if it needs to be watered. If the soil feels dry, give your tree a thorough soaking. Oak trees don’t usually need a lot of pruning, but you may want to trim them to control their size and shape them a certain way. Start by removing any dead or diseased branches and remove branches that touch each other. Just avoid pruning more than 30% of the canopy per year. [27] X Research source Within 20 years, your oak may begin producing acorns of its own. However, depending on the species, optimal acorn growth may not occur for up to 50 years."
