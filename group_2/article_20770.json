      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros The Ghost fruit has quite a few pros; it’s a good choice for grinding and PvP (player versus player), especially because of its passive Resurrection ability that’ll bring your character back if they die. It also has fast cooldowns and low mastery requirements compared to other fruits. The Ghost fruit also has a shorter cast time and endlag, and only a small knockback. [9] X Research source Shivering Possession has decent damage, mobility, and the ability to stun enemies. Spectral release is handy for its AoE (area-of-effect) properties and stun ability. Cries of the Underworld deals consistent damage to enemies, even at range. Ghost Busters has decent damage, and the ghost clones’ kills still grant you mastery (so you can grind for mastery fighting styles and swords with this ability). Wandering Soul is a great ability to use when escaping enemies (or just traveling), and it has a good speed."

      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons There definitely aren’t as many cons for the Ghost fruit—but a few are still worth mentioning! Overall, the Ghost fruit’s moves don’t have as much range as other fruits, and its combo starters could be better. Then, there are the Ghost fruit’s specific moves: [10] X Research source Shivering Possession can be a little hard for players to control, and its effects can make it harder to score combos. It’s also possible to get hit yourself when using the ability. Spectral Release has a very close range and more end-lag than the other abilities. Cries of the Underworld is useful, but you can’t deal maximum damage with it if the enemy is at a distance. Ghost Busters requires you to be close to an enemy if you want your ghosts to attack them, and the ghosts’ attacks deal reduced damage to other players. Wandering Soul allows you to fly, but that flight is slower if you have low health. It’s also tricky to maneuver with this ability in small spaces."

      "content": "The Ghost fruit is considered very good for its passive and abilities. Blox Fruits players especially like it because of its ability to summon ghost clones and because of its amazing passive ability to resurrect users. All in all, it’s a decent fruit with good stuns and spam potential, yet low mastery requirements, making it good for PvP, bounty hunts, boss farming, and grinding.
