      "content": "Measure your space. Installing glass block windows requires removing the current window frame, so ensure that you measure down to the masonry and not just the current window frame. [1] X Research source If you are in doubt concerning where the masonry is in relation to the current frame, take several pictures of the window and take them to the fabricator for your glass panels. They can give you a more proper estimate. [2] X Research source Always measure twice. Getting the right dimensions is crucial."

      "content": "Subtract 1/2” (1.27cm) from both the width and the length. This space will actually be a 1/4” mortar joint on each side of the panel, but you can simply subtract 1/2” for your measurement."

      "title": "Take your measurements to your vendor.",
      "content": "Take your measurements to your vendor. Whether you are purchasing from a dealer or having your panels fabricated, you will need to take your measurements down to the company where they will show you several styles to suit your needs. Since fabrication won’t be a same-day process, it is recommended that you leave the current window installed until your block panels are ready. If your panels aren’t being delivered directly to your home, you may want to request a band clamp around the windows. This will help you transport them with less risk of snapping any of the blocks off the larger panel. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Rip out the old jamb. The frame’s material will determine how difficult this process is. For many frames you may be able to use a simple pry bar to rip out the frame. [4] X Research source If the jambs are set in concrete or mortar, chisel some of it away to ease removal. When dealing with metal frames cast in the concrete, it is usually best to leave these in place. Ask your glass fabricator for suggestions. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Install cedar shims at the bottom of the frame. The shims will help hold the panel in place, and they will ensure an even placement of the panel in the space. The shims should be about 1/2” (1.27cm) wide and long enough to easily remove once the first round of mortar sets. [6] X Research source Install the shims at 3” (7.62cm) intervals, moving away from the corners."
