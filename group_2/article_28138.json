The type used here comes in sheets and is used as a thin plastic over in photo albums or presentation booklets. You can buy it at any office supply or craft store."

It will take longer, however. If you're using a scroll saw, try not to make sharp turns continuously—just cut one angle and then cut another angle separately. You may find that backing out of your current cut and approaching from another angle is helpful when you're cutting fine turns or small details."

Use a drum sander attachment in a drill press to sand near, but not over the lines you just traced. You could also probably do this with a rotary tool with a drum sander attached. The reason you are doing this is to leave a groove for the lenses to sit."

You can use a drum sander attachment on a drill press to do this, or a rotary tool with the appropriate attachment. At this time, you'll also want to sand down the frame and the earpieces until they are smooth. You can do this using a combination of a rotary tool, wood files, and sandpaper."

You can also cannibalize the hinges from another pair that no one wants. Cut away little cavities approximately in the shape of your hinges in the frame and earpieces. Then glue the hinges into place. You'll need to use clamps to hold them in place while the glue sets. Leave the clamps on for about an hour. Attach the earpieces to the frame using the screws that came with the hinges."
