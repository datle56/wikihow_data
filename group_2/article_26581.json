      "content": "Stubbornness is a key Taurus personality trait, so try to roll with it. Taurus is represented by the bull, and that’s where they get their deeply ingrained stubborn streak. Once a Taurus makes up his mind, it’s nearly impossible to get him to change it. He won't like it if you try to change his mind, either. [1] X Research source You can still influence him as long as you're subtle. Introduce your idea and let him come to his own conclusion about it. Works every time!"

      "title": "Tauruses are jealous and can't handle partners with wandering eyes.",
      "content": "Tauruses are jealous and can't handle partners with wandering eyes. Taurus men are extremely loyal, but they expect that loyalty back.

[2] X Research source Flirting with other guys to make a Taurus jealous is a very bad idea. He'll become angry and possessive immediately. Compliments go a long way with Tauruses and can help boost their self-esteem. For example, you might say something like, \"You're hands down the hottest guy in this restaurant. I'm so lucky.\""

It will inspire him to keep following his dreams. For example, you might say, \"You're such a talented artist, Seth. If you submit your paintings, the gallery will definitely show your pieces in their fall exhibit.\""

      "title": "Most Taurus men are sensitive to criticism.",
      "content": "Most Taurus men are sensitive to criticism. Your man won’t be completely against criticism as long as it’s constructive, but stay mindful of your tone, body language, and overall demeanor when you deliver it. Be gentle and put a positive spin on it so he feels supported and understood rather than attacked. [7] X Research source For example, instead of saying, \"Alex, you're totally doing that wrong,\" you might say, \"That project looks complicated! You probably don't need my help, but let me know if there's anything I can do.\" Instead of saying, \"I can't believe you're late for dinner yet again,\" try something like, \"Is everything okay at work? Your boss has been asking you to stay late every day this week.\""

      "content": "Tauruses find it hard to express their feelings in words. They may seem tough and stoic on the outside, but that doesn’t truly represent what’s going on internally. This is especially true at the beginning of a relationship, but don’t worry—they'll slowly open up to you over time. You’ll be rewarded for your patience, so hang in there! [8] X Research source Try sharing some of your personal thoughts or goals with him first. He'll be impressed that you feel comfortable enough to let him in, and you might just inspire him to do the same. Reader Poll: We asked 143 wikiHow readers, and 48% agreed that the approach they find most helpful for supporting someone over text is offering a listening ear . [Take Poll] So, be patient and let him open up over text, too."
