After they have been leveled according to where your pavers will sit, angle your string so that it slopes down by about .25 inches (0.64 cm) for every 1 foot (30 cm) of land. You can do this by taking the length of the plot, finding the corresponding slope angle, and lowering your stakes nearest the yard or street down by the appropriate amount. If possible, angle your slope away from your house or building and toward lower ground. [5] X Research source If you plan on leaving space between pavers, sloping the strings may not be necessary. Avoid driving the stakes into the ground over any utility lines."

If your stones are irregularly shaped, you may need to cut the edges first using a jigsaw.
