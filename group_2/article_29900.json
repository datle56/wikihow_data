      "content": "Slip the sock over your hand. Once you the sock on, make a C-shape with your hand. Put your fingers into the toe part. Try to get your thumb into the heel part. If you can't reach it, tuck the sock into the groove between your thumb and fingers. [2] X Research source Open and close your hand. Your sock should already start looking like a puppet."

      "content": "Glue some eyes onto the sock. You can do this with a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or tacky glue. For the actual eyes, you can use buttons, pompoms, or googly eyes.

      "content": "Cut the toes off of a sock with fabric scissors. Find a sock long enough to cover your arm. It can be any color or pattern. A solid sock would work for just about any character, while a spotted one could make a leopard. You can even use a striped sock to make a zebra! Once you are happy with your sock, cut the toes off with fabric scissors, using the toe seam as a guide. Those funky, fuzzy socks work the best for this type of puppet, but you can use plain socks too."

Tie a piece of yarn around the middle to hold it all together. Glue this to the top of the head, right above the eyes. [7] X Research source The more times you wrap, the thicker the hair will be. Wrap it at least 10 times. You can use a similar technique to give your puppet a mustache! Leave the hair down or cut it. You can also braid it or put it into pigtails.

Make some horns for it out of craft foam or pipe cleaners."
