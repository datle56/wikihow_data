      "content": "If you look like you’re open and engaged, he’ll respond positively. During a conversation, look him in the eyes so that he knows you're giving him your full attention. Many people don't make eye contact when they're talking to someone, so this will make him feel special and important. Smiling also sends the message that you’re happy to be talking to him, which is a great way to drop the hint. [1] X Research source Try not to stare directly at him all the time. Too much eye contact can come off as aggressive or overwhelming. [2] X Research source If you have no facial expression and you’re looking away from him while he talks, it’s going to send a subconscious message that you aren’t interested in talking to him."

      "content": "Casual and respectful touching is a great way to drop the hint. “Accidentally” brush against him in the hall, put your hand on his shoulder when you laugh at his jokes, and go out of your way to hug him first when you run into him and his friends. This kind of light touching is a big sign that you’re comfortable around him and are interested in pursuing a relationship, Jbara says. [3] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. When you hug him, hold it a little longer than you normally would. If it’s reciprocal and he holds the hug as well, it’s a huge sign that he’s into you. If you haven’t known him that long, test the waters first. Try getting a little close to him and then backing out of his personal space. If he has a negative reaction or moves away from you, just take it slow. [4] X Research source A little casual touching is fine, but don’t go out of your way to grab, hold, or touch him in an aggressive way."

Try dropping by his desk with a latte from his favorite cafe or offering to take class notes for him when he’s out sick for the day—something small but meaningful that shows you see him."

      "content": "Making an active effort to interact with him will show him you care. If you go to the same school, get up and go talk to him at lunch. Shoot him a text message out of the blue to ask how he’s doing. If you’re at a party with a bunch of friends, leave them for a minute to go talk to him one-on-one. Showing him that you’re interested in hanging out with him will help you develop a personal relationship. [6] X Research source If you sit around just waiting for him to make the first move and talk to you, he may assume that you aren’t interested in him."

      "title": "If you make him feel good, he’ll want to be around you.",
      "content": "If you make him feel good, he’ll want to be around you. Tell him you think his new haircut looks really cute or that his new shoes are really cool. You can also compliment him on his intelligence by saying something nice about his performance in class, or comment about how kind he was to someone. Everyone loves a compliment, and he’s going to be more likely to want to pursue a relationship or look at you as a potential partner if you build him up. For example, you might say something like, “That test was really hard! I can’t believe you did so well; you’re so good at math.” If you want to compliment his looks, you can say, “That shirt really brings out the color of your eyes. I love it!” But you don't necessarily have to tell him that you think he's hot or the cutest person you've ever seen: “I don't really like using physical compliments,” Jbara says, “I like more questions about what's on you like, ‘Oh, those are great shoes, it works well with your outfit, are you a stylist?’ Stuff like that, where…you're commenting on something that they created themselves, something a little different.” [7] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019."

      "content": "Go out of your way to invite him to events. It doesn’t even need to be romantic or date-like; just ask him to do things with you. If everyone is going out for drinks after work, ask him to tag along. If you and your friends are heading to the mall, send him a text asking if he wants to meet you there. This will make it absolutely clear that you enjoy spending time with him, which is a great way to indicate you have a crush. [8] X Research source If you don’t have his phone number, ask for it ! You can always play it off like you just want help with the homework every once in a while or something. If he ever invites you anywhere, go! The more time you get to spend together, the stronger your bond will grow. Spending time together is the best way to work your way up towards an actual relationship."

      "content": "People like talking about themselves, so ask him questions about himself. Give him plenty of room to open up and share how he feels. Asking questions will send the message that you’re interested in learning more about him. It will also give you plenty to talk about so that you can continue to move things forward. [9] X Research source If you’re just getting to know one another, questions like, “What do you do in your spare time?” and, “What’s your favorite movie?” are great ways to get him talking. Deeper questions are a great way to build on things once you know one another. Things like, “Where do you think you’ll be a year from now?” or, “What would you do with a million dollars?” are great ways to spark a meaningful dialogue. You can ask him questions about you as well. Something like, “Do you think I look better with long or short hair?” gives him an opportunity to say something flirty."

      "content": "A little playful banter is a great way to drop the hint. For one, this will inject some comedy into the conversation every now and then. On top of that, a little fun teasing is a subtle way of demonstrating your comfort and vulnerability around someone. It’s also a great way to relieve a little bit of tension if things ever get serious or awkward. [10] X Research source For example, you might use phrases like “You’re such a brat!” or “Your laugh is so funny to me; I love the way you giggle.” Try to keep it sweet, and don’t say anything authentically critical or mean. Try dropping hints that you're single, and maybe suggest he's the type of guy you're looking for: \"I wish I had a hot date for Friday night. You know, maybe someone about your height, who loves [insert thing he loves.]\" Don’t force this one. If you aren’t a naturally playful person, don’t worry about trying to tease him. At the same time, Jbara advises, without flirting , without “physical contact [and] a little bit of teasing, a little back and forth,” your crush may believe you only like him as a friend.

      "content": "Show you’re invested in what he has to say. Otherwise, he may assume you don’t like him. If he asks you a question, answer it and then ask a similar question back—ideally, an open-ended question that will keep the conversation flowing. Whether it’s in-person or over text, try to respond in a way where you give him an opening to build on the conversation. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If he texts you out of nowhere and asks, “How are you doing?” saying, “I’m fine,” it won’t give him anything to really work with. Alternatively, saying, “I’m fine, but this math homework is kicking my butt! I’d rather be watching Mad Men right now,” gives him a few topics to continue the conversation with. It can be hard to do this in person if you’re nervous around him, but try to limit your one-word answers and actively engage in whatever he’s talking about. For example, if he asks, “Have you seen this new Jason Statham movie?” responding with a flat “No” doesn’t really move the conversation forward. Instead, you might say, “No, have you?” or “Yes. It was really good, and I’d love to see it again. Are you going to the movies soon?”"

      "content": "Joking about being together is a great way to put the idea out there. A little lighthearted comedy about dating is a great way to suggest that you like someone. It’s also a smart way to figure out if he likes you back. If you make a joke like this, and he leans into it a bit and plays along, he probably likes you. If he says something like, “Yeah, like we’d ever end up together,” then you can backtrack a bit and play it off like you were kidding. “If [your crush] says something to you, you can make it a joke,” recommends Jbara. For example, say “‘Oh my God, are you flirting with me?’ And then immediately…you're making the conversation sexual now… you're making it a game, it becomes fun, but at the same time it's flirting and now you're building sexual tension.” [13] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. You could make jokes about him being your “History class husband” or “work boyfriend” because the two of you spend so much time together."

You don’t need to spend a ton of money either—a little doodle or a candy bar can be a perfect gift. If you can, try to choose a gift that relates to an inside joke, previous conversation, or hobby that the two of you share together.
