      "title": "A governor is the leader of a state government’s executive branch.",
      "content": "A governor is the leader of a state government’s executive branch. Their role is similar to that of President of the United States, but their authority is limited to within their state. They are directly responsible for managing their state’s affairs, and while they can’t write laws, they can sign bills into law that have been passed by their state’s legislature. A governor’s exact powers are established by their state’s constitution. [1] X Research source The U.S. has 50 governors—one for each state. Though some governors become major figures in national politics, they have no formal governing role outside of their state."

      "title": "A senator represents a state in the legislative branch of the federal government.",
      "content": "A senator represents a state in the legislative branch of the federal government. Their main responsibility is to speak for the citizens of their state and advocate for their needs on the national level. Unlike governors, senators are not leaders of a state. Instead, they vote as a group to pass laws that apply to the entire country. The powers of the U.S. Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution. [2] X Research source There are 100 U.S. Senators—two for each state. [3] X Research source Each U.S. state also has its own state senate, but these are totally different from the U.S. Senate. State senators can only pass laws within their state and have no authority outside their state’s borders. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Governors have direct control over many aspects of their state’s government.",
      "content": "Governors have direct control over many aspects of their state’s government. While their specific powers depend on the state, most governors can appoint state officials, issue executive orders, approve budgets, and deploy their state’s national guard. They can even pardon someone who has committed a crime under their state’s laws, or commute that person’s sentence so that no jail time is served. [5] X Research source In some cases, governors are responsible for appointing state judges. This gives them direct influence over the judicial branch of their state’s government. Governors can also appoint someone to temporarily fill an empty U.S. Senate seat. This sometimes happens when a U.S. Senator leaves office before an election occurs, such as when a senator resigns, passes away, or obtains another position in government."

      "title": "Governors can make many decisions unilaterally.",
      "content": "Governors can make many decisions unilaterally. This means they technically don’t need anyone’s approval—though they have still have to worry about public backlash and angering other government officials. For example, governors may issue evacuation orders in anticipation of natural disasters, like hurricanes and wildfires. These orders are then enforced by lower-level officials, including state attorneys general, mayors, state police, and local law enforcement. [6] X Research source At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governors issued executive orders forcing businesses to temporarily close. Since each governor had authority over their own state, specific requirements for lockdowns and quarantines varied widely across the country."

      "title": "Governors can’t pass laws directly, but they do help draft them.",
      "content": "Governors can’t pass laws directly, but they do help draft them. A governor work closely with their state’s legislature to draft bills that the governor then signs into law. If a governor doesn’t approve of a bill, they can veto it instead of signing it, which prevents the bill from becoming a law. [7] X Research source Governors can also influence public opinion in favor of policies they support. This can put pressure on state legislatures to pass laws that meet the governor’s demands."

      "title": "Senators are members of the Senate, the upper house of the U.S. federal legislature.",
      "content": "Senators are members of the Senate, the upper house of the U.S. federal legislature. They serve alongside Members of Congress, who are part of the lower house known as the House of Representatives. Along with drafting and voting on legislation, senators can appoint federal officials, confirm judges and justices to the U.S. federal courts, and even vote to declare war on other countries. [8] X Research source The Senate also has the unique power to remove federal officials from office via the impeachment process, which is initiated by the House of Representatives. Removal from office requires a two-thirds majority vote. Unlike governors, senators can only make decisions by a majority vote. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Some senators have specific jobs within the Senate.",
      "content": "Some senators have specific jobs within the Senate. For example, the Senate has a leadership structure, with each political party electing a leader. The party with the largest number of senators chooses the Majority Leader, while the minority party elects the Minority leader. There are also many committees with different functions and degrees of importance. [10] X Research source The Senate Majority Leader is considered the most powerful Senator, since they have authority over which bills get called for a vote. The Vice President of the United States serves as President of the Senate. They preside over the Senate but can only vote when there is a tie."

      "title": "Governors are elected to 4-year or 2-year terms.",
      "content": "Governors are elected to 4-year or 2-year terms. The exact term length depends on the state. Some states also have term limits, meaning that a governor can only serve a maximum of one or two terms. Governors are directly elected by voters in their state. [11] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source Some states don’t allow more than two consecutive terms, but permit candidates to run again after a certain number of years out of office. Some states have no term limits at all, allowing governors to serve as long as voters allow. Most governors run for office as members of a major political party. Parties select their candidates via primary elections, and voters then choose between those candidates in a general election. [12] X Research source Many governors become prominent in national politics. A few have been elected President of the United States."

      "title": "U.S. Senators are elected to 6-year terms.",
      "content": "U.S. Senators are elected to 6-year terms. There are no term limits. The only requirements to become a senator are 1) be at least 30 years old, 2) be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years, and 3) inhabit the state they represent at the time of their election. As with governors, U.S. Senators are directly elected by voters in their state. [13] X Research source Since there are no term limits, some senators have served for many decades. The longest-serving senator served for over 51 years. [14] X Research source Most Senators are members of a major political party. Parties select their nominees in primary elections, and voters then choose between nominees in a general election. Senators who are not affiliated with a political party are known as Independents. There are currently two independent senators serving in Congress. [15] X Research source A few Senators have been elected President of the United States."
