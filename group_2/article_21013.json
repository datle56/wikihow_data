Did they teach you that in Anger Management class?” “My silence is too valuable to waste on you.” “Oh, did I interrupt you while you were talking trash?” “You first.” “That’s clever.

      "content": "Match your comeback to what the other person said. The best comebacks are off-the-cuff comments you make that come to you as you listen to what the other person is saying. The key to thinking of a witty comeback is to hone your listening skills and focus on the other person’s entire message. Don’t just wait for your turn to talk. [1] X Research source Instead of memorizing a few generic comebacks, try targeting what they say or their general tone to make your burn truly savage. For example, if someone is being stuck up or talking about someone behind their back, say something like, “We can’t all be perfect like you.”"

[2] X Research source Another option is to roll your eyes with your mouth slightly open, which is a common expression people use when they’re being sarcastic. [3] X Research source Raising one eyebrow and smirking are other ways to make sure the other person knows how ridiculous you think they are. If you’re just teasing the other person, give them a smile after the sarcastic expression to let them know you aren’t seriously mocking them. Remember, sarcasm is tricky to pull off if you aren’t used to it. Brush up on your sarcasm skills to make sure your roast hits every time."
