If you're rough with your hair it can split or break, and it will look more frizzy than ever. Starting today, handle your hair with extra care, whether it's wet or dry. Here's what to do: When you're applying shampoo and other products, use your fingers to gently pull the product through your hair from roots to tips. Don't scrub your hair. Rinse your hair with lukewarm water, not hot water. Don't wring out your hair or roughly towel it dry. Squeeze out the water gently, then pat it dry with an old t-shirt, chamois or soft towel."

When you wash your hair, the natural oils that protect it from getting dry and brittle get stripped away. Do it too often and your hair will become frizzy and damaged. Cut back to washing your hair only once or twice a week so it has time to recover. After just a week or so, you should notice a positive change in the texture of your hair. [2] X Research source When you do shampoo, use only as much product as you need. A dime-or quarter sized amount is fine. Your hair shouldn't be dripping with soap. Try to wash your hair once every other day, or even once every 2 days. [3] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020.

      "content": "Let it air dry whenever possible. You've probably heard that using a hair dryer wreaks havoc on hair, especially if it's already damaged. Put down the hair dryer and let your hair air dry naturally. Get down with your natural hair texture; if you learn to love it and leave it alone, it will start getting less frizzy and dry. Avoid heat styling tools, too. Use curling and straightening irons very sparingly, if at all. [5] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. If you do feel the need to use a hair dryer, use the coolest setting that works for your hair, typically finer textures should use lower temperatures.
