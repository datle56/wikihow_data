    {
      "title": "Choose suitable paper.",
      "content": "Choose suitable paper. Select a heavy cardstock-like paper to act as the support for your bookmark, and then choose an additional image or pattern to glue over the top. Feel free to make a collage of other papers or to select multiple images if you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the paper.",
      "content": "Cut the paper. The size of the bookmark is up to you. Cut the cardstock into a small, less obtrusive bookmark only an inch long, or choose to make a more traditional sized bookmark measuring 2-3 inches wide. Don’t make the bookmark longer than six inches, as some books are this size and you don’t want the bookmark to stick out the bottom as well as the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your details.",
      "content": "Add your details. Using the decorative paper or images you may have selected, cut and glue them onto the cardstock. Try gluing a piece of textured paper or a cut-out from a magazine over the entirety of the cardstock for an easy way to add style to your craft. Adding glitter or stickers is a great way to give your bookmark personality without much work. Draw over your bookmark with markers or pens to add words, phrases, or quotes that you particularly like. You can also draw your own images onto the cardstock, or add details to the bits of paper and pictures you have glued on. Make a collage of images you cut out from magazines by overlapping them on your cardstock. You can do this with your own personal pictures as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover your bookmark.",
      "content": "Cover your bookmark. In order to protect the paper from becoming frayed or damaged, add a protective covering to your bookmark. If you have the ability to, laminate your bookmark with plastic. You can also create this effect by using wide packing tape in an even strip on both sides of your bookmark. Consider using a craft epoxy-like liquid gel to paint onto both sides of your bookmark. Paint one side at a time, allowing drying periods between coats."

    {
      "title": "Add your finishing touches.",
      "content": "Add your finishing touches. Use a hole-punch to create a hole at the top of your bookmark. Cut a piece of ribbon to be 6-8 inches long, and fold it in half. Then place the loop-end of the ribbon through the hole punch and slide the tail ends through the loop, pulling tightly. Add multiple ribbons for more color and texture on your bookmark. Use beads on the ends of your ribbon for a bit of glam. Slide a few beads over the ends of both the ribbon tails, and then tie a knot to secure it. Use a match or a lighter to burn the cut-ends of the ribbons to prevent fraying. The flame will cause the plastic to melt, creating a blunted-end to your ribbons. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Select your ribbon and beads.",
      "content": "Select your ribbon and beads. Choose a ribbon that is thin and pliable, with no wire. Your beads can be of any size and style, as long as the holes are big enough to fit the ribbon. Consider also adding a charm bead to hang from the end of your ribbons."

      "title": "Cut the ribbon.",
      "content": "Cut the ribbon. Use scissors to cut your ribbon to 42 inches long. Use a match or a lighter to cauterize the ends of the ribbons to keep them from fraying."

      "title": "Thread your beads.",
      "content": "Thread your beads. Add the cluster of beads you want to have hanging from the bottom of your bookmark. If you chose a charm, add it to the center of the ribbon and then fold the ribbon in half, threading your other beads over both tails. If you don’t use a charm, place a single bead in the center of the ribbon (threading it over only one tail), and then fold the ribbon in half and insert both tails through the remaining beads to make it secure. Tie a knot at the base of these beads when you have added all the ones you would like. Leave about a 10 inch space, and then tie another knot with both of the ribbon tails. Add any beads you would like to the top of the bookmark, and then tie one more knot to keep them from falling off."

    {
      "title": "Use your bookmark.",
      "content": "Use your bookmark. The fold in the center of the ribbon should have created a loop-like space between the two pieces of ribbon. Slide this over your book so that on ribbon is placed on the page you want to mark, and the other is placed on the front cover. This will keep your bookmark secure."
