[2] X Research source You can also snip off the post of a jeweled earring stud (as long as it has a flat back) with wire cutters. The size of the rhinestone is up to you, but your fake piercing will look more realistic if the jewel is smaller than the bead you chose."

      "content": "Create your own beaded jewelry by sliding beads onto a pin. Using a straight pin with a beaded head, slide small beads onto the pin in a custom pattern. [4] X Research source Slide the beads over the pin in whatever arrangement you like. Remember, the pin head will be the bottom of the jewelry, so the beads should be small enough they don't slide over it. Don't make the pin arrangement longer than what you'd like dangling from your navel. Using needle-nosed pliers, bend the remainder of the pin so it forms a 90-degree angle. Clip the sharp end of the pin so that only about 1 centimeter of bare wire remains. Bend the remaining wire into a small loop using needle-nosed pliers. The loop will be the top of the belly-button ring."

If you don't have a sticker, you can use wire cutters to snip off the post from a rhinestone earring (as long as it has a flat back) and glue the jewel to your skin. While the size of the rhinestone is based on your personal preference, choosing a jewel the same size or smaller than the pin head you chose will look most realistic."
