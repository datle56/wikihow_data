Some people may have a reaction to the oil, so it is a good idea to test some on a small area of your skin before you use it on a larger area. To test the oil, apply 1-2 drops to the inside of your wrist and then massage it in. Wait 24 hours and then check your wrist to see how it looks. If there is any redness, dryness, itching or swelling, do not use the oil. If the area looks and feels normal, then you can use the oil."
