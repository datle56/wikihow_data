      "content": "Connect the device to a different USB port. It is possible that the USB port you are using is defective. Try both different ports and buses on the computer. If you are using a desktop (tower) PC with both front and rear USB ports, you can often use one set even if the other is malfunctioning, since they are usually connected to a different bus. If you have both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports, they usually utilize separate USB chips and will function separately. If you are using a USB hub, try using a root port on the computer instead. This will tell you whether the hub or the computer bus is at the heart of the problem."
