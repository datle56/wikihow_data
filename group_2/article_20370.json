Plan for about an hour between the time you start to get ready for bed, until your head hits the pillow.

      "content": "Control your environment as a way to declutter the brain. Depression may feel like it immobilizes you. Reduce these feelings of being overwhelmed by making your bedroom a sanctuary of sleep. Avoid cluttering your room with lots of dirty clothes, loose papers, stacks of books, piles of equipment, or other disorganized things. Here are some ways to make the bedroom more ideal for sleep: Use a white noise machine or fan to drown out external noises, both outside of the room and the home. Make sure the room is dark by using heavy curtains or blinds or using a sleep mask. Make sure your bed is comfortable. Find spots or positions that feel more relaxing if possible. Consider using a body pillow to support your legs, hips, and shoulders. This may lead to better sleep, and ease feelings of loneliness.
