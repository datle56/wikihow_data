    {
      "title": "Secure a safety pin to 1 end of the drawstring.",
      "content": "Secure a safety pin to 1 end of the drawstring. Use a large safety pin so it's easier to handle and feed through the casing. Ensure that the safety pin will fit through the casing and secure it about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the end of the drawstring. [1] X Research source If you're buying safety pins, look for skirt pins, which are larger and sturdier than standard safety pins. Also, if the drawstring is lost partway inside the casing, just pull it all the way out. It’s easier to reinsert it completely than to fish it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the safety pin into the eyelet.",
      "content": "Insert the safety pin into the eyelet. Pro tailor Mia Danilowicz says to push the safety pin into the closure, clasp-side first. To do this, first find the eyelets, which are the circular openings where your drawstring comes out. Push the safety pin into 1 of the eyelets until it’s totally inside the drawstring casing. Again, this process is easier if you insert the paperclip so that the metal clasp, rather than the looped end, goes in first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrunch the fabric and pull the safety pin through the casing.",
      "content": "Scrunch the fabric and pull the safety pin through the casing. Now, Danilowicz says to work the safety pin through. Hold the safety pin in place with 1 hand and use your other hand to scrunch the fabric casing toward the pin so it bunches up. Then, hold the safety pin in place with your other hand and pull the bunched up fabric away with the opposite hand. It's important to hold onto the safety pin so you don't lose it inside the casing. Repeat this until the safety pin comes out of the other end of the fabric casing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the safety pin and knot the ends of the drawstring.",
      "content": "Remove the safety pin and knot the ends of the drawstring. Pull the drawstring until both ends are equal lengths. Then, remove your safety pin. If you'd like to prevent the drawstring from sliding back into the casing, tie a large knot at each end of the drawstring. [2] X Research source Make the knots larger than the eyelets so the drawstring doesn't slip back in the casing. This also works for making a drawstring bag! Just thread 2 drawstrings through the bag’s casings so that one drawstring’s ends are on the opposite side of the bag from the other string’s ends."

      "title": "Insert 1 end of the drawstring into a straw and staple them together.",
      "content": "Insert 1 end of the drawstring into a straw and staple them together. A sturdy straw can make this process easier. First, insert 1 end of the drawstring about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) into a straw. Then, staple the string in place inside the straw to make sure it doesn’t come out. [3] X Research source Don’t worry—the staple will come out easily without much damage to the drawstring. If you don’t want to or can’t staple it, though, secure them together with a bit of tape. This works with any sturdy, long, and thin object. For straw alternatives, tape the drawstring to a chopstick, knitting needle, or crochet hook."

      "title": "Feed the straw through one eyelet and out the other.",
      "content": "Feed the straw through one eyelet and out the other. Now, hold the straw with one hand and stick the straw into the drawstring holes. Once inside, use your free hand to bunch the drawstring casing down around the straw, threading the straw through the casing and out the other side. [4] X Research source This works best with a straight, non-bendy straw. If you’re using a bendy straw, use scissors to cut off the bendy part before you thread it through."

    {
      "title": "Separate the straw and drawstring, and tie knots in the drawstring.",
      "content": "Separate the straw and drawstring, and tie knots in the drawstring. Once the drawstring is clear through the casing, remove the straw from the string. Use a staple remover to get rid of the staple, or peel back the tape, if you used it. Then, tie a knot in both ends of the drawstring to make sure it doesn’t come out again. Make sure your knots are larger than the eyelets to prevent the drawstring from coming out."

      "title": "Use a bodkin to save time and effort.",
      "content": "Use a bodkin to save time and effort. This small tool looks like a large, dull sewing needle with a large hole or clamp at the end. Push about 4 inches (10 cm) of the drawstring through the hole and then push the bodkin through the casing of your garment. If your bodkin has a clamp on the end instead of a large hole, open it and put the end of the drawstring under it before you clamp it closed. [5] X Research source Bodkins are handy for this purpose since they’re smooth and well-sized, which makes them easier to handle and push through the drawstring casing."

      "content": "Bend a wire hanger to make a hook for pulling the drawstring through. If you'd like to make a sturdy tool that you can use again and again, find a wire coat hanger. Untwist the hook and shape it into a long straight wire. Then, clamp the very end of the wire around one end of the drawstring. Push the hook end of the wire through the eyelet and keep pushing the wire until the drawstring comes out the other side. [6] X Research source Feel free to bend the wire as you feed it through the casing, especially if you're inserting the drawstring through the rounded part of a hoodie."

      "content": "Wrap the drawstring around a pen with a pocket clip. If you can't find a safety pin, straw, or hanger, look for a pen or mechanical pencil that has a pocket clip and wrap the drawstring around the clip. Then, slide the writing end of the pen through the casing—just make sure the inky tip isn’t exposed. Feed the pen through the fabric and pull it through the casing until the pen and drawstring come out of the other end. [7] X Research source Ensure that you're using a pen with a pocket clip so you don't accidentally push an exposed tip through your fabric."
