Wrap the stems again going back upward toward the base of the flower. Cut the ribbon with a pair of scissors when you are finished. Leave a length of about 1-1/2 to 2\" (4 to 5 cm) at the end. Tie the loose ends of the ribbon together rightly to secure the bow to the bouquet. Wrap a loop of florist's tape around the tied ends if that will make you feel that they are more secure. If you've used silk flowers, use a dab of hot glue instead of tape. If you decide not to wrap the stems in ribbon: Cut the ribbon, leaving a 1/2 to 2\" (4 to 5 cm) tail. The ends of the ribbon behind the bouquet. Tie them tightly to secure the bow to the blooms. Add florist's tape or hot glue, if needed, for extra security."
