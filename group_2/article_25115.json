      "content": "Spray wooden areas with vinegar and water. In a spray bottle, mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Spray the mixture on your wooden furniture, surfaces, and the perimeter of your house. Termites don’t like the smell of vinegar, so they’ll try to avoid it. Reapply the mixture every day to keep termites out. [1] X Research source Alternatively, mix 2 tablespoons (29.5 ml) of white vinegar with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice and half a cup of water."

      "content": "Spray wooden surfaces with orange or neem oil. Orange oil kills termites when they come into contact with it, while neem oil kills termites after they ingest it. Pick up a bottle of your preferred oil, and dilute it with water according to the instructions on the back. Spray the oil on wooden furniture or around your home to kill termites within a few days. [2] X Research source For best results, keep spraying the oil in the same spot multiple times a day. Neem oil is safe to use around children and adults. However, it is slightly toxic to birds and fish.

      "content": "Mix clove oil and water to kill termites. Clove oil is another natural oil used to get rid of termites. Clove oil’s strong smell can interfere with termites’ navigation, and one of its components, eugenol, is toxic to them. Mix 3 drops of clove oil with about half a cup (118 ml) of water in a spray bottle, and spray it on any affected areas. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle salt on furniture for small infestations. Grab normal table salt or sea salt and sprinkle it onto furniture or in small cracks in your home. Termites don’t like salt, so they’ll avoid it as much as possible. If they venture into the salt, they’ll die within a few hours. Alternatively, mix salt with warm water and inject it into your wooden furniture. Keep in mind, though, that injecting salt water into old wooden furniture may harm it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Suffocate termites with soapy water.",
      "content": "Suffocate termites with soapy water. Termites essentially breathe through their skin, so covering them with a soapy film will suffocate them. Mix 6 tablespoons (88.7 ml) of liquid soap (like Dawn dish soap) with 8 cups (1.89 L) of water in a spray bottle. Shake it up, then spray any areas where you’ve seen termite activity. [6] X Research source You can also pour soapy water (or use water directly from the garden hose) on top of termite nests to attempt to flood the tunnels and kill the queen."

      "content": "Apply aloe vera gel to wooden surfaces. Termites can’t cross a thick layer of aloe vera, so grab a bottle of aloe vera gel and spread a layer all over your wooden furniture and any other wooden areas of your home. As the aloe vera gel dries out, apply more to stop the termites from moving around. Eventually, the termites will be stuck in place and die out. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When you’re done, wipe the aloe vera gel up with a wet cloth. This works best for termites in wooden furniture, but it’s not quite as effective if you have an infestation throughout your entire home. If you don’t have aloe vera gel, petroleum jelly works the same way."

Pick up a bag of boric acid and sprinkle it in cracks, crevices, and holes around your home. Over a couple of days, the termites will eat the boric acid and die. Try not to get the boric acid wet, as moisture lowers its effectiveness. [8] X Research source Boric acid is a natural boron compound found in nature, kind of like salt. Buy a bag of boric acid online or at most hardware stores. Boric acid can cause coughing, shortness of breath, and nosebleeds in children, especially infants. If your child comes into contact with boric acid, call poison control. [9] X Research source If you have pets, keep them out of the house when using boric acid.

Diatomaceous earth is an organic powder that contains the fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms called diatoms, and it kills insects by dehydrating them.

Place your wood furniture in a spot where it can bake in the sun for at least 8 hours, and leave it there for at least 3 days. Termites stay in moist places, so sunlight will help dry out the moist wood and kill any termites inside.

Frozen temperatures can kill dry wood termites, so if you have access to a large chest freezer, use it to kill termites in small pieces of furniture. Wrap your furniture in plastic, then put it in the freezer for at least 2 weeks. When you remove it, leave it wrapped until it thaws out completely. [14] X Research source Keeping the furniture wrapped until it thaws protects the wood from water stains. Handle your frozen furniture carefully!

      "content": "Release parasitic nematodes in the garden. Nematodes are microscopic worms that are natural predators of termites. They’ll find termites and burrow into their bodies, usually killing them within 48 hours. Since they hunt and kill pests, nematodes are usually available at garden supply stores. Release them into your garden soil immediately after you buy them, or store them in the fridge if you want to wait. [15] X Research source Nematodes don’t do well in the sun, so try to release them at night so they have time to bury themselves in the soil. Experts recommend using 13,000 to 35,000 nematodes per square foot. Once the nematodes eradicate the termites, they’ll continue to live in your garden and eat harmful bacteria and fungi."

One of the best ways to remove termites is with fumigation, so call a pest control specialist if you can’t get rid of the termites on your own. A professional pest control company can kill termites before they take over your home, and they can stop a small infestation from getting worse.

If you notice a swarm of these insects on or near your property, it’s often a sign termites live there. You may also notice discarded termite wings in your home near windows, doors, and other access points, as termites shed their wings when they find a place to set up their colony. [20] X Research source If you’re remodeling, you may also find live termites in the wood you’re tearing out. Make sure you aren’t mistaking termites for ants. Bin Break says, “Sometimes you call termites white ants, but they’re really different from ants. They’re really sensitive, and you will never see termites walking on the grass outside unless there is something wrong with it.

Mud tubes are thin mud structures (as small as ¼ inch in diameter) that termites build to connect their nests in the ground to your house, garage, or other wooden structures. If the mud tubes are moist, it means the tunnels are active. Bin Break explains, “If you find any mud tubes, you can always scratch them. If they’re active, you will find some ‘white ants’ inside, which are termites. Sometimes, you can scratch the mud tunnel and there’s nothing inside it, but that means, at some point, you had termites outside and they’re [now] feeding on your house.” [24] X Expert Source Hussam Bin Break Pest Control Professional Expert Interview. 28 June 2019."

They typically feast on decaying plant material, like wood, leaf litter, and soil humus. Termites often destroy wooden structures and furniture because they’re hard to detect. Termites and flying ants are similar in appearance, but termites have a thick, ribbed abdomen with no apparent waist; two pairs of vein-filled wings that are of equal length and twice as long as their body; straight, somewhat short antennae; and no eyes. [41] X Research source Flying ants, on the other hand, have a clearly-defined thorax and constricted abdomen; a front pair of wings that is larger than the rear pair and only slightly larger than the body; and distinct, elbow-shaped antennae with an elongated first segment.
