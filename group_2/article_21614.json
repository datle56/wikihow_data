Here, you take the protractor and set its origin on the mid-point of the major axis. Mark the point at 90 degrees. Then swing the protractor 180 degrees and mark that point. Now you can draw the minor axis at its midpoint between or within the two marks."

If you detect a horizontal line will be too short you can take a ruler and extend it a little before drawing the vertical line."
