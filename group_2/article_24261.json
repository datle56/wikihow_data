      "content": "Budget for your safe. Wall safes cost between $50-$350 on average but some will be even higher priced. For a decent safe you can budget between $150-300 but the actual price will depend on the features and size you want. Different security features and fireproofing abilities can increase the cost of your chosen safe."

      "title": "Figure out the correct size.",
      "content": "Figure out the correct size. Most homes are built from two-by-fours (44 x 94mm) spaced 16 inches (40.5 cm) apart. This means that the typical safe will have to fit in this space. Look for a wall safe with a width of less than 16 inches (40.5 cm) and depth of 3.5 inches (9 cm). You can then chose the height that you prefer in which to fit your belongings. Check the size of your walls if you feel they do not agree with these average measurements by finding the studs in your walls."

      "title": "Choose a wall safe",
      "content": "Choose a wall safe with fire resistance. Fire resistant safes will protect your valuables and papers in the event of a fire. Both Underwriters Laboratories (UL) [1] X Research source and Intertek (ETL) [2] X Research source are independent organizations that rate wall safes according to fire resistance. If you want a fire resistant wall safe choose one that will protect your goods for at least 30 minutes because most fires move through a room in about 20 minutes. UL and Intertek rate wall safes according to the type of material they will protect and the length of time they will provide protection. Look on the safe itself or the packaging for these ratings. Choose the wall safe with a fire protection rating according to what you would like to protect. Papers should not get hotter than 350 degrees F (176 degrees C), old tape recordings or 35mm slides no hotter than 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) and CDs/DVDs no hotter than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). In Europe the Eurograde system evaluates wall safes."

      "content": "Decide which access control features you would like. Access control features may include a combination, a key, both a key and pin code or biometric data such as a fingerprint. All access methods are fairly effective and depend on the user to maintain their effectiveness. If you are using a wall safe as a gun safe then it might be preferable to choose biometric access to prevent a key or code from falling into the hands of children."

      "title": "Check theft resistance ratings.",
      "content": "Check theft resistance ratings. Some but not all wall safes have been tested for burglary resistance. Again check for the UL label. A safe rated B4 then it would be able to withstand an attack of at least 15 minutes using common tools. Most burglaries take around 8-12 minutes so a wall safe with this rating would be safe during this time. Ratings of B1, B2 or B3 mean the safe provides very little security and resistance to tools. A B5 rating means the safe can withstand 30 minutes of a typical attack with common tools while a B6 rating means the safe can withstand 30 minutes of attack with common tools, torches and carbide-tipped tools."

      "title": "Find the right location.",
      "content": "Find the right location. Choose a location that is accessible so that you can use the safe effectively. Additionally the safe should be out of the regular traffic pattern of the house such as a closet, the laundry room, behind a heavy piece of furniture, behind a bookcase filled with books or in a child’s room. This makes the wall safe less noticeable and obvious to potential intruders. The location will also depend on the studs in your wall. Make sure you choose a location which will be able to make use of the space between studs."

      "title": "Locate your studs.",
      "content": "Locate your studs. [3] X Research source You will want to fix your safe between studs to allow it to be recessed inside your wall and thus less noticeable. Use a stud finder to locate the studs behind the wall by running the stud finder across your wall. The tool will have an indicator to show when it has found a stud. Stud finders can be purchased from your local hardware store. If you don’t have a stud finder you can knock on the wall and listen for a hollow or solid sound. If the sound is hollow then the location is probably between studs; if it sounds solid then there is likely a stud in this location. Knock a nail into the wall. As you hammer you will be able to feel if you hit a stud by the way the nail goes into the wall. These holes will be covered once you have installed your wall safe."

If you find plumbing in the way you may need to find a new location. If the wall is clear, you are ready to cut out a space for your safe. If something is in the way and you are not confident in your ability to safely move or go around it, the best option is to find a new section of wall."

Use a level to make level lines between the four corners. It is essential that the top and bottom are parallel with the ground while the sides are parallel with your studs. The hole should be close enough to a stud so that you can attach it to your safe later. Make sure to measure and level correctly so that you don’t end up with an uneven or wrongly sized hole."
