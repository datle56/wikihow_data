Tear gas is actually a dust that is sprayed into the air, [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source whereas biological weapons are generally gases. While it is incredibly difficult and expensive to completely protect yourself against gases, you can easily create a barrier against particles at home. Toxic ash from volcanoes, tear gas, and dust are all particle contaminates."

      "content": "Cut a U-shaped opening for your head. Use a marker to draw a “U” across the front of the bottle, cap side down. This needs to fit snuggly across your face, stopping roughly at your temple and below your chin. Make sure you leave 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) between the bottom of your cup and your chin. Cut along your outline with your razor blade. Start smaller than you think you need – you can always cut more away later. The bottle should fit snuggly across your face, as this prevent gas from getting into your eyes. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a protective seal around your face with rubber foam. Glue 1 inch (2.5 cm) of rubber form insulation around the edges of your gas mask to create a seal. This will keep contaminated air away from your eyes and nose. Take your time with this step, trying on your mask multiple times to make sure it sits snugly across your face. You can purchase rubber foam online or at large hardware stores. If you can’t get your hands on rubber foam, use several layers of tape around the edges, or strips of fabric from an old t-shirt."
