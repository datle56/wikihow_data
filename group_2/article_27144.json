      "title": "Decide on the shape of your epaulette.",
      "content": "Decide on the shape of your epaulette. Epaulettes cover the tops of your shoulders, but they come in many different shapes and sizes. Some look like semicircles, while others look like rectangles. Some look like skinny rectangles, with a rounded end that covers your shoulder caps. The edge that faces your neck will always be straight."

      "title": "Create a template on a sheet of paper based on your design.",
      "content": "Create a template on a sheet of paper based on your design. The epaulette needs to be wide enough to cover the top of your shoulder, from front to back. The length is up to you. It can span from the base of your neck all the way to your shoulder cap, or it can be just long enough to cover your shoulder cap. [1] X Research source After you cut the template out, fold it in half lengthwise, then cut off any excess paper that hangs over the edges. This will help make it symmetrical."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your template to trace and cut 2 shapes from thin cardboard.",
      "content": "Use your template to trace and cut 2 shapes from thin cardboard. These will go inside your epaulette and make it nice and stiff. Trace around the template first, then cut the cardboard out with scissors or a craft blade. [2] X Research source If you don't have thin cardboard, you can use a thin sheet of template plastic instead. You can find this in the quilting section of a fabric store. Do not use your fabric scissors for this, or you will ruin them."

    {
      "title": "Trace the epaulettes onto your desired fabric.",
      "content": "Trace the epaulettes onto your desired fabric. Choose some nice fabric for the tops of your epaulettes, then flip it over so that you can see the back. Use your paper template or cardboard insert to trace the shape onto the fabric. [3] X Research source You need to do this twice to create 2 identical shapes. Choose a nice fabric for this, such as velvet, twill, or pleather. Avoid thick or overly decorated fabrics, such as wool felt, upholster, or home décor brocade."

      "content": "Cut the epaulettes out, adding a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam. If you need to, use a ruler to help you trace a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance around the epaulettes first. Next, cut the epaulettes out with fabric scissors."

    {
      "title": "Repeat the process for the bottom fabric pieces.",
      "content": "Repeat the process for the bottom fabric pieces. Use the template or cardboard to trace the shapes onto the fabric that you want to use for the bottom of the epaulettes. Cut the shapes out, adding a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. [4] X Research source Since these pieces will be on the underside of the epaulettes, you can use a cheaper fabric for this, such as cotton. If you are using a different type of fabric for this side, make sure that the color matches the upper fabric."

      "title": "Cut some tassel trim to fit the outside edge of your epaulette.",
      "content": "Cut some tassel trim to fit the outside edge of your epaulette. Measure around your cardboard epaulette, except for the straight edge that faces your neck. Cut 2 pieces of tassel trim according to this measurement. The color of the trim is up to you. If this is for a uniform, however, the trim should match the trim on your uniform. You can find tassel trims in both the regular trim section and the upholstery trim section of a fabric store."

Wrap the trim around the edge so that the tassels are pointing into the epaulette. The edge of the trim should be touching the edge of the epaulette. Secure both pieces with sewing pins. [5] X Research source Make sure that the trim is centered. If you need to, mark the center of both pieces with a pen. Do not extend the tassel trim onto the flat edge of the epaulette. Cut it if you have to. Some trims have a thicker edge. If this edge is greater than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm), you’ll have to adjust the trim so that you don’t sew through the edge."

Backstitch when you start and finish sewing. [6] X Research source Remove the pins as you sew so that you don’t bend them or break your needle. Use clear thread, or a color that matches your fabric."

Make sure that the tassels are sandwiched between the 2 layers of fabric."

It often looks like a woven or braided ribbon, about 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) wide. They come in all sorts of colors, but you should choose one that matches the tassel trim. Do not use a round rope. Choose a flat, braided trim. Another option is to use a sequin trim. You can find these in the regular and upholstery trim sections of a fabric store."

You can stop this from happening by sewing across the cut ends, sealing them with a drop of glue, or wrapping clear tape around them. If you wrap clear tape, make sure that the braided trim stays flat. Don't wrap the tape so tightly that it curls up into a rope."

It can sit right next to the tassels and touch them, or you can leave a small gap between the cording and the tassels. You will have some extra trim hanging off of the ends of your epaulette. Make sure that you have an equal amount of trim on each side. Find the center of the braided trim before you start pinning it. This will ensure that you have an equal amount of excess trim hanging off of the end of the epaulette."
