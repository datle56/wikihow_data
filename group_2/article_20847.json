      "content": "Determine how long you’ll leave the hair on top of your head. The key to a good-looking fade is balance. A fade that starts too high on your head doesn't work well with longer hair on top. It can resemble an undercut, or make your face look longer. Before you begin, determine how long you'll leave the hair up top. Don't cut the hair at the tops of the sides of your head short unless you are going for a short fade. [5] X Research source Trimming the top of your head first may help you figure out your balance. Remember, it's better to cut your hair longer at first because you can always go back and cut it shorter, but you can't make short hair grow back quickly. Depending on the fade, you may want to leave the hair shorter or longer. Some fades, like the low taper fade , work well with all lengths. Others, like the blowout taper , work best on long hair."

      "content": "Cut long hair with scissors if necessary. The fade is a short hairstyle, so if you currently have long hair, you'll want to remove the bulk of it before getting started on your fade. Pull hair back into a low ponytail and secure it with an elastic or clip. Cut the ponytail below the elastic or clip. Then, hold out sections of hair and cut them to the desired starting length. Base this length on your balance. If you've decided to make the top of your hair 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) high, then make sure that you don't cut your long hair any shorter than that length."

[7] X Expert Source Arthur Sebastian Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 29 April 2019. Use a low guard, such as a #2, to achieve a short, clean look. Hold the clippers vertically and gently sweep them up and off the sides and back of your head. Move slowly and gently from the bottom of your head to avoid taking off too much hair. [8] X Research source The #2 guard will leave hair 1/4th an inch (6 mm) long. Another way to achieve a fade is to start with higher-numbered guards and create layers from the top down. This may help you if you keep cutting your hair too short. When sweeping the clippers, use a scooping motion—as if you were scooping ice cream. When you start, experiment on one side first to figure out the right cutting motion and length you need to make the hair to correct rough spots."

As you're learning, the haircut may not come out very well at first. Try to correct it or cut your hair short and wait for it to grow back so you can try again."
