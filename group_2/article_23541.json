Try something like: [2] X Research source “Hi, I’m Anthony.” “Hey, how are you doing tonight?” “Hi, I like your tie.”"

      "content": "Let him know that you want to hear more about him. A lot of smart guys are used to people telling them to stop talking, so getting some encouragement will be a nice change.

That’s so cool—my friend Jessica lives there now; she’s a paralegal.” Or, “My friend Jeff used to work in engineering, too. He switched career paths and he’s now an accountant.”"
