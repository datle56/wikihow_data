      "content": "Eat more vitamin D-rich foods. Vitamin D prevents liver damage (which reduces SGPT levels in the bloodstream), and those with high levels of vitamin D are less vulnerable to liver disease than those with low levels of vitamin D. Include at least 1 fruit and vegetable in each major meal to have a daily dose of vitamin D, staving off liver disease. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Incorporate good sources of vitamin D into your diet like green, leafy vegetables, cod liver oil, fish, fortified cereals, oysters, caviar, tofu, soy milk, dairy products, eggs, mushrooms, apples, and oranges. Spend more time in the sunshine, too. The sun’s UV rays stimulate vitamin D production in your skin (make sure to wear sunscreen to prevent sunburn)."

      "content": "Eat a nutritious, fiber-rich, plant-based diet. Eating organic foods helps the liver cleanse itself of toxins and create new cells to stop SGPT leaking into the blood. Consume more fresh, whole foods that you’ve prepared yourself and stay away from high-sugar or processed foods, which are often lacking nutrients. Focus on foods high in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens like spinach and cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage. Aim to get 20-30 grams of fiber per day from sources like whole grains, beans, and lentils. Include more antioxidant-rich foods like wild blueberries, carrots, potatoes, beetroot, and avocado. Replace red or fatty meat with lean protein like chicken and fish, switch to low-fat dairy products, and snack on nutritious nuts and seeds over processed foods like potato chips."

      "content": "Reduce your intake of high-fat, oily, and fried foods significantly. Fatty foods make it hard for the liver to process nutrients. Having more than 10% liver fat is a condition called fatty liver disease, which can lead to inflammation and damage to your liver tissue (resulting in higher SGPT levels in your blood). However, foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, may help lower SGPT and promote liver health. To reduce liver fat, cut back on foods like: [3] X Research source Oily foods that are deep fried Fatty cuts of meat like sausage, bacon, or pork and chicken skins Coconut oil High-fat dairy products like butter or cheese Highly processed junk food Aerated or carbonated drinks that are high in sugar"

      "content": "Add less salt to your cooking and buy low-sodium grocery items. Excessive salt, especially in the liver, causes swelling and fluid retention. This makes it harder for the liver to filter waste, leading to liver damage and raised SGPT levels. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Chemical Society Scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer-reviewed scientific journals Go to source The average adult only needs 2,300 mg of sodium (about 1 teaspoon) per day, so avoid adding extra salt to your dishes and do more cooking at home to control your sodium intake. Limit high-sodium foods like bouillon cubes, baking soda, soy sauce, salad dressings, bacon, salami, pickled foods, and processed foods. Look for low-sodium or unsalted versions of foods like soy sauce or snacking nuts at the grocery store. To add flavor to your cooking, opt for more herbs and spices instead of an extra pinch of salt."

      "title": "Stop drinking alcohol",
      "content": "Stop drinking alcohol until your SGPT levels are normal. Alcohol is very harmful to the liver. When alcohol is ingested, it goes directly to the bloodstream and makes its way to the liver, which must filter out the toxins from alcohol. Over time, regular heavy drinking can create serious liver damage that allows more SGPT to enter your bloodstream. [10] X Research source Cut out alcohol entirely until your SGPT levels return to the normal range (this can take several weeks or months depending on the cause). Follow your doctor’s instructions about when or if you can begin drinking again. After your levels have stabilized, enjoy alcoholic drinks in moderation if you wish. Medically, moderation is defined as 2 drinks or less per day for men or 1 drink or less for women. [11] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Alcohol consumption is a major contributor to liver diseases such as fatty liver, liver cirrhosis, and hepatitis, as well as increased SGPT levels.

Studies show that both resistance training and aerobic activity are equally effective at lowering liver fat and enzyme levels, including SGPT. Aim to lift weights or engage in aerobic workouts like brisk walking, jogging, or swimming for about 45 minutes a day, at least 3 days a week to see lower SGPT levels in as little as 8 weeks. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Exercise is beneficial for your overall well-being, including your liver health. Staying active excretes toxins in the body through sweating and burns fat, leaving your liver with more energy to dedicate to strengthening its cells.

      "content": "Measure your SGPT level with a blood test at the doctor’s office. A comprehensive metabolic panel or a liver panel will detect levels of SGPT (also known as alanine transaminase, or ALT) in your bloodstream. In cases of acute liver damage, SGPT levels rise dramatically as the enzyme leaks through cell walls into your blood. Elevated levels may be due to recent strenuous activities, exercise, or alcohol consumption, so let your doctor know if you’ve participated in these activities prior to getting your blood drawn. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source High SGPT is not a sign of liver damage on its own. It must be considered with other liver tests to verify whether a patient really suffers from damage to the liver. Different underlying causes might cause different levels of SGPT elevation. For example, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the leading cause of mild SGPT elevation in the U.S. Mild SGPT elevation can also be associated with strenuous exercise or thyroid disease."

      "content": "Stop taking over-the-counter drugs and supplements if possible. If your liver is already damaged and you continue taking non-prescription drugs, the liver may sustain further damage as it metabolizes additional medication. These drugs include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, pain relief medicines like acetaminophen, and more. If your SGPT is high, only take drugs your doctor recommends or prescribes. [20] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If in doubt, ask your physician about non-hepatotoxic (nontoxic to the liver) drugs or which over-the-counter drugs are OK to take.

This medication decreases inflammation in and around the liver by reducing the production of inflammatory chemicals to lessen tissue damage. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or can be injected through a vein. The most common corticosteroids are Hydrocortisone, Prednisone, and Fludrocortisone. [21] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Once the inflammation subsides, the liver cells will start to regenerate, therefore decreasing the release of SGPT into the bloodstream.
