Leave at least 3/8 of an inch (1 centimeter) of clay at the bottom to form the base of the pot. If you accidentally pinch through the base of the pot, roll the clay into a ball again and start over."

      "content": "Pinch the pot. Use gentle pinching motions to thin out the walls of the pot. Work in circles to thin out the sides at the same rate. Keep pinching until the walls are as thin as you’d like them. The walls of the pot should be similar in thickness without any large divots. [3] X Expert Source Natasha Dikareva, MFA Ceramics & Sculpting Instructor Expert Interview. 1 June 2021. [4] X Research source Smooth out any cracks in the clay with your fingers after you’ve finished forming the pot. While pinching, pay attention to the shape of your pot. Will it be a circular pot, a square-bottomed pot, or a long, tall pot? The walls can be as thick as you’d like them. However, make sure you don’t make them any thinner than 3/8 of an inch (1 centimeter) or they will collapse."

      "content": "Let the pot become “leather hard”. Set the pot in a low-traffic location and cover it with a lightweight hand towel. Let the pot dry for a few hours, checking on it periodically. When the pot is leather hard, it will be cool to the touch and firm like a block of cheese. [5] X Research source If the pot starts to look chalky, it is getting too dry."

      "content": "Smooth the surface of the pot. Once the pot is leather hard, you can smooth the surface and add embellishments. [6] X Research source Many potters prefer to use their fingers to smooth the surface of the pot, but you can also use specialized pottery tools such as wooden ribs. Additionally, you can even out the lip of the pot by cutting away any uneven areas with a craft knife. Other embellishments can include: Using your fingers to smooth away any marks or cracks in the surface Using a wooden stick to carve a pattern into the side of the pot Scraping a serrated metal rib against the side of the pot to create a rough texture"

      "content": "Allow the pot to dry completely. Let the pot become “bone dry.” During this stage, the pot will be rigid, brittle, and chalky. Polymer clay and pottery clay must be bone dry before you can bake it or fire it. Otherwise, it may melt or explode. Be careful when handling a bone dry piece of pottery as it can break easily."

Once your oven has preheated to the right temperature, place your pottery on a baking sheet and put it in your oven. Refer to the manufacturer instructions for cooking times and safety tips. Some people believe that you shouldn’t bake polymer clay in your oven because it will leave a harmful residue. However, this is a myth. [7] X Research source The baking sheet should not be used for food again once it’s been used for polymer clay."

      "content": "Dry out air-drying clay. You don’t need to cure air-drying clay in the oven or in a kiln. Instead, place a lightweight towel over the pot and set it in an undisturbed location. Let it dry for five to seven days to allow it to completely harden before decorating it. If you paint the clay when it’s still wet, it won’t harden properly. Once it’s dry, the clay will be chalky and firm. It’s better for the clay to dry too long than too little."

Once your pot is completely bone dry, carefully transport it to your local pottery supply store. These stores usually offer inexpensive firing services. You will be able to pick up your fired piece after a few days. Make sure you tell the store employee the name of the clay you used as different clays are fired to different temperatures."

Once you’ve decorated it, seal the paint onto the surface of the pot with a sealing varnish. [8] X Research source Polymer clay isn’t food safe, so you don’t have to worry about choosing food safe paints or varnishes. Avoid using nail polish or oil based paints on your pot. They will dissolve the surface of the clay. These materials can be purchased at most craft supply stores. For help finding them, talk to a store representative."

Purchase a food-safe professional varnish and apply four to five coats to the surface of the pot. Acrylic paints, latex paints, and food-safe varnishes can be purchased at craft supply stores. Talk to a store representative for help finding these items. Follow the manufacturer instructions when applying the food-safe varnish. For example, some varnish manufacturers ask you to let the varnish dry twenty-four hours between coats."

      "content": "Glaze or paint pottery clay. Once your pot has been fired in a kiln, you can decorate the surface however you’d like. If you’re not going to use the pot for food or drinks, you can paint the pot with acrylic, latex, or oil-based paints. Alternatively, glaze your pot to make it food and drink safe. This will require another firing in the kiln, so talk to a pottery store representative to learn about your options. You will need to choose a glaze that has a similar firing temperature to your clay. Talk to a pottery store representative for help choosing a glaze. Never glaze the bottom of your pot. This will make it stick to the kiln shelf and ruin it."
