According to registered dietician Melody Sayers, \"Fiber-rich foods like fruits, veggies, and plant-based protein help you stay satisfied for longer.\" She also stresses how \"plant-based protein sources have no cholesterol and practically no saturated fats.\" When you're trying to lose weight and cut calories, you'll need to choose nutrient-dense foods. These are items that are relatively low in calories, but also high in nutrients. Include one to two servings of fruits or vegetables at each meal. Make sure to measure your portions to 1/2 cup of fruit, [2] X Trustworthy Source USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion U.S. agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research Go to source 1 cup of vegetables and 2 cups of leafy greens.

It also helps support your metabolism during the day. [4] X Research source Include a source of lean protein like chicken, fish, tofu, beans, shellfish, or low-fat dairy at each meal. Stick to a 3–4 oz portion of these lean proteins.

These foods also contain moderate amounts of fiber and may help you stay more satisfied. [6] X Research source Although whole grains are more nutritious compared to refined grains (like white bread or white rice), they do not offer as many nutrients as protein, fruits, or vegetables. Choose whole grain foods over simple carbs, or refined grains, as in white bread, crackers, baked goods. Try: brown rice, quinoa, oats, farro, whole wheat bread, or whole wheat pasta. Measure your portions of whole grain foods to help you lose weight. Measure out 1 oz or about 1/2 cup of grains.

Many processed foods are higher in calories, fat, sugars and other additives. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you currently rely heavily on processed foods, slowly make the switch to less processed foods. Start by making one meal or snack at home or pack to bring with you.

Even when you're slightly dehydrated, you may feel hunger signals when in fact you're only thirsty. Aim for at least 64 oz (2 litres) of clear fluids each day.

Only cutting out calories and exercising can cause weight loss. However, if you're cutting out a significant amount of calories (500-1,000 to lose 2 pounds in a week), you may not be able to eat enough to meet your daily nutrient needs. Always talk to your doctor prior to starting any supplementation. He or she will be able to tell you if this is safe and appropriate for you."

Your basal metabolic rate or BMR is how many calories your body burns per day performing basic metabolic functions, such as breathing, digesting food, or blinking. [12] X Research source This calculation is important for determining your basic caloric needs. You can do it by hand or use an online calculator, like the one here . If you are a woman, calculate your BMR using the following formula: BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 x weight in kg) + (1.850 x height in cm) – (4.676 x age in years) [13] X Research source 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years) If you are using metric measurements, use the following formula: Example: A 5'7\", 135 pound, 30-year-old woman's BMR would be 655 + (4.3 x 135 pounds) + (4.7 x 67) – (4.7 x 30) = 1408.5. If you are a man, calculate your BMR using the following formula: [14] X Research source 66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years) If you are using metric measurements, use the following formula: BMR = 66.5 + (13.75 x weight in kg) + (5.003 x height in cm) – (6.755 x age in years) Example: A 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old man's BMR would be 66 + (6.3 x 180 pounds) + (12.9 x 72) – (6.8 x 30 years) = 1924.8."

      "content": "Calculate your calorie goal. You can use the number of calories you burn every day to help you calculate a calorie limit to help you lose 1–2 pounds per week. There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat. In order to lose a pound of fat, you must consume 3,500 less calories than you burn. To lose 2 pounds of fat in a week you must consume 7,000 less calories than you burn in that week. In other words, you must have a daily deficit of 1,000 calories to lose 2 pounds of fat in a week.BMR = 66.5 + (13.75 x weight in kg) + (5.003 x height in cm) – (6.755 x age in years). [18] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To calculate how many calories you should eat to lose 2 pounds per week (given your current activity level) subtract 1,000 calories from the calories you burn in a day as calculated in the step \"Account for how active you are.\" Example: If you normally burn about 2694 calories/day then you would need to eat 1694 calories per day to lose 2 pounds per week. Note that smaller women will have a difficult time achieving a 1,000 calorie deficient. If your calorie intake is less than 1,200 calories/day after subtracting 1,000 calories for weight loss you might want to consider a slower weight loss plan. Eating less than 1,200 calories a day can lead to nutrient deficiencies and inhibit your long-term weight loss goals. [19] X Research source Example: If you are a woman with a BMR of 1,408 who is mildly active (x 1.3) and therefore burns about 1,831 calories per day, a deficient of 1,000 calories would require that you eat only 850 calories per day. This is too low for a long-term diet and will prevent you from getting the nutrients your body needs."

      "content": "Eat until you're satisfied. In addition to counting calories, you can also pay attention to how your body feels when you're eating. It has a natural way of telling when you've eaten just the right amount (without calorie counting). Our bodies have many mechanisms to help tell us when we've eaten enough food at one sitting. There are cells in both the stomach and intestines that help tell our brains that we've had enough food and we're satisfied. Listening and paying attention to these cues can help you stop eating when you're satisfied — not full or overly full. This is your body's natural \"calorie counter.\" Aim to stop when you're satisfied. This feels like a lack of hunger, general sense of contentment, and a knowledge that you won't be hungry for another few hours. You should not feel uncomfortable. If you feel full, you might have had a few bites too many, finished the entire serving, or had second servings. If you feel full or uncomfortable, you have had too much and you've overeaten."

Lifestyle activities burn small amounts of calories; however, if you're moving more all day long, you can make a significant impact on your weight. Try to move or walk more throughout your day.
