Press and hold down for 10 seconds to achieve a beautiful curl. After your eyelashes are curled, it's time for mascara. Choose a color that doesn’t overpower your face. If you have dark hair, a black mascara will probably work best. Blondes and lighter brunettes should stick with a brown mascara. Keep your lashes from looking clumpy by making sure the product is evenly distributed along the mascara wand. Start at the base of your lashes and work the wand to the ends, gently wiggling it as you go. This will also help to avoid clumping, and keep your eyelashes from looking weighed down with product. For the natural look you desire, one coat of mascara should do the trick. If you have thick lashes, you can skip this step all together."
