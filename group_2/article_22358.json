Reduced amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables are associated with lung diseases, particularly with asthma and COPD. Fruits and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidants, which have been shown to protect against asthma and COPD and may protect against cancer.

If you do want to eat meat, make sure the beef is lean, preferably grass fed and hormone and antibiotic free. Eat poultry that's raised without hormones or antibiotics. You should also remove the skin. [4] X Research source Emelyanov A, Fedoseev G, Krasnoschekova O, et al.

Poultry, such as chicken and turkey, are rich sources of vitamin A. People with vitamin A deficiencies are susceptible to bacterial infection in the lungs. Increasing your intake of vitamin A helps to kill harmful micro-organisms from the lining of lungs."

Switch to organic foods as much as possible. Studies show that a number of different preservatives and additives found on in non-organic foods may be associated with asthma attacks, lung cancer, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. These additives include sulfites, aspartame, parabens, tartrazine, nitrates and nitrites, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and benzoates. [5] X Research source Jin H, Xu C-X, Lim H-T, et al.

This will help you limit your intake of additives and preservatives, which can cause breathing problems and increased lung sensitivity. You should try to make most of your food from scratch, though it may take some extra practice and planning. You will be healthier if you cook more from scratch and use foods that have not been processed. This is because they retain most of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients inherent in the foods. A way to tell if a food is too processed is to see if it is too white, such as white bread, white rice, or white pasta. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice, and whole grain pasta. This means that you should include only unprocessed complex carbohydrates. If you avoid white bread and other processed foods, you have essentially excluded any other carbohydrates. When complex carbs are processed, they are broken down into the simple carbohydrates that are used by the body. [6] X Research source"

Drinking enough water is also necessary to keep your mucus thin, which helps to prevent too much mucus from building up in your lungs and airways. You can also increase your body's hydration levels by drinking herbal teas and juice. Any fluid that is non-caffeinated is considered part of your daily fluid intake.

Exercise increases blood flow to the lungs and allows all the necessary nutrients to reach them. You should take it slowly at first and proceed with caution so you do not overdo it. Find the right pace for you and increase the level of exercise as you are comfortable. When you first start, go for a long or brisk walk or use an elliptical machine. These exercises are not too strenuous but will get the blood and air moving through your lungs and body. If you have lung or breathing problems, consult your doctor before doing any new exercises.

At first, any of these exercises might make you a bit dizzy. This is why most healthcare professionals advise a slow and steady approach. Once you get used to the method of breathing that works best for you, you will find that you are using that method more and more, often without actively or consciously thinking about it. You can find a personal trainer or physical therapist who can guide you in increasing that capacity. Ask your health care professional for a referral.

The first method is pursed-lips breathing. Start this method by breathing in through your nose for about two or three seconds. Next, pucker your lips and breathe out slowly through your pursed or puckered lips for four to nine seconds. Repeat as often as you are comfortable. If you get uncomfortable, wait an hour and try again. It will take practice and dedication, but if you do, you will soon find it easier to breathe and find that you feel better.

      "title": "Use diaphragmatic breathing.",
      "content": "Use diaphragmatic breathing. You should teach yourself to do diaphragmatic breathing, which is breathing through your belly instead of your chest. Although most people don’t breathe this way, this is considered normal breathing. It uses the diaphragm, which is the strip of muscle below your lungs that is the main muscle of breathing. First, relax your shoulders, back and neck. Place one hand on your belly and one on your back. Inhale through the nose for two seconds. As you inhale, move your belly outward. Then, breathe out through pursed lips to help control the rate of exhalation while gently pressing on your belly. This pushes up on the diaphragm, strengthening the muscle. This will take some practice to master. It is not easy to retrain yourself to use the diaphragm, but if you watch babies, this is the way they breathe. They don’t use what are called the “accessory muscles of breathing,” which is the muscles of the neck, shoulders, back, and rib cage. Once you get it, use the method for as long and as often as you are comfortable. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Perform a deep breathing exercise. There is a variation on the pursed-lips and diaphragmatic breathing methods adapted from the University of Missouri at Kansas City. For the deep breathing method, lie flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands palm down on your stomach, right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly. This exercise ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage. Do this whenever you are short of breath or as often as you can. At first, you may feel a bit dizzy because you are pulling more oxygen into your lungs than you are used to. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, stop. However, you can repeat this as often as you want. [14] X Research source"

As you exhale, make a humming sound. This noise moves your diaphragm and helps strengthen the muscle. Do this whenever you are short of breath or as often as you can. At first you may feel a bit dizzy. Don't be alarmed. This is because you are getting more oxygen than you are used to getting at one time. If at anytime you feel uncomfortable, stop.

On the second intake of air, move your arms to the side, keeping your arms at shoulder level. On the third intake, lift your arms over your head. Repeat 10 to 12 times.

Eucalyptus oil vapor acts as a decongestant when it is inhaled, making it effective in the treatment of bronchitis. Try placing a couple of drops of the oil into a bowl of hot water and inhaling the steam.
