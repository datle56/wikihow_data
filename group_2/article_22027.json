Not only will it help you relax, but it’ll also work as a great distraction and time killer. Also, with sites like Netflix and Hulu, as well as a multitude of network streaming sites, watching shows and movies is easier than ever.

      "content": "Invest in a Kindle or e-reader. If you don't want to waste your days in front of a television, try reading e-books.

      "content": "Draw on your cast. When you see people with casts and see all of the signatures on them, it makes you want to sign it, right? Well now lucky for you, you have a cast of your own to write and draw on! You can ask people to sign your cast, or you can just draw on it yourself. It's also a great thing to have for (believe it or not) to-do lists and things you need to remember. [2] X Research source If you are going to draw on your cast, get silver or gold sharpies to use because if your cast is dark, you want to use colors that will show up."

For example, you can list simple things like clapping or cutting your food. Or go for bigger things like rock climbing, swimming, or handstands. Let your frustration serve as a motivation to try new things once your arm has healed."

      "content": "Keep clean. Though it may seem like an impossibility with a cast, you can invest in a few items to help you stay hygienic. This way you're not trapped taking bird baths or getting family and friends involved. Instead, try finding a few items like: An electric toothbrush, or “end tuft” brush to make brushing your teeth simpler. You can also get an access flosser, which will allow you to floss one handed. [3] X Research source Spray deodorant. If you aren’t able to use your arm fully, this will save you the pain of trying to put on a stick. Just make sure you apply it while shirtless, as you might accidentally spray it all over your clothes. Dry hair shampoo. This is a great item if you aren't able to lift your arm fully or get your cast wet. You simply spray it on the roots of your hair and massage it in. It's a quick way to get your hair looking freshly washed, and it won't stain your clothing. If you have the ability, you can even go to a salon for regular hair washing. Some salons may give you a discount if you are only going to have your hair washed."

      "content": "Readjust your sleeping habits. One of the most annoying problems with a cast can be situating yourself in bed. For example, it's hard to turn over when you can only use one arm. It can also be painful to keep your broken arm in one position all night. Try instead to prop your arm up with pillows. You can even build yourself a pillow fortress to make sure you don't roll over onto your arm during the night. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try new ways of eating. If you don't have someone with you to help you cut food, you may have a slight struggle on your hands. However, if you are alone, you can problem solve by eating foods that only require a spoon or fork - or foods soft enough to be cut with either. You can also use food delivery services like Blue Apron or Fresh Direct which will not only save you from having to carry groceries but also do the food prep for you. A lot of their meals come pre-portioned, so rather than trying to cut up and measure ingredients, you can get straight to the cooking. If you get really desperate, though, try a pizza cutter instead of a knife."

You should also make sure you are wearing shirts that you can fit over your cast. It’s also a good idea to get dressed cast arm first, so you know what you picked out will work."
