      "title": "Tear some paper into small squares or rectangles.",
      "content": "Tear some paper into small squares or rectangles. Newspaper works best, but you can also use plain newsprint paper from the craft store instead. Don't cut the paper; the ragged edges will help the paper seal together and give you a smoother finish. Consider using both newspaper and tissue paper. This way, when you do multiple layers, you will be able to see which one you are working on. Avoid using plain printer paper or construction paper. Both are too thick and too stiff for this project. You can also use gauze strips for your project."

      "title": "Dip a paper strip into the glue, and place it onto the balloon.",
      "content": "Dip a paper strip into the glue, and place it onto the balloon. Drag the strip across the edge of the bowl as you pull it out. This will remove any excess glue. Place it down near the top of the balloon. Use your fingers or a paintbrush to smooth the paper down so that it lays flat against the balloon."

      "title": "Continue applying the paper strips until the balloon is completely covered.",
      "content": "Continue applying the paper strips until the balloon is completely covered. Overlap the strips slightly as you work from one end of the balloon to the other. Work your way from the top of the balloon all the way down to the tail end. Do not cover the tail, or you won't be able to remove the balloon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a second layer of paper.",
      "content": "Apply a second layer of paper. You don't have to dip these strips of paper into the glue. Simply stick them to the wet paper that's already on the balloon, and use your fingers or a paintbrush to smooth down the edges. Consider using a tissue paper or plain newsprint for this layer. This way, you will be able to see what's cover and what isn't. Two layers is ideal for eggs that you want to cut open. If you want a sturdier egg, apply a third layer. You may have to use some extra glue for this one."

      "content": "Pop and remove the balloon. Once the egg is completely dry, gently tug the balloon tail up so that you expose a bit of the balloon. Pierce it with a pin or pair of scissors and wait for the balloon to deflate. Once it is completely deflated, pull it out and discard it."

      "title": "Consider giving the eggs a final coating of gloss.",
      "content": "Consider giving the eggs a final coating of gloss. Once all the paint has dried, spray or paint the eggs with a glossy sealer. You can even use a glittery sealer to give it some extra sparkle.This will help make them more durable. If you'd like, you can cut the egg in half using jagged, zigzag lines so that it resembles a cracked open egg. When you are done, you can fill each half with fake grass, and place a little chick or bunny figure in each."

      "content": "Cut the colored tissue paper into 1½-inch (3.81 centimeters) squares and set it aside. This will make the outside of your egg. You can make it all one color or many different colors. Some crafters have noted that lighter colored tissue paper, such as yellow, shows the layering and overlapping more. To make polka dot eggs, punch a ¾-inch (1.91 centimeters) circle in the center of your square using a scrapbooking hole punch. Discard the circles, and use the squares so that you get white polkadots on your egg."

Smooth it down with a brush dipped in more glue. Overlap the pieces as you cover the entire egg. Start applying the tissue paper at the top of the balloon and work your way towards the tail. Don't cover the tail up. [1] X Research source"

If you are making polka dotted eggs, be careful not to cover up the white polka dots!"

Let the patch covering the hole dry before moving on. Because these eggs are made from colorful tissue paper, they don't need to be painted. You can still decorate them, however, with glitter glue if you'd like."
