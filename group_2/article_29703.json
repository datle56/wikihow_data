      "content": "Combine the milk, pumpkin puree, and sugar. Pour the milk into a 2-quart (2-liter) saucepan. Whisk in the pumpkin puree and the sugar. Keep whisking until the pumpkin puree is completely mixed in. Make sure that you are using plain pumpkin puree and not the pumpkin pie blend. The pumpkin pie blend contains additional ingredients that won't work in a latte."

      "content": "Add in the pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and coffee. The coffee must be strong, otherwise the latte will taste too milky. You can use freshly-brewed coffee from the coffee maker, or you can use instant coffee instead. For a more traditional latte, use 1 to 2 shots of espresso (about 30 to 60 milliliters) instead.

      "content": "Stir everything together once more. If you want to, you can pulse the mixture with a handheld blender to make the milk more frothy."

      "content": "Heat the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice in a small saucepan. Combine the pumpkin puree and the pumpkin pie spice in a small saucepan. Cook them over medium heat for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. The mixture is ready when it turns fragrant. For extra flavor, add in some freshly-ground black pepper. Make sure that you are using plain pumpkin puree and not the pumpkin pie blend."

    {
      "title": "Mix in the sugar.",
      "content": "Mix in the sugar. Keep stirring until the mixture turns thick and syrupy. If you want a less-sweet latte, you can use less sugar."

    {
      "title": "Stir in the milk and the vanilla extract.",
      "content": "Stir in the milk and the vanilla extract. Allow the mixture to heat back up, but don't let it come to a boil. This will make the latte taste more syrupy, like what you'd find in a coffee shop. For something less sweet, use only 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of vanilla extract. Stir the ingredients continuously to prevent the milk from scalding. The type of milk you use is up to you. Whole milk will produce the richest taste and the most froth, but nonfat milk will also become frothy enough to work with and will produce a slightly healthier drink."

      "title": "Blend the two together with a handheld blender.",
      "content": "Blend the two together with a handheld blender. Keep blending until the mixture turns foamy. This will take about 15 to 30 seconds. You can also use a regular blender or food processor, but be sure to hold the lid down tightly and to wrap towels around it. If you don't do this, the mixture will leak out. If you don't have any kind of blender, process the mixture with a whisk. It won't be as smooth, however, and you may still have some pumpkin puree in the finished drink. The mixture should become very foamy. Expect more foam if you used whole milk and less if you used low-fat or nonfat milk."
