      "content": "Roll up 50-75 diapers . Choose newborn diapers so the parents can use them right away, or go with size 1 or 2 so they have diapers on hand when the little one gets bigger. Simply take a diaper out of the package, roll it up starting at the “open” top end, and wrap a small rubber band around it. [1] X Research source Feel free to make your cake with either disposable or cloth diapers. Buying diapers with a colorful design will enhance the fun look of the cake. [2] X Research source"

Place an empty paper towel roll, wine bottle, baby bottle, or even a bottle of baby shampoo or lotion in the center of the base to act as a support for your cake. [3] X Research source"

Place another diaper the same way so that it overlaps the first. Repeat this process so that you form overlapping layers of diapers around the paper towels. Secure the base layer by wrapping a large rubber band (or tying a piece of string) around all of the diapers. You’ll need a full box of diapers to create a 3-tier cake. Feel free to use any brand or size of diapers you like. Even cloth diapers could work!"

Wrap one piece around each tier of diapers and secure it with double-sided tape. [9] X Research source Go with pink ribbon for a girl or blue ribbon for a boy for a traditional look. Opt for a gender-neutral color like yellow or green for any diaper cake. Choose a printed ribbon to stay on theme, like red gingham for a baby shower picnic or a dinosaur-printed ribbon for a dino party."

For a practical and adorable option, place baby toys or accessories like pacifiers, baby rattles, or baby travel toiletries in the top of the diapers around the edge of each tier or behind the ribbon. Top the cake with a sweet stuffed animal or a teeny pair of baby booties for a finishing touch. [10] X Research source For a unicorn-themed cake, cut some pretty eyelashes out of black paper and attach them to the top tier with tape or glue. Add a unicorn horn and some ears to the top of the cake as a finishing touch. Keeping it classic? Grab some rubber ducks in various sizes and styles and place them around and on top of the cake. For a serene garden theme, stick pretty succulents around each tier, plus a few at the top. Secure the topper with a safety pin or tie it in place with ribbon, if needed."
