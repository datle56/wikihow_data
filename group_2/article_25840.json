      "content": "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) SNAP provides you with an electronic card you can use at grocery stores to buy food. SNAP cards are known as Electronic Benefits Transfer Cards, or EBT cards, and are reloaded with benefits each month. Not all grocery store purchases can be made using an EBT card. You can only purchase food or seeds to grow food to eat. Household items, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, vitamins, minerals, live animals, and hot foods cannot be purchased with an EBT card.

[2] X Research source Eligibility requirements: No more than $3,000 in countable resources, or no more than $4,500 in countable resources if at least one person in the household is over 60 or disabled. Countable resources include things like a bank account. Resources like a home or lot are not counted. [3] X Research source A net monthly income of $1,255 or less (for a household of 1). The monthly income cutoff is dependent on the size of your household. You can find a listing of income cutoffs by household size on the USDA’s website .

      "content": "Locate the food pantry nearest to you. Food pantries provide free food (groceries or sometimes cooked meals) to those who are struggling financially for reasons like low income, unemployment, homelessness, disabilities, and more. Young people have the highest food insecurity rate of any age group, according to Feeding America research and college students in particular can sometimes find free food pantries on campus. Often, the only requirements for visiting a food pantry are to be in need and to live within a certain area near the pantry (each pantry usually serves a specific area or region, and going to the one nearest you helps save on time, money, and gas). [17] X Research source So, look online for the pantry nearest to you: FreeFood.org is a great website for locating food pantries in your area. Enter your zip code, and a variety of options will appear on the screen. [18] X Research source FeedingAmerica.org also has a food pantry search tool. Just enter your zip code to find options near you. [19] X Research source Many food pantries tend to be found at churches or community centers, but the need for flexible locations and hours has given rise to mobile pantries that can be found throughout the community."

Some pantries schedule appointments, while others have you wait in line (sometimes for up to 30 minutes, so call ahead if you’re unsure what to expect). Then, you’ll likely need to provide some proof of ID and address and some information about your family’s needs to receive food. Some pantries are set up like grocery stores where you can pick what you want, while others provide premade boxes of food. If you don’t have an ID or proof of address on you, most pantries will still allow you to take food and request you bring your registration information on your next visit. [20] X Research source The most common information a food pantry will ask for includes: Any form of ID (a driver’s license, student ID, or even a Costco membership card can work). Often, IDs from other countries are accepted for immigrants and non-citizens. ID for your children (like a birth certificate or school ID) so you can get items like diapers or formula. Proof of your address, like a signed lease or utility bill with your name and address on it."

For example: Nutritious produce like grapefruit, carrots, spinach, and sweet potato usually go for no more than $1 to $4 at most supermarkets. Grapefruits are a good addition to breakfast, apples and carrots can be used as snacks, spinach can be added to sandwiches or salads, and sweet potatoes can be fried, grilled, or baked as a side dish to many meals. Fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables are often more nutritious than canned ones.

If you go shopping without a specific list, you might get dazzled by “huge deals” that aren't actually that big or find yourself impulse buying items you don’t need (or that sound attractive now but aren’t very filling or satisfying later). So, make a list of exactly what you need and embrace the motto “get in and get out” to avoid overspending. [24] X Research source Try grocery shopping during off-hours when the store is less crowded. Your trip will be faster, and you’ll be more likely to grab what you need and leave than when it’s crowded and you have to move slowly down the aisles."

Chow advises to be on the lookout for coupons, especially those specific to your dietary needs and preferences. Look in paper magazines or advertisements or on sites like Coupons.com , Coupon Sherpa , or The Coupon Marketplace . [25] X Research source When using coupons, try to use them on sale items unless the coupon specifically says it can only be used on full-priced items. Use your $1.00 tuna coupon to buy tuna that's already 2 for 1, for example. [26] X Research source Try to select the brand that is on sale or has the best coupon deal, even if it’s not your usual preference. [27] X Research source Some stores allow you to stack manufacturer and store coupons, so if you have two $1.00 off coupons you can use both on the same item.

      "content": "Shop at discount grocery stores. If you can find a discount grocery store in your area, try to shop there. Chow explains that discount stores buy things like dented cans, overstocked foods, and other items regular retailers might not shelve and sell them for a reduced rate. Sometimes, a local dollar store will have a small grocery section that’s great for items like canned items, condiments, and cheap snacks. Be careful with dented cans. A can with a dent in the seam, a dent where the sides and ends of a can meet, a sharp dent, or a dent that causes bulging or swelling means the can is probably not safe for consumption. Dents at the top of a can are also a bad sign. These dents may mean that the seal could have broken, allowing harmful bacteria to get inside the can."

Even if you can't afford to make a big meal, a simple casserole made from cheap ingredients can serve well as a side dish. Collaborate with other friends or community members you know are also on a budget. They might be interested in doing regular potluck nights a few times a week so everyone saves money. Families with small children might be particularly interested in a regular community potluck as this saves them the time and money of cooking for the night."

Even if you don’t have a backyard or garden, certain fruits, vegetables, and legumes can grow healthily out of pots or planters . You will need to provide your plants with light, however. If you don’t get a lot of natural light from windows or a balcony, many greenhouses and hardware stores sell grow lights that simulate the effect of natural sunlight. [28] X Research source Foods that grow well in pots or containers include beets, cabbage, carrots, cucumbers, eggplants, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onions, peas, peppers, potatoes, radishes, spinach, summer squash, Swiss chard, tomatoes, and winter squash. [29] X Research source Buy seeds at a greenhouse, nursery, or some grocery stores (EBT cards can be used to purchase seeds). Some local libraries also offer free seeds for residents with their library card. Most packs include planting, watering, and light instructions on them that vary based on the plant. In general, you’ll plant seeds a few inches apart in a location where they’ll get several hours of sunlight a day. Water whenever the soil feels dry to the touch. [30] X Research source If growing your own food is not possible, look into community garden projects in your city. If you get involved, you might receive free items from each harvest. Community gardens also might give you a specific plot where you can grow and tend to your own fruits and vegetables."

      "content": "Seek out edible plants in your area. Sometimes, certain spots in a city or town contain fruit trees or edible plants. If the area is a community space or if a fruit-laden branch is hanging over a public sidewalk, it is often legal for you to pick the fruit and greens for your own consumption. [31] X Research source However, local laws may vary. The group Falling Fruit provides an interactive map of a variety of cities. They locate areas where food grows and is legal to forage. [32] X Research source Scope your community when you go out and be on the lookout for edible plants. Ask around if you discover a tree to make sure it falls on community property. If you pick from a tree found on someone's personal residence, you could potentially get in legal trouble. Consider buying a foraging handbook to help you identify safe plant types to eat. It will also teach you how to properly clean and store foraged food. Dumpster diving is a type of foraging where people go to the dumpsters of grocery stores and restaurants to search for recently expired food that's been thrown out. Some areas have banned dumpster diving, so check the regulations in your area. Only take food from dumpsters if it's in a safe plastic wrapping that is unbroken or otherwise damaged."
