While decreased sex drive or other sexual problems can be a side effect of many types of antidepressants, they can also be a complication of the depression itself. Some antidepressants are also more likely than others to interfere with your sex drive. Ask your doctor or psychiatrist how likely it is that your medication is causing your symptoms. The types of antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include: [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Certain SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), such as Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), Luvox (fluvoxamine), Celexa (citalopram), or Zoloft (sertraline). Some tricyclic antidepressants, such as Tofranil (imipramine), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as Nardil (phenelzine).
