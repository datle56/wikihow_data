      "content": "Evaluate the dog for more severe injuries. If your dog has just experienced a traumatic event, take a moment to assess your dog. If your dog has more serious injuries, then you will need to address these first before dealing with the broken leg. If the injury occurred on a road, move the dog to a safe place and then administer emergency first aid. Some things to look for include: Whether or not your dog is alert. If your dog is unconscious, then he may have a head injury. Whether or not your dog can take full breaths. The color of their gums. They should be pink. If they are very pale, muddy, or blueish in color, then your dog is not getting enough oxygen and needs immediate veterinary attention. Strong, synchronous pulses. Feel for the heart beating on the lower chest, near the elbow joint. The femoral pulse is also easy to feel on the inside surface of the thigh, in the middle of the leg. If you cannot find a strong regular pulse, then seek immediate veterinary attention for your dog."

      "title": "Examine the injured leg.",
      "content": "Examine the injured leg. If you see your dog limping, take a look to see which leg is injured. Do a slow, careful examination of the injured leg. The broken leg could be really obvious, such as an exposed, open fracture. In this case, you’ll need to keep the wound clean. If it is a closed fracture, your dog may be limping but there may not be any blood or obvious wound. Whatever type of break, you’ll need to apply first aid and get your dog to the veterinary hospital right away! [1] X Research source Apply pressure if you notice that the limb is bleeding. Since injured dogs can be fearful and aggressive, you’ll need to be careful. Signs of aggression include growling, snapping, snarling, and rigidness. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source To avoid getting bitten, don’t put your hands or face close to the injured dog, especially if it is already agitated. To help keep your dog calm, place a light towel or cloth over their head. This will help to limit light and sound, which may help to keep your dog calm. If you need to move the dog away from the place where the accident occurred, you can use a towel sling to support some of their weight."

You want to wrap the wounds so the bandages are snug but not applying too much pressure. [3] X Research source Secure the bandage with first aid tape. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a clean bandage or gauze, you could use a clean towel. You should be able to fit 2 fingers under the bandage. If you can't, the bandage is too tight and you should rewrap it so it's looser. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Put a leg-splint on your dog. You should prevent the fracture from getting any worse by applying a simple leg-splint. Use a medical splint or, if you don’t have one, a ruler or a spatula will do the trick! The splint should cover the entire area of the fracture and should extend past the joints above and below the fracture. It may go all the way up to where the leg meets the abdomen. Tie the splint to the leg with a bandage and secure it with medical tape at the top and the bottom. [6] X Research source"

Wrap a towel or a blanket around their abdomen. Hold some of their weight with the towel while they walk to the carrier or the car. [7] X Research source An easy way to do this is to pass a large bath towel under your dog’s belly. Hold the end up over his back, like a sling, to support his weight."

      "content": "Restrain your dog in a carrier. Because your dog could move around on the journey to the veterinary hospital, you should restrain them. Lay them down with their injured leg up in the carrier. [8] X Research source Use the carrier to transport them to the hospital by car or taxi. Since injured dogs can become aggressive, you may want to put a muzzle on your dog before taking them to the veterinarian. [9] X Research source However, make sure to remove the muzzle if you feel like it is restricting your dog’s breathing. If you don't have a muzzle on you, you can make one by wrapping gauze or a piece of fabric around your dog's snout and tying a knot so it's snug."

On the way, try to keep your dog warm and comfortable by loosely wrapping them in a towel or blanket. If your dog was involved in a vehicular accident, it is especially important to get them to the hospital quickly because they could have internal injuries in addition to the broken leg. You could ask a friend to comfort your dog in the back seat while you drive. You’ll need professional veterinary treatment. So don’t use ointments on the open fracture, or perform other self-treatments on the dog. Don’t try to re-set the bone yourself. [10] X Research source"

Typically, non-surgical treatment with a cast or a splint will be cheaper than surgical options, although there may be more follow up visits with non-surgical options. [16] X Research source The average cost for treating a broken leg is $2000. See if your veterinarian offers a payment plan or more affordable care options."

While your dog recovers from the broken bone, you’ll need to restrict their movement to a few five-minute walks a day, or just enough to let them eliminate outside each day. Although it is not absolutely necessary, you might want to keep your dog in a crate during this time, so you don’t have to worry about them injuring themselves when you can’t see them. Crates are widely available from pet retailers and sold for the purpose of housebreaking puppies. You don't want a crate that is overly roomy. The general rule is to use a crate that the dog can sit upright in without banging its head. After a few weeks and if your veterinarian approves it, you can start to increase physical activity. Keep your dog away from stairs and slippery surfaces. If you let the dog out of its crate, it may run around and injure itself again!"

Your veterinarian may prescribe a pain medication, which could be a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), a synthetic opioid, or an opioid. You should ask your veterinarian which medication works best and when it will make your dog’s pain go away. You should also ask about side effects of specific drugs.
