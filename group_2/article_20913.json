Prior to performing the injection, it is important that the patch of skin over the muscle where the injection will take place is sterilized and clean. Again, this minimizes the chances of an infection following the injection. [5] X Research source Allow the alcohol to air dry for 30 seconds. Do not touch the area until you give the injection; if you do, you'll just have to clean the area again."

      "title": "Encourage the patient to relax.",
      "content": "Encourage the patient to relax. If the muscle receiving the injection is tense, it will hurt more, so relaxing the muscle as much as possible helps to ensure the least pain felt on injection. [6] X Research source It can sometimes be helpful to distract the patient before injecting by asking them questions about their life. When the patient is distracted, their muscle is more likely to be relaxed. [7] X Research source Some people also prefer to be positioned in a way in which they cannot see the injection taking place. Seeing the needle approaching can cause worry and distress in some, and will result not only in increased anxiety, but also in tensing of the muscle. To help the patient relax, suggest they look in another direction if they want to."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Start by removing the cap, and then insert it smoothly at an angle of 90 degrees to the skin. [9] X Research source If you are just learning to give the injection, do not go too quickly, as you want to ensure you do not push the needle in too far and hit the bone. [10] X Trustworthy Source Immunization Action Coalition Nonprofit organization focused on promoting the use of vaccines by distributing information about vaccines and the diseases they prevent. Go to source About one-third of the needle should remain exposed. [11] X Research source Be careful not to go so fast that you either miss the spot or cause any more damage to the skin than is needed. As you practice and become used to giving the injection, you can increase your speed. The quicker the insertion, the less pain your patient will feel [12] X Research source ; however, you do not want to sacrifice safety for speed. It can be helpful to pull up the skin around the injection site with your non-dominant hand (as your dominant hand will be doing the injection) prior to injecting. [13] X Research source Pulling up the skin can help you mark your target and make it less painful for the patient when the needle goes in."

      "content": "Pull back the plunger before injecting for a dorsogluteal muscle. After injecting the needle but before injecting the medication, pull the plunger back a little. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, it is important because if any blood comes into the syringe when you pull back, it means your needle is located in a blood vessel and not in the muscle. [14] X Research source You will need to begin again with a new needle and syringe if this happens. [15] X Research source You only need to do this for dorsogluteal muscles since you’re close to the gluteal artery. You don’t need to pull the plunger back for any other IM injections. [16] X Research source The medication is designed to be injected into a muscle and not into the bloodstream, so if you see any red color when you pull back you will need to remove the needle and dispose of it. Prepare a new needle and choose a different injection site — don't try to give the shot in the same place. [17] X Research source Most often the needle lands in the muscle itself. Rarely does it land in a blood vessel, but it is always best to be safe rather than sorry prior to injecting."

      "title": "Inject the medication slowly.",
      "content": "Inject the medication slowly. [18] X Research source While it is best to insert the needle quickly to minimize pain, the opposite is true for the actual injection. This is because the medication takes up space in the muscle, and the surrounding tissue will need to stretch to accommodate the added fluid in the space. Injecting slowly gives more time for this to happen and causes the patient less pain. If the skin is stretched flat, that only use a 5 ⁄ 8 in (1.6 cm) needle. If you squeeze and bunch up the muscle around the injection site, then use a 1 in (2.5 cm) needle.

Syringes have three main parts: the needle, barrel, and plunger. The needle goes into the muscle; the barrel has markings, either in cc (cubic centimeters) or mL (milliliters), with numbers next to the markings, and it contains the medicine; the plunger is used to get medicine into and out of the syringe.

      "title": "Know where to give the injection.",
      "content": "Know where to give the injection. The human body has a number of spots that are most receptive. [25] X Research source Vastus Lateralis Muscle (Thigh): Look at your thigh and divide it into three equal parts. The middle third is where the injection would go. The thigh is a good place to give yourself an injection because it is easy to see. It is also a good spot for children younger than three years old. Ventrogluteal Muscle (Hip): To find the correct location, place the heel of your hand on the upper, outer part of the thigh where it meets the buttocks. Point your thumb at the groin and your fingers toward the person's head. Form a V with your fingers by separating your first finger from the other three fingers. You will feel the edge of a bone along the tips of your little and ring fingers. The place to give the injection is in the middle of the V. The hip is a good place for an injection for adults and children older than seven months. Deltoid Muscle (Upper arm muscle): Completely expose the upper arm. Feel for the bone that goes across the top of the upper arm. This bone is called the acromion process. The bottom of it will form the base of the triangle. The point of the triangle is directly below the middle of the base at about the level of the armpit. The correct area to give an injection is in the center of the triangle, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below the acromion process. This site should not be used if the person is very thin or the muscle is very small. Dorsogluteal Muscle (Buttocks): Expose one side of the buttocks. With an alcohol wipe, draw a line from the top of the crack between the buttocks to the side of the body. Find the middle of that line and go up 3 inches (7.6 cm). From that point, draw another line down and across the first line, ending about halfway down the buttock. You should have drawn a cross. In the upper outer square you will feel a curved bone. The injection will go in the upper outer square below the curved bone. Do not use this site for infants or children younger than three years old; their muscles are not developed enough."

For children and babies up to two years old, the thigh muscle is best. For those three years and older, the thigh or deltoid are both viable options. You should be using somewhere between a 22 and a 30 gauge needle (this will largely be determined by the thickness of the medication — your doctor will tell you which gauge to use). [26] X Research source Note: For incredibly small children, a smaller needle is needed. The thigh can also tolerate a larger needle than the arm.

Other times, the medication is in a vial and needs to be drawn up into the syringe. Before administering medication from a vial, make sure you have the right type of medication, it is not expired, and that it is not discolored or has particles floating in the vial. If the vial is new, make sure the seal is not broken. Sterilize the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Hold the syringe with the needle pointed up, the cap still on. Draw the plunger back to the line indicating your dose, filling the syringe with air. Insert the needle through the rubber top of the vial and press the plunger, pushing the air into the vial. With the vial upside-down and the tip of the needle in the medicine, draw the plunger back again to the proper dose (or a little past if there might be air bubbles). Tap the syringe to move any air bubbles to the top, then push them into the vial. Make sure you still have the correct dose in the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial. If you don't plan on using it right away, make sure you cover the needle with the cap."

[30] X Research source When administering an IM injection, the penetrative action of the needle creates a narrow channel, or track, within the tissues. It may be possible for the medication to leak out of the body through this track. Applying the Z-track technique reduces skin irritation and allows for effective absorption by sealing the medication in the muscle tissue."
