      "title": "Apply lemon juice.",
      "content": "Apply lemon juice. Lemon juice is commonly used to lighten hair and can even be added to the white cycle of your laundry as a bleach alternative. You can spot-apply lemon juice to dark spots as a lightening agent, but note that the citric acid is harsh and can irritate your skin. If you want to use lemon juice regularly or over large areas, consider diluting it or creating a gentler paste by mixing it with honey or yogurt. You can mix lemon juice with water in a spray bottle, rub the rind on your skin, or make masks and lotions. No specific way is guaranteed to work faster than any other. Be patient; lightening your skin with lemon takes time. [1] X Research source Don't use lemons on areas that have been recently waxed, shaved, or have cuts."

      "content": "Try a plain yogurt mask. In addition to the fact that yogurt is a very gentle bleaching agent, it contains lactic acid that moisturizes, zinc that combats sunburn, and active cultures that attack harmful bacteria and fungi. In comparison to formulated, exfoliating products, yogurt doesn't exactly come up to snuff. It contains about .9% free acid; it's Alpha Hydroxy Acid levels are considerably lower than most other alternatives. It won't hurt you, but it may not give you the results you're looking for. At the very least, certainly not quickly."

      "content": "Make a baking soda paste. Baking soda is commonly used as a household cleaner and tooth whitener, but it can also lighten skin. Though it is relatively gentle, note that over-applying can have a drying effect; to create a more skin-friendly paste, mix baking soda with honey, apply it as a mask, and let it sit for at least ten minutes. Baking soda is used as an exfoliant. It won't lighten the skin you're in, but it can remove sun-damaged skin cells that have darkened."

      "content": "Wash and exfoliate your skin regularly. This helps remove the outermost layer of skin that is darkened and/or damaged by contact with the sun. Avoid over-exfoliating, however, as this can interfere with you skin’s natural oil production and cause greasiness. [2] X Expert Source Kimberly Tan Licensed Esthetician Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. One cheap and effective homemade exfoliant is brown sugar mixed with honey. On its own, honey can make skin feel remarkably soft; coupled with the gritty sugar texture, the two make for a very effective scrub. As a bonus, honey is an antibacterial agent [3] X Research source that can help keep you from breaking out."

      "content": "Wear a shimmering powder to create the effect of lighter skin. By scattering light, the powder will not only make your skin appear brighter, but also even out blemishes. Baby powder can do this, too. It's light enough to fill in your pores like a powder foundation, but heavy (and white) enough to subtly affect your skin tone. Make sure not to apply too much, though, or you'll end up looking like an 18th-century Geisha."

      "content": "If all else fails, use a skin-lightening cream. Be forewarned, however, that hydroquinone – the active ingredient in many bleaching creams – has been banned in many countries due to studies suggesting that it is carcinogenic. Bearberry (Beta-Arbutin) and kojic acid are also recent trends in skin lightening. However, recently bearberry has been linked to hydroquinone and has also been deemed unsafe [4] X Research source ; kojic acid, on the other hand, has passed its tests. Used at levels of 2% (no higher) in cosmetic products, it's safe. [5] X Expert Source Kimberly Tan Licensed Esthetician Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. Note: in lab testing, skin lightening results were seen at 4%. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
