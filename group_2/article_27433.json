      "content": "Put the milk, sugar, and cocoa powder in a saucepan. Pour 4 cups (950 ml) of milk into a medium saucepan and stir in 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar with 1/4 cup (25 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder. [1] X Research source If you don't have granulated sugar, you can substitute brown sugar, honey, or agave. Keep in mind that since these will add flavor to the hot cocoa, you'll need to add them according to your taste."

      "title": "Simmer the hot cocoa over medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Simmer the hot cocoa over medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk the milk occasionally as it begins to bubble very gently. If it starts to boil, turn the burner down to medium-low. Then, heat the hot cocoa until the cocoa powder and sugar dissolve completely. [2] X Research source Whisking the hot cocoa will help break up the cocoa powder and can make the cocoa a little frothy. It's important to watch the heat as you make hot cocoa. You don't want the milk to boil or it will burn on the bottom of the saucepan."

      "title": "Stir in the vanilla and pour the cocoa into mugs.",
      "content": "Stir in the vanilla and pour the cocoa into mugs. Turn off the burner and stir in 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract or any flavor extract you'd like. For example, try peppermint, almond, or coffee extract. Then, divide the hot cocoa into serving mugs. [3] X Research source To make it easier to pour the cocoa, consider using a ladle to spoon the hot cocoa into the mugs."

      "title": "Top the hot cocoa with marshmallows or whipped cream before serving.",
      "content": "Top the hot cocoa with marshmallows or whipped cream before serving. Although you can enjoy your hot cocoa right away, sprinkle a few mini-marshmallows or dollop some freshly whipped cream on your cocoa for an even sweeter treat. [4] X Research source You can also sprinkle a little ground cinnamon over the hot cocoa or hook a candy cane over the side of the mug."

      "title": "Chop",
      "content": "Chop 4 ounces (112 g) of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate. Put the chocolate bar on a cutting board and carefully chop it into chunks that are no larger than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). The finer the pieces, the faster the chocolate will melt. [5] X Research source You can use any type of chocolate bar you like to customize your hot chocolate. For example, try making hot chocolate with white chocolate or milk chocolate. If you'd like to use a bar of unsweetened chocolate, you will need to add granulated sugar according to your taste."

      "title": "Heat the milk and salt to a simmer over medium heat.",
      "content": "Heat the milk and salt to a simmer over medium heat. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of milk, half-and-half, or cream into a saucepan and turn on the burner. Stir in 2 pinches of salt and heat the milk until small bubbles form on the surface of the milk. Stir the milk occasionally so it doesn't cook on the bottom of the pan. If the milk begins to bubble too much, turn the burner down to medium-low."

    {
      "title": "Whisk in the chopped chocolate.",
      "content": "Whisk in the chopped chocolate. Keep whisking so the hot milk melts the bittersweet or semisweet chocolate. The hot chocolate will be a little lumpy at first but should become smooth once the chocolate melts completely. You can leave the burner on medium until the chocolate melts. Whisking the hot chocolate will make it a little foamy. If you prefer completely smooth hot chocolate, use a wooden spoon to stir the liquid. The amount of time it will take to melt the chocolate will depend on how large you chopped the pieces."

      "title": "Turn off the burner and stir in vanilla.",
      "content": "Turn off the burner and stir in vanilla. Mix 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of vanilla extract into the hot chocolate and taste it. If you'd like an even stronger chocolate flavor, you can whisk in 2 tablespoons (14 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder until it's dissolved. [6] X Research source For a slight coffee flavor, mix in 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of espresso powder along with the vanilla extract. You can also adjust the sweetness at this point, stirring in more sugar if the hot chocolate is too bitter for you."

      "content": "Pour the hot chocolate into mugs and serve them with whipped cream . You can also garnish the whipped cream with chocolate shavings, more cocoa powder, or a dusting of powdered sugar.

Put 2 tablespoons (14 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder into a microwave-safe bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon (12.5 g) of sugar with a pinch of salt.

      "content": "Stir in 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. Slowly pour in just a few spoonfuls of the milk and stir until it mixes with the cocoa to form a smooth paste. Then, gradually stir in the rest of the milk so there aren't any lumps. [9] X Research source For creamier hot cocoa, use cream or half-and-half instead of milk."

Then, stir in 1 ⁄ 4 teaspoon (1.2 ml) of vanilla extract and begin sipping your hot cocoa. [11] X Research source You can add a handful of mini-marshmallows to the mug just before you're ready to drink the cocoa."
