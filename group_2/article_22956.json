      "content": "The idea is to provide a source of income while you create. To start using Patreon as a creator, all you need to do is create an account and start releasing content, such as videos, art, or snippets of your writing. Fans of your work can then sign up to become “patrons.” Patrons support creators by paying a monthly subscription fee or pledging a set amount of money per post. [1] X Research source Since income for Patreon creators is entirely donation-based, it’s up to the creator to bring in patrons. You’ll need to advertise your Patreon page on your social media accounts or reach out to your friends and ask them to join. [2] X Research source Patreon is not really designed to help a creator expand their fanbase. Instead, it provides an easy way for an established fanbase to directly support their favorite creators."

      "content": "You can choose to make content public or exclusive to patrons. Types of media that you can publish on Patreon include text posts, images, videos, livestreams, and audio recordings. As a patron, you can also choose who sees the content—for instance, you might make certain content available only to people who signed up for a specific membership tier. [3] X Research source To post content on your Patreon page, select Post , then New from the sidebar menu. From there, choose the type of content you’d like to post. Follow the prompts to upload content, such as an image or audio file, or simply type into the text box. If you’re posting a video, you’ll need to host it on another site, such as Vimeo or Streamable. You can then follow the instructions to embed the video on Patreon when you make your video post. [4] X Research source You can also choose whether to publish your content immediately, or select Schedule to set an automatic release date for the post."

      "content": "Creators can offer different tiers of support for patrons. Depending on how much a patron is willing to pay per month—or per post—they can get access to different rewards set by the creator. For example, an artist might offer access to exclusive video tutorials to patrons at the lower tiers, and draw commissions for patrons who sign up at a higher tier. [10] X Research source To make a tier and set the associated benefits, log into your Patreon account and click the Edit your page button at the top of the page. From there, select Tiers and then Add tier . Follow the prompts to customize each tier. [11] X Research source To support a creator as a patron, navigate to their page on Patreon and hit the Select button under the support tier you want to sign up for. Follow the prompts to enter your payment information and start making payments. [12] X Research source Not all creators offer membership tiers. In these cases, patrons have more freedom to choose how much they pay per month. The default recommendation is $5 USD, but you can pay as little as $1 per month."

      "title": "There’s no upfront fee to sign up for Patreon.",
      "content": "There’s no upfront fee to sign up for Patreon. As a creator, you can sign up for a Lite, Pro, or Premium plan. While it’s free to sign up for any of these plans, Patreon will take a larger cut of your profits if you choose a higher-level plan. This is called the “platform fee.” In addition to the platform fee, Patreon also takes a small percentage of each pledge as a processing fee. [15] X Research source Platform fees are taken as a percentage of your monthly income. The percentages are 5% for the “Lite” plan, 8% for the “Pro” plan, and 12% for the “Premium” plan. [16] X Research source Processing fees vary slightly depending on factors like your preferred currency and the amount of each pledge. For instance, the processing fee for pledges over $3 USD is 2.9%, plus an additional $0.30 per pledge. For pledges under $3, the fee is 5%, plus an additional $0.10 per successful pledge. [17] X Research source The fees for other currencies supported by Patreon are similar, generally ranging from around 3-5% plus 10-35 cents per pledge. For non-US patrons using PayPal, an additional 1% fee will be taken from each pledge. [18] X Research source Depending on where you live and how much money you bring in from Patreon, you may also need to pay taxes on your income."
