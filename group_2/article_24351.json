      "title": "Start the interview with light conversation.",
      "content": "Start the interview with light conversation. While doing so, establish the character of the questioned person. This may involve their occupation, musical preferences, family, etc. During this preliminary chat look for signs if the person is nervous and scared, prone to bragging, confident or not. Mark their level of intelligence and adapt to it."

      "content": "Switch to the subject of the questioning abruptly. This way you'll be able to notice the interviewed person's reaction. Remember that in 9 out of 10 cases the first impressions are the most correct."

      "content": "Let the interrogated person tell you their story without interrupting them. Look for inconsistencies. Being too detailed often shows the person has been prepared for questioning and has had the time to make their story up. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Have another person enter the room shortly after the interviewed person has finished their story. Your associate must pretend to say something in your ear. Give the interviewed person a short look and excuse yourself."

      "content": "Return in about 20 minutes. At this time the suspect should be worried as to what has happened during your leave."

      "content": "Take about 5 minutes during which you may rearrange things on your desk, or scribble something on a scrap of paper. Then proceed to ask the suspect about the inconsistent points in his story."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for details.",
      "content": "Ask for details. Some questions, like the color of a hit-and-run vehicle are easy to answer and the suspect saying they don't remember is an obvious attempt to conceal something. On the other hand, it would be strange for the interrogated person to have seen or remember the license number, so answering this question would show them having thought the whole thing over.

      "content": "Be careful about the details. For example, if the hit-and-run has been driving on the suspect's side of the road(assuming you're in a right-side traffic country), it's strange for the suspect to say the car had a scratch on the left side. How have they seen it? These little details most often reveal a liar."
