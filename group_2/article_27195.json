      "content": "Use your fingers to pull apart some wool into tufts. Do not cut the wool into tufts. This will create sharp edges and make it difficult to felt. Also, be sure to get pure wool and not acrylic; acrylic fibers will not felt. Many crafters will recommend Merino wool for its fine fibers. [1] X Research source The wool does not have to be naturally colored! Consider getting some dyed wool!"

      "content": "Lay the tufts out on a baking sheet, overlapping each row like scales on a fish. Make sure that the fibers are all going in the same direction. You do not have to cover the entire baking sheet; an 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square will be plenty. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one.",
      "content": "Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one. For example, if all the tufts were going up-and-down in the first layer, make all the tufts go side-to-side in this layer. You can also experiment with using a different color of wool for this layer. Be sure to use a color that complements the first one, however, or you might get a muddy result."

      "title": "Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet.",
      "content": "Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet. Remember to alternate the direction in which the fibers are going with each layer. Two layers is perfectly fine for a thin piece of felt, but if you'd like something thicker, aim for three or four layers total. Consider adding some pieces of loose-weave fabric or bits of Merino yarn on top for color and texture. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the layers with a piece of tulle or sheer polyester fabric.",
      "content": "Cover the layers with a piece of tulle or sheer polyester fabric. This will help keep the fibers in place during the felting process. The fabric needs to be big enough to cover the entire wool sheet."

      "content": "Make your felting solution and pour it into a spray bottle. Keep the rest of the felting solution handy to refill the bottle as needed. You will need 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 1 quart (950 milliliters) of hot water. Don't shake the bottle, or you will create too many suds. [4] X Research source The hotter the water is, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that it is uncomfortable to work with, however."

      "content": "Spray the wool down, then gently massage it with a piece of soapy bubble wrap. Don't be tempted to pour the water onto the wool. This will cause the fibers to move around too much. Instead, spray it down with your hot, soapy water until it is completely saturated (but not dripping). Ball up some bubble wrap, rub it over a piece of bar soap, then gently massage the felt using small, circular motions. [5] X Research source If you accidentally soaked the wool, use a small sponge to mop up the excess water. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "When the wool is ready, transfer it to a sheet of bubble wrap and peel off the tulle or polyester fabric. You can tell if the wool is ready by doing a simple pinch test. Pinch a piece of the wool between your thumb and forefinger. If it stays in place and doesn't come off, you can move on the to the next step. If it lifts away, then continue pressing the wool. The bubble wrap needs to be textured side up."

Next, roll the wool up as tightly as you can along with the bubble wrap, starting from the bottom. Press down as you roll the wool to drain off any excess water."

Gently press down onto the felt sheet to squeeze out the excess water. Do not wring or twist it. [8] X Research source Consider adding a splash of white vinegar to the water. [9] X Research source This will remove excess soap and restore the natural pH of the wool; it will brighten the wool's colors and help it last longer."

You can use natural, uncolored wool, or wool that has been dyed bright colors. The size of the tufts doesn't really matter, but a 4 to 5-inch long (10 to 12 centimeters) tuft will give you a bead about the size of a cherry. [10] X Research source"
