      "title": "Begin with a square sheet.",
      "content": "Begin with a square sheet. [1] X Research source In the vast majority of cases, the most accessible plastic bag will be a shopping bag. These are extremely common place, and large enough to pick up air. First cut the bag so that it can lay flat on a surface. Next, using scissors or a precision knife, cut the largest square you can from the material. The larger your parachute, the slower it will fall. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Triple fold the square and cut it into a circle.",
      "content": "Triple fold the square and cut it into a circle. [3] X Research source First fold the square diagonally so that it becomes a triangle. Next, fold the triangle in half using one of the long ends as the divider. This should result in a much thinner triangle. Repeat the same fold to your thin triangle. Once you have your third fold, cut the wide end off with scissors. This will cut all the degrees of the circumference at once. Once you have accomplished this, unfold the plastic to reveal your circle. Alternatively, you can cut the corners off the square to make an octagon shape. Any additional amount of angles is good; what's important is that it starts to resemble a circle. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make six marks around the circle.",
      "content": "Make six marks around the circle. [5] X Research source Use a compass protractor and mark dots 60 degrees apart from each other. You should make marks with permanent marker to ensure the highest visibility. These marks will ultimately become the holes for your parachute strings. Six marks is optimal because it allows for the parachute to hold its shape and isn't overly complicated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the marks.",
      "content": "Tape the marks. [6] X Research source Taping over your marks will make the holes sturdier. Take a small square for each hole from a roll of paper tape and run it over the top and bottom of the hole. Because the tape holds its form better than the bag will, it will give you an easier time when it comes to stringing up the parachute."

    {
      "title": "Punch holes through marks with a nail.",
      "content": "Punch holes through marks with a nail. [7] X Research source Take a nail and push through your assigned marks. Because the plastic is fairly fragile, you won't need much force to do this. Hold up the bag and push it gently through. If the nail you're using is large, don't push it through all the way. The parachute holes should be just big enough for the strings to fit through."

    {
      "title": "Make six equal pieces of string.",
      "content": "Make six equal pieces of string. [8] X Research source String will allow you to tie a weight to the plastic bag, transforming it into a parachute. Cut out six equal pieces of string. The string should be thin enough to fit through the holes you created in the plastic bag. A foot of string should suffice, provided the parachute is the size of a regular shopping bag. It's a good idea to place the strings up against one another to ensure they're the same length. When you prop them up all in a row, you can cut off parts of any string that protrude from the rest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the strings through each of their holes.",
      "content": "Tie the strings through each of their holes. Run each piece of string through their respective holes and tie them each in a small knot on the parachute's roof. When you are done, each of the taped holes you made should be filled with their own string. Try to keep your knots consistent. Different knots may result in different lengths for the strings."

      "content": "Attach a screw and nut. [9] X Research source Take each of your strings and wrap them around a screw where the body meets the base. In order to secure these strings, fix a nut on the screw and turn it around until the strings are caught in the middle. This screw will give your parachute some much-needed weight to work with."

      "content": "Decorate your parachute. Although some people are fine to leave their parachutes bare, others may enjoy decorating theirs with patterns and colour. Because you'll be throwing your parachute up in the sky, adorn the parachute with eye-grabbing colours. Detailed designs won't be picked up by the human eye from a distance, so it's best to keep your decorations simple. Coloured marker is perfect for decorating your parachute."

      "title": "Throw it high in the air.",
      "content": "Throw it high in the air. [10] X Research source The best way to see a parachute in action is to drop it from an altitude. Alternatively, you can throw the screw high in the air. The parachute will catch air and slow the descent. Dropping it down from a higher altitude will give the parachute more time in the air."

      "title": "Make a small hole in the parachute's center to make it fall straighter.",
      "content": "Make a small hole in the parachute's center to make it fall straighter. [11] X Research source Punching a small hole in the center of your parachute will guide the air through the center. This has the effect of straightening your parachute's descent. If you don't have a hole, it will be much more likely to float off course. Straightening the parachute is ultimately optional, but it is valid to keep in mind if you're dissatisfied with the way your parachute is gliding. The marks should be placed a centimetre into the plastic bag from the outer perimeter."

      "title": "Wrap the string around the screw when storing your parachute.",
      "content": "Wrap the string around the screw when storing your parachute. [12] X Research source The strings on your parachute will knot easily if you don't store it in the right way. Take the strings and wrap them around the screw weight. When the strings are secured, you can fold in the plastic bag. Take care to treat the parachute gently; any rips or tears could ruin the parachute completely. If you do end up ripping par of the parachute, you may be able to save it by taping the rip shut. The parachute won't likely work as well as it used to, but it should be able to pick up air all the same."
