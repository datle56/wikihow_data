      "content": "Add 1-2 cups (185-370 g) of uncooked rice to your blender. Use your favorite type of rice to make flour, as white, brown, and glutinous rice (sticky or sweet rice) all work great as flour. Just add 1-2 cups (185-370 g) of uncooked rice to your blender at a time so the rice doesn’t clog your machine. Working with smaller amounts at a time helps the blender work more efficiently and grind the rice into a finer consistency. [1] X Research source 1 cup (185 g) of uncooked rice yields about 1 ½ cups (278 g) of rice flour. If you don’t have a blender, use a food processor instead. Optionally, soak your rice in water for 5 minutes to get rid of any dust and debris. Then, spread it on a towel and let it air dry until it’s crunchy. Like white and brown rice, glutinous rice does not contain gluten. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Blend the rice for 1-2 minutes, or until it is a fine powder. Put the lid on your blender and turn it on to its highest setting. Simply blend the rice for about 1 to 2 minutes, or until it’s turned into a fine powder and has a mostly uniform consistency. [5] X Research source If your blender stars to feel hot, turn it off and let it cool down for several minutes before blending more rice. Blending the rice very finely helps it combine with other ingredients. Coarse rice flour can make recipes come out textured and inconsistent. If you plan on making a lot of rice flour, invest in a high-quality blender. Blending rice is hard on your blender's blades."

      "content": "Add 2-3 tbsp (23-35 g) of uncooked rice into the coffee grinder. Coffee grinders also blend rice into a fine consistency, just like blenders and food processors. Just measure out the total amount of uncooked rice you want to blend. Then, add 2-3 tbsp (23-35 g) of uncooked rice to the grinder at a time. This prevents your coffee grinder from getting clogged or overheated. [8] X Research source Clean your coffee grinder before you add the rice so it doesn’t take on a coffee flavor. Just use a small brush or spatula to wipe out the grounds."

Just set your machine to its finest setting, which might be labeled “Fine,” or “Pastry.” Then, flip the grain mill’s power switch to turn it on."

As it passes through the hopper, it is automatically ground into a fine powder and deposited into the attached canister. If any rice gets caught in the hopper, use a spoon to push the rice down into the grinder. [11] X Research source Most grain mills make a high-pitched sound when it's finished grinding the rice. Let the mill run for an extra 5 seconds after it’s finished grinding to make sure no stray pieces of rice are lodged inside."

Hook the canister back into the mill, turn the mill on, and pour the rice flour back into the hopper. Running the flour through the mill a second time grinds it up even finer for a more consistent texture. [12] X Research source Use a spoon or spatula to push the flour through the grinder, if necessary. Turn off the grain mill once it’s finished grinding the flour."

Grinding rice into flour generates heat, whether you’re using a blender, food processor, coffee grinder, or grain mill. So, let the flour cool down to room temperature. Then, pour the flour into a glass or plastic storage container or jar that has an airtight lid. [13] X Research source Label your container with the date you made the flour as well as what type of rice you used. This keeps track of how old the flour is and when it might go bad. Alternatively, seal the rice flour in a plastic bag. Just squeeze out any excess air before you close it. Exposing the flour to air can cause it to spoil faster."
