      "content": "Be emotionally supportive . Everyone wants to know that they are loved and appreciated. Encourage your friends to follow their dreams, especially if no one else will. Find a way to tell them how much they mean to you, even if you have to do it casually or inconspicuously. Be caring and compassionate in all your dealings. Just being there for your friends, whether they’re having a major life struggle or just ranting about their work situation, can be the best thing you can do to make them happier. Another way to be emotionally supportive is to let your friends know when they’re being self-destructive. If they’re in a bad relationship, making poor life choices, or squandering their talents, find a gentle way to discuss it with them. Whether or not they listen is up to them, but at least you took the time to be honest."

      "content": "Cheer them up when they’re down. Smile at them and, if you have a warm relationship with the person, hug them . Do something fun like building a blanket fort , hosting a sleepover , or making silly putty — especially if you’re “too old” for such things. Put together a little collection of adorable pictures, videos, and gifts and dare the person not to feel better after taking a look. Of course, being silly won’t make a person happier in every situation, but it’s worth a shot. Your friend will appreciate that you’re really willing to put in hard work to make him smile. If your friend is really sad, then sometimes the best way to cheer him up is just to be there for him, as a shoulder to cry on. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to come up with a ridiculous activity to make your friend feel better, if the mood isn’t right. Sometimes, even after lots of talking and hugs and cuddles, the person still will be in a bad mood. With certain types people it actually helps to get sad about them being sad. If they're the empathetic kind, it'll drive them crazy to see you sad and they'll try to fix it. And usually when they do, their mood will improve as well, and sometimes more than what you yourself are capable of."

      "content": "Be a good listener . One easy way to make somebody feel appreciated and validated is to simply hear them out. Try to understand their thoughts and be in their shoes. Ask thoughtful questions, don’t interrupt, and if you don’t understand something, say something instead of playing along. You may have a friend who feels like he doesn’t get enough attention and who really needs a kind ear, and you can make that person happier by being there and making an effort to really listen. To truly listen to your friend, turn your body toward him, make eye contact , and don’t give unsolicited advice. Make your friend see that you’re fully focused and are there to help make your friend’s life better, not to pass judgment. Put your phone away when your friend is talking to show that you are giving your friend the attention he deserves. Reader Poll: We asked 141 wikiHow readers how they like to cheer someone up, and 55% of them said listening and affirming their feelings without any judgment or criticism. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Give a meaningful gift. Take the time out to pick out a special gift that is suitable for the person. The more thought you put into the gift, the better it is from the point of being an expression of positive energy and consideration. Get your friend something that he or she would really like or need instead of getting something random; it could be a rare album that your friend would love, or a first edition of your friend’s favorite novel. Making an effort to find something truly unique for your friend will make your friend feel instantly happy. Though giving your friend a meaningful gift on her birthday or during the holidays can make a positive impression, sometimes nothing can make a person happier than a random gift given without a special occasion."

[1] X Research source People don’t call each other just to chat nearly as often as they used to. Make your friend happy by calling without wanting a single thing.

      "content": "Help out a friend just because. Another way to make a friend happy is to offer some help. This doesn’t mean you have to do anything super intense, or to help out only during dark times either. If your friend is having a busy day, pick up lunch for him or her or offer to walk his dog that morning. You can give your friend a ride to work if you know his car is in the shop, or help him put together that IKEA table that’s been leaning against his wall for weeks. Even making an effort to help out with the small things can bring a smile to your friend’s face. Some of your friends may be resistant to asking for help even when they need it. Work on making them see that you genuinely do want to help them, and they’ll be more eager to accept. BY offering your help, they will also be more likely to accept. Be observant .

Leave the note on your friend’s doorstep, in your friend’s mailbox, or even sneak it inside a book your friend is reading. The element of surprise can make your friend even happier."

Even white lies can feel like little betrayals. Make sure your actions always reflect your words – and vice versa. If you want to make your parents happy, then one of the best things you can do is to be worthy of their trust. Your parents may spend a lot of time worrying that you’re not being open with them.

You can also invite them to get out for a while by going bowling , swimming , or doing something else fun and active. Family time doesn’t have to be boring, and it can be just as fun as you want it to be, whether you go check out a new Italian restaurant or play charades . Your parents will want to spend time with you more than anything else, and being around them more will make them very happy.

Pick a weekly night for family time, whether it’s every Sunday or every other Wednesday. Plugging family time into your routine will definitely make your parents happy. The key thing with spending time with your parents is that you should act like you want to be there, not like you’re just doing it to make them happy and wishing you could be with your friends instead."

Let’s face it: it’s all too common for parents to get taken for granted, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay. Step outside the expected mold and make an effort to show them that you care. Remember that your parents aren’t just parents; they’re people with their own goals, feelings, and needs. They aren’t “required” to take care of you; they made a choice to care, and you should be appreciative of that."

One way to make your parents happy is to make an effort to be a happy person yourself, whether it means finding love, a meaningful career, or pursuing a hobby that makes you happy.

[3] X Research source It’s all too easy to call your parents to complain about your job or other annoying aspects of your life. However, you should call them to talk about the things you like, too.

Your parents will really appreciate the extra effort you’re making and they’ll be happier as a result.

Just giving your parents a hug or a kiss before you go to school will make a difference in their days. When your parents come home from work, don’t just stay in your room and greet them from the other side of the house. Make an effort to come down, give them a big hug, and ask about their day."

If you’re having a busy day, even a text message saying hi and asking how they’re doing can make a huge difference.

Pick the person a flower, help them carry their groceries, or offer to do something big like help them move. Being kind just for the sake of kindness will bring you good karma and will make the rest of your day better, too. Look around you.
