      "content": "Many Linux distributions come with a graphical package manager that makes installing software a breeze. These GUI tools make it easy to browse apps by category as well as search for what you need. Depending on your Linux version's software tool, you may be able to check out reviews from other users, see screenshots, and read descriptions of programs before installing. Using your distribution's software manager and repositories (which are remote servers that host software packages) ensures you'll always get the right version of the software for your version of Linux. Ubuntu: Use the Ubuntu Software app to install programs from packages. You'll find it on the Dock or by searching for software in the Activities search bar. [1] X Research source Linux Mint: Use Software Manager, which comes with the Cinnamon desktop environment, to install applications and Flatpak packages. You'll find it in your menu under Administration > Software Manager , or by typing software manager into the search bar. Any distribution using the GNOME desktop environment: If you're using Debian , Fedora, or any other Linux distribution and have the GNOME desktop environment, you can use the GNOME Software tool to install applications from your distribution's repositories, as well as Flatpak and Snap packages. Just type software and clicking Software on the Activities screen. Any distribution using the KDE desktop environment: Similar to GNOME, KDE has a software center called Discover. [2] X Research source With Discover, you can install applications from your distribution's own repositories, as well as Flatpak packages, Snaps, Plasma add-ons, and AppImages from store.kde.org.

Software available in your distribution's Software tool will not always be the most current, as it can take a while for software updates to make it to these more commercial repositories. Fortunately, you can use tools like Advanced Packaging Tool (Apt) (for Ubuntu and Debian-based systems) and DNF or Yum (on RPM-based systems like RedHat and Fedora) to find newer versions of software from a wider variety of repositories. If you're using Ubuntu, you can add PPA (Personal Package Archive) repositories using the Apt tool, as well as in Ubuntu Software in Other Software > Add . [4] X Research source If you want the flexibility of Apt without having to learn a bunch of commands, you can use Synaptic , a graphical front-end to Apt. You can also try Flatpak or Snapcraft , both of which have web-based browsing tools that make it easy to browse for and install software for any Linux distro."

[5] X Research source You can use apt or apt-get in any of the following commands interchangeably, as they do the same thing. apt-get is the older way of using the apt command, but it still works.

DNF (and Yum) install .RPM packages, which are the standard package types on all of these Linux versions. Yum was the default package manager for RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, and CentOS until the release of DNF. [6] X Research source The two package managers have identical syntax—typically, when you see instructions for using yum to install packages, you can simply swap out yum with dnf in your command. Because DNF is an improved version of Yum, you'll want to use DNF instead of Yum unless DNF isn't available on your older system. If you downloaded a .RPM package from the web, you can use DNF or Yum to install it. To do so, just use the command sudo dnf install packagename.rpm ."
