Just place a drop of glue on the earring post and press the bead against it, holding it for a minute while the glues sets. To make flower studs, cut out eight circles (each one slightly smaller from the last) from the colored net fabric. Layer the circles one on top of the other to form a flower pattern, then use a threaded needle to sew a small bead onto the center of the flower. Secure the flower with a couple of stitches at the back. Place a dot of glue on the earring post and stick the flower on top. The easiest option is just to cover the face of the earring post in some gold, silver or colored glitter glue and wait for it to dry. Then you have a simple sparkly earring!"
