      "content": "Wear a bit of makeup if you'd like to. Don't wear too much, just enough to make you feel comfortable. Some makeup that looks good on middle schoolers is: A little mascara. This makes your eyelashes longer and boys are more likely to notice you. Try some concealer if you have dark under-eye circles or acne. Wear lip gloss or a light shade of lip-stick. Don't wear dark red lipstick; it makes you look too adult. Scented body lotions and perfumes are great, but avoid using too much. However, it is also okay to not wear makeup if that is what you choose."

      "title": "Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself.",
      "content": "Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself. Dress in clothes that make you feel beautiful and confident. For some people that might be a simple pair of jeans and a t-shirt, and for others it might be a flowy sundress. The more confidence and positive energy you radiate, the more people will be drawn to you. [2] X Research source Make sure your clothes are clean and neat. Wrinkles and coffee stains are not so cute."

      "content": "Talk to single guys in class. Are there a few cute, single boys in your classes? Take action and start conversations with them to see if you connect. If their desks are near yours, this will be a little easier, but you can always chat them up before or after class, too. Starting a conversation might be intimidating, but all you have to do is comment on something related to the class! If the classroom is freezing, you could say something like, “Are you cold? This classroom feels like the arctic.” [3] X Research source You could also ask them for help. You might ask, “Can I borrow a pencil?” or “Did you happen to catch the homework assignment?”"

      "content": "Go to parties and other social events. A great way to meet potential boyfriends is to put yourself out there! Go to your classmates’ parties and attend school functions, like football games and pep rallies. The more boys you meet, the more likely you are to find the right one for you. [4] X Research source To make the most out of the social events you attend, you can’t stay huddled in a circle with your friends the entire time. If you see someone you like, start a casual conversation with them by commenting on something around you. [5] X Research source For example, you could say, “I love this song! Do you know it?” If he’s a fan too, you already have something in common!"

      "content": "Ask your friends to help you meet boys. Your friends may know some cute single guys, so ask them if they can introduce you.

Sit next to him at lunch, on the bus, in class, or at the football game. Of course, it’s best not to sit next to him all the time--you might scare him away. However, sitting next to him now and then will give him a hint. You can even save him a seat if you’re feeling extra bold!"

You should also make eye contact, smile, and do a little playful teasing! [8] X Research source Say something funny like, “Wow, you’re pretty good at soccer...almost as good as my little sister!” [9] X Research source Make sure you keep the teasing lighthearted. If it seems like you’re hurting his feelings, back off."

      "content": "Use social media to flirt. Like his photos on Instagram, tag him in funny memes, and keep up your Snapchat streak. Moderation is key, though. Liking posts from months ago and sending him an endless stream of Snapchats may look a little creepy."

      "title": "Keep your texts fun and casual.",
      "content": "Keep your texts fun and casual. You shouldn’t be in constant communication with your crush, or you could seem clingy. Instead, text him every of couple days talking about something funny that happened at school or wishing him luck on his baseball game. Don’t appear too eager when responding to his messages. Play hard-to-get by waiting a few minutes to respond to some of them. Make sure you're texting each other equally. If you’re always the one who has to initiate the conversation, it’s a bad sign."

[11] X Research source You could say, “Hey, do you want to come over tonight? My family is having a game night, and it’s always super fun!” Make sure you ask your parents before making plans outside of school with your crush."

      "content": "Be upfront about your feelings. If you think he’s interested and you want to start a relationship, it’s important to be honest about your emotions. No matter how obvious you think you’re being, your crush isn’t a mind reader. You don’t have to declare your undying love for him, but you should tell him that you’re interested in something more than friendship. [12] X Research source You might say, “I really like you, and I’d love to get to know you better.” Try to do this in a private situation so it’s easier for both of you to communicate honestly and openly."

If he avoids you, seems bored when you’re together, declines your invitations to hang out, or seems to care more about chasing other girls, he may not be the one for you. [13] X Research source Rejection can hurt, but there are tons of guys out there. Let yourself feel sad for a bit, then brush it off and meet some new guys who appreciate you for you."
