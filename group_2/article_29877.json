      "title": "See if you like the sleeveless look before you start cutting.",
      "content": "See if you like the sleeveless look before you start cutting. Roll up the sleeves as high as you can, or tuck them into the shirt around the seam to see if it looks good as a sleeveless T-shirt. Optionally, place sewing pins in the sleeves and put the T-shirt on to see if you like where they sit on your shoulders. If you’re planning on cropping the shirt, roll the bottom of the hem up inside to see where you’d like it to lay."

      "content": "You can either cut the seam out of the sleeves or leave it in. Leaving the seam intact will keep your finished T-shirt from unraveling or looking shabby. It will also make a smaller armhole. Cutting out the seam with the sleeve gives a more casual, halter-top look, and because the hole is larger, it can make the shirt a little more comfortable, too. [1] X Research source For a baggy T-shirt, keeping the seam on the shirt might be a good approach. If you want to turn your T-shirt into a muscle shirt, plan to cut the seams out. [2] X Research source To make cap sleeves, mark a line from the bottom of the sleeve straight up, with the top of the line about 2 in (5.1 cm) out from the seam. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the T-shirt out on a flat surface and outline your desired cut.",
      "content": "Lay the T-shirt out on a flat surface and outline your desired cut. If you’re cutting out the seam, mark a line 1 in (2.5 cm) in from the seam with chalk or an erasable pen . Curve around the seam so that the line ends at a right angle about 1 in (2.5 cm) under the sleeve. [4] X Research source To keep the seam, make a line about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the outside of the seam. [5] X Research source If you want to keep the seam without hemming the edge, make the line 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) from the outside of the seam. Optionally, pin both sides of the seam on each sleeve together to make sure they stay even when you start cutting. If you want to crop the shirt, mark a line straight across the bottom where you’d like the hem to lay. [6] X Research source Try not to mark a straight diagonal line from the top of the shoulder down to the side of the shirt. This can create a very large armhole that changes the shape of the shirt.

      "title": "Hold the fabric taut and carefully cut the sleeve off.",
      "content": "Hold the fabric taut and carefully cut the sleeve off. Pull the fabric tight around the marked area as you cut. Follow the marks you made in the last step in an even line around the sleeve. Cut as smoothly as you can without stopping to make your cut clean. Cut along any additional marks you made along the bottom of the shirt, too. For a more jagged punk look, cut around the bottom of the neckline on both sides of the T-shirt. [8] X Research source Repeat on the other sleeve. Alternatively, fold the T-shirt in half before you cut the sleeves off for a more even cut on both sides. [9] X Research source The leftover sleeves can be used as headbands, rags, or mini handbags or you can cut them into squares and use them for quilts or other sewing projects."

      "content": "Fold the edge of the sleeve inside the shirt and stitch it in place. To prevent the sleeves of your shirt from curling in or fraying, fold the edge of the fabric 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) inside the sleeve and pin it down. With a sewing machine or by hand, sew 2 straight lines next to each other around the ends of both sleeves to attach the hem . [10] X Research source If you cropped your shirt, do the same along the bottom to prevent it from rolling up. You can also gently stretch out the sleeves (and any other part of the shirt you cut) to smooth the edges and help prevent the threads from unraveling. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut holes into the fabric with scissors or a box cutter. To make your shirt look distressed and worn-in, hold a pair of scissors open or use a box cutter to create small sporadic cuts in the hem and on the front and back of your shirt. To make slightly larger holes, pinch the fabric and cut straight into the fold. Stretch the hole out a little bit with your fingers to prevent fraying. [12] X Research source For a more punk look, stick safety pins over any distressed holes you made."
