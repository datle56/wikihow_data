      "content": "Caesar cut Named for Julius Caesar himself (who apparently began wearing his hair this way when his hairline started to recede), this hairstyle is short all around, but with short, horizontally straight bangs. Perfect for disguising your forehead and making it seem a tad shorter. You can also easily add product (like mousse or pomade ) to create volume and texture, giving your hair a fuller look and drawing attention away from your forehead."

      "content": "Textured crop This trendy style is perfect for drawing attention away from your hairline or forehead. Short sides and back and longer (2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm)) hair on top, with lots of choppy layers for added texture , will grab people’s attention for sure!

      "title": "Side part",
      "content": "Side part Almost everyone looks great with a side-part . This timeless hairstyle is dignified and professional-looking, but it’s also not out of place in more casual, low-key environments. Best of all, it can partially hide a large forehead or cover up a bald spot or receding hairline. The side part is also versatile: you can add some texture with pomade or a sea salt spray for a fuller bedhead look (perfect for a fun night out), or keep it short and smooth for a more reserved, profesh vibe. Or, give the classic look a fresh spin by getting a hard part with a fade."

      "title": "Blowout fade",
      "content": "Blowout fade With a blowout fade, you have a temple or low fade around the sides and back of your head, with lots of hair left on top, which you can texture or volumize into a pompadour for extra volume, or slick back for a sleeker look. The pompadour will help make your forehead look a little smaller by comparison, but either one looks nice!"

      "title": "Side-swept undercut",
      "content": "Side-swept undercut With a classic undercut , the hair on the sides and back of your head is buzzed short or shaved, while the hair on top is drastically longer. [2] X Research source If you’ve got enough hair up top, you can easily sweep it to the side for a trendy side-swept undercut. Style the hair up top into a fro or pompadour for more texture and boldness. It’ll catch people’s eye—which will detract from your forehead. Don’t have long enough hair on top, or don’t want to keep your hair long? Try a side-swept fade : while with an undercut there’s a drastic difference between the longer hair on top and shorter hair on the sides, with a fade, your hair gradually tapers on the sides and back for a subtler look."

      "title": "Clean shave",
      "content": "Clean shave A clean shave may sound counterintuitive if you want to cover up a receding hairline or big forehead, but actually, it’s genius. If nobody can tell where your hairline begins, nobody will suspect your hairline is receding or that your forehead is a tad larger than average. Plus, it’s a sleek, dignified look!"

      "title": "Long bangs",
      "content": "Long bangs If you have longer hair, consider long bangs to hide your forehead or frame it to make it look smaller. Tousled, messy bangs hanging in your eyes will give you a casual but slightly dangerous vibe, while straight, smooth bangs look more professional. Either way, it’ll help cover your hairline and forehead."

While it’s probably too short to cover a large forehead, it can be super effective if you’ve got bald spots or thinning hair: while the hair on top is left a little longer, the hair on the sides and back is close cut, making it easier to disguise your hairline."

      "title": "Brushed-up",
      "content": "Brushed-up This one is similar to the side-sweep in that it involves you keeping the top of your hair longer and the sides and back trimmed, and parting your hair to one side to emphasize the length and volume. However, unlike a traditional side-sweep, with a brush-up, you style the hair on top with a blow-dryer and a round brush to create a more rounded, full shape. For a variation on the brush-up, try a quiff , in which you style only the front of the hair, rather than the whole top of your head, as you do with a brush-up."

      "content": "Long and layered Growing your hair long and adding layers for volume and texture can not only cover up your forehead or receding hairline, but distract from it as well. There are tons of ways to style long hair , from down and loose to up in a casual ponytail or half-ponytail. The options are pretty endless!"

      "content": "A forehead that’s 5 or more fingers wide may be considered large. Hence the term “fivehead.” A forehead that’s proportional to the rest of the face is typically about the width of 3-4 of your fingers. A big forehead could be caused by a number of factors, including: Genetics: If people in your family have a larger forehead or receding hairline, you may too. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hairline: If your hairline is receding , it can make it look like your forehead is larger than it actually is. Grooming habits: Taking good care of your hair can keep it lush and full for longer, whereas hairstyles that harm your hair—like tight ponytails, harsh chemicals, or excessive heat style—can make your hair thin and your hairline recede.

      "content": "Of course! People make up all sorts of rules about how our bodies need to look to be attractive, but in the end, 1) it’s not how you look that matters (but we’re sure you’ve heard this (true!) platitude), 2) attractiveness is subjective, and 3) literally anybody can be physically attractive regardless of how big or small their forehead is. Whether you have a fivehead or a twohead, it doesn’t mean you’re not a hottie. Studies show being attractive is more about attitude and personality than how big or little your forehead is. Try to be confident and friendly, and you’ll be fine! [8] X Research source Of course, being intentional about your looks and wearing your hair in a style that makes you feel good and comfortable is a great way to feel confident about yourself (no matter how big your forehead is). So try out different hair styles and see which ones make you feel most like…well, YOU!"
