You need to be available for an audition or interview at a moment’s notice or you will never become a paid actor.

      "content": "Take professional headshots. Headshots are high-quality pictures of you that studios use to decide if you are the right fit for a role. There are thousands of photo studios that offer headshots, usually costing anywhere from $200-$400. Make sure you tell the photographer that your headshots are for acting, as there are some other professions that require headshots in a different style. Your headshot should show off your brand, or how you want the industry to see you. Think about 3 words that describe you, like \"upbeat, funny, and sporty,\" or \"intelligent, quirky, and caring.\" Then, try to embody that through your wardrobe, expression, and pose.

Being an extra means you get to be on set, meeting people and learning how the film industry works, while still making some money acting. Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Megan Fox, and more famous actors all started out as extras and worked their way up from there. [3] X Research source Any chance you get to be on a professional film set will help you make contacts that could lead to your next role."

Years later, after proving she was a dependable actress in several plays and small TV roles, she was asked to audition for the role of Pam. Be kind to everyone you meet, and work hard on every role you get – you never know who is going to come through with your big chance. The more roles you take, no matter how small or weird, the more connections you will make with actors, directors, casting professionals, and agents."

The people you take classes with are all in the same boat as you, and opportunities will arise for some people that can help you as well. Many now-famous comedy groups, like the Upright Citizen’s Brigade, began through friendships made at acting classes."

      "content": "Register with SAG to get benefits, auditions, and certification. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is a union for actors. Many TV shows, films, and even commercials will only hire SAG-certified actors. While this does not have to be your first step in Hollywood, you should register online once you start getting your first auditions. Membership costs roughly $200 a year SAG members receive health benefits, acting workshops, online casting databases, and support when reading and signing contracts."

You should also continue asking your friends if they know of any good casting opportunities. Check online casting databases, like Backstage.com and SAGAFTRA.org, to get up-to-date casting information. Ask your agent, if you have one, to find auditions or parts for you. Always prepare for an audition by cleaning up, reading the part, and practicing your monologue or speech beforehand."

      "content": "Get an agent once you start booking gigs. Agents specialize in landing roles for actors by communicating directly with studios about their needs. When a movie or TV show needs someone with a certain look or style, they ask the agent to provide them with a list of potential names instead of putting up a Craigslist ad. To get an agent, research acting agencies near you and send them a resume, cover letter, and headshots. Try to focus on agencies that specialize in actors whose brands are similar to yours, like Broadway or feature film actors. [4] X Expert Source Martin Bentsen Acting Coach & Headshot Photographer Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. Try to use SAG/AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) approved agents, as they have been vetted by the industry and have proven connections. To find agents, search online for “acting agencies,” buy a “Call Sheet” book, which is a print collection of agents, or ask Hollywood friends if they can put in a good word for you. Apply to 10-15 agencies at a time, as they are often busy and may not even read your submission. Many will only accept actors who have already worked a few small gigs. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Start with small roles. As wonderful as it would be to rocket to stardom in your first picture, most actors work steadily for years before being noticed, if they get noticed at all. Do not let pride keep you from applying for small parts on TV shows, commercials, or the backgrounds of movies. Every role you land will help further your dreams as an actor. Commercials are an enormous market for actors and usually only require one day of work."

Getting on stage is valuable experience that can get you noticed if the right person is in the audience. Ian McKellan, Alec Baldwin, and Sarah Jessica Parker all began their careers in theater.

While not necessary to succeed in Hollywood (directors like Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and James Cameron never went to film school), film school is a great place to learn the hard skills of film—camera settings, lenses, lighting, and sound design—while getting a chance to practice with professional equipment. Many cities have night classes in film at local art schools if you have already graduated. Film school can be expensive, but you'll learn a lot about how to create films, and it's a great way to make connections in the industry.

From makeup and costuming to sound engineering and cinematography, there are a lot of potential jobs in Hollywood behind the scenes. However, almost none of them will hire you without past experience. In almost every instance you have to start from the bottom to get the job you want. Some of the most common entry-level positions are: Production Assistant (PA): The PA does whatever the movie needs, from picking up actors or food to checking the script and rolling up cords. This is oftentimes the first job a burgeoning filmmaker takes because they get to work with many different film departments and meet many people, but it is thankless work. [8] X Research source Grip: Holds boom microphones and sometimes cameras. This is a great job for someone interested in the audio side of Hollywood, but it is physically taxing to hold up equipment all day. Script Supervisor: Reads the script while filming to make sure there are no mistakes. Though this is not always considered an entry-level position, smaller studios will often hire a new person if they have experience in editing or writing. [9] X Research source"

Most of your day is spent doing menial tasks or running errands, and it might feel like you are wasting your time.

While a good smile and personality will help in an interview, most studios want to see some of your work before hiring you. A demo reel is a short compilation of your film accomplishments that you use to prove your skills. It should be no more than 2 minutes long and it should feature your very best work. Keep it short – you should grab their interest in the first 30 seconds. Tailor your reel to your job – if you are applying for a job editing, focus on scenes that cut between multiple angles, if you are focusing on sound design then focus on scenes that showcase how you mix music, dialogue, and sound effects seamlessly. Try to show a variety of work – if you can show 2-4 different projects successfully you prove that you can work on a variety of films. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Read screenplays from your favorite movies and shows. Reading screenplays is essential if you ever want to write them. A good screenplay must tell the entire story without any actors or cameras—it must paint a picture in the reader's head as if they were watching the movie at that very moment. This is an art form, and you can only learn it by reading the masters. Perform an internet search for “Title + Screenplay PDF.” While not every screenplay is online, a large number of them have been posted on various websites. Reading screenplays is a great way to learn formatting as well – if you see a scene a movie you like and don’t know how to format, like a montage or transition, read the screenplay to see how it is written out."

      "content": "Write screenplays. The first question you will be asked in an interview is, “can we see your work?” Very few people in Hollywood are concerned with your degree or resume outside of writing – what they want to see is a fresh voice that is willing to write for a living. Once you’ve written one screenplay and it is as good as you can possibly imagine, sit down and write another. Try to write 3-4 pieces in the same genre (horror, comedy, drama, etc.) since most studios specialize in one type of film. If your first screenplay gets noticed, you then have 2-3 extra scripts the same studio might want."

Think of the brief explanations provided next to movies online and in the newspaper. You want to communicate, in general, the main character, the mood, and the plot in only one sentence, which is often harder than it looks.

More importantly, most contests offer feedback on your script, giving you advice on how to improve it from industry experts. This is especially crucial if you don’t live in L.A, as contests are a direct line to Hollywood if you win. Most contests cost between $35 - $100 to apply to, but they are cheaper the earlier you submit. Read reviews of contests before submitting to them to see if they are worth your money.

Just like burgeoning directors must start as Production Assistants, a writer usually needs to start at the bottom before getting their own show or movie deal.
