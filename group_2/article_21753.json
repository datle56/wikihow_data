[2] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. This helps make hanging many pictures feel less chaotic.Or, line up the edges of each picture with the edges of those next to it, rather than lining up their centers, for an even more organized look. Keep each picture about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) away from the next to ensure the spaces between them are the same."

      "content": "Place a strip of tape 60 in (150 cm) above each stair as a guide. Measure 60 in (150 cm) above the first and last steps and mark those points with masking tape . Then connect the points with one long strip of tape that spans the staircase. [7] X Research source This gives you a clear guideline to roughly follow as you hang pictures. Generally, aim to hang the centerpoint of any larger frames along this line. 60 in (150 cm) is the average eye level, which makes it ideal for hanging pictures. [8] X Research source For more precision, place an X along the line above the center of each stair to line up smaller frames with individual steps."

Drywall and plaster can’t handle heavy weights, so if you’re hanging up a picture or a large piece of artwork, use a stud finder to mark the perfect location. [11] X Research source If you don’t have a stud finder, use your knuckles to gently tap on the wall. If it sounds hollow, there’s no stud there; if it doesn’t sound hollow, that’s a stud. If you have cement walls, install a wall anchor first so the pictures don't fall down. [12] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."
