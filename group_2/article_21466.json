Oils like coconut oil , olive oil, jojoba oil, and argan oil can all be used during your scalp massage. Keep in mind warm scalp massages have not been scientifically proven to lead to faster hair growth. [1] X Research source Start by warming up the oil in a bowl of hot water. Test the oil before you use it to make sure it is not scalding hot; you want a comfortable temperature that will not damage your scalp or your hair. Use your fingertips (not your fingernails) to gently massage your scalp with the warm oil in slow, circular motions. If you have a partner or a friend close by, ask them to help you massage your scalp. Have them massage your scalp with their fingertips for about 3 minutes. Then, run the oil through your hair and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Shampoo your hair well, possibly more than once, to remove the oil . Do the oil massage on the days when you normally shampoo, so that you do not end up washing your hair more often than usual."

      "content": "Try the “inversion” method. The “inversion” method is when you invert your head so it is below your heart, stimulating blood flow that can then encourage hair growth.

Though there is no scientific proof that this method works, it is a harmless method you can try to encourage hair growth. You can also do yoga poses like downward dog, shoulder stand, or head stand. The idea is that your head is below your heart, leading to blood flow to your head. You can massage your scalp with coconut oil before you invert for 4 minutes a day to encourage hair growth. You may also want to measure the length of your hair at the beginning of the week so you can chart your progress. Come out of the inversion slowly so you do not feel faint or dizzy. At the end of the week, measure your hair again and note how long your hair has grown in just one week."
