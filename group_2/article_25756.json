      "title": "Practice in a room with little air flow.",
      "content": "Practice in a room with little air flow. Windy days will make it impossible for even the best smoke tricksters to conjure up a trick. You want as little outside wind as possible, so stay away from fans, close the windows, and choose a still, quiet room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work on keeping the smoke in your mouth.",
      "content": "Work on keeping the smoke in your mouth. The smoke will start to dissipate in your lungs, making it thinner and weaker. Take short breaths in, puffing your cheeks out slightly, and work on keeping the smoke in your mouth. Think of taking 3-4 partial inhales instead of one big, long drag on your hookah or cigarette. You should feel the smoke towards your throat, especially if you take several quick breaths."
    },
    {
      "title": "Exhale slowly.",
      "content": "Exhale slowly. A long, slow exhalation keeps the smoke packed together, helping it appear as a thicker, more coherent cloud. Work on exhaling in a controlled, stream, almost letting the smoke eek out of you instead of forcing it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your smoking device wisely.",
      "content": "Choose your smoking device wisely. Rolled smoking devices, like joints, cigarettes, and blunts have thick smoke because the paper is burning along with the contents. E-pens, with their high vapor content, are also good to smoke for tricks. But the easiest way to do tricks is with a hookah because the glycerin in shisha is vital to thick plumes of smoke. Water bongs and pipes are usually the hardest to use for smoke tricks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work on the Burst.",
      "content": "Work on the Burst. This simple trick is just a good way to practice keeping the smoke in your mouth, not your lungs. To do it, simply take a big puff, then close your mouth. Open your mouth with a quick, percussive \"puh!\" sound to push a big ball of smoke out of your lips. It should clear your mouth completely. If the cloud is a big, solid white color you're doing well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try the Dragon.",
      "content": "Try the Dragon. This simple trick is a good way to practice using your nose and mouth together. It ends up shooting 4 small streams of smoke: 2 from your lips and two from your nose. To do it: Take a big inhalation of smoke, keeping it in your mouth if possible. Extend your bottom lip to the sides, pushing your top lip down in the center, so their are two openings on the corners of your mouth. Breathe out of your nose and lips at the same time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the smoke in your mouth after a medium-sized drag.",
      "content": "Keep the smoke in your mouth after a medium-sized drag. Ghosting is when you exhale some of the smoke, then inhale the cloud back into your mouth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your mouth and exhale gently.",
      "content": "Open your mouth and exhale gently. Open you mouth roughly halfway and slowly exhale the smoke from your mouth for a few seconds. Be gentle, keeping the smoke from getting too far from your face. Think of letting the smoke escape, instead of forcing it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Quickly inhale the smoke back.",
      "content": "Quickly inhale the smoke back. Keep your lips together and lean forward, sucking up all the smoke like a vacuum or Ghostbuster."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adapt this into a \"Snap Inhale\" as you get more comfortable.",
      "content": "Adapt this into a \"Snap Inhale\" as you get more comfortable. Let the smoke out of your mouth and then bring it back, but you can do it much faster with a snap inhale: Curl your tongue up to the roof of your mouth with your lips still closed and mouth filled with smoke. Snap your tongue down as your mouth opens to push the smoke out in a puff of air. Suck back in the cloud of smoke like a normal ghost, but do it quickly, before it fades away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a big, full drag.",
      "content": "Take a big, full drag. Keep the smoke, like normal, in your mouth if possible. This trick works best with thick, white smoke."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push out your bottom lip, opening your mouth slightly.",
      "content": "Push out your bottom lip, opening your mouth slightly. Hold your bottom lip out like have an an underbite. Let the smoke escape from your mouth, drifting up from your lower lip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inhale the smoke through your nostrils.",
      "content": "Inhale the smoke through your nostrils. As the smoke escapes, drifting up from your bottom lip, inhale gently from your nose. It will appear like an upside down waterfall of smoke, sneaking up from your bottom lip into your nose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adapt the French Inhale by mixing it with other tricks.",
      "content": "Adapt the French Inhale by mixing it with other tricks. Try blowing a smoke ring through your mouth and inhale it back through the nose. Can you adapt into a French Ghost, popping the smoke out from your mouth and pulling it back through the nostrils?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try ghost-facing.",
      "content": "Try ghost-facing. This is just a patient, easier version of the French Inhale. To do it you must take a large, full drag. Open your mouth from the lower lip and slowly exhale, pushing the smoke out and up. Keep exhaling slowly, tilting your chin slightly down as you do, to cover your whole face in smoke."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a full mouth of smoke.",
      "content": "Get a full mouth of smoke. Take a full, long drag and keep the smoke in your mouth. Smoke rings only work with thick, fully formed smoke, so consider using a Hookah or cigar to practice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your mouth to an O shape.",
      "content": "Open your mouth to an O shape. Some people have success pulling their lips back over their teeth, but the overall goal is simply as if you were saying \"oh.\" Keep your mouth open and round and you'll be perfect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use quick bursts of air to push the smoke out.",
      "content": "Use quick bursts of air to push the smoke out. There are a lot of schools of thought about how to best accomplish this, as it is the hardest part of blowing rings: Exhale with rapid, clipped breaths. A lot of groups call these \"reverse hiccups.\" A hiccup is basically a quick, brief inhalation. It feels almost like a pop.Think of making a \"Huh, Huh, Huh,\" sound as you push air out. Use your tongue to \"flick\" out bits of airs. Time your flick with a puff of air, almost like a heavily enunciated \"to.\" Tap out the rings. Contort your mouth so that your cheeks are concave (curving into your mouth). Tap the cheek with a finger, hitting it hard enough to force some air out of your mouth. You can tap rapidly as you get better and better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change your mouth shape to change the ring shape.",
      "content": "Change your mouth shape to change the ring shape. Rings are determined by the size of your mouth and the force you use to push the smoke out. Once you get the basic idea down, practice moving your lips and working your lungs to get different sized rings.. You can make your rings into little hearts easily. After you blow it out, snap just above the ring, 1-2\" high. The resulting burst of air will dent the top of the ring, making a heart appear."

      "title": "Mix dishwashing soap and water in a dish.",
      "content": "Mix dishwashing soap and water in a dish. You want a liquid mixture, but enough soap to make bubbles. Start with 1/2 cup of water and a 2-second squirt of soap, then adjust accordingly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip the end of a straw into the mix.",
      "content": "Dip the end of a straw into the mix. This is like using bubble mix as a kid. You want a thin film of soapy water over the end of the straw. The wider the straw, the better the bubble will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a big inhalation.",
      "content": "Take a big inhalation. Inhale as much smoke as you can from your chosen device. The more smoke, the bigger your bubble. Leave the straw in the soap as you inhale."
    },
    {
      "title": "Exhale through the dry end of the straw.",
      "content": "Exhale through the dry end of the straw. Exhale slowly, building the bubble so it doesn't pop due to a rapid push of air. When you're out of smoke, stop breathing and pull the straw off of your bubble. Avoid inhaling through the straw at all times if you don't want a big mouthful of soap."
