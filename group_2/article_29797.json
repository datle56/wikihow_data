      "content": "Boil 4 cups (0.95 L) of tap water in a sterilized pot for 5 minutes. Add water to the pot directly from the tap or with a sterilized measuring cup. Once boiling, let the water roll and bubble for at least 5 minutes to eliminate bacteria. Turn off the heat and let the water cool to lukewarm. [2] X Research source Alternatively, use or purchase distilled water to skip the boiling process. If you’re in a hurry, microwave the water in a covered container for 2 minutes until it’s boiling or almost boiling. Plan to use the water quickly after boiling. If it sits too long, it will collect bacteria again. Avoid using well water or sea water, since these contain more particles and germs than you get from your tap."

      "content": "Stir in 2 teaspoons (8.4 g) of non-iodized salt until it’s dissolved. Regular table salt grains are small enough to dissolve easily in hot water. If you’re using sea salt, opt for small grains or flakes rather than large crystals. Stir while the water is still lukewarm to help the salt dissolve. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re making saline for oral swishing , add 4 teaspoons (16.7 g) of salt and 8 teaspoons (33.5 g) of baking soda (the baking soda makes the solution less abrasive). [4] X Research source For nasal irrigation , add 3 teaspoons (12.6 g) of salt and 1 teaspoon (4.2 g) of baking soda. [5] X Research source To clean piercings , add 1 teaspoon (4.2 g) of salt (super salty saline may irritate the piercing more than it helps)."

[6] X Research source To transfer the saline to a syringe or irrigating tool, pour it directly from the pot into a clean paper cup , then dip your syringe into the cup. [7] X Research source Avoid dipping non-sterilized tools or utensils directly into the solution."

[8] X Research source After 3 days, dump any remaining solution, re-sterilize the container, and make a new batch if needed.

      "content": "Clean wounds with a gauze pad dipped in saline. Put on disposable gloves and place a towel underneath the wound. Dab the wound in a circular motion, working outward from the center to prevent germs spreading inward. Use multiple pads if needed to remove all debris and draining liquids. [10] X Research source Pat the wound with a clean, dry cloth to dry it. Throw away your gloves and saline-soaked gauze after cleaning. Apply a new dressing to the wound if necessary."

      "content": "Irrigate your sinuses with a neti pot or soft rubber ear bulb syringe . Draw 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of saline into the bulb or syringe. Lower your head over a sink (or in the shower) and rotate to the left so your right nostril is raised. Squeeze half the solution into your right nostril and wait a few seconds for it to come out of your left. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Repeat this process through the other nostril. Breathe through your mouth while the saline runs from one nostril to the other. Blow your nose gently to keep the saline from running into your ears. If it does, it’s OK—the mild discomfort will go away after a few minutes. Irrigate at least 30 minutes before applying any other nasal medication."

      "content": "Swish saline in your mouth for 30 seconds to relieve oral pain. Simply rinse a mouthful of solution around your teeth and gums 2-3 times per day, then spit it out. The saline acts as an antiseptic to kill bacteria and speeds up healing for oral wounds and sores. [14] X Research source Also try gargling saline to soothe a sore throat. Homemade saline is non-toxic if you accidentally swallow it."

      "content": "Soak piercings for 5-10 minutes daily to clean and disinfect them . Pour saline into a small cup or shot glass and invert it over your piercing to form a vacuum. If the location makes this too difficult, use a cotton pad or paper towel that’s dipped in saline to clean the piercing site or add your saline to a spray bottle. [15] X Research source Dry the piercing gently with clean paper towels. Avoid using cloth towels since they contain more bacteria (and are more likely to give you an infection)."
