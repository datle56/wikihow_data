      "title": "Pisces and Libra can make a sweet pairing but have their differences.",
      "content": "Pisces and Libra can make a sweet pairing but have their differences. In some ways, Libra and Pisces can complement one another. They’ll strike a balance between emotional depth (from Pisces) and intellect (from Libra), and their mutual desire for true love will connect them. Still, their clashing natures—like Libra’s logical mind and Pisces’ dreamy personality—may cause tension. Libra is an air sign ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty. This makes Libra charming, intelligent, gentle, and well-balanced. Pisces is a water sign ruled by Neptune, the planet of creativity and dreams. This makes Pisces empathetic, intuitive, gracious, and artistic."

      "title": "Both signs are influenced by Venus, making them romantics at heart.",
      "content": "Both signs are influenced by Venus, making them romantics at heart. If there’s one thing Pisces and Libra will always have in common, it’s their adoration for love and romance. These sweet-natured signs share a connection through Venus; it’s Libra’s ruling planet and is exalted in Pisces. Unconditional love defines both signs’ approach to romance, and they’ll cherish one another fully. In astrology, exaltation is a place of high awareness. Each planet is exalted in a single sign, and Venus is exalted in Pisces. This essentially means that Venus has a lot of influence on Pisces’ personality. Libra is naturally charming and loves to explore, especially when it comes to cultured things like art and music. Creative Pisces will enjoy being treated to such experiences. Pisces’ intuition helps them to easily identify Libra’s needs. Compassionate Pisces will also do their best to accommodate those needs, which Libra will deeply appreciate."

      "title": "Libra does not always show emotion as deeply as Pisces.",
      "content": "Libra does not always show emotion as deeply as Pisces. Empathetic Pisces operates on pure emotion, which is something a logical air sign like Libra just doesn’t do. That isn’t entirely a bad thing: when they respect one another’s emotional disposition, they can balance one another out. However, if Pisces can’t accept Libra’s logical personality and Libra tires of Pisces’ emotions, they may clash. [1] X Research source To make this relationship work, Pisces must understand that Libra isn’t as openly emotional as they are. With patience and communication, Pisces can show Libra that it’s okay to express emotion sometimes. Meanwhile, Libra can use their intellect to help Pisces see the rational side of things. Pisces tends to see life-or-death situations everywhere, whereas even-minded Libra can help Pisces find the middle ground. In short, both signs must learn to work with their emotional differences, or they may find the relationship a difficult one."

      "title": "Pisces and Libra’s ties to Venus lead to a strong intimate connection.",
      "content": "Pisces and Libra’s ties to Venus lead to a strong intimate connection. Both signs are devoted to their partner’s pleasure even more than their own, which means intimacy will usually be very satisfying for them. Neither sign has a tendency for aggression, so they’ll approach one another with tenderness and care. Because Venus rules Libra and is exalted in Pisces, both signs tend to use sex to express love, which makes Pisces sexually compatible with Libra."

      "title": "Libra’s thirst for excitement may clash with Pisces’ slow, sensual vibe.",
      "content": "Libra’s thirst for excitement may clash with Pisces’ slow, sensual vibe. Both signs look for passion in their intimacy, but they show it in different ways. While Libra doesn’t do aggression, they do like spontaneity, excitement, and fast-paced lovemaking. That isn’t really Pisces’ speed; emotional Pisces expresses their passion by taking things slowly and savoring every minute. That doesn’t mean this pair can’t enjoy intimacy; Pisces is also adaptive and extremely creative in bed, which Libra will find attractive . If Pisces can adapt to Libra’s speed, Libra will gladly indulge Pisces’ out-of-this-world ideas."

      "title": "Libra and Pisces may not fully understand one another, causing distrust.",
      "content": "Libra and Pisces may not fully understand one another, causing distrust. While their desire for love will bring them together, they have very different personalities. Social Libra wants to be liked by everyone, and Pisces may see this as a confusing lack of self-confidence. Pisces, on the other hand, can be a bit slow to commit and flirty towards other people, which Libra will find hard to accept. To overcome a lack of trust, Pisces and Libra will need to take their relationship one step at a time and keep clear lines of communication. If they take things slowly and work to build their understanding of one another from the ground up, they’ll find it much easier to develop a natural trust in one another."

      "title": "Pisces and Libra can inspire one another as they exchange ideas.",
      "content": "Pisces and Libra can inspire one another as they exchange ideas. As an intellectual air sign, Libra will be open to discussing anything and everything with Pisces, who will embrace Libra’s open-minded approach to conversation. Pisces, a creative and eccentric sign, has a particular fascination with dreams and other surreal topics. Together, Libra and Pisces will create some big dreams. [2] X Research source Sometimes, Libra and Pisces can get so caught up in their dreams that they forget to make them a reality. Libra, a cardinal sign, is a bit more decisive than Pisces. If Libra can take charge while Pisces offers encouragement, this pair can move past the “ideas” phase of their dreams. Pisces, a mutable sign, tends to go with the flow and might prefer to follow Libra’s lead. This also makes Pisces adaptive and fuels their creativity; Pisces can be the “ideas” person to Libra’s inner go-getter."

      "title": "Pisces speaks from the heart while Libra speaks from the head.",
      "content": "Pisces speaks from the heart while Libra speaks from the head. They’ll do their best to understand one another, but Libra and Pisces can end up speaking two different languages. Pisces’ thoughts are often fueled by emotion and instinct. Libra is logical and uses cold, hard facts to justify their ideas. When one partner is saying “I think,” and the other is saying “I feel,” it can lead to miscommunication. They can still enjoy exchanges if they focus on one another’s good qualities! Libra is a thoughtful listener who is always curious about new ideas, and Pisces’ empathetic heart allows them to see the world from another person’s perspective. Still, Libra can be argumentative when they’re stuck on making a specific point, and Pisces may be too passive to defend themselves. When both focus on listening actively to one another, they can reach an understanding."

      "title": "Love is the most important shared value between Libra and Pisces.",
      "content": "Love is the most important shared value between Libra and Pisces. Other values may differ, but Pisces and Libra can unite under the idea that love should be sacred. Both will crave love, and heap adoration on anyone willing and able to show it to them—which, in this case, would be one another. As a result, they’ll both prioritize one another’s happiness, which is a valuable thing in a relationship. If Libra and Pisces share a strong attraction from the beginning and feel connected to one another, that devotion and commitment to true love can be the glue for their relationship."

      "title": "Libra is more outgoing, whereas Pisces is shy and reserved.",
      "content": "Libra is more outgoing, whereas Pisces is shy and reserved. Libra also values a busy social life. Charming and gregarious, Libra is happiest with a vibrant social life and a ton of friends who all think Libra is the bee's knees. Pisces, on the other hand, likes all things familiar. They tend to need more alone time and prefer to spend time on creative and spiritual pursuits rather than making friends with everybody. In a relationship, Libra tends to want to be joined at the hip! While it’s a sweet thought, Libra may need to give Pisces some space at times and let them do their own thing. Then, Pisces may be able to compromise and join Libra for a couple of their social outings (but not all). If Pisces can get out of their comfort zone for Libra, then Libra may be willing to do the same and fly solo sometimes."

      "title": "Both signs hate conflict and may be unable to address important issues.",
      "content": "Both signs hate conflict and may be unable to address important issues. Conflict isn’t either sign’s strong suit; Libra tends to strive for peace and balance in life, so they dislike the lack of harmony that comes with conflict. Although Pisces is more willing to discuss their feelings, they still fear true conflict because it might mean upsetting (or, in their minds, losing) their significant other. While conflict isn’t fun, the ability to face it as a team is crucial for a healthy relationship, something Pisces and Libra may need to learn together. Pisces may need to take the lead since they’re more comfortable with emotions and gently tell Libra when something is bothering them. Libra, in turn, may need to overcome their fear of conflict and understand that if issues are left to fester, they become worse. If Libra talks to Pisces about their problems, the pair can work through them together. Reader Poll: We asked 707 wikiHow readers what their biggest dealbreaker is as a Pisces and 62% of them said someone who lies. [Take Poll] It’s important for both signs to learn to be upfront with their feelings so the other one doesn’t feel betrayed or lied to."

      "title": "They may encounter conflict if one partner tries to change the other.",
      "content": "They may encounter conflict if one partner tries to change the other. Outgoing and logical Libra has a very different disposition from introverted and creative Pisces, and without understanding, both may assume the other needs to think and behave differently. [3] X Research source Compromise and balance are one thing, but if either sign approaches the other from a judgmental point of view, one may end up disrespecting the other. Respect is the key to strong communication for this pair. Adapting to one another’s needs can be a good thing, but they must respect their differences too."

      "title": "Libra and Pisces can be great partners if they develop mutual respect.",
      "content": "Libra and Pisces can be great partners if they develop mutual respect. These signs are fundamentally different on many levels, including the way they think and communicate, but the one thing they share is a reverence for love. If they learn to respect their differences, listen to one another’s needs, and work through conflict, they’ll find in one another the true love they’ve been waiting for their whole lives. In some ways, friendship comes even easier than romance for Libra and Pisces because they can support and inspire one another without romantic expectations to worry about. Air and water don’t usually mesh well in astrology, but if they truly love one another and put in the work, Libra and Pisces make a surprisingly sweet and devoted pair."
