Interior designer Kanika Khurana says to draw the eye up, “You always want to go at least 4-6 inches (10.16-15.24cm) above your frame…And if you have a really high ceiling, you can take it all the way up and leave about 4-6 inches from the ceiling.” [1] X Expert Source Kanika Khurana Interior Designer Expert Interview. 21 June 2022. Use a measuring tape to measure the width of the window or doorway for curtains. Add 6-12 inches (15.24-30.46 cm) to your measurement so the rod extends 3-6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 cm) past the window or doorway on both sides. Mark the height and width for the brackets with a pencil. If you want the curtain to be inside the window or doorway, measure inside the frame, along the top edge. Do not add any extra measurements."

      "content": "Cut a ¾-inch (1.91 cm) wooden rod to match your measurement. Use strong, sturdy wood, such as oak. These curtains can get heavy, so you want the ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wooden rod to be strong enough to hold them up. Cut the wood yourself using a saw , or ask the hardware store where you buy the dowel to do it for you. [2] X Research source If you already have a sturdy metal rod that’s the correct length, use that instead if you like. Do not use a tension rod; it won't be sturdy enough to hold the weight of the beads."

      "title": "Attach curtain rod brackets to the wall.",
      "content": "Attach curtain rod brackets to the wall. Install the curtains by placing the brackets against the wall on the spots you marked when measuring. Use a drill to create pilot holes and then insert the screws. [3] X Research source Make sure you’re drilling into the wooden support beams and not into drywall. If you must use drywall, use heavy-duty wall anchors to support the rod. If you only drive the screws into drywall, the weight of the curtains will pull the rod off the wall. Depending on how wide your window or doorway is, you may need between 2 and 3 hooks. The wider the window or doorway is, the more hooks you will need. If you are going to mount the curtain inside your window or doorway, then drill the holes into the frame itself. You will need to get special mounts for hanging curtains inside windows ."

      "content": "Hang the rod on the brackets. Hanging the rod before you string the beads allows you to determine how long your curtains will be. It also keeps the strands from getting tangled while you work on them. If you hang the curtain inside the window or doorway, be prepared for a tight fit. You may have to sand down the end of the curtain rod."

      "title": "Measure and cut fishing line to the desired length of your curtain.",
      "content": "Measure and cut fishing line to the desired length of your curtain. Measure how long you want your curtains to be, starting from the top of the curtain rod. Double your measurement and add 12 inches (30.46 cm), then cut the fishing line to this measurement. Cut and work on one strand at a time. If you cut too many strands at once, the fishing line may turn into a tangled mess. Home stager, realtor, and interior designer Angelica Savard says that many people tend to hang curtains too low. [4] X Expert Source Angelica Savard Home Stager, Realtor, & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 April 2020. Since you’re making the curtain, make sure the bottom beads are 3-4 inches (7.62-10.16 cm) off the floor. A micro-filament line works well because it's clear and strong, says crafting specialist Nicole Bolin. Crochet thread might be too weak and cotton rope too thick, she adds. [5] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 29 October 2020. The strands don't all necessarily have to be the same length. Plan out your design before making the curtain if you want strands of different lengths."

      "title": "Tie the lengths of the fishing line to split curtain rings.",
      "content": "Tie the lengths of the fishing line to split curtain rings. Find the center of a length of fishing line, then slip it through the curtain split ring . Tie 2-3 knots beneath the slip ring to keep the fishing line secure, or use a slipknot. Make sure that the fishing line is centered and that both strands are the same length. Your fishing line is twice as long as the height of the rod because you fold it in half and insert two strands inside each bead. The extra 12 inches (30.46 cm) of length allows you to secure the end of the strand so the beads won’t fall off. Work on one strand of beads at a time then hang it on the rod as soon as you finish it. This helps keep your strands from getting tangled. Split curtain rings are the same thing as keychain rings. Because of their design, they don't have any gaps that your fishing line might slip through. They are also very strong and sturdy."

      "title": "String your beads onto the fishing line.",
      "content": "String your beads onto the fishing line. Thread your first bead onto the fishing line. Make sure you put both strands of the fishing line through the bead’s hole. Pull the bead all the way up the line to the split ring, and then add the next bead. Keep doing this until you have about 12 inches (30.48 cm) of string left at the bottom. Your beads don't all have to be the same size. Play around with different patterns. For example, you could use mostly small beads on your curtain and use a large, chunky bead every couple of inches/centimeters. You need more beads than you might think for this project. They can be glass, plastic, wood, or even homemade. One way to make your own paper beads is to cut paper triangles. Roll the paper around a toothpick. When you reach the end, glue it down and pull out the toothpick. If you are using colored string, consider using clear beads for a cool effect."

      "title": "Add a 2-hole bead and tie off the ends of the line.",
      "content": "Add a 2-hole bead and tie off the ends of the line. Put one strand of fishing line through each hole of a 2-hole bead . Tie about 3 knots under the bead to secure it. Then, thread the ends of the fishing line back through the holes of the bead and up through the next couple of beads on the line. Go about 2 inches (5 cm), then trim off the ends. If you do not have any 2-hole beads, use a larger 1-hole bead instead. Turn the bead so that the ends are pointing to the side instead of up and down. Take one strand of fishing line and pull it through the left end of the hole. Pull the other strand of fishing line through the right end of the hole. Tie the knots above the bead. Place a drop of super glue over the knot to make it stronger and less likely to slip. Do not use a crimp bead as it may not hold as well on fishing line as it does for jewelry-making wire.

      "content": "Hang the strands of beads on the curtain rod. Lift the end of the curtain rod off the bracket and loop the ring over the end. Slide it to the opposite end of the rod close to the bracket on the other side. [7] X Research source Continue cutting and beading your strands until you have as many as you like on your curtain rod. They don’t all have to be the same length, but remember to add 12 inches (30.46 cm) to each strand to finish it off properly. It may sound like a lot of work, constantly getting up and sliding the split ring onto your curtain rod, but it will help keep your work from getting tangled."

      "content": "Adjust the spacing of the strands of beads on the rod. Make adjustments as needed to ensure that the curtain is hanging evenly. If you use glass beads, the light behind the curtain catches the colors of the beads and makes them glow—just like a suncatcher. Try using sturdy wooden or plastic beads for doorways to avoid breakage since doorway bead curtains move and hit against each other more often."

      "content": "Add decorative finials to the ends of the rod (optional) . Adding finials can take your design to the next level. It also helps prevent the split rings from sliding off when you move the curtain around. Use simple wooden ornaments and attach them to each end of your curtain rod with wood glue. Metal, glass, or ceramic curtain rod ornaments that screw on are also available. [8] X Research source However, you must drill holes into the curtain rod to install them. It’s not possible to add finials to a curtain rod mounted inside a window or doorway."
