      "content": "Assemble the cake on the serving plate. It is easier to decorate the butterfly in position, as it can't be moved once made. Place the candy length down the center of the plate. This serves as the butterfly's body. Place the two wings on opposite sides of the candy, resting on the plate. Face the curve in toward the butterfly's body, the straight edges facing outward."

    {
      "title": "Decorate the wings.",
      "content": "Decorate the wings. The wings can be decorated in any fashion you like. The basics are: Ice or frost both sides of the cake. Stick candies onto the cake in symmetrical patterns on each wing (mimic the same pattern, mirror image, both sides). Sprinkle with edible glitter, sprinkles, or other small cake decorating items."

      "content": "Add a head and antennae. Use a round candy ball for the head. Unroll licorice lengths or similar candy to make the antennae––then re-roll the top portion to give it a little curl."

      "content": "Keeping the two semi-circles together, as if the cake were still whole, cut the cake like a peace sign. To help you get this exact, use toothpicks as markers, placed before cutting the cake. Once this is done, you now have four wing pieces."

Frost down all of the sides of the wings, keeping this layer very thin. To set this layer, place it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. This will make it much easier to add the whipped frosting."

      "content": "Decorate the wings. Place three colors into pastry cones or piping bags; these can be made easily from paper or cellophane if you don't own any. For the colors, choose according to the kind of butterfly you're trying to make or just use colors the cake recipient likes. Pastels are one possibility, neon colors another, and realistic colors too (look online for butterfly images to get the real colors). Pipe an amount of the first color on the base of the top wing. Use the spatula to spread a line of this across to the center of the wing. use the knife tip to drag the color into a point near the wing joint. Repeat with the next color just above it, then finish with another color on top. Three lines of color should fit across the top wing. Repeat on the opposite top wing. Repeat on the lower two wings. Exactly the same process, only slightly smaller blobs of frosting/icing will be needed. Accent the wing streaks using a piped line around the edges."

Suggestions include: Sprinkles or edible glitter Coated almonds - add one per wing streak in the same color as the streak, or a different color Sanding sugar for a sparkle."
