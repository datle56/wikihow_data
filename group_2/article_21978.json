      "content": "Wait 6 months after the plant blooms. Usually, it takes about half a year for pineapples to fully develop after the plant blooms. Start looking for ripeness at about 5 1/2 months. [2] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Keep in mind that the \"bloom\" becomes the pineapple. The pineapple will be covered in small blue flowers. If you're growing your plant from a pineapple top, it can take up to 2 years before a pineapple starts growing."

      "title": "Look for a color change from green to yellow-orange at the base.",
      "content": "Look for a color change from green to yellow-orange at the base. Unripe pineapples are green in color. When they begin to ripen, you'll notice a change near the base of the pineapple. It will start to turn yellow-orange, indicating its ready or almost ready for picking. [3] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Pay attention when the fruit is at least 2/3 yellow. The fruit won't be ready to ripen until the majority of the fruit has turned yellow-orange. At this point, the pineapple is considered mature, though not necessarily ripe. An overripe fruit will be turning brown or moldy. It may have soft spots on it, too."

      "content": "Give the pineapple a good sniff to test for the pineapple scent. When a pineapple is ready to harvest, it will start to have a strong pineapple scent. You'll know it's ripe when you catch whiffs of it even when you don't have your nose right next to the pineapple. [4] X Research source Lean down a bit to smell your pineapple. The smell will be strongest at the base. If the fruit is overripe, it will start to have an alcohol-like or fermented fruit smell."

      "title": "Tap the side of the pineapple and listen to how it sounds.",
      "content": "Tap the side of the pineapple and listen to how it sounds. Firmly but gently tap the side of your pineapple your hand while listening closely to the sound it makes. If it sounds solid when you tap it, it's not quite ready for harvest yet."

      "title": "Wait until the pineapple is ripe to harvest it.",
      "content": "Wait until the pineapple is ripe to harvest it. Pineapples do not ripen too much more after they are picked. Therefore, if you want a tasty pineapple, you must wait until it is fully ripened to harvest it. [5] X Research source A pineapple may ripen a little after it is harvested if you keep it at room temperature. However, you should not count on this is as the primary method to ripen your pineapple. Let most of the maturing happen on the plant."

      "content": "Wear gloves to protect your hands. The leaves of pineapples can be pretty sharp. Similarly, the rind of the pineapple can also be rough on hands. Try wearing a pair of gardening gloves to provide protection. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Steady the pineapple with one hand.",
      "content": "Steady the pineapple with one hand. Hold on to the top of the pineapple with your non-dominant hand. You can grab the actual fruit or grasp the top of the pineapple between the leaves. You want to keep the pineapple still while you cut it off."

      "title": "Use shears for an easy cut.",
      "content": "Use shears for an easy cut. One way to cut the pineapple off is to simply grab a pair of gardening shears. Cut the pineapple stem just below the pineapple, and catch the fruit as it comes off the plant. [7] X Research source Make sure to leave some stem behind so that the plant can regrow. If you need to, you can use both hands to operate the shears. Just try to catch the pineapple before it falls, as you don't want to bruise it."

      "content": "Try a sharp knife if you don't have gardening shears. A sharp knife will work about as well as gardening shears. Saw into the stem just below the pineapple until the pineapple comes free. Be careful not to damage other leaves as you are cutting off the pineapple."

      "content": "Place pineapples in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life. While a typical refrigerator is colder than what's ideal for pineapples, storing them in the refrigerator is still your best bet. It will slow down the decaying process. Ripe pineapples do best at a temperature of 45 to 55 째F (7 to 13 째C), and the ideal fridge temperature is 36 째F (2 째C). To keep the pineapple a bit warmer, place it in the warmest part of the refrigerator. Use a thermometer to test the temperature in different areas, as models vary. Pineapples will generally last 3-5 days in the fridge. On the counter, they'll last 1-3 days. [8] X Research source"
