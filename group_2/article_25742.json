Notice that while the word for \"day\" is \"Rooz,\" the days of the week do not include this word.

These letters \" و, ژ, ﺯ, ﺭ, ﺫ, ﺩ, ﺍ\" link to the letter that precedes them, but not to the letter that follows. [7] X Research source Most letters in Persian have four forms: initial, medial, final, and detached. The form they take depends on their position in a word. \"Initial\" letters are the first letter of a word, and they connect to the letter that follows. \"Medial\" letters are attached on both sides to the letters in a word that come before or after them. \"Final\" letters are those at the end of a word. They tend to take on a tail, or be written slightly larger than the letters preceding them. \"Detached\" letters are letters that stand alone, as in the alphabet. The seven letters that do not link take only two forms, \"final\" and \"detached.\""

Look up language schools and tutoring services in your area. Put up ads on craigslist and tutoring websites offering to pay for tutoring sessions. Check to see what other potential students are offering, as well as what local tutors of other languages are asking, and have that amount in mind if you get any offers. Try putting up flyers in places that Persian-speaking people might be, such as mosques and neighborhoods with Iranian, Tajik, Afghan, and other residents. If you know anyone who speaks Persian, ask if they or someone they know could tutor you. A Persian speaker who has teaching experience in other subjects might be excited to combine their skills. Ask a friend who speaks Persian to make a standing date with you to chat in Persian. Offer to pay. Consider taking calligraphy lessons."

If you are traveling to a country plagued by terrorism, violence, or the after effects of civil and international war, make sure you are traveling to a city or town that is considered lower risk. Consider the areas that you must pass through, however, to get there. [9] X Research source The organization that you travel with should discuss safety with you extensively. Consider a critical language scholarship. If you are an undergraduate or graduate student and a citizen of the United States, you might qualify for a CLS, an all-expenses paid intensive summer class run by the United States government. For Persian, you'll need to have studied for at least a year before this program will accept you. [10] X Research source Visit a website like https://www.goabroad.com/ to find out about vetted study abroad opportunities. Check that any program you choose is run by legitimate organizations, such as certified colleges and universities.
