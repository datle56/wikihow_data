If she says that she does not want you to interact with someone, do not use this against her. Her paranoia is already at high alert so breaking your promise will do irreversible damage. Avoid using an ex to make her jealous. Knowing that you already have had a romantic relationship makes it easy to believe you can rekindle it at any moment. Do not mention high profile friends. Whether you have mutual friends that are on tv, play professional sports, or have high paying jobs, their social status makes them an alluring romantic pursuit. Your girlfriend may easily become jealous if you show too much favor to a high profile friend."
