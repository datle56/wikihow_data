      "title": "Schedule an appointment with your health care provider.",
      "content": "Schedule an appointment with your health care provider. You could simply go to your primary care physician, or to any doctor. However, the person in the best position to write an ESA letter for you is the mental health professional who is treating you for your mental disorder. [2] X Research source When you call to schedule the appointment, let them know that you want to talk to them about getting an ESA letter. That way you're not putting them on the spot when you show up for the appointment."

      "title": "Describe specifically your need for the letter.",
      "content": "Describe specifically your need for the letter. In the US, ESA letters may be used for 2 distinct purposes. Either you want to bring your animal with you in the passenger cabin of an aircraft, or you want to be allowed to keep your animal with you in no-pets housing. [3] X Research source Different situations may call for different reasons you need to have your pet. For example, if you have anxiety and a pathological fear of flying, your therapist might be able to write you an ESA letter to have your animal in the cabin of an aircraft. However, those same reasons wouldn't justify your need for your animal in no-pets housing."

      "title": "Explain how your pet eases the symptoms of your disorder.",
      "content": "Explain how your pet eases the symptoms of your disorder. While your health care provider doesn't have to name the disorder you have, they do need to be able to describe how your animal helps you manage your symptoms. Often, the animal provides a calming effect. [4] X Research source For example, if you suffer from anxiety, your animal may help keep you calm or give you something to focus on when you feel a panic attack coming on. Your animal also may provide you with a sense of connection to reality or to the world. Being responsible for the animal's well-being may help keep you grounded."

      "title": "Provide your health care provider with a sample letter.",
      "content": "Provide your health care provider with a sample letter. You can find sample letters online to make sure that your health care provider includes all the information necessary for a valid ESA letter. Generally speaking, the letter must state that you have been diagnosed with a recognized mental disorder and that your ESA eases the symptoms of that disorder. [5] X Research source The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law has a PDF of a sample letter you can download at http://www.bazelon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ESA-Sample-Letter.pdf . This letter meets all the necessary legal requirements. If the name of the recipient of the letter is known, the letter should be addressed to them specifically. Otherwise, a generic \"to whom it may concern\" letter is fine."

      "content": "Pick up your letter from your health care provider. Your health care provider may write your letter immediately, or they may have you come back for it. If you need it by a certain date, be sure and let them know that. [6] X Research source Once you get your letter, you're responsible for delivering it to the appropriate person. Before you give them your letter, make a copy of it for your own records."

      "title": "Draft a letter requesting reasonable accommodation.",
      "content": "Draft a letter requesting reasonable accommodation. Although you can request reasonable accommodation in a face-to-face conversation, or even over the phone, a written letter is a better method. You can lay out the reasons for your request, and you have a record of it.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source You can find sample letters online that you can use as guides. For example, the Disability Rights Center of Maine has several sample letters available at https://mainelse.org/sites/default/files/DRCSampleLetters.pdf . If you know the name of the recipient of the letter, address it specifically to them rather than using a generic salutation, such as \"to whom it may concern.\" There's nothing wrong with emailing the letter. However, if you anticipate resistance to your request, you might want to take it in person or mail it using a trackable method."

      "content": "Discuss the matter with someone in charge. Whether you're requesting accommodation from your landlord, or want to take your ESA on a plane, make sure the person you're talking to has the authority to grant your request. Otherwise, you could be challenged later on. Give them your letter requesting reasonable accommodation, as well as your letter from your health care provider. [8] X Research source Make your request in advance, and as soon as possible. If you leave it to the last minute, you risk putting yourself and others in a difficult or awkward situation. Be respectful, and don't put anyone on the spot or make demands. You may get resistance because people have abused the privilege of having an ESA so they can keep their pets with them. the person you talk to may have had bad experiences previously with someone who had an untrained or disruptive animal."

If the person you talk to agrees to let you have your ESA with you, ask them to give you a letter to that effect on company letterhead. You can use this as an official document if anyone hassles you later on. [9] X Research source Make several copies of this letter to ensure you always have one handy. Keep this letter as well as a copy of the letter from your health care provider with you whenever you are in public with your ESA."

      "content": "Pay any required fees or deposits to keep your ESA with you. Service animals are exempt from deposits or fees designed to cover damage to the property. However, an ESA is not exempt. If you're allowed to keep your ESA in no-pets housing, your landlord may ask you for an additional deposit. [10] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source You may also be required to pay a nonrefundable pet fee. If you're not able to pay the entire amount up front, find out if you can make installment payments over several months."

      "title": "Have your animal's temperament evaluated.",
      "content": "Have your animal's temperament evaluated. Not every animal can handle being an ESA. Even though you may not treat the animal any differently than you would a pet, the demands on the animal are different. Generally, your animal should have a calm, even temper. [11] X Research source For example, if you have anxiety, you wouldn't expect a nervous chihuahua that had a high anxiety level itself to have a calming influence on you. If you've not yet adopted your animal, choose a breed with an appropriate temperament for being an ESA. For example, if you're looking for a dog, consider breeds often used as service animals, such as retrievers and German Shepherds."

      "content": "Take your animal through basic obedience training courses. Particularly if you have a dog as your ESA, basic obedience training will ensure your dog behaves appropriately in public situations. For other types of animals, you may also be able to find training courses (although your options will likely be limited). [12] X Research source In some situations, you may be required to vouch for your ESA's behavior. For example, some airlines require ESA handlers to sign a written statement that their ESA is calm and well-behaved. [13] X Research source"

Nobody welcomes an animal that is not housebroken and makes a mess or damages property. [14] X Research source If an accident happens, clean it up yourself as quickly as possible. No one else is responsible for taking care of or cleaning up after your ESA."

Even though ESAs are not service animals, you should still hold yourself to the same standard. [15] X Research source If your animal is calm and obedient, this shouldn't be a problem. If you have a cat, rabbit, or other animal that can't exactly be \"trained,\" make sure you have the animal in a carrier or restrained in some way at all times when you're out in public."

      "content": "Follow established rules for handling your ESA. When you are permitted to have your ESA in no-pets housing or in a public place, there may be rules regarding what your ESA can and can't do, or where your animal is permitted to go. If you violate these rules, you may no longer be allowed to have your ESA with you. [16] X Research source For example, if you have a dog as your ESA, and your landlord requires dog owners to clean up after their animals outside, this applies to you as well. If you don't clean up after your dog, your landlord could evict you for a lease violation – regardless of your dog's status as your ESA."
