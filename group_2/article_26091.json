      "content": "Boost your overall happiness by acting in accordance with your values. Stop for a minute and think about what's most important to you. Not material possessions, but the people, circumstances, and feelings that make you feel like your life has meaning. These are the things you want to order your life around. As long as the things you do and the decisions you make follow along with those core values, you'll feel at peace. [1] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For example, you might determine that your loyalty to your friends is one of your core values. Anything you do that furthers that value will increase your overall happiness. Other core values might include empathy, faith, family, public service, community, human rights, or community."

      "content": "Counter negative self-talk by reinforcing how you live up to your core values. If you create your own affirmations that you repeat, you'll boost your self-esteem and start thinking more positively. Just 5 minutes a day can gradually improve your overall outlook so you start feeling happier about life. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if loyalty is one of your core values, you might repeat an affirmation like, \"I am a loyal and supportive friend who is worthy of love.\" Consistent repetition is the key if you want to reap the full benefit of positive affirmations. The longer you keep up this habit, the more improvement you'll see. Jain notes that \"95% of the time during the day we are having repetitive thoughts. So if you can learn... how to change even 1% of your thoughts in a day to be neutral or happy, then you can start changing your mind and changing the baseline on which you operate.\""

      "title": "Manage your stress by writing it out.",
      "content": "Manage your stress by writing it out. Keeping a journal allows you to be your own therapist, in a sense, and work through things that might be troubling you. A lot of times, you'll find that something you thought was a really big deal turns out to be nothing at all once you take a minute to think about it rationally. When it comes to journaling, structure matters a lot less than the act of doing it. If having a dedicated journal to use and a specific spot and time is helpful for you, do that. But don't stress out if you find it's easier for you to be more haphazard about it. It's great if you write in your journal every day, but journaling doesn't have to be a daily practice to be effective! Journal when you feel the need to and don't beat yourself up when you don't—you likely won't get as much out of it if you're forcing yourself to do it."

      "content": "Pay attention to how different foods make you feel. Some foods can potentially boost your mood while others have the opposite effect. Increase your overall happiness simply by eating more of the foods that make you happy and fewer of the foods that don't. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Studies have shown that more traditional diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, have lower risks of depression than a modern \"Western\" diet that includes lots of processed and refined foods and sugars. Eliminating sugars and processed foods from your diet for a couple of weeks can have a profound effect on your mood and overall sense of well-being. For best results, eat the rainbow every day with plenty of nutritious fruits and vegetables at every meal."

      "content": "Exercise to release feel-good chemicals in your brain. The neurochemicals and hormones your brain releases when you exercise automatically lift your spirits and put you in a better mood—and the effect tends to last for a while after you've stopped exercising. The more active you are throughout the day, the more happy hormones your brain will produce to keep your mood elevated. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Regular cardio and strength training are important, but it's also important to be active throughout the day. Spreading out your activity will make you feel better than if you only exercise for one hour first thing in the morning and then are sedentary for the rest of the day. For example, you might take the stairs instead of the elevator, or park in the back row of the parking lot so you have a longer walk."

      "content": "Hydration helps you have a happier mindset. Being dehydrated can definitely make you feel grumpy and out of sorts, but getting enough water actually improves your mood. It also helps your body function more smoothly so you can be more confident in yourself and have more energy to be more active. [5] X Research source Specifics on the amount of water you need vary depending on your height, weight, where you're located, and what you're doing. Generally, if you rarely feel \"thirsty\" and your urine is pale yellow or lighter, you're well hydrated. If you have a hard time drinking just plain water, try snacking on water-rich foods, such as watermelon. You could also mix flavors in your water or try a sparkling variety."

      "content": "Do something you're good at for a sense of achievement. You automatically feel a sense of pride when you get the opportunity to show off something you know you're really good at. You're also fine-tuning your already-expert skills in the process, so you'll gradually get even better. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The pride you feel in yourself can bleed over into other areas of your life. When you know you're great at something, it can help you be more forgiving of yourself when you're trying to learn something new. Doing something you're good at also reminds you of the benefits of investing your time and effort into something. When you see that you can excel at one thing, you start to believe it's possible to excel at something else."

Maintaining a work-life balance and making time for the things you enjoy is a great way to prevent burnout.

      "content": "Shift your mindset to become more resilient. Life's challenges might get you down, but with a growth mindset they won't take you out. That's because you know that you can adapt and change as circumstances require and still come out on top. You don't see failure as a threat, but as an opportunity to grow, and you embrace mistakes as learning opportunities . [8] X Research source When you have a growth mindset , you automatically look for the lessons you can learn out of any challenge or misfortune. You see struggle as a chance to gain new insights and enhance your perspective. Tan encourages you to \"try new things and keep an open mind about them.... If we are close-minded about any new experiences, that's a barrier to making life more interesting.\""

Notice any emotions that come up and how it feels to participate in the world around you. Starting a meditation practice is a great way to bring mindfulness into your daily life. You might also try yoga or tai chi . [9] X Research source Jain notes that when you're \"on autopilot mode, you're not really stopping to pause. Because life is so fast, you can learn to pause a little bit.\" Tan recommends meditation because \"personally, meditation brings me a lot of joy—with practice, I can access blissful emotions such as empowerment, gratitude, and a feeling of wholeness while I meditate. If I need a quick reset, I take 15 minutes out of the middle of my day to access those emotions and then continue on with a more positive mindset.\" Jain also recommends meditation, explaining that when you meditate, \"your subconscious mind has time to go ahead and start bringing you from the sympathetic mode to the parasympathetic mode of your nervous system, calming you down, and then you start feeling happier when you're calm and relaxed. Then you can look at life with more happiness and joy.\""

If you've never simply sat for a minute to reflect on the things in your life that you're grateful for, take a moment to do it now and pay attention to how it makes you feel. Start a list with 5 things you feel grateful for, then add another 5 things to your list each day. Over time, you'll find yourself overflowing with gratitude for the world around you. [10] X Research source Think about the little things as well as the big things. Often it's the little things that end up having the most tremendous impact on your life.

This is partly because your brain releases hormones that cause you to feel good. Break big goals into smaller goals to keep those good feelings coming. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that while you do want goals that you can realistically achieve within the planned time, you also want them to require some effort on your part. You won't get a sense of satisfaction from achieving a goal you were able to reach easily. [14] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Jain recommends that you set happiness as a goal, noting that \"if you make it a goal, then you're willing to put in some effort.
