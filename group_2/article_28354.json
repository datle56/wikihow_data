If you have not already done so, rinse your eyes out with a commercial eyewash or water if that's what you have on hand. f the problem is as a result of a contaminant such as a piece of dirt, this may be enough to solve the problem. Make sure the water and/or solution is at a temperature of between 60 °F (15.6 °C) and 100°F. If using water, use sterile water or bottled water. However, precautions should be taken to ensure that bacteria, other contaminants, or irritants are not introduced to the eyes, which are quite vulnerable to damage and infection. If you need to wash your eye because it came into contact with a contaminant, call poison control (800) 222-1222 and seek medical attention immediately in the case of a chemical burn or if another contaminant contacts your eye. You will be instructed as to whether you should wash your eye. [1] X Research source Note the following guidelines for eye washing: For mildly irritating chemicals, like hand soap or shampoo, rinse for five minutes. For moderate-to-severe irritants, like hot peppers, rinse for at least 20 minutes. For non-penetrating corrosives such as acids (like battery acid), rinse for 20 minutes. Call poison control and seek medical attention. For penetrating corrosives such as alkalis (like bleach or drain cleaner), rinse for at least 60 minutes. Call poison control and seek medical attention."

In some cases, a combination of a few brands may be even be necessary. In case of chronic dry eyes, artificial tears must be used even if the eyes are symptom free. Directions vary from brand to brand so follow the instructions on the label.

Do not apply ice directly to your eye as it could damage both your eye and the delicate skin around your eyes.

Eyestrain is on the rise due to the proliferation of screens, including televisions and computers but also more recently, smartphones. Symptoms included a itchy and dry eyes, pain, a sensation of a foreign object being in the eyes, and the feeling of tired eyes.

Symptoms are pain with blinking, pain with light, red eyes along with eye pain. Typically, hot compresses for 20 minutes four to six times daily can remove the blockage"

If your eye pain is accompanied by itchiness in other parts of your body, sneezing or a runny nose, you likely have allergies. Most people suffering from allergies notice that these symptoms are more pronounced during spring or autumn seasons where the pollen count is usually highest. Others may find that there allergies are related to certain animals, such as cats or dogs. [7] X Research source"

Most people who develop this type of pink eye would have already been suffering from a flu or cold. The best option in treating this form of pink eye is to simply use general home treatments to ease some of the pain. This type of pink eye will generally clear on its own in two to three days but last up to two weeks. Bacterial pink eye is generally caused by the same bacteria that is responsible for strep throat and is the most common type of pink eye. This bacteria lives on the surface of the skin and causes infections due to unhygienic practices such as frequent eye rubbing, improper hand washing or unsanitary contact lens use. This type of pink eye is distinguished by thick, yellow discharge from the eye and can result in rapid vision loss if not treated in a timely manner with antibiotics.

Viral conjunctivitis usually goes away on its own after two to three days and does not need antibiotics or other prescription medication. Treat allergic conjunctivitis with allergy medications, such as antihistamines (like over-the-counter Benadryl). In addition, most eye drops contain a compound known as tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride, which works as a vasoconstrictor and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels and makes them less noticeable.
