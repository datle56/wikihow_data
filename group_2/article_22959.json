When you overdraw your account, your new balance will reflect in the negatives, but you won't be charged an overdraft fee like with other major banks. When you get paid again or load your card , Chime will automatically apply it to your negative balance. Keep in mind this only applies to debit card purchases and cash withdrawals. This will not cover Pay Anyone transfers, ACH transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions.

While Chime doesn't offer cash advance , there are plenty of eligible apps that work seamlessly with Chime."
