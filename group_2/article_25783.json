      "content": "Identify why you are concerned about your nose. People tend to be influenced by their surroundings and the opinions of others. Maybe someone made an unkind remark about your nose to you one day, or you suddenly noticed an imperfection on your nose that bothers you. Or, you are focusing on the noses of others, like those of your friends or a famous model. Write down your thoughts about your nose. Ask yourself what it is you dislike about your nose. Is it too long, too big, too small, too square, too round? This will help you identify what judgments you’re making about yourself. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Figure out who or what influences your thinking. Unfortunately, people can say unkind things to you, even people close to you like friends or family. One of the first steps to combatting negative body image is recognizing who is saying unkind words to you. Because these are likely people you trust, you are probably taking their words to heart. Consider the extent to which you may be influenced by society’s expectations and ideas about the perfect nose. You also may be hyper-aware of noses in magazines, online, and on TV."

      "content": "Recognize when you are having extreme thoughts about your appearance. Often, negative thoughts come from imagining the most extreme or worst case scenario. Focusing just on your nose and making it the centerpiece of your life is an extreme behavior. There are so many other aspects of you that make you the way you are. For example, extreme thinking would be if you feel like you need to layer on a lot of makeup to downplay your nose before going out in public. In reality, people will likely not notice your nose at all."

      "content": "Recognize that noses change over a lifetime. A person’s nose will change shape over time. The support within the nose will weaken as a person ages, and the nose will start to slump. It may look a little longer or larger as a person gets older. No matter how you think your nose looks now, it will continue to change, just as the rest of your body will change."

      "content": "Try a cognitive belief exercise. This exercise helps remind us what we cognitively think is most important about a person. When we are asked what we like most about ourselves, we often name personality features over physical features. This reminds us that personality and capability are more important than physicality. [3] X Research source We are also reminded that we have the power to define our self-worth by our own terms, not by those imposed on us by our culture. Make a list of your three favorite physical features. You can train yourself to think more positively about your body overall. This might help you accept your nose and see it as beautiful too. List three of your favorite features. For example, you might say, “I like my eyes, I have long eyelashes, and I have nice toes.” List your favorite parts of your personality. You might say, “I am a hard worker, I’m a good friend, and I have a good sense of humor.” Put your two lists together and rank them in order of importance. Write one sentence about each list item. Most people who do this exercise tend to rank personality traits higher than physical traits."

[10] X Research source Lavanya, T; Margret, F. Maria. “The relationship between perceived body shape and self esteem among adults.” Indian Journal of Community Psychology. Vol.9(2), Sep 2013, pp. 338-349. One way to ensure that someone’s attention is not on your nose is to turn the conversation onto him or her. Everybody is proud of something, such as his occupation, family, church or beliefs. If you are worried that this person will notice your nose, listen closely to discover what someone is proud of.

Vol.23(2), 2001, pp. 1-18. . Once you have identified a point of pride, compliment the person about that. If possible, extend it into a related friendly joke.
