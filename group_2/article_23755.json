      "title": "Turn the electricity to the well pump off.",
      "content": "Turn the electricity to the well pump off. Before you do anything, flip the switch on your wall or tank to turn the electricity for your well pump off. The switch will either be installed on the wall near your tank or on the control unit itself. If you don’t know where the electrical switch for the pump is, you can flip the breaker for the room that the well system is in. [1] X Research source Turning the electricity off will hold the water supply from the source in place. This means that no new water will be fed into your tank. This will also prevent you from getting electrocuted if you have to touch the circuits in your control system. If you’re using a submersible system, make sure that you close the water line manually first. There should be a valve near the location where the pipe turns downward into the ground."

      "title": "Attach a hose to the water spigot on your control system.",
      "content": "Attach a hose to the water spigot on your control system. You need to shut off the water and drain your pressure tank in order to diagnose and resolve pressure-related issues in your well system. To start, screw a hose on to the water spigot near your control system. Run the hose to a safe area outside where you can empty a few dozen gallons of water. [2] X Research source If you live in a residential area, you can run the hose out to the nearest gutter. If there is water dripping off of your spigot when you go to attach the hose, this could be your problem. Try tightening the valve on the spigot. If it’s still dripping when it’s tightly closed, replace it. This may solve minor pressure issues."

      "title": "Close the water shutoff to prevent air from getting in your pipes.",
      "content": "Close the water shutoff to prevent air from getting in your pipes. After you attach and run your hose, close the water shutoff to your building. The water shutoff is usually a flat handle sticking out the top of your pipe. If you have one, it is between the tank and the pipe running the water into the building. Turn it so that it’s not parallel to the pipe to turn it off. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn the drain valve on your runoff spigot to release the water.",
      "content": "Turn the drain valve on your runoff spigot to release the water. Turn the valve on top of your spigot to open the water runoff. This will allow the water in your tank to empty out through the hose. The well system will use the pressure already in the tank to push out the water. [4] X Research source This should typically be done once every 6-8 months for maintenance. This process removes sediment and debris from your pipes."

      "title": "Monitor the pressure gauge as the water drains for spikes or odd readings.",
      "content": "Monitor the pressure gauge as the water drains for spikes or odd readings. Pay attention to the gauge above your drain valve as the water empties out of the tank. The needle on the gauge should go down very slowly at first as the water initially drains. It should drop rapidly to 0 psi once the water passes the pressure sensor at the bottom of your tank. If the gauge doesn’t respond, behaves erratically, or shoots up and down when you’re draining the tank, contact a well-water system repair company. The problem is likely electrical and requires a licensed professional to fix it. [5] X Research source Psi stands for pounds per square inch. It is the unit used to measure pressure. Once the pressure reads 0 psi, your tank is empty. Close the spigot once you’ve drained it."

      "title": "Unscrew the air fill valve on the top of your water tank to access your air valve.",
      "content": "Unscrew the air fill valve on the top of your water tank to access your air valve. Once your tank is at 0 psi and there is no more water coming out of the hose, your tank is empty. Inspect the top of the tank and you’ll see 2 caps. The bigger one is the well cap, and the smaller one is the air fill valve. Unscrew the smaller cap by hand to access the air fill valve. [6] X Research source Depending on your specific brand, the air fill valve may be on the side near the top. If the screw is screwed on too tight to remove, try using a wrench or channel locks to loosen it. The air fill valve is usually the smallest cap on the top of the tank. It is rarely in the center of the top though."

      "title": "Attach a pressure gauge to the air valve and wait for the needle to stop moving.",
      "content": "Attach a pressure gauge to the air valve and wait for the needle to stop moving. Screw your pressure gauge on to the air fill valve. Tighten it by twisting it on to the threads of your air valve or clamping it on with the locking mechanism by flipping the switch on the gauge. Put your ear near the valve to make sure that there is no air escaping from the valve. Once the gauge is airtight on the valve, watch the needle on the pressure gauge and wait for it to adjust to the pressure on your tank. [7] X Research source If you hear air coming out of the air fill valve either before or after you take the cap off, your air fill valve may need to be replaced. This typically requires a professional to install it."

      "title": "Read the gauge and cross-reference your manual to check the cut-in setting.",
      "content": "Read the gauge and cross-reference your manual to check the cut-in setting. Check the reading on your gauge to make sure that air in your empty tank is 1-10 psi below the cut-in pressure. You’ve emptied the water in your tank, so the pressure should be a little lower than your normal cut-in pressure. If the psi in your tank is within this range, there is likely no problem in your tank. [8] X Research source The most common cut-in/cut-out configurations for pressure tanks are 30/50 and 40/60. These numbers refer to the pressure level at which your pump adds or releases pressure in the tank."

      "title": "Replace your pressure tank if your gauge reads 0.",
      "content": "Replace your pressure tank if your gauge reads 0. If your tank goes all the way down to 0 psi when the needle on your pressure gauge has settled, there is an issue with the way that your tank maintains and regulates pressure. Replace the entire pressure tank by contacting the company that installed it. [9] X Research source If the gauge flutters all over the place, make sure that your air pressure gauge is working correctly. Try testing it on an inflated tire to ensure that it is working correctly. Unless you installed the tank yourself, this typically requires a professional installation."

      "title": "Add air if your tank pressure is lower than 2 psi below your cut-in threshold.",
      "content": "Add air if your tank pressure is lower than 2 psi below your cut-in threshold. If your tank is higher than 0 psi, but more than 2 psi under the cut-in pressure, you need to add air to the pressure tank. Attach a bike pump or air compressor to the air fill valve and fill it up for 15-45 seconds. Check the pressure again with your gauge and continue adding air and checking the pressure until you’re exactly 2 psi under the cut-in threshold. [10] X Research source Never go over your cut-in pressure. This can create a dangerous scenario where there is too much pressure in the tank for the amount of water in it. If you add too much air, simply press lightly on the air fill valve from the side. If you hear air escaping, it’s emptying. If it can’t be pressed to the side, attach a compressor halfway until you hear the air shooting out. This is the most common problem with the water pressure in a well system."

      "title": "Close the spigot, turn the power on, and wait for the automatic cut-off to make sure it’s accurate.",
      "content": "Close the spigot, turn the power on, and wait for the automatic cut-off to make sure it’s accurate. Turn the spigot where your hose is attached so that it’s closed. Remove your hose. Turn the shutoff valve back to its original position. Turn the power back on and watch the pressure gauge on the control unit to make sure that it shuts off automatically at the correct psi. If it cuts-off early, increase the cut-off by adjusting it on your pressure control switch. [11] X Research source Open the water shutoff once you’ve verified that your tank is cutting off automatically at the correct psi. If your well system had no shutoff valve to lock out the water in the building, it may take a while for the pressure to rebuild."

      "title": "Adjust the pump pressure control switch if your pressure gauge doesn’t match the control unit.",
      "content": "Adjust the pump pressure control switch if your pressure gauge doesn’t match the control unit. If the tank reading is 2 psi under the cut-in when you measured it manually, but the gauge on the control unit is still low when there’s water in it, adjust the pressure on your control switch. Look for a grey or black box behind the gauge with a coil on it. Try tightening the nut on top for 1-2 rotations and then recheck the pressure gauge on the control unit. Tighten the nut as necessary until it reads no more than 2 psi under the cut-in. [12] X Research source The pressure control switch sends the signal to the tank that it needs to turn on or off. If the switch is reading the pressure as being lower than the actual pressure, fixing the discrepancy should solve your pressure problems."

      "title": "Check the pressure-reducing valve on your supply line and try adjusting it if everything else works.",
      "content": "Check the pressure-reducing valve on your supply line and try adjusting it if everything else works. If everything is working and the pressure in the tank is 2 psi under the cut-in, try checking the pressure-reducing valve on the supply line where you’re getting your water. A reducing valve looks like a bulky fixture with a bell-shaped cap, and it will be attached to the pipe between the wall where your water main is and the tank. Tighten the screw on top of the valve to see if that solves any issues related to pressure in your home. [13] X Research source The pressure-reducing valve controls how fast the water is fed into your system from the water main. If it’s loose, it could be interfering with the amount of water that is supposed to be coming into your building. If the pressure-reducing valve is broken, leaking, or spinning in place, replace it. You may not have a pressure-reducing valve on your tank system depending where you live."

      "content": "Contact a plumber to inspect and clean your pipes if you can’t find a problem. If everything appears to be working on your water system, you may have a damaged or blocked pipe. Contact a plumber to inspect your pipes and identify the problem. The issue could be related to a pipe that you can’t even see. [14] X Research source A plumber will be able to replace pipes and clear blockages. Unless you have experience replacing pipes and resealing walls, don’t open up sections of flooring or drywall to look for a problem in your pipes. Let a professional do it."

      "title": "Install a pressure booster if the well system is working and your pipes are clean.",
      "content": "Install a pressure booster if the well system is working and your pipes are clean. If everything is working and you have a supply pipe that is 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) or bigger, you can install a pressure booster. A pressure booster is a water reserve that uses an electric pump to artificially add more pressure from your water main. The installation process for a pressure booster is different depending on the brand or type of booster you buy; follow the instructions for your specific booster to attach it to your well system. [15] X Research source Some pressure boosters involve cutting out a section of pipe in between your regulator and the tank and to store a reserve of water. You will need to cut pipes and add threading to install these boosters. Many pressure boosters involve installing multiple valves and pressure gauges along your supply line to push water through at a faster rate. Some pressure boosters are all-in-one units, and replace a section of your control unit or regulator with a second pump system. If the pipe that connects to your water main is smaller than 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm), there won’t be enough room for the pressure booster to help. You can buy a pressure booster online or from a plumbing specialist."

      "title": "Add a constant pressure system to your water line to stabilize pressure permanently.",
      "content": "Add a constant pressure system to your water line to stabilize pressure permanently. A constant pressure system can be attached to modify the way your tank cuts in and out. Like boosters, a constant pressure system is installed differently depending on the brand or type or system. Instead of turning on and off based on the amount of pressure in the tank, a constant pressure system will keep the tank at a single, consistent level of pressure. [16] X Research source Most constant pressure systems are installed on the submersible pump, in between the regulator and the water main, or on the control unit directly. If a constant pressure unit is installed on the submersible pump, you’ll need a plumber to access the pump underground. A constant pressure system basically turns your well system into a municipal system."
