      "content": "Combine concrete mix and water in a 3:1 ratio. Brick mason Gerber Ortiz-Vega says, “The easiest way to mix concrete is to buy bagged concrete mix. Usually, you’ll add 1 part water to every 3 parts concrete mix.” Pour the concrete mix into a wheelbarrow or a large bucket—something that will be easy to scoop from. Make a well in the middle and slowly add the water, then stir everything together until the mix is evenly wet. Measure the water—don’t estimate how much you’re adding. This will ensure every batch of concrete has the same consistency. If you’re not sure how much concrete to mix up, check out our section on how many blocks one bag of cement will produce . If you want to make your concrete from scratch, try a cement-sand-aggregate ratio of 1:3:6. This means you’ll use 1 part concrete, 3 parts sand, and 1 part of an aggregate like gravel or cracked rock.

      "content": "Oil the block molds for easier release. To keep the concrete from sticking to the inside of the mold, spray your block form or wipe it down with oil or concrete form release . If you’re using a mold made of wood, apply the oil the night before if possible. This will allow it to soak into the wood, making it more effective. [3] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source You probably won’t need to re-apply oil after every block. Just wipe the concrete out of the mold, and only add more oil if it seems like the concrete is sticking to the mold. If you want to create hollow concrete blocks, place PVC pipes in the center of the molds or purchase a hollow brick mold . If you’re not sure what type of mold to use, check out our section on choosing a concrete mold ."

      "content": "Scoop the concrete into the molds and tamp it down. Use a shovel to fill the block form with concrete. After each scoop, use a tamper or the end of a wooden board and tap the concrete down firmly. This will help remove trapped air—bubbles in the concrete will compromise the integrity of your bricks. Keep scooping and tamping the concrete until the mold is filled. [4] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source Use a trowel or straight edge to scrape any excess concrete off the top of the mold.

      "content": "Carefully remove the form from the concrete block. As soon as you finish shaping the block, remove it from the form. [5] X Research source The concrete won’t be set, so you’ll need to work carefully—if you move too quickly or bump the block with the form, you could damage your brick. The exact way you unmold the concrete will depend on the type of mold you use: [6] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source If you made a simple wooden mold held together by screws, loosen the screws so you can slide the mold off of the brick. Some forms have handles or a footplate to help you secure the block as you remove the mold. You can also cut a piece of wood or styrofoam to fit just inside the mold. Place it on top of the concrete block, then gently press down on the piece as you slide the form up and off of the block. This will give you leverage, but you won’t have to push directly on the block."

      "content": "Cover the blocks with plastic sheets for the first 24 hours. After removing the block from the form, leave the block where it is for at least 48 hours—it might crumble if you try to move it. Put a plastic sheet over the block for the first 24 hours. On the second day, remove the plastic sheeting and sprinkle a little water on the blocks. [7] X Research source This will help prevent cracks. After about 48 hours, the bricks will be hardened enough that you can stack them on top of each other."

      "title": "Let the blocks cure for about 2 weeks before you use them.",
      "content": "Let the blocks cure for about 2 weeks before you use them. Even though it will only take a couple of days for the blocks to be strong enough to stack, it will be about 2 weeks before the concrete is cured enough to actually build with it. If you use the blocks sooner than that, the blocks may shrink or crack, and your structure could collapse. [8] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source Sprinkle water on the bricks every day for the first week. Construction specialist Alberto DeJesus says, “To make sure your concrete cures properly, do your project when it’s at least 50 °F (10 °C) out and not raining.” Once the blocks are cured, store them in a dry area out of direct sunlight."

      "content": "Make your own form out of wood. To make a simple wood form, cut 4 pieces of wood, then nail, glue, or screw them into a rectangular box. [9] X Research source It will be easiest to remove the form if you use screws—place a screw on the top and bottom of each corner, so a total of 8 screws for a simple box. After you mold your block, remove the screws and carefully pull each piece of the form off of the block. If you don’t want to unscrew the form, try cutting a smaller piece of wood, styrofoam, or another sturdy material as a lid. Cut it so it passes smoothly through the mold. After you make a block, place this lid on top of the brick. Press down on the lid to hold the brick in place as you lift the mold to remove it. To make several blocks at once, build a long rectangular box, then add small pieces of wood as dividers, evenly spaced along the box. To create holes in the center of the block, insert PVC pipe into the center of the mold before you add the concrete."

      "content": "Buy a concrete form if you don’t want to make one. You can buy concrete block forms in a variety of shapes and sizes. This can be an easier option if you want to make hollow cinderblocks or decorative blocks. Additionally, these forms may come with handles, lids, plates, or other features designed to make it easier to remove the form from the block. Some forms are slightly tapered so they’ll slide off of the block more easily. You can buy rectangular molds to make standard blocks, hollow molds for traditional cinderblocks, or decorative molds for things like pavers. Pre-made concrete molds are often made of wood , plastic , or stainless steel . These molds should be treated with oil or concrete release agent so they’ll slide off the block after molding. Some form kits come with presses you can use to create designs on the surface of the concrete."

      "title": "Use homemade concrete blocks for anything except tall walls.",
      "content": "Use homemade concrete blocks for anything except tall walls. Homemade blocks can replace commercial concrete blocks in almost any project. For instance, you might use your blocks to create a raised garden bed, planter, fire pit, garden border, or retaining wall. You could even stack the blocks and add a longboard to create your own table or bench. If you’re building tall walls, it’s safer to purchase pre-made concrete blocks, as they will have gone through a rigorous quality control process. It’s probably more cost-effective than making your own blocks, too. If you’d like to paint your finished concrete, painting specialist Andrew Kazimierski recommends starting with a coat of masonry primer, then finishing with a top coat. He says, “Be sure to let the concrete cure for about 30 days before painting it.”"

[11] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source Some people skip the gravel in concrete blocks and just mix cement and sand at a ratio of between 1:6 and 1:8.
