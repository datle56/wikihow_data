      "title": "LOML stands for “Love of my life.”",
      "content": "LOML stands for “Love of my life.” The most common definition for LOML when it comes to texting and social media is “Love of my life,” referring to your soulmate—a person you love more than anybody else. This acronym typically describes a literal romantic partner or spouse and conveys your strong, deep feelings for them. However, it can alternatively describe a figurative or joking “love of my life.” [1] X Research source “We’ve been married for 5 years, and I’ve known every day that you’re the LOML.” “Romance? Nah. I am absolutely not joking when I say my dog is the true LOML.” LOML can sometimes also mean “Light of my life,” which is a different phrase with the same basic meaning as “Love of my life,\" describing a romantic soulmate. When saying LOML out loud, some people may pronounce it like a word (“lommul”), and some might say each individual letter (“L O M L”). However, many choose to say “love of my love” directly."

When you’re using LOML to refer to a romantic partner or spouse, why not text it to them directly to share your heartfelt feelings? Let them know that they’re the love of your life and you care for them more than anything. In a loving relationship, few sentiments are as sweet and meaningful as this one! [2] X Research source “Just wanted to remind you that you’re truly the LOML. My favorite person in the world! ❤️” “Meeting you proved to me that soulmates exist. You’re the LOML! 💋🥰”"

      "content": "Describe the person you love to someone else using LOML. Love often makes people so joyful they want to shout their feelings from the rooftops! If you’re dying to dish on how amazing your significant other is, send LOML in a text to describe them. This will quickly show the other person how serious—and deep—your feelings are. [3] X Research source “I think Maya is really the LOML. She’s incredible!” “I’ve known Alex is the LOML for a while now. I can’t wait for you to meet them!” While this acronym typically describes adult partners and spouses, teens might use it to talk about a boyfriend, girlfriend, or significant other as well."

      "title": "Exaggerate your love of a person or character playfully with LOML.",
      "content": "Exaggerate your love of a person or character playfully with LOML. You can also use LOML figuratively, describing somebody or something as the “love of your life” when you don’t actually think of them romantically. For example, you could jokingly call your pet the love of your life or get super attached to a fictional character and declare them your soulmate. [4] X Research source “Why do I need a spouse when my cat is the LOML?” “No spouse will ever measure up to the true LOML, Clark Kent. 🤪” When you use LOML this way, it’s implied that you aren’t actually being serious. However, you could also use a goofy emoji like 🤪 or a laughing emoji like 😂 to show you’re exaggerating."

It feels great to be loved, especially by someone you presumably love too. Send them a romantic, heartfelt text in return. If you like, you could even return the gesture and tell them they’re the love of your life too. [5] X Research source Person 1: “Sending kisses to the LOML! 💋💋💋” Person 2: “Thank you, darling!

Let them know how happy you are that they found their soulmate . Person 1: “It’s official: Candice is the LOML! 😍 Want to meet her sometime?” Person 2: “Absolutely!

You could agree with their quip (for example, if they talk about a character you really like too), or just jokingly congratulate them on finding the fake love of their life. Person 1: “Would you be disappointed in me if I said I was done dating and my dog is the real LOML?” Person 2: “LOL, not at all. I’m sure you two will be very happy together. 😂😉”"

The only difference is the “OT” at the beginning, giving OTLOML extra emphasis. “Drew is the OTLOML, I’m sure of it! ❤️” “Oh my GOD. My life is forever changed. This insanely good quesadilla is the OTLOML!” Another abbreviation is “TLOML,” or “The love of my life.” It’s extremely similar to the original LOML and has the same overall meaning as both LOML and OTLOML."

      "content": "JOML means “Joy of my life.” While it’s a different phrase altogether than LOML, this acronym has the same basic meaning; JOML refers to a person you love deeply, typically a romantic partner or soulmate. “Joy of my life” describes a person who makes you feel more joy than any other, so you can use it when texting your partner or describing them to someone else. [6] X Research source “You are the JOML. I can’t imagine life without you! ❤️” “Meg is amazing! Truly the JOML.”"

While there’s no definitive date or year for LOML’s invention, it was first used with message boards, instant messenger, and text messaging in the late 1990s and early 2000s. [7] X Research source The T9 keypads at the time had limited characters and were difficult to type on, so condensing phrases into acronyms like LOML became common practice. By the late 2000s, LOML was used widely across social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, as well as text messages!"
