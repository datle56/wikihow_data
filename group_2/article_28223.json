      "title": "Buy fake nails and denture adhesive cream.",
      "content": "Buy fake nails and denture adhesive cream. To make your vampire fangs, purchase a set of white fake nails that matches the color of your teeth. You can find fake nails and denture adhesive cream at your local drug store, supermarket, or online. Many artificial nails come in a semi-sheer finish that looks similar to the tooth enamel, but you can also use a more opaque style. If you can’t find white fake nails, use a light nude or off-white color instead."

      "title": "Select nails that match the width of your teeth.",
      "content": "Select nails that match the width of your teeth. Hold a few different sized nails over your canine teeth to ensure your fangs fit properly. Start with the smallest nails in the set, then gradually increase the size until you find the best shape. [1] X Research source Your canine tooth is the third tooth from the center of your mouth. It should look pointier than your other teeth. Be sure to use the same nail size if you want identical fangs."

      "title": "File the nails to a sharp point.",
      "content": "File the nails to a sharp point. Use a metal nail file to smooth out any rough edges and file each nail into a fang shape. To keep your workspace clean, place newspaper underneath the nails to catch any debris that may fall. [3] X Research source As you’re filing, hold the nails against each other to ensure they’re the same shape. Alternatively, use sandpaper to file the nail into a sharp tooth shape."

      "title": "Stick the tooth on with a dab of denture adhesive cream.",
      "content": "Stick the tooth on with a dab of denture adhesive cream. To help the adhesive stick better, dry your tooth and gum with a clean tissue. Add a small dot of denture adhesive cream on the back of the nail, and gently press it onto your tooth. Hold it in place for 10-15 seconds until the adhesive sets, then flash your best smile to look like a vampire ! [4] X Research source Avoid sleeping and eating with your fangs on—you don’t want to accidentally swallow them!"

      "content": "Find a white plastic straw. It’s perfectly fine if the straw doesn’t match the color of your teeth, especially if you’re just wearing them for a party or photo! If you’re really concerned about matching the shade of the straw to your teeth, you can always whiten your teeth with a whitening strip or pen ."

      "title": "Cut off a small piece of the straw.",
      "content": "Cut off a small piece of the straw. Use a pair of scissors to cut off a piece of straw that’s about 2 inches (5 cm) long—this will serve as both fangs. [5] X Research source If your straw is a bendy, you can simply cut off the top portion, right above the accordion bend."

      "title": "Fold the piece of straw in half and trim it into fangs.",
      "content": "Fold the piece of straw in half and trim it into fangs. Bend the cut-off piece of straw in half, then use a pair of scissors to trim the bent side into a pointed, triangular shape, but leave the bent straw intact (so, cut your pointed tip all the way across the horizontal length of the straw). The pointed end will act as the tip of your fangs. [6] X Research source The open ends of the straw will act as the base of your fangs (allowing you to secure the fangs over your teeth), so make sure you don’t cut too close to the open end of the straw."

      "title": "Pull the straw apart and cut off the back side of each fang.",
      "content": "Pull the straw apart and cut off the back side of each fang. Rip the straw along the bent crease to separate it into 2 “fangs.” On each fang, there will be a “front” and “back” side (since the straw is circular). Trim off the back side of each fang so you’re left with a clean finish. [7] X Research source If you leave the back side intact, you’ll be able to see a piece of straw behind your tooth when you wear your fangs, making them look less realistic."

      "title": "Cut 2 small slits at the base of each fang and wear them.",
      "content": "Cut 2 small slits at the base of each fang and wear them. At the base of your fang (the open end of the straw), cut 2 vertical slits on the outer corners to make the straw more flexible. This allows you to slide the fang over your tooth more securely. Then, feel free to dress like a vampire and show off your new fangs! [8] X Research source"

In most cases, you can combine one part alginate and one part water in a small dish, mixing the 2 ingredients together with any utensil. Once it’s combined, transfer the alginate mixture into your mouth guard. [10] X Research source Alginate is a non-toxic molding powder made out of kelp. You can find it online or at your local art or dental supply store. Be sure to make your fangs as soon as the mold sets—alginate is delicate so it can crack within a few hours."

Slowly press the alginate-filled mouth guard into your upper teeth, making sure your teeth don’t hit the bottom of the mouth guard. Wait 3 minutes for the mold to become solid, then gently remove it by pulling down. [11] X Research source If you want a more accurate way of determining when the alginate is ready to remove, place a small dot of it on your finger and watch for it to turn solid. If there are bubbles or broken pieces in the negative, it can interfere with the mold for your fangs. Make another batch of alginate mold and repeat this step."

Pour slowly and carefully to avoid trapping air bubbles in the cast, then follow the instructions of your product to let it dry. [13] X Research source Within several minutes of being poured, the plastic will turn white and hot—do not touch it with your bare skin! After the plastic sets, wait an additional 10 minutes before removing it from the mold. This gives the inside plenty of time to dry, ensuring the plastic model of your teeth is solid."

Stir the ingredients with a disposable utensil until it turns into a paste. When you lift the utensil, it should drag up a string of acrylic. [18] X Research source Since you only need enough acrylic mixture to fill the fang holes of your alginate mold, just eyeball a small amount of powder and liquid. Add more powder if the mixture is too runny, or more liquid if it is too hard. The acrylic may become warm as it mixes, so avoid direct contact with your skin. Be sure to mix the acrylic in a well-ventilated area, and don’t use any equipment you plan to reuse."

      "content": "Press your tooth cast into the mold and let the acrylic harden. Gently push your ordinary tooth cast (without the clay fangs) into the alginate mold. The teeth of the mold should push right into the acrylic, letting the acrylic harden and adapt to the shape of your teeth. [20] X Research source Watch the leftover acrylic in your mixing bowl to gauge how much the acrylic has hardened, then remove the cast when the acrylic is mostly hard. Even though the acrylic is a little rubbery, it should still keep its shape when you slip it off."

Hold the triangles over your teeth to see if you need to trim off any excess, and cut them until you achieve your desired shape. When you’re ready to attach the cotton, dry your tooth and gum area, then stick them over your canines for instant fangs. When the cotton is damp, it should stick to your teeth without any glue, giving you enough time to snap a quick photo. If you plan to wear your fangs for longer, apply a thin coating of denture adhesive powder over the back of the fang, then press it over your tooth—the moisture from the cotton activates the adhesive and makes it sticky.

      "content": "Work around your braces by using braces wax. If you have braces, make vampire fangs by molding a strip of braces wax into a triangular shape. Once you’re happy with the look of your fangs, stick the wax between your canine teeth and your braces wire. Since the wax is a sticky self-adhesive, it should stay in place as long as you don’t eat or drink anything. For a more realistic looking fang, combine the wax with a little bit of white non-toxic clay, then press it directly onto your tooth."
