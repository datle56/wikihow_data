      "content": "“IMK” is an acronym for “In My Knowledge.” When you see “imk” in a text from a friend or on places like TikTok or Instagram, it usually means the sender is pretty confident about their answer but not completely sure. It’s another way of informally saying, “If I recall correctly,” “As far as I know,” or “I think so.” [1] X Research source You: “Do you think Justin is coming tonight?” Them: “Imk, I sent him the invite, and he said bet.” You: “Can Mom pick you up after school?” Them: “Imk, she said she was free, so…”"

      "title": "“Imk” is often mistaken for “Let Me Know.”",
      "content": "“Imk” is often mistaken for “Let Me Know.” Due to the similar appearance of an uppercase “I” and lowercase “L,” sometimes “Imk” can be a misspelling of another popular texting term, “LMK” which stands for “Let Me Know.” It’s used to have someone expand on an idea or to request more information. [2] X Research source You: “Hey, lmk if you can come over tonight. Got cash to order food!” Them: “I’m just waiting for my mom to come home, so I’ll lyk soon.”"

      "content": "Use “IMK” to share information that you believe is correct. Want to tell someone you’re pretty sure about something? Send a quick “IMK” message. The information is based on your experience or knowledge, so it’s important to remember that it doesn’t mean it’s 100% accurate. [3] X Research source Them: “Yo, I thought you said Justina and Devin broke up?” You: “Imk!! She said she wasn’t talking to him anymore.”"

      "title": "Learn how the sender got their information.",
      "content": "Learn how the sender got their information. If you received an “IMK” text, it’s okay not to feel just as confident as the sender does. After all, it’s based on information that’s privy to them—not you. Feel free to ask questions or follow up about how the other person gained that information to help shape your understanding or how you respond to a situation. Them: “Imk the test next week isn’t happening.” You: “Where’d you hear that from?” Them: “I overheard Mrs. Jamison telling the guidance counselor Mr. P will be out for the next two weeks, so they’re trying to find a sub.” You: “Dang. I think I’ll still study tho, just in case.”"

      "content": "I’ll Message You This may be a less common usage for “IMK,” but some users have used the acronym to stand for “I’ll Message You,” indicating they’ll share information in your DMs rather than in the public comments on Instagram or TikTok.
