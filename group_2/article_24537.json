      "content": "Italian brainrot is a trend where users make surreal AI-generated animals. Well, to start, it doesn’t actually have much to do with Italy. Basically, people on TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram, and other social media platforms are using AI to generate images of wacky animals combined with objects like cacti or planes. When they share their creations, they give them vaguely Italian-sounding, gibberish names, like “Tralalero Tralala,” which is a shark wearing sneakers. [1] X Research source They also often give these characters backstories that include other characters, making a sort of connected universe of brainrot animals. For example, check out this YouTube video explaining the entire backstory of Tralalero Tralala in an Italian brainrot-esque style. Often, the characters are posted in video format, with AI voice-overs or songs about their bizarre backstories, like the fictional wars each character has fought in or who their rivals are, to accompany them. However, since the voiceovers are often in another language and assumed to be nonsense, they may contain offensive language and/or views of the creator. Most of the videos are still images of the characters with flame effects, slide show animations, and other basic effects."

      "content": "The Italian brainrot trend started on TikTok in January 2025. The first widely popular Italian brainrot post came from user @eZburger401 on TikTok (who has since been banned) when they posted the now-popular “Tralalero Tralala” soundbite. Days later, the user @amoamimandy.1a posted a video with the sound featuring an AI-generated shark, which exploded in popularity and inspired a wave of imitators. [5] X Research source The trend was cemented when the second character, Bombardiro Crocodilo (a bomber plane with the head of a crocodile), established the format. From there, things developed pretty quickly, and it’s hard to say who coined the term “Italian brainrot,” but that’s more or less how this all started. The rest is internet history."

      "content": "Italian brainrot pairs AI trends with absurdism and silly humor. AI is, for better or worse, all the rage these days. It’s a fun toy that can generate images, text, and sound just from a few commands. Combine that with the nonsensical humor of the internet, and you’ve got a recipe for success. The point of Italian brainrot is that it’s goofy, absurd, and is an opportunity for users to show off their own AI creations. Italian brainrot is also hard to co-opt for ads and marketing, which might make it especially appealing to advertisement-weary internet users. Some say Italian brainrot is “post-ironic,” meaning that everyone knows it’s kind of stupid, but they enjoy it anyway, and often because it’s kind of stupid."

To make an Italian brainrot meme, you’ll need to use an AI program like ChatGPT , or the native AI program on your device (like Cortana or Apple Intelligence). Ask the program to generate an image of the craziest animal-object mashup you can think of, like a rose-spider hybrid or a caterpillar with boots. Once you’ve got your image, post it to TikTok or your social media of choice. Use a popular sound, if possible, and tag it as #Italianbrainrot or #brainrotanimals. To add more depth, ask the AI to generate a backstory for your character, then ask it to translate the backstory to Italian. Include this backstory in your post. Or, exercise your imagination and write your own backstory!"

      "content": "Some Italian brainrot animals and sounds are vulgar or explicit. The voice-overs and background stories for certain characters aren’t always safe for kids or work. Sometimes, they include warped, somewhat concerning representations of current events, politics, or history. Some voice-overs are offensive to certain religions or groups of people, as well. Of course, these descriptions are often in different languages, meaning an English-speaking person probably won’t understand them unless they go out of their way to look up their translations."

      "content": "AI comes with its own set of controversies. The use of generative AI in any use case, not just Italian brainrot, has prompted many opponents and criticisms. For one, AI uses a huge amount of electricity and power in order to operate, meaning it has an overall negative environmental impact. [7] X Research source Using AI to generate brainrot animals may contribute to this impact. In addition, many critics have pointed out that AI “learns” by studying stolen data, like artworks or written works, which infringes on copyright. Others say that AI can lead to a dependence on AI, replacing someone’s skill, creativity, or critical thinking the more they use it."

Supposedly, your brain turns to mush and you start saying things like “skibidi gyatt rizzler.” The meaning has morphed over time, and now it sort of just describes any meme, joke, thought, or behavior that’s silly, nonsensical, or absurd.

      "content": "The Italian brainrot trend uses AI to make absurdist animal characters. These mashups usually have vaguely Italian-sounding names and unique backstories that reference other animals. The trend started on TikTok in January 2025 with the creation of the Tralalero Tralala character, a shark wearing Nike sneakers. The meme format is appealing because of its bizarre imagery, use of AI trends, and “post-ironic” humor. “Brainrot” is a word that describes silly or nonsensical behavior caused by too much social media usage. While they’re goofy fun for many users, Italian brainrot may be seen as insensitive toward Italian people, and the contents of some of the memes may be considered edgy or offensive to certain cultures."
