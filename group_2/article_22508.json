      "content": "Decide how long you want the skirt to be, and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to it. You will need this extra length for the hem. If your skirt has a lining, and you need to hem it as well, plan on having it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the finished skirt."

      "content": "Draw a line across the skirt where you need to cut it using dressmaker's chalk. Consider using a hem gauge to measure upward from the hem while you draw the line. This will ensure that you will be cutting an equal amount off all around the skirt. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a ruler or measuring tape instead."

      "content": "Fold the hem down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), secure it with sewing pins, then press it with an iron. Be sure that you are folding towards the wrong size of the fabric (inside the skirt). If you have a serger, or if your serving machine has an overlock stitch, you can skip the folding and use that instead. When you are done, remove the sewing pins. Pressing the hem with an iron helps smooth out the fabric so that it's easier to sew."

      "title": "Consider sewing the hem down using a sewing machine.",
      "content": "Consider sewing the hem down using a sewing machine. Try to get as close to the folded edge as you can. About 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch (0.16 to 0.32 centimeters) will be enough. Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric. This is ideal for those who are working with skirt linings and thinner materials."

      "title": "Consider blind stitching the hem.",
      "content": "Consider blind stitching the hem. Thread a needle, and tie a knot at the end of the thread. Use the needle to pull the thread through the hem. Catch 1 to 2 threads from the skirt material, then bring the needle back into the hem. Pull the needle ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) through the hem, then use it to catch 1 to 2 threads from the skirt material again. Keep blind stitching until the hem is all sewn up. Knot the end of the thread, and snip the rest off. [1] X Research source Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric. This is great for those working with a heavier or thicker material."

      "content": "Draw a line around the skirt where you need to cut it, then cut along that line. Consider using a hem gauge to measure up from the bottom of the skirt to the cutting point. This will help ensure that you are cutting an even amount off all along the hem. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a measuring tape or ruler instead. If you are cutting a skirt lining, cut it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the skirt itself."

      "content": "Using a sewing machine, straight stitch a line ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) away from the cut edge. Try to use a higher thread tension for this. This will help make the hem easier to fold later on. It will also create a sort of guideline for you, so you won't have to make as many measurements.
