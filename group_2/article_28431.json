Keep in mind, however, that it won't physically make your nose smaller. Also, if you have a very long nose, contouring will not make your nose look shorter in side view. When you're contouring your nose, think about what you can do to create the shape you want it to have. If you have a really long nose, for instance, and you want it to appear slim but smaller, you would put highlight on the tip of your nose, and contour the bridge and the tip with a darker shade to make the bridge look shorter.

[10] X Research source For the shadow, choose a color that two to three shades darker than your natural skin tone. For this, you might use a powder or a liquid bronzer. [11] X Research source For the highlighter, choose a color that is two to three shades lighter than your natural skin tone.For instance, you might use a highlighter product or a liquid concealer. [12] X Research source Consider your skin undertone. Some people will have a warmer/yellow-tinted undertone while others will have a cooler/pink-tinted undertone.

Make sure that the foundation matches your face exactly. It is not a good idea to match foundation on your hand or wrist; these are usually a different shade than your face.
