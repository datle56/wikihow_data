      "content": "Use adhesives to stick your decorations to the ceiling with ease. As long as the items you have are lightweight, such as streamers, using sticky tack or tape is probably the best bet, and is something that you’ll typically have lying around the house. [1] X Research source Place tape or mounting putty on the end of your decoration, and attach it to the ceiling. Smooth it over and apply pressure to ensure it doesn’t fall off. Tape is especially useful if you are using one that isn’t going to chip the paint off the ceiling when you pull down your decorations – Gaffer’s Tape is a great option to ensure this. Mounting putty, also known as sticky tack, is also great for lightweight items and can be re-used. Similar to tape and mounting putty, you can also try adhesive hooks for lightweight objects. You can also use self-adhesive hook-and-loop fastener for your decorations. Attach one side of the hook-and-loop fastener to the ceiling and one side of the hook-and-loop fastener to your decoration, then stick the hook-and-loop fastener back together! [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Add thumbtacks, hooks, or nails to the ceiling for heavier objects. If your objects are heavy, securing them with tape just won’t do. If you are looking for a more permanent solution and don’t mind puncturing your ceiling, you can attach thumbtacks, hooks, or nails to your ceiling which will allow for a more sturdy mount, and will also last longer over time. [3] X Research source Thumbtacks are the simplest of the three, which you can easily pop right through your decoration and onto the ceiling. These are best for lighter objects. You can also use a hammer for nails and hooks, or a drill for screws in your ceiling, which you will be able to tie your objects to or hang them from. This option is excellent for heavy decorations as the hooks, nails and screws are able to support more weight. If you do drill into the ceiling, make sure you wear protective eyewear so nothing gets into your eyes. [4] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. If you're hanging something heavy, make sure you're using an anchor that's rated for the amount of weight you're hanging up so it doesn't fail.

      "content": "Attach string, twine, or fishing wire to the ceiling. This can be done, for example, by wrapping it around a hook on the ceiling. Then, once those are hung, you can add the decorations to the end of each hanging line. [6] X Research source String or yarn is beneficial because you will be able to find different colors and thickness to add to your décor and theme. Twine is a good option if you are going for a more rustic feel. Fishing wire serves two very useful purposes when hanging décor: it is extremely strong, and since it is thin and clear, can easily be hidden from sight."

      "content": "Use clothespins to hang items along a rope. If you are hanging objects like photos or bulbs from the ceiling, secure two ends of a rope on either end of the room and let the rope drop a little bit in the middle. Use clothespins to hang your items along the line. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure your decorations to ceiling rafters or exposed beams. For rooms that give you a little more leeway than just a typical flat ceiling, you can attach your decorations directly to the ceiling rafters or exposed beams, which are likely lower to the floor and easier to access. [8] X Research source Use zip ties to securely wrap your decorations around the rafters or beams, so you can easily cut them down when you are finished with them. [9] X Research source You should be able to tie string, fishing wire, twine, or even the object itself directly around the beams or rafters in a tight knot."

      "content": "Wrap your decorations around a light fixture instead of the ceiling. If you have a chandelier or hanging light fixture on your ceiling, you can easily tie your decorations like balloons or streamers to the light fixture itself. [10] X Research source Be sure to keep the decoration away from the actual light itself, or keep the light turned off to avoid the decoration from heating or catching fire."

      "content": "Slip the end of your décor between your ceiling tiles. If you’re hanging items from a ceiling that has ceiling tiles, like in a classroom, for instance, you’ll be able to slip one end of your decoration under a lifted ceiling tile. Then, when you put the ceiling tile back down to its original resting place, it will automatically secure your decoration. [11] X Research source Make sure the decoration is lightweight like ribbons or streamers so that it doesn’t slip through the ceiling tiles."
