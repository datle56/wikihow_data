      "content": "Smell some spices. Smelling certain spices can cause you to sneeze. Try searching your cupboard for a bottle of spices, such as ground black pepper, cumin, coriander, or crushed red pepper. You can open the bottle and sniff the spices or use them in your cooking and inhale through your nose as you add them. [1] X Research source Grinding the spices can also cause you to sneeze. Try grinding a few peppercorns with a mortar and pestle to bring on a sneeze."

      "title": "Sniff a bit of capsicum extract.",
      "content": "Sniff a bit of capsicum extract. Capsicum is naturally derived from hot peppers, and is used in both medication and pepper spray. Be careful of the amount you put on the swab. You can purchase a bottle of some capsicum extract or look for a product that contains it already. Don’t apply the extract to the inside of your nose because it will burn. Instead, dab a cotton swab against the top of a capsicum extract bottle and hold the cotton swab in front of your nose. Inhale the scent of the capsicum through your nose. [2] X Research source If you do not have capsicum extract, then you can also cut open a hot pepper, such as a jalapeno or chili, and dab the inside of it with a cotton swab. Then, inhale the scent of the capsicum through your nose."

      "content": "Sniff a fizzy drink. Sniffing a carbonated beverage, especially from a soda fountain, may be all the stimulation your nose needs to let loose a sneeze. Simply drinking a carbonated beverage may work, but you can also hold the cup right under your nose and inhale through your nose. [3] X Research source This should cause you to sneeze. Make sure that the soda is really fizzy. If it is flat, then there might not be enough bubbles to bring on a sneeze."

      "title": "Open a stick of peppermint gum.",
      "content": "Open a stick of peppermint gum. Some people sneeze from smelling peppermint. If you have some mints or peppermint gum around, then try popping one in your mouth. Inhale the scent as you enjoy the gum or mint and it may cause you to sneeze. [4] X Research source You can also try sniffing a bottle of peppermint essential oil if you have some. Just open the bottle and inhale the scent of the oil through your nose. Sniffing mint toothpaste may also work. Just open the cap of your toothpaste and inhale the scent through your nose."

      "title": "Tickle your nostrils.",
      "content": "Tickle your nostrils. You can trick your nose’s defense mechanisms and trigger a sneeze by gently agitating the inside of your nostrils. The inside of your nose is extremely sensitive to irritation, so you can use a tissue to brush your nostril hairs and this may induce a sneeze. [5] X Research source Roll the corner of a tissue into a small point. Put the point into your nostril, then turn and wiggle the tissue it should tickle a bit. Similarly, use a fake feather to brush the underside of your nose. You don’t even have to stick the feather in your nose to irritate it. Tickling the outside of your nose will probably make you sneeze. Don’t stick anything, even a tissue, into your nose any further than the inside edges of your nostrils. Never use a hairpin or other small sharp instrument to stimulate your nose hairs."

      "content": "Try plucking out an eyebrow hair. [6] X Research source Some people will sneeze reflexively just from plucking out an eyebrow hair. To see if this will cause you to sneeze, get out a pair of tweezers and use them to pluck out a single eyebrow hair. This may be enough to bring on a sneeze. Grasp the eyebrow hair near its root with the tips of the tweezers and pull the hair out quickly."

      "title": "Look suddenly at a bright light.",
      "content": "Look suddenly at a bright light. Up to a third of people have a built in “photic sneeze reflex.” If you have this reflex, then you’ll probably sneeze if you suddenly see a bright light. To find out if you are one of these people, turn off the lights and sit in the dark for a few minutes. After waiting a few minutes to allow your eyes to acclimate to the darkness, look up at the light and turn it on. [7] X Research source You can also close your eyes tightly while standing in direct sunlight. Block the sunlight with your hand as well. After a minute or two, remove your hand and open your eyes. Doing this may cause you to sneeze. This works because the trigeminal nerve, which controls sneezing, runs right alongside the optic nerve. The over stimulation of the trigeminal nerve may cause you to sneeze. Never look directly at the sun, as this can quickly damage your eyes."

      "title": "Take a deep breath of cold air.",
      "content": "Take a deep breath of cold air. [8] X Research source Another good way to trigger your sneeze reflex is to take a deep breath of cold air. For instance, if you're inside and it's significantly colder outside, try stepping out and suddenly inhaling the cold air. If it's not cold enough outside, try opening your freezer and leaning your face into the cold air for a few seconds. Another way to do this is to take a hot shower, then stick your head out quickly and take a deep breath of cooler air."
