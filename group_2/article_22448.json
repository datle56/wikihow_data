      "content": "Call a wildlife rehab center if you see visible signs of injury or illness. Look for signs of injury on the bird, like blood, cuts, punctures, or broken limbs. Also, notice whether the bird is shivering or making low noises, which can indicate that it’s in distress. [1] X Research source Look around the area, as well. Unfortunately, if a predator attacked the nest or the nest was damaged in some other way, the baby bird’s parents may have been killed. This is an emergency, even if the baby bird wasn’t injured. If you see any signs of injury or illness, or if the bird is orphaned: Jump to our section on how to help an injured, orphaned, or abandoned bird ."

      "content": "Help if it’s a nestling or hatchling, but leave healthy fledglings alone. If the baby bird isn’t injured, the best way to help it will depend a lot on how old it is. Here are some signs that can help you estimate the bird’s age: [2] X Research source Hatchling (0–3 days old): Hatchlings have no feathers, thin down, or very early feathers. Their eyes are closed, and they can’t make their own body heat. Nestling (3-13 days old): Nestlings are just starting to develop feathers—usually spiky pin feathers. Their eyes may be opened, but they can’t stand, hop, walk, or grip things with their feet. Nestlings often wiggle their way out of their nests. If you find a hatchling or nestling, jump to our section on how to help . Fledgling (14+ days old): A fledgling is older than a nestling and will usually have lots of feathers on their bodies, but their tail and wings will usually be shorter than an adult’s. [3] X Research source Fledglings are encouraged or even pushed out of the nest by their parents. They will usually spend 2–5 days on the ground before learning to fly, and they usually won’t return to the nest once they leave. If the bird you found is a fledgling, jump to our section on how to help ."

      "content": "Put the baby bird back into its nest if you can find it. If you find a hatchling or nestling on the ground, you can usually find a nest nearby. If you see a nest, carefully pick up the baby bird and put it back in the nest. It is a myth that the smell of humans will cause the parents to reject the baby bird—birds don’t use their sense of smell to identify their young. The baby bird should be nurtured and fed by the parents once you put it back in the nest. [4] X Research source Wear gloves when you handle the baby bird. Even though your scent won’t cause the mother bird to reject the baby, wearing gloves will help protect you from disease, parasites, and injury. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a hanging nest if the bird’s parents are near but the nest is destroyed. Poke drainage holes in the bottom of a small basket, or use a berry container or plant pot that already has holes. Line the bottom of the container with grass, leaves, or shredded paper. Place a stick at an angle in the bottom of the nest for the parents to perch on, then hang the nest from a branch in a safe place, away from predators and out of direct sunlight. [6] X Research source This temporary nest will give the baby bird a home until it’s ready to leave the nest for good."

      "content": "Wait a few hours for the parents to return, and call for help if they don’t. After you return the baby bird to its nest, watch to see if the bird’s parents return. Just be sure to watch from a safe distance—if you’re too close, the bird’s parents may get spooked and stay away. Keep in mind that the bird’s parents may only visit the nest briefly, so they may be feeding the baby bird even if you don’t see them return. [7] X Research source If you’re sure the bird’s parents haven’t returned after a few hours: You may need to contact a wildlife rehabilitation center. Jump to our section on how to help an abandoned bird for more information on what to do next."

      "title": "Leave the fledgling alone if it is healthy and safe.",
      "content": "Leave the fledgling alone if it is healthy and safe. Lederer says, “If you see a fledgling out of its nest, leave it alone. It most likely jumped from its nest, which is natural, and it’s probably being cared for by its parents.” Lederer adds, “Baby birds rarely fall from their nests. They leave because it’s getting too crowded and because they are old enough. But because they can’t fly, their parents stay nearby to feed them.” The parents may have several babies scattered in different directions, but they will return frequently to check on each fledgling."

      "content": "Move the fledgling to a safe location if it’s in harm’s way. If the baby bird is in an unsafe spot, like on a sidewalk, near a road, close to other animals, or in direct sunlight, move it to a safe spot. For instance, you might carefully place it under a nearby bush or in a shady spot under a tree. [8] X Research source Don’t move the fledgling too far—its parents will return to the spot where they last saw it."

      "title": "Do not try to feed the fledgling.",
      "content": "Do not try to feed the fledgling. Birds have specific and unique diets, and giving them the wrong food can be fatal. They can also aspirate the food (breathe it in) if they’re not fed properly. And, giving the bird water could be a drowning hazard. [9] X Research source If the parents don’t return within two hours to feed the fledgling: Contact a local wildlife rehabilitation center. Keep in mind that they receive numerous calls about fledgling birds around the same time each year, and they’ll likely advise you to leave the bird alone unless it’s clearly sick or injured."

      "content": "Keep pets indoors for about a week so the bird can safely learn to fly. Curious cats and dogs can pose a danger to baby birds. Create a safe spot by keeping your pets inside for the next week or so to avoid unintentional injury. [10] X Research source If you do need to take your pet outside, put them on a harness or leash. If there’s an animal in the area that doesn’t belong to you, try contacting its owner and asking if they’ll bring the pet indoors. If neighborhood cats are curious about the baby bird and no one will bring them inside, spray them with water so they’ll leave the area."

In general, the safest way to transport it will be to gently place the bird in a cardboard box lined with a cloth. Bunch up the cloth to create a makeshift nest in the center of the box, then carefully place the bird into the nest. Be sure its legs are tucked under its body. [12] X Research source Don’t use terry cloth (like a towel) in the box—the bird can get tangled up in the fibers. [13] X Research source Bring the baby bird to the nearest rehabilitation center for treatment as soon as possible so it can be treated and released back into the wild.

Keep it somewhere like a spare room or a bathroom, away from children or pets, and turn off any TVs or radios in the room. Limit your contact with the baby bird to avoid causing it stress. If the bird is shivering, warm it up by putting one end of the cardboard box on a heating pad set to low.

When a bird is injured, it will use all its energy to fight shock and the injury. Do not force it to devote its energy to eating as well. [16] X Research source Also avoid giving the bird water—it can potentially drown the bird.
