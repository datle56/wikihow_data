However, even just sitting down for a meal instead of eating standing up or in front of the television can help you pay attention to what you're eating and learn not to mindlessly plow through your food. [1] X Research source If your parents aren't much into cooking, maybe you can learn a few simple, healthy meals to cook for your family once and a while. For instance, baking fish in the oven is fairly simple, and perhaps you can learn how to boil vegetables. If you're interested, ask your parents if you can take a basic cooking class."

That means you won't be as tempted to snack throughout the day. Include a little bit of protein, whole grains, and a fruit or veggie if you can. For instance, try a bowl of oatmeal with some low-fat yogurt and blueberries. You could also have whole-grain toast with boiled eggs and a side of strawberries."

But stress can also make you gain or keep on weight. You're not going to make stress go away completely, but you can learn ways to cope with it. [3] X Research source One way you can deal with stress is to write about it. Keep a journal, and at the end of the day, write about what's bothering you that day. Just writing it can help take a load off your mind. [4] X Research source You can also try meditation or deep breathing. It's not as crazy as it sounds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Deep breathing is literally just taking a moment to focus on your breathing. Close your eyes. Focus only on your breathing. Breathe in slowly through your nose, counting to four in your head. Hold your breath for four counts, then breathe out slowly. Try to block out any other sensations or thoughts. Continue breathing this way for a couple of minutes until you feel yourself calming down."

You can ask them to hide it away from you, though. Maybe the rest of the family could have a special cabinet for junk food that you don't go into, or maybe they could keep special snacks in their rooms, when possible.
