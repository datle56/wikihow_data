      "title": "Ask how you can help.",
      "content": "Ask how you can help. It may seem obvious to pose such a question, but doing so shows your genuine concern and commitment to helping your sibling get better. Professional help is required to help your sibling overcome whatever they're feeling. However, there may be something you can do immediately to make them more comfortable or temporarily distract them from upsetting thoughts or feelings. Approach your sibling and say, \"You haven't seemed like yourself lately. What can I do to support you better?\""

      "title": "Listen to show you care.",
      "content": "Listen to show you care. Simply listening to your sibling vent their frustrations or fears may offer them some level of comfort. Rushing to reassure or dismiss without hearing the person's full story is a common mistake made by friends and loved ones of suicidal persons. [1] X Research source Pull up a chair and find a quiet place for the two of you to go so that they can express what they're feeling. Actively listen by: Asking open-ended questions: \"What happened to make you feel this way?\" or \"How long have you been feeling this way?\" Summarizing what the person said: \"So, you've been feeling pretty bad ever since you dropped out of college.\" Reflecting, or repeating a word back: Your sibling says, \"Yes, I've felt just lost in my life since then.\" You can reflect by repeating, \"Lost...\" to encourage them to continue. Clarifying points that the person skirts over: \"Tell me more about that.\" Reacting to the message: \"You have really been having a tough time. I appreciate you sharing your feelings with me.\""

      "title": "Refrain from judging, criticizing or blaming.",
      "content": "Refrain from judging, criticizing or blaming. Becoming angry because they want to take their life, blaming yourself or your parents for how they feel, or chastising them for breaking moral or religious principles will only lead to your sibling retreating further into themselves and pushing you out. Leave your own ego and agenda at the door. Being a source of support means putting aside any differences of opinion to show genuine concern for this person. If you have the urge to state a judgment, such as \"Oh, that's what bothering you?\", just don't say anything at all. Practice your active listening skills and be present for your sibling. You might say something like, \"We all think or feel things we aren't proud of. I won't judge you for what you think or how you feel.\""

You might say something like: \"I know it seems hard, but you can feel better with professional help.\" \"It may not look like it today, but these feelings are only temporary.\" \"You are not alone.\" \"Your life is important to me.

      "content": "Offer physical touch. If you and your sibling generally have a touchy-feely sort of relationship, a hug just might show them how much you care. Hugs release oxytocin, a hormone that is known to reduce stress and increase the sense of trust and security. If a hug isn't your guys' thing, a pat on the back or throwing an arm around their shoulder might do the trick. If physical touch isn't normally exchanged between the two of you, show your concern in verbal ways like listening or asking how you can help. [3] X Research source"

It can be understandable for siblings to share sensitive information, but suicidal thoughts should never be kept confidential.

      "content": "Reach out to an adult. Your sibling may order, threaten or even beg you not to do so, but a very important step here is telling someone immediately. Alerting a parent is best, as this is someone who lives with and loves both you and your sibling. Also consider telling another close relative, such as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or older sibling, or a school counselor if your parents are unreachable. Teens may fear being judged or getting their parents angry. If your sibling says they don't want to tell them, offer to do it with them. The two of you might go to your parents and you hold their hand as they say something like, \"My life has been really crappy lately and I have thought of how to kill myself.\" [5] X Research source Or, if they refuse to talk to them, you might approach them and share your concern. \"Mom, Dad, I'm really worried about Ben. He told me he has been wanting to kill himself, and I believe him. We need to get him some help.\" Respectfully let them know that you are serious and if they don't act on your urges to get them help, you will tell others (other close family members, a school counselor, etc.) until someone listens."

This document allows your sibling to list any contact numbers they can call, such as their therapist, the suicide hotline, or the local emergency room.

A professional can assess your sibling's situation and determine whether they need to be hospitalized for intensive treatment. [7] X Research source If your sibling is resistant to treatment, ask them to do it for you as a favor or gift. For example, you might say, \"Having you feel better and more hopeful is important to me. That's why I'm asking you to see a psychologist that will help you with what you're going through. I know you don't want to, but it would give me peace of mind.\" Take things further by facilitating the process.
