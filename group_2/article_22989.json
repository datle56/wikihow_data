      "content": "A worker wasp lives between 12-22 days on average. This varies a bit depending on the type of wasp and the environment they’re living in. Female worker wasps live the shortest length of time after birth, while male wasps rarely live past their mating season. Solitary wasps, regardless of gender, rarely live past a single season. Solitary wasps live by themselves and, while common, aren’t what people generally think of when they think of wasps. Social wasps, like yellowjackets and paper wasps, are the ones that come to mind, as they build nests and serve queens. The two varieties have different reproductive cycles that can affect how long they live. Social wasps can actually die of loneliness! They need to be around their colony to maintain a level of energy necessary to live. A social wasp separated from their hive can die in mere days. Almost makes you feel a little bad for them!"

      "content": "A developed wasp colony can last three to four months. A lot of factors come into play in how long it thrives, including food availability and weather. Generally speaking, they’ll last through the late spring and all through summer, with the workers starting to lose energy in the autumn. While they won’t go out of their way to attack people (contrary to popular belief), wasps will fearlessly protect their nests if discovered. Most stings happen when a nest is stumbled upon in its hiding place. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Solitary wasps die quickly if trapped indoors. Without a proper food source (especially since they tend to hunt for their meals) or access to water, they’re unlikely to live beyond a few days. So, you might be able to put away the old shoe and just let nature take its course if you have a single one buzzing around. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wasp nests die quickly indoors.",
      "content": "Wasp nests die quickly indoors. Colony wasps usually rely on sugars and pollination to keep themselves fed. If they don’t have quick access to sugar, the colony will begin to die. As a result, it’s possible to just leave a wasp nest alone if it’s completely indoors, but the nest shouldn’t be ignored if wasps don’t seem to be leaving or dying. It may mean they have access somewhere to food and water. Some wasps can actually survive a while without food! It depends on the species and the season, their metabolism can be slow enough to keep them kicking for longer than normal. A worker wasp who’s just eaten and has moved into autumn will live a little longer if deprived of food. [4] X Research source A hibernating queen can live several weeks without food. Their metabolism is extremely slow during this period, so whatever they eat in autumn usually lasts longer. That said, if the temperature rises suddenly, it may prompt them out of hibernation early, which can lead to them starving. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "A nest that forms both inside and outside can last months.",
      "content": "A nest that forms both inside and outside can last months. Wasps like to build their nests in high places that are safe from predators. The corners of roofs and gutters are popular spots, and the species happens to be a fan of chewing wood, it can make nests form in walls. These nests can be really problematic, because the wasps have an easy means to get inside and out, and are protected from harsh temperatures."

      "content": "Secure windows and doors from wasp invasion. Just making sure bugs aren’t flying into your house is a great prevention technique. The easiest way to do this is with bug screens, which will stop most bugs from worming in. [6] X Research source Avoid sealing off holes in your home if you suspect a wasp nest in your walls. If you cut off their entry point, they may get further inside trying to find a new way out."

      "title": "Keep trash bins and other containers shut.",
      "content": "Keep trash bins and other containers shut. Nests tend to form in protected places to hide from predators and make the walls of the colony easier to build. While most will be high up, it’s not uncommon for them to form deep at the bottom of containers. Open trash bins in particular can attract scavenging worker wasps. Make sure to keep tight fitting lids on these and other containers to prevent colonies from growing.

If you see a nest starting to form, or know of places where they tend to form, you can spray it with an insecticide specifically for wasps and hornets. Remove inactive nests to avoid repopulation (though wasps don’t commonly use the same nests.) Be very careful when approaching active nests – wear protective clothing that covers as much skin as possible. [8] X Research source"
