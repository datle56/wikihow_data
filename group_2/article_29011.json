      "title": "Cut 2 wood squares in the size you want for your press.",
      "content": "Cut 2 wood squares in the size you want for your press. Cut the wood with a table saw or a circular saw. You can make your press any size you want it to be, depending on the size of the plants you’ll be pressing. Between 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) should be big enough for most projects. [1] X Research source For best results, choose wood that is 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) or 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Visit your local hardware store and ask the employees to cut the wood for you if you don’t want to use a saw. Most hardware stores will perform this service for free."

      "content": "Measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) diagonally from each corner on both boards. Mark the spot with an X using a pencil. This will be the location for your drill holes."

      "title": "Drill a hole",
      "content": "Drill a hole through each of the marks. To ensure your boards will line up perfectly, drill through both of them at the same time. If you’re using 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) bolts, use a 5 ⁄ 16 inch (7.9 mm) drill bit. If you’re using a different bolt and you’re not sure what size drill bit to use, pick a bit you think is about the same size, then drill a test hole through a piece of scrap wood and make sure your bolt slides through easily. Adjust the size as needed."

      "title": "Sand",
      "content": "Sand the surface of the wood. Use a medium-grit sandpaper or a sanding tool if you have one. Make sure the wood is smooth, especially around the holes you drilled."

      "content": "Stain or paint the wood if you want. You can personalize your flower press by staining or painting it any color you want. You can also leave the wood plain if you prefer. [2] X Research source If you do use a paint or stain, allow the wood to dry completely before moving to the next step. Try decorating your press with stencils or cut-out illustrations of flowers."

      "title": "Cut the edges of your cardboard and paper off.",
      "content": "Cut the edges of your cardboard and paper off. Once the cardboard and paper are cut to size, cut away the corners so the paper and cardboard will sit inside the bolt holes. You should cut off a triangle-sized piece from each corner. When you're finished, the paper and cardboard should look like a square with the edges cut off. The paper absorbs moisture from the flowers during pressing. You can use any kind of smooth paper, including newsprint, blotting paper, tissue paper, or smooth coffee filters. Avoid paper towels or other textured paper because it may leave an imprint on the petals. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the washers and wingnuts on the bolts and tighten them. You’ll put down the washers first, then the nuts. Tighten the nut just until it feels secure. You don’t want to tighten them too much, as you’ll need to raise and lower the nuts in order to add flowers to your press. [4] X Research source Wingnuts are designed to be gripped and can be tightened and loosened more easily than traditional nuts, but if you only have regular nuts on hand, you can use those."

[7] X Research source Flowers with bulky blooms, like roses or carnations, take much longer to dry and don’t look as nice when they're pressed. You may want to hang them to dry them instead."
