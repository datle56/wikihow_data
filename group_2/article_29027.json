Then, you'll need the \"Spritesheet and XML generator\" from GameBanana. Finally, you'll need the \"Psych Engine\" from GameBanana or use Kade Engine (far superior). Download either WinRAR or 7zip to your computer and use their guided installer. You should now be able to use their \"extraction\" functions on the other tools. Locate the \"files” section of the GameBanana pages and click “manually download” on the latest version of the file that corresponds to your PC system. The tools from GameBanana will come in ZIP files. If you have a Windows PC and don’t know if it is 64-bit or 32-bit, you can research “how to check if my system is 64-bit or 32-bit” online. Open the ZIP files for the generator and the Psych Engine. They will contain folders. Move the folders to an easily accessible location (like the desktop) by clicking and dragging them"

To make your own version of the game, you will need to provide your own assets. The assets you will need are OGG and PNG files. You can either create assets or obtain them from some resource, like from online, from a friend, or from a CD. To create assets, you will need talent with music and drawing. You will also need software for music and drawing (a DAW and an image editing program) to convert your music into a OGG file and your drawings into PNG files. There are both free and paid software for creating your assets To get an OGG file from a DAW, create your music, go to your export settings (likely accessed by going to top menu bar, clicking “File”, then clicking “Export”), then export your music as an OGG file To get a PNG file from an image editing software, create your art, go to your export settings (likely accessed by going to the top menu bar, clicking “File”, then clicking “Save as) then save your image as a PNG file If you are familiar with “the Boyfriend” and want his or any other voices in your song, you will need to create a separate OGG file containing nothing but the voices of characters like the Boyfriend or your own custom character. You will need to create poses for your custom character and save each individual pose a PNG file for animation. The minimum number of poses you’ll need for a character is two, but the more you have the more fluid the animation can be and the more expressive your character can be. Every pose of the character will need to be on a transparent background. Different image editing software will have different ways of getting a transparent background. Research online if you are unsure of your specific software’s capabilities Your character can be drawn in any style you like, however, for the menu they will need to be transparent with black outlines. Make sure your character is not colored in. For their icon they can be in any style, but their icon will need to be on a 300x150 sized PNG file. You will need to draw two heads (one normal head, one head expressing that the character is losing) that take up the upper half of the PNG file Save your character and music files to the appropriate folders.

Go back to File Explorer and locate the XML for your character, then right click it and open it with a text editor like Notepad. Copy the text after “name=” up until the numbers. For example, if you named your character john, you should copy “John idle”. Once you have copied the text, go back to the character editor in the game and paste the text you copied into the XML box. If you made a low amount of PNG files for your character’s poses and movement, you might want to adjust the number under the “Framerate” box to be lower.

These group names can be found in the character’s XML file. Click the add/update button on the bottom of the bottom box to add the animation to your character. Make sure you repeat this animation process for “singLEFT”, “singRIGHT”, “singUP”, and “singDOWN”. You can use the same “Animation on .XML/.TXT” text for every sing direction. To test your animations, cycle through your character animations with the W and S keys. The text at the top of the screen will change.
