      "content": "Thread one side of the lace through the bottom eyelet. The eyelets are the small holes on the front of the boot. You can thread the lace through the eyelet from the outside or push the laces in through the holes from the middle of the shoe. Try both methods to see which style you prefer. [1] X Research source Threading the laces from the outside lends itself well to the loose and criss-cross styles."

      "title": "Thread the other side of the lace into the opposite eyelet.",
      "content": "Thread the other side of the lace into the opposite eyelet. If you laced from the outside in, the laces will wrap around the bottom eyelets. If you are lacing from the inside out, the laces will wrap over the leather to the next eyelet up. Lace both ends of the shoelace in the same way. For example, if the left side is going from the outside into the center of the shoe, the right side of the lace should do the same thing."

      "title": "Match the lace length by pulling both ends of the lace.",
      "content": "Match the lace length by pulling both ends of the lace. Pull the ends of the shoelace up so that each side of the shoelace is the same length. This will ensure that your shoelaces aren’t lopsided when you reach the top holes. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a lacing style and lace the rest of your shoes. Now that you've started off your laces, you can choose a style and lace the rest of your shoes. If you need to wear your Timberlands for physical labor, make sure to use the criss-cross or army style to keep your boots tight on your feet. If you're wearing Timberlands for fashion, choose the loose style."

Take the right lace and do the same thing. Pull on both ends of the lace to tighten them. You should see an X. Criss-cross lacing is good if you need your shoes to stay securely on your feet."

      "content": "Repeat the process until you’ve laced your laces through every eyelet. Continue crisscrossing your laces all the way up your shoe until you don’t have any more empty eyelets. After making every cross, remember to pull on both ends of the shoelace to tighten your boot."

      "title": "Skip the highest holes if you don’t have any more lace.",
      "content": "Skip the highest holes if you don’t have any more lace. You'll need at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) on each end of the lace in order to tie a knot. If you run out of shoelace, avoid threading the laces through the very top eyelets in your shoes. Not threading the top holes will leave you enough lace so that you can properly tie a knot.

You can put the bow in front or behind the tongue of the Timberland, depending on whether you want your laces to show. If you're working in your boots, tuck the laces behind the tongue so that they don't come undone and so that you don't trip over them. [4] X Research source Pull on both ends of the laces to tighten your Timberlands before you tie your knot or bow."

Instead of crisscrossing over to the other side, as you would in a traditional or criss-cross lacing, take the end of the left lace and push it through the hole or eyelet directly above the one that it’s currently in. Repeat the process on both ends of the lace. You should now see your shoelace run vertically through the holes. [5] X Research source"

Your shoelaces should now look like they run vertically on the bottom, cross over, then run vertically again on the third eyelets from the bottom.

      "title": "Repeat the pattern until your boots are fully laced.",
      "content": "Repeat the pattern until your boots are fully laced. Alternate between crisscrossing and vertical lacing all the way up the shoe. Because you’re using vertical lacing, you should have more shoelace towards the top which will make tying a knot easier."

Instead of lacing the shoelace through the fourth hole, however, skip the hole and go to the next highest hole, or the fifth eyelet. [8] X Research source This style is fashionable but isn't great if you're doing manual labor. Skipping holes will give your Timberlands a looser, more casual look."

If you want to try for a different look, you can tie a traditional overhand knot on both ends of the shoelace instead of tying them together with a bow or a knot. This will prevent the laces from coming loose while you walk around and is a unique and stylish way to tie your shoes. [10] X Research source"
