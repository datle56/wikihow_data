Also, one of the guards always tells the truth, while the other always lies—but you don’t know which is which, either. You can ask the guards a single question, so how do you find the door leading to freedom? Answer : You ask one of the guards (it doesn’t matter which one) which door the other would say leads to freedom. That’s because: If it’s the liar guard, they’d falsely say that the other guard would point to door B. If it’s the truth-telling guard, they’d truthfully say the other guard would point to door B as well. Therefore, regardless of which guard you ask, you can safely deduce that door A is the safe door and door B is the deadly one."
