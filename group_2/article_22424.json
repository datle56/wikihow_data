      "content": "Be a good friend. A good friend can be helpful by really listening to the person and speaking to them from the heart. [1] X Research source While it can be a challenge to maintain a friendship with someone who is somewhat emotionally unstable, remember that this is (hopefully) a temporary state, and they are working towards improvement. Make an effort to spend time with your friend. People with low self-esteem often lack the initiative to make plans with someone. You may have to initiate plans yourself and stick with them. Difficulty in reaching out and following through in social plans is not a slight towards you. Rather, it reflects on the anxiety, fear, or depression a person with low self-esteem may have. Having a regular \"date\" can be helpful, providing a way to lessen planning and making sure weeks do not go by without contact. Whether this is a Sunday afternoon cup of coffee, Wednesday night poker night, or daily morning swim, these times can be vital to helping you and your friend. Listen to your friend, making eye contact while you are conversing. Talk to them about their problems, ask them about what's wrong, and offer them support and advice (but only when they ask for it). A little caring can go a long way. Showing that you care about your friend can help give them the support they need to improve their self-esteem. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid trying to tell the person how to think. You risk alienating the person you are trying to help if you directly tell them how they should think about themselves or how they should act. Instead, support your friend for who they are, and try to encourage them towards and model healthier emotional self-care. [3] X Research source If you try to counter the person’s negativity, they may not respond well. This is not a problem solved solely by logic. For example, if they say “I feel so stupid,” it may not be helpful to say, “No, you’re not: you’re very smart.” Your friend will likely easily bring up ways they are stupid--that is what they have been thinking. Instead, try responding to “I feel so stupid” by saying something like, “I’m sorry you feel that way. What makes you think that? Did something happen?” This can offer an avenue for a more productive conversation. Affirm their feelings. Just having one's voice heard is empowering. It is tempting to try to argue that negative feelings are unmerited, but you should avoid that. Yes: \"You sound really disappointed over not having a date for the semi-formal. I can imagine that's very tough. I've had that sort of thing happen to me, too.\" No: \" You shouldn't feel so bad about not having a date for the semi-formal. It's really not a big deal, so get over it. I had that happen to me and I was fine.\""

      "title": "Problem-solve, if the person is able.",
      "content": "Problem-solve, if the person is able. If a person has low self-esteem, they may often personalize the issue. The problem is with them, and it is something that seems unable to be solved. It can help to have a person come at it from a fresh angle. Remember that problem-solving usually can only be done after some of the more negative emotion is expressed. For the above example: \"A lot of people go as a couple to the semi-formal, but I know a lot of people who are going solo, too. You certainly would not be the only one.\" Or: \"A bunch of us are carpooling there, if you would like to come. I'd love to have you join us. In fact, if you would like me to introduce you to my roommate's friend, I was thinking the two of you might hit it off...\""

A person with low self-esteem ironically will often be more willing to help out a friend than themselves. Offering an opportunity to help another can set up for a moment to do something that builds self-esteem. For example, having a person help you with a relationship problem or fix your computer is helpful."

      "content": "Provide a shoulder to cry on. If your friend wants to talk about her feelings or about the root of their low self-esteem, the most helpful thing you can do is listen while they process these issues. Often, if someone identifies the root cause of their self-esteem problems, they realize that their negative feelings about themselves come from outside. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Suggest inner voice modification.",
      "content": "Suggest inner voice modification. Ask your friend what their inner voice says to them about themselves. You’ll likely find that their inner voice is constantly negative. [6] X Research source Try to teach them to be more kind to themselves by stopping the negative self-talk and turning it around to something positive. For example, if their inner voice tells them, “I mess up every attempt at a relationship,” that supposes that one is cosmically doomed to be single based on one relationship . It also suggests that there is nothing one can learn from a failure, or skills to improve on. Hopefully, as a friend you can re-frame this assessment to declarations such as: “This relationship did not work out, and it is better to know that sooner rather than later. Thank goodness that I learned now rather than be married and have three kids!\" \"I may have to kiss a few more frogs before I find my prince. Most people do.\" \" I learned that I need to communicate better. I will work on that - it is something I can get better at.”"

Both cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy can help with low self-esteem. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You may want to approach this conversation carefully. You don’t want to alienate the other person or make them think that you think they are crazy. If you have ever been to therapy yourself, explain how much it helped you in the past. Do not be surprised or upset if your suggestion is immediately rejected. You may have planted a seed that will continue to grow in the other person’s mind; they may eventually decide to try a counselor."

      "content": "Model setting goals, taking risks, and resiliency. People with low self-esteem often hesitate to take risks or make goals because of a fear of failure. By making goals and taking risks yourself, you can show a healthy approach for life. Additionally, showing that failures are not disasters will help show that one can recover from setbacks. If possible, talk through your thought process with the person with low self-esteem. You may want to emphasize: What goal you are setting and why. (I want to run a 5K so I increase physical fitness.) What you will do when you achieve the goal. (When I finish that race, maybe I will think about running a half-marathon). How you will feel if you do not achieve it. What happens if I do my best and give it a shot and it does not work out? (I would be disappointed if I do not finish the race, but there is always another race. Besides, my real goal is to be more physically fit. If I am healthier, I am a winner. If running does not work out, there are other fitness activities I could try.) The possible outcomes of taking a risk. (I could get thinner. I could hurt my knees. I might look ridiculous in the gym. I may feel better. Maybe I will really like this.) How you will feel with the different outcomes. (I would be really happy to succeed, and feel more confident about myself. Injury would be bad, though. I hate feeling out of place, too.)"

Talking to someone with low self-esteem about the way you talk to and think about yourself can help him understand a more positive inner voice. [9] X Research source Emphasize that even when things do not work out as you had hoped, you do not blame or berate yourself. Communicate that you do not assume that other people are judging or thinking bad things about you in their minds. Explain how you praise yourself for your accomplishments, and that being proud of yourself doesn’t mean being arrogant. Model an inner voice that actually shows the support that you would give a dear friend, not the abuse that you wouldn’t wish on anyone."

Explaining that you are not—and you do not want to be—perfect, and that you love yourself anyway can go a long way to help someone with low self-esteem. [10] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Whereas someone with low self-esteem may think, “I am a failure because I haven’t found a job,” you can model a better approach by saying, “I am a great employee, and am working towards finding a job that is the right fit for me.” Instead of expressing something like, “I am hopelessly disorganized,” you can say, “I am better at the ‘big picture’ ideas than the details, but I am working on becoming more organized and attentive to detail.”"

      "content": "Put up appropriate boundaries if needed. A person with poor self-esteem may become extremely needy. While you want to be helpful, you may also find yourself constantly getting distressing calls at 3 a.m., endless conversations about himself that drain you emotionally, or demands for meeting up when you have other social obligations. So you may have to put up some boundaries to keep the friendship from becoming toxic. For example: Your primary obligation is to your children. That does not mean your friend is not a priority, but your child's dance recital will be a higher priority than your friend's poetry reading. Calls after 10 p.m. must be a real emergency. A car accident is a real emergency, but a breakup with a girlfriend is not an emergency. You need time away from your friend to nurture other relationships. You value your friend but also need to spend time with other friends, family, boyfriends or girlfriends, and even time to yourself. You will talk about what is bothering your friend, but also about your own life, interests, and other things. Friendships are two-way relationships that have give-and-take."

In the effort to help someone with very low self-esteem, a friend may end up investing a lot of time and effort to fix the suffering friend, but not be able to. And that can make two people very, very unhappy and unbalanced. A therapist can make progress in a way that even a really, really great friend is usually not able to."

      "content": "Do not accept abuse. People with low self-esteem unfortunately can become negative to others. Sometimes this gets so extreme that it becomes abusive. You are under no obligation to help a person who treats you in a hurtful manner, physically, verbally, or in any other way. Low self-esteem does not give a person a \"free pass\" to be cruel, no matter why the person has low self-esteem. You have a right to protect yourself from further pain. You may have to discontinue your friendship, and rightfully so."
