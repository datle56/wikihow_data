After a 5-minute warm-up, experts suggest doing 10-15 reps of traditional push-ups, 10-15 reps of wall push-ups, 10-15 reps of bench dips, and 10-15 reps of tricep kickbacks. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source To do a wall push-up, stand about 1 arm’s length in front of an open wall. Then, pretend you’re doing traditional push-ups, pressing up against the wall instead of the floor. To do a bench dip, sit in a stable chair and grab the sides of the seat with both hands. Then, lift and lower yourself in front of the chair, sinking down until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push yourself back up, and repeat the exercise again. To do a tricep kickback, start in a kneeling position with your right knee touching the ground and your left leg extended forward at a 90-degree angle. Lean forward, and then lift your left arm behind you, keeping your elbow straight. Once you’ve done 10-15 reps, switch positions and work your right arm instead.
