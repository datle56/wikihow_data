[1] X Expert Source Mark Co, DPM Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. They're usually small, and range in size from 1 to 10 mm (0.039 to 0.394 in). You might notice a single wart, or see them growing in clusters. [2] X Research source Warts don't have heads like pimples, but there might be a small black dot in the bump that looks like a tiny seed. Sometimes, the blood that feeds a wart dries inside and forms a small black spot. These spots are called thrombosed capillaries. Warts are caused by viruses; different viruses cause different kinds of warts and affect various parts of the body."

      "content": "Determine what type of wart you have. You can get a common wart on any part of your body, especially your hands. They often appear as a raised, flesh-color bump with an irregular surface. These warts are most typical, but there are other types of wart. [3] X Expert Source Mark Co, DPM Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. Here's how to identify them: Plantar warts develop on your feet, especially on the weight bearing parts. They are usually hard and may have a black dot in the center, which is a broken blood vessel. Flat warts usually occur on your face, hands, and feet. They often look like a grouping of flat-top, flesh-colored bumps. They can also be dome-shaped. Filiform warts, which most often appear on your face, lips, nose, and eyelids, look like thin stalks, similar to a skin tag. Sometimes you might have a cluster of stalks in a circle."

      "content": "Pay attention to how quickly the bumps developed. Usually, warts take around 2 to 6 months to grow to a noticeable size. Even the fastest-growing warts develop over the course of days or weeks, so bumps that appear suddenly are most likely due to another issue. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your bumps suddenly appeared over a matter of minutes or hours, they might be due to an allergic reaction. Hives, or small pink bumps associated with an allergic rash, are also itchy. Warts usually aren't itchy or painful.

Common warts are usually rough or grainy, a bit like the texture of cauliflower. Some warts are smooth, flat and skinny, while others look like clusters of little threads or strings. [10] X Research source Common warts, which usually have rough surfaces, are often easily treated with over-the-counter medication.

For these spots, over-the-counter salicylic acid should do the trick.

It can take multiple weeks for these treatments to yield results. [16] X Research source If the label advises, soak the area for 10 minutes in warm water and buff the wart with an emery board before applying the medicine. This can make the medicine more effective. Throw out the emery board after buffing the wart, and don't use it file your nails or share it with anyone. Topical medications come in gel, plaster, or bandage forms. You should only apply the medication directly to the wart. Do not use it on any other parts of your body. Side effects may include burning or redness at the application site.

Then, cut the plaster to fit the size of your wart. Apply the plaster to the wart and leave it on for 24-48 hours. Buff the wart with the pumice stone again, then reapply the plaster until your wart goes away (or until you see the doctor again). [19] X Research source Don't use the pumice stone on any other area after you've used it on the wart. After the treatment is complete, discard the pumice stone. You should get relief from pain after the first 24-48 hours. The pumice stone and the salicylic acid will both irritate the skin on the wart. This can help your body develop an immunity to that strain of wart, and when that happens, it should go away."
