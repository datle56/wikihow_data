      "content": "Shake out each garment after removing it from the wash. Giving your clothes a good shake before you hang them up helps eliminate wrinkles and soften your items as they dry. Just hold your garment by the flattest end and give it 1 to 2 quick shakes. [1] X Research source Hang up your clothes as soon as your machine finishes washing them. Leaving clothes in the washer can create wrinkles and leave them smelling musty."

      "content": "Group similar garments together and hang the biggest items first. When you take out your laundry, sort your items from largest to smallest. So, put your linens, towels, pants, shirts, socks, and undergarments together. Then, hang up your biggest items first to make sure they have enough space to dry. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang dark clothes inside out and out of direct light to prevent fading. Sunlight can fade dark or bright-colored garments, so turning them inside out helps slow down the process. Just take a moment to turn any jeans, pants, shirts, dresses, or skirts inside out. Then, hang these items out of direct sunlight to prevent any potential bleaching. [3] X Research source Feel free to leave white clothing out in the direct sun. The sun’s rays naturally bleach and brighten light-colored garments."

      "title": "Fold sheets and blankets in half and hang them by the folded end.",
      "content": "Fold sheets and blankets in half and hang them by the folded end. Take your blanket or flat or fitted sheet and fold it in half lengthwise. Then, bring the folded end up to the clothesline so the crease faces the ground. Pin the corner with a clothespin and stretch the fabric taut as you move across the line to pin the middle and the other corner. [4] X Research source The folded crease is the heaviest part of the blanket or sheets, so keeping it face down allows it to get more airflow and dry quicker. Keeping the top of the sheet flat and straight helps prevent wrinkles. Put down blankets or comforters in the dryer instead of air drying them. The down might clump together and not dry properly when it’s hung."

      "title": "Keep towels unfolded and vertical on the clothesline.",
      "content": "Keep towels unfolded and vertical on the clothesline. Bring your towels up to the clothesline so one of the short ends faces the line. Then, drape it slightly over the clothesline and pin both corners in place. [5] X Research source To save space and clothespins, hang your towels next to each other and clip the corners together with the same pin. If your towels or garments feel stiff after drying, hang them where they catch a good breeze. Then, add fabric softener to your wash cycle or make your own softener with vinegar. Alternatively, place your items in the dryer for 5 to 10 minutes while they’re slightly damp to soften and fluff them."

      "title": "Pin pants and jeans to the clothesline by the leg cuffs.",
      "content": "Pin pants and jeans to the clothesline by the leg cuffs. The heaviest part of your pants is the waist, so allowing the waist to hang gives it more airflow and helps your pants dry faster. Simply hold the bottom of your pants against the clothesline. Then, pin each pant leg cuff in place. [6] X Research source If you have 2 clotheslines side by side, separate the legs and pin 1 to each line to help speed up the drying time."

      "content": "Clip shirts at the side seams and hang them by the bottom hem. Hanging your t-shirts and blouses by the sides and hem prevents creases and helps them dry faster. Just turn your shirt upside down and place a clothespin where the side seam and bottom hem meet. Then, pull the bottom taut and clip the other corner. [7] X Research source Pulling the hem straight and flat ensures the shirt doesn’t sag on itself and creates wrinkles. Alternatively, hang non-stretchy shirts on a hanger and hook the hanger on your clothesline. Don't hang stretchy fabrics and heavy knits, like sweaters. Hanging them up can make them lose their shape or stretch out, so lay them flat to dry."

Then, stretch them out on the line so they don’t sag, and clamp a clothespin on each corner.

      "content": "Dry your clothes in a well-ventilated space with low humidity. When you dry your clothes inside, you need a lot of dry, circulating air to remove moisture and keep them smelling fresh. Choose an open space in your home that’s near a window, fan, or vent to give your garments more airflow. Then, make sure the space doesn’t trap humidity; basements and attics tend to stay stuffy and moist. [11] X Research source For extra air circulation, set a standing fan by your clothes to speed up drying. If you live in a humid area, place a dehumidifier near your clothes to remove moisture faster. Do not place your clothing directly onto a heat source, like a heating vent. The heat can potentially start a fire. The area you choose doesn’t have to get direct sunlight—just placing your clothes in an open, well-ventilated area helps them dry. Plus, direct sunlight can fade blacks and bright colors."

[19] X Research source After about 1 to 2 hours, feel your clothes. If they’re damp but not overly wet, flip them over. This lets the other side breathe and dry, which speeds up the process and helps prevent musty odors.

Dryers are also one of the least energy-efficient appliances in your home. So, air-drying your clothes is a more cost-effective and sustainable option.
