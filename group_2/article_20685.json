The closer you are to your obsession, the harder it will be to stop thinking about it. Putting physical distance between yourself and your obsession will help you gain mental distance, too. It'll be hard at first, but soon you'll feel the obsession's spell start to weaken, bit by bit. [1] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021. Obsession with a person is a sign of an unhealthy relationship. Limit your contact with a person about whom you have developed an unhealthy obsession. Spend time distracting yourself with other things. If you work or go to school with the person you’re obsessed with (meaning you can’t avoid them), try to interact with them as little as possible. Don’t spend extra time chatting or making small talk—say what you need to say, then walk away. Maybe you're obsessed with a particular pastime, like playing your favorite video game. If that's the case, put the game out of your sight by uninstalling it from your computer or giving your console to a friend to keep for a while until your obsession dies down."

[4] X Research source Cutting off your obsession's sustenance is no easy task. You might find yourself playing mental games, like telling yourself you'll just look at someone's Facebook page one last time before stopping this obsession. But if you want to shed your obsession, you have to cut yourself off right when you want to indulge the most. Try giving yourself a time limit: spend 15 minutes on your obsession, then move onto something else. Sometimes an obsession is so strong that it persists no matter how much you try to starve it. No matter how hard you try to cut yourself off, your thoughts might keep returning to your obsession. If that's the case, don't be hard on yourself—you can still beat your obsession, it's just going to take a bit more time."

When it feels so good to think and talk about your favorite topic, why would you ever want to stop? Remember why you want to get over the obsession: so you can see past it and enjoy the other things life has to offer. When the obsessive thoughts arise, have a few good distractions lined up so you won't fall into the rabbit hole again. [5] X Research source Here are some good ways to distract yourself: Do you have certain emotions (boredom, stress, anxiety) or situations that trigger your obsession? If so, be aware of those triggers and start distracting yourself right away. Do some exercise that occupies your brain, too. Running and walking might not be your best bet, since you'll have too much time to think about your obsession. Try rock climbing, caving, or playing a team sport that engages both your mind and body. Works of fiction make excellent distractions. Pick up a new book or watch a film with themes that have nothing to do with your current obsession. In the moment, when your thoughts are drifting and you need an emergency distraction, try blasting some music, calling up a friend (to talk about anything but your obsession), reading an engaging news article, or getting back to work.

Really listen to people when they're talking to you. Let yourself get absorbed into conversations, instead of absent-mindedly nodding while your head is in the clouds. It might help to have a mantra you can recite when you notice your thoughts turning obsessive.

Not all obsessions are bad; in fact, many people spend their lives trying to find their \"passion\"—that one subject that instills in them the desire to learn more and work harder. If you've found an obsession that fills you with purpose, many would consider you to be very lucky.

[16] X Research source Even if your obsession might not result in something as prestigious as a PhD in astronomy, you can still channel it into something productive. Maybe you're obsessed with celebrity gossip, and you can't stop reading tabloids. Why not start a gossip blog or Twitter account to share what you've learned? You could also use your obsession as motivation to improve yourself. If you're obsessed with someone who never looks your way, maybe you'll decide to change bad habits that are holding you back. Let it be your reason for getting up early to go on morning runs before work, or for reading all the course material so you have something intelligent to say in class."
