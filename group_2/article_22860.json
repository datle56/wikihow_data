      "content": "The legend of the Hope Diamond curse began in the 1910s. At this time, newspapers began publishing articles about the Hope Diamond being cursed—claiming that most of its owners, wearers, or handlers experienced tragedy after coming into contact with the gem. 1910 is the same year famous jeweller Pierre Cartier purchased the diamond and supposedly spun his own tales about the curse to entice potential buyers. The timeline of the curse itself begins in the 1660s, when a French merchant either purchases or steals the stone that will be cut into the present-day Hope Diamond."

      "content": "People attribute the Hope Diamond curse to theft and greed. Cartier claimed the Hope Diamond curse came from French merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier stealing the diamond from a statue of a Hindu goddess, but there is no evidence this happened. Another theory is that the diamond attracts wealthy people whose curse is their own greed."

      "content": "In the 17th century, a French merchant purchased the uncut stone in India. According to various accounts, the first curse victim—Jean-Baptiste Tavernier—bought the diamond while traveling in India in the 1660s. The beautiful blue diamond likely originated from the Kollur mine in Guntur, then part of the Golconda kingdom. Myth holds that Tavernier died in a wild dog or wolf attack in Russia, but there’s no evidence to support this. [1] X Research source When Tavernier brought the uncut diamond back to France, it became known as the Tavernier Blue. [2] X Research source Before being cut, the diamond weighed an estimated 115 carats. Hope Diamond owner Pierre Cartier claimed Tavernier stole the Hope Diamond from a Hindu idol of the goddess Sita, leading to the famous curse. However, the truth of this claim is dubious."

      "content": "In 1668 or 1669, Tavernier sold the diamond to King Louis XIV. It would stay with the French royal family for a little over a century. [3] X Research source The King ordered that the Tavernier Blue diamond be recut from its triangular shape into a roughly 69-carat heart shape. A supposed victim of the curse, he died painfully from gangrene in 1715. [4] X Research source Today, the heart-shaped diamond is known as the French Blue. Another curse victim is Nicolas Fouquet, superintendent of finances for King Louis XIV. He supposedly wore the Hope Diamond once and was banished and imprisoned for 15 years until his death. In 1749, King Louis XV had a jeweler set the French Blue into an elaborate emblem of the Order of the Golden Fleece."

      "content": "In the 1790s, the diamond disappeared amidst the French Revolution. After the 1791 executions of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the revolutionary government seized all royal jewels—including the French Blue. In 1792, looters stole the French Blue and other Crown Jewels from the Garde-Meuble. [5] X Research source Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, who inherited the Hope Diamond, are the most famous victims of the Hope Diamond curse. Marie Louise, Princesse de Lamballe, is another curse victim from this time. An associate of Marie Antoinette, she supposedly wore the Hope Diamond. An angry mob murdered her during the Revolution. During the diamond’s disappearance, some believe it ended up in Spain. A Goya painting shows a similar gemstone worn by Spanish Queen Maria Luisa. The curse may have led to her husband’s forced abdication from the throne and the two having to flee the country. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source While there’s no verification, it’s been reported that Fals’ son murdered him, stole the diamond, and later took his own life. The stone resurfaced in London under the ownership of diamond merchant Daniel Eliason. [8] X Research source The UK’s King George IV is another supposed victim. A rumored owner of the diamond, he died in 1830 and was deeply in debt—supposedly forcing his estate to sell the diamond."

Supposedly, banker and designer Thomas Hope purchased the stone shortly before his death in 1831—was his death caused by the curse? In 1839, his brother Henry Philip Hope listed the Hope Diamond in a catalog detailing his gem collection, suggesting he purchased or inherited it from Thomas. [9] X Research source After the Hope family acquired the stone, it became known as the Hope Diamond. The Hope Diamond stayed in the Hope family until 1901, when Lord Francis Hope sold it to relieve his debts—his debt making him another supposed victim of the curse. French gemologist Charles Barbot publicly speculated that the Hope Diamond was the recut French Blue in his 1858 book Traité Complet de Pierres Précieuses . Another Hope family victim is May Yohé, an actress and the ex-wife of diamond owner Lord Francis Hope. She had several failed marriages after divorcing Hope, and died penniless."

In either 1908 or 1909, Turkish diamond collector Selim Habib purchased it from Joseph Frankel’s Sons & Co. [10] X Research source However, he sold it in 1909 due to financial troubles, so some consider him another victim of the curse. It continued to pass through different jewelers until 1910. The New York Times erroneously reported that Habib drowned in a shipwreck, taking the diamond with him. [11] X Research source He’d actually already sold the diamond and was not on the boat."

Her only daughter died of an accidental drug overdose at 25 years old. Her husband, Ned McLean, cheated on her and was later declared insane.
