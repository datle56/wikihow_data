      "content": "Use coconut oil to fight extreme brittleness. Coconut oil is a fast-absorbing and rich oil that would be perfect if your horses live in a very dry, drought-ridden environment. A thin coat of coconut oil provides deep moisture without making the hooves soft. [1] X Research source Because coconut oil turns solid below 76 °F (24 °C), it can be a little difficult to apply in the wintertime. Find refined coconut oil in your local grocery store or natural foods store."

Cover the entire surface, including up 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) into the hairline. Lift your horse’s foot and apply a coating to the underside of the hoof as well, covering the heel, frog, and sole. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a hoof brush, you can also use a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide paint brush. Be sure to clean the top of your horse’s hooves and clean out the soles with a pick before applying the oil. Dirt and grime can interfere with the oil absorbing, and it can be very messy. If you mixed various ingredients to make your oil, be sure to shake the container well before you dip your brush in."
