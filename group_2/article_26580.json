While they may not always wear their feelings on their sleeves, Scorpio men certainly approach their romantic relationships with a ton of passion and emotional intensity. Their natural drive and determination often help them develop powerful connections with the people they care about. Scorpio men also tend to let their passions guide them through life. Every decision they make is fueled by intense emotion and intuition, even if they don’t show it to others.

They don’t let anything stop them from achieving those goals and often have high expectations for themselves! Expect your Scorpio guy to be exceptionally ambitious, hardworking, and driven. In modern astrology, Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, the planet of transformation and rebirth, as well as power and control. Much of Scorpio’s intense ambition stems from their connection to Pluto; they want to evolve into powerful authority figures.

With a calm, reserved, and quiet exterior, Scorpio men often come off as very mysterious and secretive. They often keep to themselves and don’t like to show any vulnerability. In Scorpio’s mind, if nobody knows what they’re thinking, that gives them an advantage in conversations. For instance, your Scorpio man might not initially give you many details about himself. In fact, he might change the subject or redirect by asking a question rather than answering one from you. As you get closer to him, your Scorpio guy won’t act so secretive around you anymore—but around other people, he’ll likely maintain the same mysterious, reserved personality."

They’re often very secretive and may need alone time to reflect, work through their emotions, or recharge and do a few solo activities. When your Scorpio guy needs space, give it to him! Let him go off and come back to you on his own. Protesting or crowding a Scorpio guy who wants some privacy may just end up making him uncomfortable. Scorpio is typically an introverted sign, so alone time is important to them. Remember, Scorpio’s independent nature isn’t a reflection of you or your relationship.

Remember: although Scorpios are intuitive, they’re not psychic! Ignoring him when you’re upset will likely only lead to more conflict, so let him know what’s on your mind, and listen when he opens up to you. For example, you could say, \"When you said that you don't like my dog, it hurt my feelings. My dog means a lot to me, and I guess hearing that made me feel offended.\" Sharing your emotions during a conflict can be tough, but ultimately, it’s the only way to move past the problem in a healthy way—and your Scorpio will definitely appreciate it in the long run!"

Harsh criticism can hurt your Scorpio man’s feelings and damage the trust that you share.

To make discussions easier, try pairing each constructive comment with a compliment to make Scorpio feel more at ease. For example, you could say, \"When we were talking with my friend, she said she felt like you were a little standoffish. I know you didn't mean it because you have such a good heart, but sometimes you can seem a little aloof.\""

If your Scorpio guy is too domineering or assertive for your liking, remind them that you value your independence as much as they do. From there, focus on building a more balanced relationship. Arguments aren’t about winning, so don’t try to win every disagreement with your Scorpio. Focus more on understanding his perspective and coming to a compromise than shutting him down. For example, you might say, \"I know you want to spend the entire weekend together, but I need some “me time” tonight. I'd appreciate it if you could respect that and go out with friends tonight instead.\""

      "content": "Tell your Scorpio man if you feel like he’s being too possessive. Scorpios are fiercely protective when they’re in love, especially when they feel concerned, jealous, or insecure. However, if that possessive behavior makes you feel smothered, telling your Scorpio you need more personal space and independence is more than okay. Be gentle and respectful when pointing this tendency out to your Scorpio. His heart is usually in the right place; he might not even realize he’s smothering you. For example, you could say, \"I know you're worried about me taking the night bus home, but I promise you I'm safe. This is something I've done many times before. How about I call you when I get home?\""
