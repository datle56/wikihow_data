      "title": "Motor oil is the carrier oil that will hold your fluid together.",
      "content": "Motor oil is the carrier oil that will hold your fluid together. Measure out the motor oil using an electronic scale . Then, pour the oil into a shallow dish made of thin plastic, like a petri dish . [1] X Research source The viscosity of the motor oil doesn’t matter here. As long as it’s motor oil, it will work! Petri dishes are ideal, because they’re thin enough for a magnet to penetrate. Some people have also had success using vegetable oil instead of motor oil. However, vegetable oil is very thin, and may not combine with the iron oxide as well."

      "title": "Iron oxide powder",
      "content": "Iron oxide powder creates the magnetism in ferrofluid. Use your electronic scale again to measure your iron oxide. Then, pour the iron oxide into the motor oil. [2] X Research source You may have heard about harvesting iron oxide from cassette tapes using acetone. If you’d like to try this method, break apart cassette tapes and soak the tape in acetone for 1 hour outside. Then, use a knife to gently scrape the iron oxide off the tape into a dish. Just keep in mind that many people have tried this method with little success, so it’s a better idea just to buy iron oxide outright. You can also make ferrofluid with magnetic ink developer or ferric chloride, but these are very expensive. Iron oxide is much more affordable."

      "title": "Combine your ingredients until your mixture is thick.",
      "content": "Combine your ingredients until your mixture is thick. Use a stir stick that you don’t mind throwing away later, because iron oxide stains. Keep stirring until the ferrofluid is the consistency of a thick stew. [3] X Research source You won’t notice any immediate changes right away, and that’s okay. Just wait until you grab a magnet in the next step!"

    {
      "title": "Use a magnet to manipulate the ferrofluid.",
      "content": "Use a magnet to manipulate the ferrofluid. Since iron oxide is magnetic, it will automatically gravitate toward the force of a magnet. Place your magnet underneath the petri dish and move it around. Have fun playing with your ferrofluid! [4] X Research source When the iron oxide mixes with the oil, the iron particles stay suspended in the fluid rather than mixing entirely. When you introduce a magnet to the ferrofluid, the magnet pulls the particles apart, forcing the fluid into interesting shapes, peaks, and valleys. Try moving your magnet to the side and the top of the dish, too. Just be careful not to dip it in the ferrofluid, or things could get messy!"

      "title": "Keep ferrofluid around for a couple of months if you’d like to.",
      "content": "Keep ferrofluid around for a couple of months if you’d like to. Want to keep playing with your ferrofluid? Pour it into an airtight container that you don’t mind throwing away later. [5] X Research source Ferrofluid will last for a couple of months until the iron particles settle at the bottom. [6] X Research source Ferrofluid only starts to break down when it’s exposed to air. If you keep it sealed in a glass jar, it has a shelf life of up to 10 years."

      "title": "Dispose of ferrofluid like you’d dispose of motor oil.",
      "content": "Dispose of ferrofluid like you’d dispose of motor oil. Since ferrofluid is mostly motor oil, it’s considered hazardous waste. For small quantities (like 1 batch), seal it in an airtight container and throw it in the trash. For large quantities (like multiple batches), take the ferrofluid to a hazardous waste facility. [7] X Research source Do not pour ferrofluid down the drain, as it will clog your pipes."
