[1] X Research source The ∫ {\\displaystyle \\int } is the symbol for integration. It is actually an elongated S. The function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is called the integrand when it is inside the integral. The differential d x {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} x} intuitively is saying what variable you are integrating with respect to. Because (Riemann) integration is just a sum of infinitesimally thin rectangles with a height of f ( x ) , {\\displaystyle f(x),} we see that d x {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} x} refers to the width of those rectangles. The letters a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} are the boundaries. An integral does not need to have boundaries. When this is the case, we say that we are dealing with an indefinite integral. If it does, then we are dealing with a definite integral. Throughout this article, we will go over the process of finding antiderivatives of a function. An antiderivative is a function whose derivative is the original function we started with."

      "content": "Understand the definition of an integral. When we talk about integrals, we usually refer to Riemann integrals; in other words, summing up rectangles. Given a function f ( x ) , {\\displaystyle f(x),} a rectangle width of Δ x , {\\displaystyle \\Delta x,} and an interval [ a , b ] , {\\displaystyle [a,b],} the area of the first rectangle is given by f ( x 1 ) Δ x 1 , {\\displaystyle f(x_{1})\\Delta x_{1},} because it is just the base times the height (the value of the function). Similarly, the area of the second rectangle is f ( x 2 ) Δ x 2 . {\\displaystyle f(x_{2})\\Delta x_{2}.} Generalizing, we say the area of the ith rectangle is f ( x i ) Δ x i . {\\displaystyle f(x_{i})\\Delta x_{i}.} In summation notation, this can be represented in the following manner. [2] X Research source ∑ i = 1 n f ( x i ) Δ x i {\\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i})\\Delta x_{i}} If this is the first time you have seen a summation symbol, it may look scary...but it's not complicated at all. All this is saying is that we are summing up the area of n {\\displaystyle n} rectangles. (The variable i {\\displaystyle i} is known as a dummy index.) However, as you can guess, the area of all the rectangles is bound to be slightly different from the true area. We solve this by sending the number of rectangles to infinity. As we increase the number of rectangles, the area of all the rectangles better approximates the area under the curve. That's what the diagram above shows (see the tips for what the graph in the middle shows). The limit as n → ∞ {\\displaystyle n\\to \\infty } is what we define as the integral of the function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} from a {\\displaystyle a} to b . {\\displaystyle b.} ∫ a b f ( x ) d x = lim n → ∞ ∑ i = 1 n f ( x i ) Δ x i {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\mathrm {d} x=\\lim _{n\\to \\infty }\\sum _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i})\\Delta x_{i}} Of course, this limit has to exist in order for the integral to have any meaning. If such a limit does not exist on the interval, then we say that f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} does not have an integral over the interval [ a , b ] . {\\displaystyle [a,b].} In this article (and in almost every physical application), we only deal with functions where these integrals exist."

The main goal of integration by parts is to integrate the product of two functions - hence, it is the analogue of the product rule for derivatives. This technique simplifies the integral into one that is hopefully easier to evaluate. ∫ u d v = u v − ∫ v d u {\\displaystyle \\int u\\mathrm {d} v=uv-\\int v\\mathrm {d} u}"
