      "title": "Cut an 8.5 in (22 cm) wide and 17 in (43 cm) long piece of cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut an 8.5 in (22 cm) wide and 17 in (43 cm) long piece of cardboard. You can use a straight piece of cardboard or cut apart a cardboard box. Measure out your piece and use a box cutter to cut it out in a straight line. [1] X Research source If you wear larger than an XL size T-shirt, add 2 inches (5.1 cm) onto both measurements before you cut out your panels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut out 2 more identical pieces of cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut out 2 more identical pieces of cardboard. Grab some more cardboard and cut out and measure 2 more panels that are the same size as the first piece. Use the first piece of cardboard you cut out as a guide to make sure they’re all the same size. [2] X Research source If the panels aren’t all the same length, use your box cutter to cut off the excess until they’re even."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay all 3 panels side by side lengthwise.",
      "content": "Lay all 3 panels side by side lengthwise. Pick a flat surface, like the table or the floor, and spread your cardboard pieces out. Line the panels up lengthwise without any space in between them so they make one tall piece of cardboard. [3] X Research source If there are any gaps between the panels, your T-shirt folder might not work as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the top half of the panels together.",
      "content": "Tape the top half of the panels together. Grab a roll of masking tape or duct tape and stick the 3 panels together so they’re still side by side. Use 2 different pieces of tape to attach them, but only tape the top half of the panels together so the bottom can still bend. [4] X Research source Your T-shirt folder will need to fold upwards, which is why you need to leave a gap at the bottom of the panels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure halfway up the middle panel and draw a line across it.",
      "content": "Measure halfway up the middle panel and draw a line across it. Use a ruler or a tape measure to mark a line in the center of the middle panel. Use a permanent marker to draw a line across the center so you can keep track of where it is. [5] X Research source This will be about 4 inches (10 cm) up from the bottom of the panel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Score a line across the center of the middle panel.",
      "content": "Score a line across the center of the middle panel. Use a knife or a box cutter to gently cut a line across the center of the panel, but don’t cut all the way through the cardboard. Instead, score a line about halfway through it so that the panel can bend, but it’s still attached to the top half. [6] X Research source This will make the bottom panel easier to bend so you don’t have to fold and crease it a bunch of times."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the T-shirt face-down on the center panel.",
      "content": "Place the T-shirt face-down on the center panel. Try to center the collar at the very top of the panel and flatten the shirt out so it’s not creased or wrinkled. The sleeves of your shirt will spread out over the right and left flaps of the T-shirt folder. The more centered the shirt is, the better it will fold. [7] X Research source Always start with the T-shirt face down so that the design faces upwards when it’s folded. The T-shirt folder works best on short sleeve, lightweight T-shirts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the left flap over to fold the left arm.",
      "content": "Flip the left flap over to fold the left arm. Grab the left panel of your cardboard and flip it over on top of the T-shirt, then pull the panel back. The left sleeve of your T-shirt should now be folded over onto the center of your T-shirt. [8] X Research source Flip the panel quickly so that the sleeve doesn’t have time to fall or bunch up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the right flap over to fold the right arm.",
      "content": "Flip the right flap over to fold the right arm. Now, do the same thing to the other sleeve of your T-shirt by quickly flipping the right flap over the center of the shirt. Then, pull the flap away so you can see the straight line of your folded T-shirt. [9] X Research source If your shirt is wrinkled or didn’t fold correctly, you can just undo it and try it again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom panel up.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom panel up. Finally, pick the bottom panel of the cardboard up to fold the bottom half of the T-shirt on top of itself. This completes your folded shirt, and you can flip it over to see the design on the front. [10] X Research source Try to put your folded shirt directly into its storage spot so it doesn’t accidentally come undone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store your T-shirt with the design facing outwards.",
      "content": "Store your T-shirt with the design facing outwards. Now you can put your folded shirt into a drawer or a suitcase so it stays neat and wrinkle-free. Try to place the design facing outwards so you can tell which T-shirt you’re picking up when it comes time to get dressed. [11] X Research source Storing shirts that are folded neatly saves a ton of space, so you can fit more shirts into your closet or suitcase at one time. Try using your T-shirt folder to fold shorts and pants too! Just fold the clothing in half lengthwise, then center it on the cardboard. Use the bottom panel to flip the bottom half upwards for a neat, clean fold."
