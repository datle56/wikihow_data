      "title": "Fold a square piece of paper in half diagonally, then open it back up.",
      "content": "Fold a square piece of paper in half diagonally, then open it back up. Bring 1 corner over to the opposite corner, lining up the edges. Make a crease by running your finger or fingernail firmly along the fold. Open the paper so it lies flat after you fold it. If you're using patterned paper, start with the blank side facing up. Your paper can be any size, as long as it’s a perfect square shape. You can use any type of paper you'd like. However, origami paper is recommended, especially for beginners, because it's thin and easy to fold cleanly."

      "title": "Bring the 2 corners in towards the center crease, forming a kite.",
      "content": "Bring the 2 corners in towards the center crease, forming a kite. Take the 2 corners that are on either side of the crease. Fold them into the center so that the edges line up along the crease. Try to align the edges so that they touch. There shouldn’t be a large gap between them and they also shouldn’t overlap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over and fold the 2 corners into the center crease again.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over and fold the 2 corners into the center crease again. Bring the 2 corners on either side of the original crease line towards the center. Line up the edges with the crease. This is the same fold you just made, but on the opposite side of the paper. You should now have a smaller kite shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the kite in half, bringing the bottom of the tail up to meet the top.",
      "content": "Fold the kite in half, bringing the bottom of the tail up to meet the top. You’re now folding the 2 corners of the original crease line. Make sure the points of the corners line up perfectly to ensure the paper is folded exactly in half. Crease the fold. The wider bottom layer will be the body of the swan and the thinner top layer will be the neck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold down the tip of the top layer to create the beak.",
      "content": "Fold down the tip of the top layer to create the beak. Take the top point and bring it down towards the bottom. Crease it so it stays in place. Make the beak as big or as small as you’d like. However, it should be smaller than the neck and body to look proportionate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the swan over and fold it in half vertically.",
      "content": "Flip the swan over and fold it in half vertically. You’re re-folding the paper along the original crease line. Press firmly along the fold to crease it. The beak and neck should be exposed. Make sure the beak and neck are folded in half, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the neck and beak away from the body, pinching the fold to secure it.",
      "content": "Pull the neck and beak away from the body, pinching the fold to secure it. The neck should be at a 90 degree angle from the body. You won’t be able to make a smooth crease at the base because of the previous folds. Instead, squeeze it with your fingers to hold the neck in place. You can pull the beak away from the neck if you want, too. Use the same pinching method."

      "content": "Display paper swans around your house for decor on a budget. Why spend a lot of money on decorations when you can make them yourself with just a few pieces of paper? Set a swan on a bookshelf or end table, for example. Or make a bunch of swans in different sizes and group them together for an interesting coffee table arrangement. If you’re putting your swan on a bookcase, use newspaper or old book pages instead of plain paper for a playful touch. Homemade decor personalizes and warms up any space."

      "content": "String swans together if you want to make a garland or mobile. Attach your paper swans to a long piece of string or twine with tape or glue. Then drape the garland on a mantel or doorway for a whimsical accent piece. Or make multiple strands and tie them to an embroidery hoop for a beautiful mobile. [1] X Research source Strings of paper swans hung vertically also make elegant wall art to be hung behind a bed or on a large living room wall."

      "content": "Fold your swan with a napkin to use it as a place setting. Since most paper napkins are squares, they make for the perfect origami paper. Set your napkin swan on top of a plate to really impress your guests. Plus, they can use the napkins during the meal. Win-win! [2] X Research source Choose napkins that match the color scheme of your party for a pretty table. Let your guests take home the swans if they don't use them as a creative party favor."

      "content": "Attach a hanger to the swan if you want to make an ornament. Loop string around the neck or glue a piece of wire to the head so you can hang your swan. Be careful not to squeeze the string too tight so it doesn’t crunch up the paper. [3] X Research source Swan ornaments make great gifts, too. Use paper in holiday colors for an extra festive touch."
