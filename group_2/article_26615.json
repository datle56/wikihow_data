While many foods contain elements that mimic estrogen, some have enzymes like ellagitannin, naringenin, and apigenin that block the production or spread of the sex hormone. Depending on the specific food, this is done by actively preventing estrogen from binding to cell receptors or by mimicking aromatase inhibitors. Some foods that contain anti-estrogens are: [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Citrus fruits Mushrooms Onions Celery Asparagus Mustard greens Pomegranates Apples and apple juice Berries Eggplant"

Beer, bourbon, and many other forms of alcohol contain phytoestrogens that, when consumed, can lead to a general increase of estrogen in your body. Stick to drinking in moderation or cut out alcohol altogether if you’re worried about how it’s affecting your hormones. If you’re struggling to quit or cut back on your drinking, talk to your doctor. They can give you advice or even prescribe medications that may help. In addition to alcohol, other recreational drugs—such as amphetamines, marijuana, heroin, and methadone—can also cause hormone imbalances.

However, getting too little sleep at night can mess up your hormone balance and cause you to produce less testosterone. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To keep your hormones in balance, go to bed early enough to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night. [18] X Research source Keeping your room dark and quiet can help you sleep better. In addition, low light levels help stimulate the release of melatonin—a natural sleep hormone that also inhibits estrogen production in your body. [19] X Research source If you have trouble getting to sleep at night, establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book, meditating, or doing light stretches or exercise.
