      "content": "Combine cornstarch and water. That's it! From there, the recipe can deviate based on your preference for thickness; you can add more cornstarch or water until the paste is your preferred consistency. Thoroughly mix the two ingredients together. As the cornstarch absorbs water the mixture will thicken and begin to resemble glue. [1] X Research source For thin cornstarch paste, use 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of cold water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of cornstarch. For thick cornstarch paste, use equal parts cold water and cornstarch. Because the starch may settle, stir the simple cornstarch paste just before using it."

    {
      "title": "Heat the mixture.",
      "content": "Heat the mixture. If you're creating a thick paste, adding it to heat can make the mixing process easier. Place 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan. Place the pan over low heat. Stir the ingredients together until they're smooth. When the consistency is thick and gluey, remove the mixture from heat. The finished product will be somewhat translucent. [2] X Research source Allow everything to cool before pouring it into a plastic container for use. Using a whisk can work initially, but you'll need to switch to a heavy spoon when the mixture thickens."

      "title": "Store the paste in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Store the paste in the refrigerator. Use a clean plastic or glass container for storage. The mixture will keep for as long as a month in the refrigerator. If necessary, you add more water and slightly heat the mixture to soften it before use. An old butter tub works well for larger amounts of paste. If you're making paste for multiple projects or more than one person, small yogurt containers with lids work well."

      "title": "Use the cornstarch paste in your arts and crafts projects.",
      "content": "Use the cornstarch paste in your arts and crafts projects. This simple cornstarch paste can be used with yarn, string, Popsicle sticks, and various other children's art. After using cornstarch paste in a craft project, allow it to dry for 24 hours."

    {
      "title": "Use corn syrup and white vinegar.",
      "content": "Use corn syrup and white vinegar. This variation creates a stronger glue that can be used in craft projects in place of regular school glue. Mix 3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml) corn syrup, and 1 tsp white vinegar into a saucepan. Place the pan over low heat. Stir the mixture it until it's blended together well, then remove it from heat."

      "title": "Add cornstarch and water.",
      "content": "Add cornstarch and water. Pour an additional 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water into the saucepan. Slowly and continuously stir the mixture until everything is well combined. The mixture will begin to thicken into a glue-like substance after a few minutes of stirring. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Allow the mixture to cool.",
      "content": "Allow the mixture to cool. The mixture will be very hot, so handle it with care. After bringing it to room temperature, spoon the mixture into a plastic or glass container for storage. Don't pour the mixture into a container while it's still hot, as it could melt the storage container. Do not allow a child to use the paste until it has completely cooled."

    {
      "title": "Add white glue to your mixture.",
      "content": "Add white glue to your mixture. If you'd like your cornstarch paste to dry quickly, you may want to add some white glue to the mixture. Blend enough cornstarch and water to make a thick paste. After heating the mixture until translucent, take it off the heat, and stir in the white glue. [4] X Research source For best results, use a 50/50 mixture of glue and paste. Make sure you stir thoroughly after the white glue is added. Otherwise, the glue will not bind with the cornstarch paste base. The resulting mixture is a good choice for craft projects that require extra gluing power."

      "title": "Add a few drops of essential oil.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of essential oil. Choose your favorite scent and stir in a few drops just before using the glue. A little goes a long way, so don't add more than 3-5 drops. Rose oil is a great touch for glue on a love letter. Peppermint would be an excellent addition to a Christmas card."

      "content": "Sprinkle in some glitter. When the paste is almost hardened, you can mix in some glitter to add sparkle. This is a great way to integrate glitter into arts and crafts without making a big mess. Ensure the glitter is not added too late, or it will be difficult to blend into the paste."
