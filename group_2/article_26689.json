      "content": "Handle private documents carefully. Don’t leave private documents unattended, whether you’re a nurse, lawyer, or an employee handling your company’s confidential material. Remain aware of where the materials are and who can access them. When disposing of confidential documents, do not merely use a single paper shredder, as the shredded paper can be re-integrated. Try to shuffle the documents and then process documents at several paper shredders. If you tend to destroy confidential documents in bulk, contact confidential recycling company on site. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re a healthcare professional, don’t leave a patient’s medical records unattended on a cafeteria table or in a reception area."

      "content": "Lock file rooms, cabinets, and other storage spaces. In addition to securely storing confidential materials, ensure they’re protected from damage. For instance, irreplaceable vital documents should be stored in fireproof, waterproof safes or cabinets. When you leave a secure room, make sure drawers, cabinets, and doors are locked. To avoid accidental breaches, get in the habit of double checking every handle before you walk away from a storage unit or door."

      "content": "Use discretion when discussing confidential information. Always be aware of your surroundings whenever you talk about private information. Discuss sensitive information in a private setting, and make sure only authorized personnel are within earshot. [2] X Research source When you have to confer with a colleague about a patient or client, discuss only the necessary details. Depending on your location and industry, you might be legally required to withhold or change any identifying information. If a client or patient calls you, head to a private location to talk. Unless it’s an emergency, avoid discussing confidential over the phone. Discuss scheduling issues over the phone, for example, but save sensitive information for a face-to-face conversation."

      "content": "Protect intellectual property with confidentiality agreements . Regardless of your role or industry, you’ll most likely sign a non-disclosure agreement at some point in your professional career. Always read any contract carefully before agreeing to its terms. [3] X Research source If you’re an employee, make sure you understand terms such as using your company’s intellectual property within certain bounds or not discussing operations with family and friends. Report to your manager if you need to access to confidential documents, if necessary. If you operate a business, you’ll want to secure any confidential information you need to exchange during transactions, negotiations, and other occasions. For instance, if you’re presenting an invention to a potential investor, it’s wise to have your lawyer draft a non-disclosure agreement to ensure your intellectual property won’t be used without your consent."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with your specific legal and ethical requirements. From healthcare professionals to educators, each profession has its own ethics codes on confidentiality. Furthermore, laws that govern confidentiality vary by location, and industries are regulated in different ways. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source While ethical and legal obligations can get complicated, not knowing them won’t be an excuse if you accidentally breach them. Your employer or professional organization should provide resources on ethical and legal compliance. If you’re not sure about a situation that could lead to a potential ethical or legal pitfall, don’t do anything without doing your homework. Consult your profession’s code of ethics, look up applicable local or federal laws, get advice from a trusted colleague (without disclosing private information), or contact your professional organization."

      "content": "Inform clients and patients how their information is used. If you handle confidential information for a client or patient, you’re most likely ethically or legally bound to make sure they understand their privacy rights. Tell them what information is recorded, how it’s stored and for how long, and how it’s used. [5] X Research source Ask them if they have any questions about how information such as medical or legal records are stored and used. Additionally, inform them of the limitations of their right to privacy. For instance, if you’re a therapist, inform your patient that you’re obligated to report if they threaten to harm themselves or others."

      "content": "Comply with the more stringent law when 2 privacy laws interact. When 2 laws interact, 1 takes precedence over the other. In general, comply with the law that offers stricter privacy protections for a patient or client. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Suppose you’re a psychologist in New Hampshire and you’ve received a subpoena requesting information about a patient. New Hampshire (NH) state law and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) both govern how providers handle patient records, but vary when it comes to disclosing patient records to legal authorities. Since NH law requires a court order or patient consent, rather than a subpoena alone, it offers stricter protection than HIPAA. In this case, you’d be breaking the law if you complied with the subpoena."

      "content": "Obey mandatory reporting laws. Sometimes, you’re legally obligated to disclose information that would otherwise be confidential. For instance, if you’re a healthcare professional, you’re required to contact the authorities if a patient tells you they plan on harming themselves or others. Failure to do so could land you in legal trouble and jeopardize your professional certification. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Additionally, patient or client records might be requested by subpoena, court order, or warrant. If necessary, disclose only the information specified in the legal demand. For instance, if a court order requests information about a specific injury, don’t disclose records about an illness they had as a child. Keep in mind that attorney-client privilege takes precedence over legal demands, such as a discovery request or ordering a lawyer to testify under oath. [12] X Research source"
