      "content": "Standard Shein shipping usually takes 7-10 business days. Most customers in the United States can expect their package to arrive within this time frame, though the package may arrive sooner with express or expedited shipping. Packages will ship after the order has been processed at the warehouse, which may take a few business days. [1] X Research source Express shipping typically takes 3-7 days after the order has been processed. Expedited shipping , while not always available, usually takes between 2-4 business days after the order has been processed. Note that express shipping is not available for P.O. boxes and APO/FPO addresses."

      "content": "Order volume and processing Large orders with multiple items typically require more time for processing, picking, and packing. Items that require customization, like tailored sizing, may also take longer to process because they need additional production.

The closer a destination is to one of these hubs, the more quickly the package will be delivered. However, sometimes the nearest warehouse is out of stock of the items needed, so an order may be rerouted to a hub farther away, resulting in delayed shipping times. [4] X Research source"
