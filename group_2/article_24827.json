      "content": "Gather 4 safety pins and 2 hair ties. To keep your off-the-shoulder tops in place, you’ll need 4 safety pins and 2 hair ties. The safety pins don’t need to be big ones — they just have to be able to attach to a hair tie. Look for soft hair ties if you have them since they’ll be under your arm. If you don’t have hair ties, you can use rubber bands, but rubber bands won’t be as comfortable. [1] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019."

      "content": "Choose a top that fits comfortably on your shoulders. You don’t want to pick a top that is too tight and cuts into your shoulders. Picking a top that’s too loose can lead to you having to pull up your off-the-shoulder top constantly, which is also an annoyance. Choose a top that fits your shoulders well, holding itself up while not cutting into your arms. [10] X Research source Always try the top on to determine if it's a good fit. Adjust it how you'd want to wear it on your arms, and then move your arms up and down. If it's sliding all around on your arm, it's not a good fit. If you're purchasing an off-shoulder top online, read the reviews to see what people are saying about whether or not it stays on your arms. Try it on once it arrives, but make sure you don't take off the tags until you're sure you want to keep it."

You definitely don’t want to be constricted to keeping your arms at your sides, and if it’s that tight, the sleeves will definitely slide up whenever you move. When you try on an off-the-shoulder top, move your arms around to test it out before making a decision. [11] X Research source"
