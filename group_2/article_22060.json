      "content": "Make it spontaneous, or plan ahead with an alarm. Spontaneous sex can be thrilling, but it isn’t always practical—especially when you have things to do and places to be. [1] X Research source If it’s a lazy weekend morning, though, don’t be afraid to have an unplanned romp in the sheets. Otherwise, plan for it the night before and set a pleasant alarm 30-60 minutes earlier than usual, so you have plenty of time. To be spontaneous, you might wake up your partner with gentle kisses, then lead into some sexy touching. If they’re into it, try going on to your preferred type of frisky fun. You might plan even further ahead, or establish a day that generally works. Maybe you drop the kids off at grandma’s the night before so you can enjoy a morning to yourselves."

      "content": "Wake your partner up with a sexy morning massage. Get your partner awake and ready to go with some slow and sensual foreplay . Start by gently rubbing their back in slow strokes. [2] X Research source Once they’re awake, gently rub your hands up their thighs to get them in the mood, or smooth your hands over their shoulders, neck, chest, or any other sensitive areas where they enjoy a gentle touch. Slip out of your pajamas and spoon your partner to get some skin-to-skin contact while you massage them. Licensed counselor Tara Vossenkemper reminds us that communication and consent is key. Don’t perform sexual acts on your partner if they’re still asleep, and respect their boundaries if they say they’re too tired or not in the mood."

      "content": "Ease into the action so you both have time to wake up. It can take a little time to get going in the morning, especially if you’ve gotten up extra early. Instead of aiming for anything wild or energetic, take it slow and easy. Start with some kissing, cuddling, and pillow talk, then gradually work your way up to more intense action. [3] X Research source If there isn’t any time pressure, take some time to spoon and snuggle afterwards. You could even go back to sleep for a few minutes before hopping into the shower and getting your day started.

      "content": "Get to bed early so you’ll be more energized in the morning. It’s harder to get in the mood when you’re groggy and sleep deprived. If you’re interested in morning sex, get to bed a little earlier than usual the night before so you’ll wake up refreshed and ready to go. [4] X Research source For example, if you usually go to bed at 11 p.m. and wake up dragging the next day, try pushing your bedtime back to 9:30 or 10:00. That way, your energy levels will be higher when you wake up."

You don’t have to be totally groomed and Instagram perfect before having morning fun, but having a minty fresh mouth will make the experience more enjoyable for everyone. [5] X Research source Hop out of bed and give your teeth a quick brush before you start making out, or do it while you use the restroom after you wake up. If you’d rather get straight to the action, keep some mints or breath freshening strips in your nightstand for a quick fix. If you’re gonna brush your teeth afterward, wait for 1-2 hours. Irritating your mouth after oral can lead to greater risk of infection. [6] X Research source"
