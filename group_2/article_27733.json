      "content": "Gather your materials. This is a much simpler recipe than making your soap from scratch. It involves melting a pre-made soap base down and then modifying it with your own ingredients. Here's what you'll need: 1 lb Soap base of your choosing (suspension-friendly) 4 oz rolled oats (can add more or less to suit your tastes) 1.5 tsp almond oil (optional) 2 oz roasted almonds (optional) 1 to 2 tbsp honey (optional) Pot and/or heat-proof container for melting soap Large bowl or measuring cup for mixing Whisk or spoon for mixing Soap mould or pan measuring roughly 9 x 4 inches Wax paper or parchment paper (optional)"

      "title": "Choose a soap base.",
      "content": "Choose a soap base. Craft shops have many different soap base options: goat's milk, shea butter, and olive oil are popular choices. Most importantly, choose a suspension formula to ensure that your oats won't sink to the bottom of the soap during the cooling process. Soap bases are often called “melt-and-pour” soap bases by crafters, since all you need to do is melt down the base, add your ingredients, pour it into a mould, and then let it cool. If a soap base isn't easy for you to obtain, you can also purchase a regular bar of soap and just melt it down, add the oats, and let it cool. Any soap bar will do, although one with higher-quality ingredients will make your skin feel nicer."

      "title": "Prepare your mould.",
      "content": "Prepare your mould. You can use whatever moulds you like for this recipe. If you're making regular bar soap, you can get away with using a 9 x 4 inch baking pan. You can really use whatever shape you want though. If you use metal or plastic containers that aren't specifically made for soap, be sure to line them with wax paper or parchment paper before pouring your soap into them. This will make it much easier for you to remove the soap once it's cooled. Some soap-makers even line their professional soap moulds. This helps prevent the soap from getting stuck in the corners of rectangular and square moulds. If you're using moulds with more detailed shapes, you won't want to line them as this will obscure the design."

      "title": "Melt the soap base down.",
      "content": "Melt the soap base down. You can do this by placing it directly in a saucepan over low heat. Another option is to place it in a large heat-proof bowl and place that bowl in a saucepan full of a few inches of simmering water (i.e. a double-boiler). You can also melt the soap base down in the microwave. For this option, you'd put it in a heat-proof container (ceramic or glass) and then microwave in short intervals (probably a minute at first, then 15 to 30 seconds at a time) until it's completely melted. For all three options, be sure to stir the soap constantly to make sure it's fully melted and doesn't get scorched. If using the microwave, take the soap out and stir it in between intervals."

Pour your oats (or almond-oat mixture) into the melted soap mixture while stirring it, ensuring that it's well-mixed and that there are no clumps. If you're also adding honey and almond oil to the mixture, add these wet ingredients to the melted soap before you add the oats/oat-almond mixture. This will ensure the liquids are evenly distributed. This is the point at which you can add any other ingredients you'd like to add to the mixture. Common ingredients that soap-makers like to add to their bars include vitamin E oil, essential oils (lavender and orange blossom are popular scents), and poppy seeds (alone, not with oats)."

Adding water to lye will cause a strong reaction, with the solution erupting up out of the container, possibly causing injury to you.

You should be able to lift the hand mixer or whisk out of the mixture, and the drippings should appear on the surface of the mixture rather than disappearing right into it. You can also check the mixture's temperature to make sure it's ready to go.

At this time you can take it out of the container and cut it up. Be sure to wear your protective gear because the lye will not have completely neutralized at this point, and can still cause you harm. If your soap looks crumbly, crusty, or has liquid or powder floating on top of it, you'll need to throw it out and start again.

Allowing the soap to “cure” will give it time to harden, dry out, and become more gentle as the pH of the soap lowers over time.
