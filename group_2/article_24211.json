Operating systems have varying system requirements, so if you have an older computer, make sure that your computer can handle a newer operating system. The following are some of the system requirements for different operating systems: Windows 11 — 64-bit 1 gigahertz (GHz) dual-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB or larger hard drive, UEFI, Secure Boot capable, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver, 9\" HD (720p or greater) display with at least 8-bit color, Internet connection. [1] X Research source Window 10 — 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor, 1 GB RAM for 32-bit processors or 2 GB RAM for 64-bit processors, 16 GB hard drive space for 32-bit processors or 20 GB hard drive space for 64-bit processors.

Arch Linux is not recommended for beginners. macOS — macOS is designed to run on Apple computers only. While it is possible to install macOS on a non-Mac computer , it is a long and complex process, and it requires your PC to have very specific hardware. macOS simply will not run on many PCs."

This means that you will lose all of your files on the computer unless you back them up . [7] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Always make sure that any important files are copied to a backup location before starting the installation process. You can use an external hard drive to back up your data. You can also use cloud storage, such as DropBox , Google Drive , iCloud, or OneDrive . If you are installing the operating system alongside your existing one, you most likely will not have to delete any data. It is still wise to back up important files just in case. You cannot backup programs; they will need to be reinstalled once you have finished installing your new operating system."

Regardless of which operating system you want to install, you can download the ISO file from the developer's website. An ISO file is a disc image that needs to be burned to a disc or copied to a bootable USB drive . Alternatively, Windows 10 and 11 allow you to download a media creation tool you can use to create a bootable USB drive, instead of downloading an ISO file. When upgrading Windows, you can only upgrade to your current edition. This means that if you have Windows 10 Home Edition, you can only upgrade to Windows 11 Home Edition. If you want to upgrade to Windows 11 Pro, you would need to purchase a license to download it. You can download various operating system ISO files from the following websites: { https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 Windows 11], Windows 10 , Linux Ubuntu , Linux Mint , Linux Fedora , OpenSUSE , Arch Linux"
