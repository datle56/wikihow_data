      "content": "Cut your paper. Cut long triangles out of magazines, coloured construction paper, wallpaper, etc. The base of the triangle will be the width of the bead and the longer the triangle is, the fatter the bead will become. The slender 1-inch (2.5cm) beads used in this method are made from 1-inch by 4-inch (2.5cm x 10cm) triangles, but 1/2-inch by 8-inch (1.27cm x 20cm) triangles would create fat 1/2-inch (1.27cm) beads. Cut accordingly.. Always have a guide or a ruler whenever you want to cut a straight line."

      "title": "Roll the bead.",
      "content": "Roll the bead. Starting at the wide end, roll the triangle around itself using a dowel, toothpick, or bamboo skewer. For a symmetrical spiral, keep the triangle centered as you roll; for a more free-form look, allow the triangle to become slightly off-centered. Roll tightly, especially if you want the beads to last. Try to avoid having space between the layers."

      "title": "Apply a varnish.",
      "content": "Apply a varnish. Use a finish like Marvin Medium, ModPodge, Diamond Glaze, or a solution of one part clear-drying glue to two parts water. Let it dry thoroughly, making sure it doesn’t stick to anything. You might shove a toothpick into a pincushion or a piece of Styrofoam to allow it to dry completely. Add multiple coats for a glossier, longer-lasting finish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove your bead.",
      "content": "Remove your bead. Wait several hours until your clear finish has set on the bead. Slide the bead off the end of the dowel. If it is well wrapped and glued, it will hold. If the bead begins to unravel, replace it on your skewer and add more glue and finish where necessary."

The base of the triangle will be the width of the bead and the longer the triangle is, the fatter the bead will become. 1-inch by 4-inch (2.5cm x 10cm) triangles will make slender 1-inch (2.5cm) beads, whereas 1/2-inch by 8-inch (1.27cm x 20cm) triangles would create fat 1/2-inch (1.27cm) beads. Cut accordingly."

      "content": "Create your design. Draw on each cut-out with markers, pencils, or pens. Since the triangle will eventually be rolled onto itself, only the outermost edges and the last inch or two of the tip of the paper will be visible; these are the areas where you should focus your design. Play around with a few colors and design combinations as you go to see what looks best. Color the tip of the triangle red and then alternate 1-inch (2.5cm) strips of orange and red marker down the outside edges; this would create a bead with a red center surrounded by orange and red stripes. Color the tip of the triangle black, move down an inch, draw 1-inch (2.5cm) black strips on either outside edge, move down an inch, and repeat; this would create a zebra-striped bead with a black center. Do not use washable markers, especially if you plan to glaze your beads; the colors will run."
