Divide the costume into 6 sections: helmet, dark clothes, dark boots, dark gloves, cape, and accessories. Decide what type of costume you want - something that is 100% accurate, something that is comfortable, or something that is quick and easy to make. Decide what parts of the costume you can make at home, and what you need to buy from a toy or costume store."

      "content": "Purchase inexpensive black clothing. Black is Darth Vader's signature color, and black clothing is a key element of the costume. You can save money by buying black clothing from a thrift store. You will need a long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt, sweatpants or cargo pants, and socks. Think about where you will be wearing the costume when selecting clothing items. Purchase heavy, bulkier clothes if you plan on wearing it outside as a Halloween costume. For a costume party, look for cotton items that are thin and loose to help keep you comfortable indoors. If you are planning on adding armor or padding (e.g. football pads) underneath your clothes to give you a muscular look, consider buying things in a size or two larger than you normally wear."

      "content": "Make or buy boots and gloves. You will need thick black gloves and boots. As a result of his deformities, Darth Vader kept his body covered-up at all times, including his hands and feet. [4] X Research source Motorcycle gloves and boots work very well because they are big, thick, and typically black. Large leather or pleather gloves, and/or cheap black snow boots work as well. You can also make your own \"boot\" covers to wear over your shoes. Here are the directions: You can sew your own boot covers using pleather material, 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) elastic, and a sewing machine. [5] X Research source Make a pattern by tracing your shoe and pants from the bottom of the sole to your knee. Do this for your right and left leg. Trace the pattern onto your fabric, making sure to include the width of the shoe at the toes and heels, and adding fabric as needed. Leave a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of fabric along one side for a seam. Do this twice for each side and then cut-out your tracings. Sew the two halves together for each boot, only sewing along the sides and keeping the top and bottom open. Cut four pieces of elastic that are the same length as the bottom of your boot. Place one end of the elastic near the right seam and the opposite end next to the left seam. Secure with flat pins and machine stitch elastic to the bottom of your boot. Put the boots on by pulling them over your shoes and pants."

Inflate the balloon and place it in a plastic bucket to prevent it from moving around. Add a single layer of paper mache to the balloon by dipping strips of newspaper into the paste and sticking them directly onto the balloon. Let everything dry before starting the next step. Paper mache can get messy. Use a flat working surface, such as a table or kitchen floor, and spread newspaper over the entire area before you begin."

Once you are finished modeling Darth Vader's features with cardboard, add another layer of paper mache and let dry. Don't forget to create a visor that sticks-out over the eyes and juts out from the side of the face.

Measure yourself in three places: while wearing shoes or boots, measure the distance from the nape or your neck to the floor; stretch your arms to the side and measure the distance between your finger tips; and measure the circumference of your neck at its base. Bring them with you when you go to the fabric store, and ask someone to help you determine how much fabric you need to purchase. Allow yourself extra fabric, about 2.5–3 inches (6.3–7.6 cm) on two sides, for hemming. Fabric is usually sold by the yard."

If you don't know how to use a sewing machine, there are a variety of cape designs available for different skill levels. Additionally, Darth Vader's cape is different from a standard super hero cape in that it doesn't \"swoosh\". You want to use heavy fabric like wool to weigh the cape down. For a basic cape design, you will need: At least 1 yard (0.91 m) heavy black fabric (this is to make a child's costume, adults will need more based on height and weight) At least 1 yard (0.91 m) additional fabric if you decide to include a lining.

Adjust the pattern to accommodate your measurements (height from nape of neck to floor, and width of outstretched arms). Measure the width at the base of your neck to determine the collar size, adding several extra inches for comfort. When finished, cut-out the fabric. Repeat this step if you want to add a lining to your cape. Alternatively, you can draw, cut-out, and then sew two semi-circles together. Fold the fabric in half and pin together. Double your neck-to-floor measurement and mark it on the fabric, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) from the base of the semi-circle to the edge of the material. Use a piece of chalk attached to a string to draw a perfect arch. Cut the material out. In the center, draw and cut-out a smaller semi-circle for your neck. Use a sewing machine to stitch the two halves together."

      "content": "Hem the collar and bottom of the cape and add velcro. Use a sewing machine to hem the collar and bottom of the cape using a simple double-fold hem. Fold the fabric over about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm), and then fold it again another 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Secure with straight pins. Sew the hem about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.3 cm) from the second folded edge. When done, flatten the hem with an iron. When taking initial measurements for your cape, you want to add several extra inches for a hem. Hemming your cape will make it more durable and prevent the edges from fraying. Secure the collar together by sewing or gluing a 2–3 inch (5.1–7.6 cm) piece of velcro on each side. If your cape is heavy, you might need a slightly larger piece of velcro."

You can use old football or hockey gear, such as shoulder and chest pads, shin guards, and/or an athletic girdle. To avoid chafing, you should wear a t-shirt and briefs under the pads. [8] X Research source If wearing one, put the athletic girdle or shapewear on first. [9] X Research source Next, position the shoulder pads so they are comfortable and have someone help you secure them in the front and back. Finally, tie or strap-on knee of shin guards. Pads can be bulky and make it difficult or uncomfortable to move around in. If you are not used to them, practice wearing them around the house for a few hours over several days. Use duct tape (attached to clothing - not skin) to help secure pads that feel loose or shift too much. Sports equipment is expensive. If you do not have pads of your own, ask to borrow them from a friend or check a second-hand store or consignment shop for clean used items."

If you decide not to wear pads, but still want to create a bulky look, consider wearing a thick sweatshirt or layer several shirts. You can do the same for pants - wear two pairs of sweatpants, or pull black sweatpants over a regular pair of jeans.
