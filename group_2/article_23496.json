You can also filter the results to show only users with the same handle name, display name, and/or include their Twitter/X handle name in their Bluesky description. While this tool is helpful, it's not foolproof—if someone from Twitter/X is using a different name on Bluesky and didn’t include their old Twitter/X handle in their description, Sky Follower Bridge may not be able to find them. Similarly, if someone on Bluesky snagged a Twitter/X user's username before that person had the chance to create an account, you'll see the wrong person in the results. Double-check each profile before following."

Because the import will repost all your tweets at once, only use this method if you don't have followers—otherwise, you'll be spamming them. This tool also doesn't preserve replies, so conversations may be confusing once imported.
