      "title": "Remove the ink tube from a pen that has a metallic body.",
      "content": "Remove the ink tube from a pen that has a metallic body. Unscrew the mouth of the pen to reveal the ink tube. Pull out the ink tube and the spring from the body of the pen and then screw the pen back together. Throw the ink tube straight into the trash once you remove it to stop it from leaking on your furniture. [1] X Research source It is important to use a pen with a metallic body, as this conducts the electrical charge from your hand which makes the stylus to work."

      "title": "Push a little cotton ball into the tip of the pen.",
      "content": "Push a little cotton ball into the tip of the pen. The cotton ball helps to conduct the electrical current and gives the stylus a padded pointer. Roll up a little cotton ball and push it into the nib of the pen. Try to push as much of the cotton ball as you can into the pen so that it doesn't come loose when you try to use the stylus. [2] X Research source If you don't have a cotton ball, use a small piece of cotton fabric."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim off any excess cotton ball that is hanging out of the nib.",
      "content": "Trim off any excess cotton ball that is hanging out of the nib. This makes the stylus easier to use and makes its touch more accurate. Leave about 2 millimetres (0.079 in) of the cotton ball hanging out of the pen so that the tip of the metal pen doesn't scratch your screen. [3] X Research source If the cotton ball falls out or gets pushed into the pen over time, simply push a little more of the cotton ball into the nib of the pen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your pen stylus in the same way that you would use your finger.",
      "content": "Use your pen stylus in the same way that you would use your finger. Press the cotton ball down on the screen to activate it. Move the stylus around the screen to navigate around the device. Keep spare cotton balls on hand to refill your stylus in case it falls out with usage or in storage. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Unscrew the pen to remove the ink tube.",
      "content": "Unscrew the pen to remove the ink tube. In order to make this stylus, you need a pen that can be unscrewed. Remove the spring and ink tube from inside the pen and then reassemble the pen. [5] X Research source Keep the small inside parts of the pen away from children, as they can pose a choking risk."

      "title": "Cut the middle of a cotton swab on an angle.",
      "content": "Cut the middle of a cotton swab on an angle. Estimate where the middle of the cotton swab is and then chop it in half on a sharp angle. This creates a pointy end on the plastic part of the cotton swab which makes it easier to insert into the pen. [6] X Research source Throw 1 half of the cotton swab into the trash, as it is not needed for the stylus."
    },
    {
      "title": "Poke the pointy end of the cotton swab into the tip of the pen.",
      "content": "Poke the pointy end of the cotton swab into the tip of the pen. Leave the cotton portion of the cotton swab and about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) of the plastic handle out of the pen. Don't worry if the cotton swab is a little loose, simply hold it in place for now. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the cotton swab in place with a piece of tape.",
      "content": "Secure the cotton swab in place with a piece of tape. Wrap the tape around the plastic portion of the cotton swab and the mouth of the pen so that it stays in place when you are using your stylus. If the cotton swab still feels a little lo0se, simply wrap another piece of tape around it. [8] X Research source Both sticky tape and masking tape work for this task. Avoid using washi tape, as this doesn't tend to be as sticky."

      "title": "Wrap a 9 cm (3.5 in) square of foil around the cotton swab and the neck of the pen.",
      "content": "Wrap a 9 cm (3.5 in) square of foil around the cotton swab and the neck of the pen. Cut out the aluminium foil with a pair of scissors. Wrap the square tightly around the plastic portion of the cotton swab and around the neck of the pen. The aluminium foil helps to transfer the electrical current from your hand to the tip of the cotton swab. [9] X Research source Don't cover up the cotton portion of the cotton swab, as this helps to prevent the screen from getting scratched."

    {
      "title": "Moisten the tip of cotton swab with water each time you use it.",
      "content": "Moisten the tip of cotton swab with water each time you use it. Wet your fingers and then dab the cotton swab with your damp fingers. This small amount of water helps to conduct the electrical current and makes the point of the stylus more accurate. Use your homemade stylus to navigate your way around your device. If it loses its accuracy, simply place a little extra water on the end of the cotton swab. [10] X Research source Avoid soaking the cotton swab in water, as this can leave drops of water on your screen."
