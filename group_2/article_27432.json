      "content": "Blend 8 tablespoons (115 g) of butter into the dry mixture. Cut the butter into cubes and add them to the bowl with the seasoned flour. Use your hands or a stand mixer to mix the ingredients until the butter is incorporated. Then, set the mixture aside. [2] X Research source If you're using a stand mixer, stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally."

      "content": "Stir in up to 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of water to form a soft dough. Get out 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of cold water and pour a few spoonfuls of it into the flour and butter mixture. Use a spoon to stir the dough and keep adding spoonfuls of water until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. You may not need all of the water. Avoid adding too much water or the dough will be too sticky to handle."

Then, pulse the cheese until it's as fine as possible. [3] X Research source Pulverizing the cheese makes it easier to distribute it within the dough."

Then, combine the mixture until the cheese is evenly distributed. [4] X Research source If you don't have a stand mixer, use a stiff spoon or spatula to combine the mixture."

      "content": "Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill it for 2 hours. Tear off a piece of plastic wrap and tightly wrap the dough with it. Put the dough in the fridge to rest for 2 hours. This helps the gluten in the dough relax so it doesn't shrink as the cheetos cook. [5] X Research source"

Roll the dough piece between your palms to make a 2 in (5.1 cm) long cheeto. Repeat this for the rest of the dough.

To test if the cheetos are done, carefully remove 1 from the sheet and break it in half. If the cheeto doesn't snap in half easily, bake it for another 2 or 3 minutes and check them again.

[11] X Research source For a slightly smoky flavor, used smoked paprika. If you'd like to store the seasoning to use another time, put it in an airtight container and store it at room temperature for up to 6 months. Although you can use the seasoning after 6 months, the spices will begin to lose their bold flavor."

Keep in mind that this makes about 1 tablespoon (0.5 g) of seasoning, so you don't need a large bowl. [12] X Research source If you want to make just enough seasoning for a small bag of cheetos, halve the amounts or set aside half of the seasoning for later."

[13] X Research source If you have trouble getting the seasoning to stick to the cheetos, spray them with cooking spray and try stirring them again."
