      "content": "Place the eggs in a saucepan or pot. Set your eggs at the bottom of a heavy-bottomed saucepan or pot. If you’re cooking more than one, place them next to each other gently to avoid breaking. Avoid placing more than 4 eggs on top of each other. To keep the eggs from cracking as they boil, consider placing a folded cheesecloth at the bottom of the pot to pad them. If you're unsure whether your eggs are fresh, test them by placing them in a bowl of water. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh. If it floats to the top, get rid of it. Pro tip: Let your eggs come to room temperature before boiling to help prevent cracking and make them easier to peel.

Steady the eggs with your hand as you add the water to keep them from breaking, or just point the stream of water at the side of the pan. [2] X Research source Cold water helps to keep the eggs from overcooking. Never drop eggs directly into a pot of hot water, or the shells will crack and the egg will run (giving you poached eggs). Salted water helps to make the egg white firm up more quickly. It also helps plug small leaks if the shell cracks during the cooking process. [3] X Research source"

The water will boil more quickly with the lid on, but it's fine to leave it off if you'd rather keep an eye on the eggs. [4] X Research source You can stir the eggs very gently every now and then to make sure they've not settled at the bottom, where they'll cook less evenly and break more easily. Use a wooden spoon to stir gently."

The heat of the water and the remaining warmth from the burner will be enough to finish cooking your eggs. [5] X Research source Depending on how hard or soft you like your eggs, you can leave them like this for about 3 to 20 minutes: If you like your eggs soft-boiled , remove them from the water in 3 minutes or less. The whites will be set, while the yolks will be runny and warm. [6] X Research source If you like your eggs medium-boiled , remove them from the water in 5 to 7 minutes. The yolks will be semi-soft in the very center and the whites will be firm. If you like your eggs hard-boiled , leave the eggs in the hot water for up to 10 to 15 minutes. The yolks will be firm all the way through."

As soon as you've cooked your eggs for the desired amount of time, drain the hot water from the pan or remove the eggs one by one with a slotted spoon. Place the eggs under cold running water or drop them carefully into a bowl of ice water to bring their temperature down. Let them sit in cool water for about 15 minutes. [7] X Research source Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand comfortably, put them in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes to loosen the shells. If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are, you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them right after chilling. To test whether an egg is hard-boiled without breaking it, whirl it on a table. If it spins fast and easily, it’s hard-boiled. If it wobbles, it needs more time."

      "content": "Peel the eggs when you're ready to eat them. Press each egg into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell. Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell. This makes it slightly easier to peel. [8] X Research source Rinse the eggs under cold water as you peel them to keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg. Quick peeling tip: Put the eggs back in the pan you cooked them in and put the lid back on. Shake the pan back and forth to crack all the shells at once."

You can store leftovers in a bowl with a plate on top or a sealed container. In both cases, cover the eggs with a wet paper towel. Change the paper towel each day to keep the eggs from drying out. [9] X Research source Eat the eggs within 4 to 5 days. You can also store the eggs in cold water. Change the water each day to keep the eggs from breaking down. Hard-boiled eggs can be stored for several days before cracking and peeling them, but they tend to get a little rubbery and dried out. It's usually better to store peeled eggs."

      "title": "If your yolks are grayish-green, cook for less time.",
      "content": "If your yolks are grayish-green, cook for less time. Letting boiled eggs cook too long can give the yolks a gray-green ring and a sulfur-like smell. There's nothing wrong with these eggs, and they are perfectly safe for eating. However, if you find this unappetizing, reduce how long you let the eggs cook next time. [10] X Research source The gray-green color is formed when iron from the yolk reacts with hydrogen sulfide from the white. This reaction occurs after the rest of the egg has finished cooking. [11] X Research source Extra heat also tends to over-coagulate the proteins in the egg. This can make the white rubbery and the yolks dry."

If you notice that the first egg you peel and crack is undercooked, return the rest to hot water and allow them to sit for longer. Undercooked eggs can pose a risk of salmonella infection. The FDA recommends cooking all eggs until the yolks are firm or using eggs that have been in-shell pasteurized. [12] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Spin an egg on a hard surface to test whether it’s cooked all the way through. If it spins evenly (like a top), the egg is cooked. If the egg spirals or wobbles, it may be undercooked."

      "content": "If your egg is hard to peel, steam it . The fresher your egg is when it’s boiled, the harder it may be to peel. Steaming the egg before you cook it can help separate the egg’s membrane from the shell, making it easier to peel. Simply place the eggs in a metal colander and rest the colander on a pan. Boil an 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in the pan for about 10 minutes, turning the eggs frequently. [13] X Research source Some people also like to add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water when boiling eggs that are very fresh, but this can add a sulfuric taste to the eggs. When eggs are just a day or two old, the membrane sticks to the shell, making the egg difficult to peel. The best eggs for hard-boiling are about 7 to 10 days old. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "If your egg cracks in the water, add vinegar. Eggs cracking while boiling is a common problem, especially if your eggs are very cold. To fix this, simply add a small spoonful of vinegar to the water. This helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster, plugging the cracks in the shell. Try to be quick here. If you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly. You may notice a little whiteness creeping out of a cracked egg. If you don't get to it with the vinegar in time, don't worry. It should still boil fine, but it may look a little funky."

Hard-boiled eggs are packed with protein, making them a delicious and nutritious addition to just about any meal or snack. They also have a mild taste that’s not too eggy, so they’re extremely versatile in flavor combinations. Here are some of our favorite ways to use hard-boiled eggs: [15] X Research source Slice hard-boiled eggs lengthwise and whip up their yolks to make deviled eggs. Mix chopped hard-boiled eggs with mayonnaise, onions, sweet relish, and celery to make an egg salad. Top a salad with halved or chopped hard-boiled eggs. Pickle hard-boiled eggs with apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, peppercorn, and salt. Place slices of hard-boiled egg, avocado, and tomato on a piece of toast."
