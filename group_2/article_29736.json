There are three common ways to get a name tag: [3] X Research source Loot chests: Name tags can be found inside chests in dungeons, abandoned mineshafts, woodland mansions, and Nether Fortresses. [4] X Research source Fishing: Each time you catch a fish , it has a 0.8% chance of being a name tag. [5] X Research source With the Luck of the Sea enchantment on your fishing rod, the probability rate increases to 1.9%. Trading with a librarian: Complete lower-tier trades with a librarian until you've unlocked the 6th tier (Master). At that point, you can buy a name tag for 20 to 22 emeralds . [6] X Research source"

[12] X Research source If you sheared the sheep, let it graze in some grass to bring back its shimmering rainbow wool. You also can’t breed rainbow sheep—the only way to get a rainbow sheep is to name it “jeb_”. Any baby sheep you breed from rainbow sheep will be the original color of one of their parents.

This works on all animals and villagers except the ender dragon and squid. “Toast” gives a rabbit black and white spots. This effect was created after a user asked Minecraft developer Ryan Holtz to make a rabbit that looked like his lost bunny named Toast. This only works on rabbits. “Johnny” causes a vindicator to attack all other mobs except evokers, pillagers, vindicators, and ghasts. This only works on vindicators."

[17] X Research source When you shear a dyed sheep, its wool will be the same color as the dye."
