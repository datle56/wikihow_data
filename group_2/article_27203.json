      "content": "Warm 1 gallon (3.8 L) of fresh goat’s milk to 86°F (30°C) in a stainless steel pot. Stir it regularly so that it does not burn on the bottom. Check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer and remove it from the heat when you reach the target temperature. [1] X Research source Feta is traditionally made with goat’s milk but you can use cow’s or sheep’s milk as well. Try to not let the temperature go more than 1-2 degrees above the target temperature. It’s important to use a stainless steel pot because it is a non-reactive metal, which means that it will not interact with the milk."

      "content": "Mix 1 tbsp (15 ml) of plain yogurt with an equal amount of goat’s milk. Stir the blended yogurt and milk into the warmed milk and mix it thoroughly with a kitchen spoon or ladle. Cover the pot and allow the inoculated milk to sit for 1 hour at room temperature. [2] X Research source The live yogurt cultures will help the milk to curdle."

Let it cool in the fridge before you dissolve the rennet in it. [3] X Research source You can order rennet online or visit a specialty shop that carries cheesemaking supplies."

      "content": "Add the dissolved rennet to the milk after it has sat for 1 hour. Stir the mixture with a kitchen spoon or ladle vigorously for 15-20 seconds to mix it thoroughly. The milk will begin to thicken after 10 minutes. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the milk mixture sit covered overnight at room temperature.",
      "content": "Let the milk mixture sit covered overnight at room temperature. This will allow the milk to coagulate and the curds to develop. Put the pot somewhere out of the way and make sure it is securely covered with the lid so that no contaminants can get in. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the break between the curd and the whey the next morning. The milk will look gelled and some of the whey, or liquid, will have separated. Insert a clean finger or knife into the curd and slowly pull it out to see how the curd breaks. [6] X Research source The curd should split neatly and the whey should look opaque."

[7] X Research source The cheese curds will move around as you cut them, so don’t worry about making each one a perfect cube."

Any pieces you miss will break up later in the process so don’t worry too much about getting every piece perfect. [8] X Research source"

Place it above a bowl or container and let all the whey strain out for 2-4 hours. [9] X Research source You can let the whey strain out either at room temperature or in the fridge. Save the drained whey in the bowl or container."

Let it sit overnight. [11] X Research source To make a homemade cheese mold, cut the ends out of a smooth-sided 4 x 5 inch tin and save one of the cut ends. You can use a sterile handkerchief instead of cheesecloth in the mold."

Let the whey brine sit out at room temperature, covered, for 12-24 hours to make it acidic. [12] X Research source The brine must be acidic or else the cheese will melt on the surface."

Leave a bit of space at the top of the jar because you will cover the cheese with brine. [13] X Research source A mason jar is a good option for storing your homemade feta."

[14] X Research source The feta will stay good for up to 1 year as long as you keep it in the fridge and in brine. The cheese will become drier and more easy to crumble with time."
