      "content": "Put the cigarette in your mouth. Place the filter end of the cigarette into your mouth. You can hold your cigarette using your index finger and thumb. Another way to hold it is to use your middle finger and index finger. Make sure you put the filter end into your mouth. You can tell because the filter side will often be another color and there will be cotton in that end. You can put either end into your mouth if you are smoking filterless cigarettes."

      "title": "Create a flame with your lighter.",
      "content": "Create a flame with your lighter. Hold your lighter with your thumb positioned on the spark-wheel. Flick your thumb down while holding onto the button. Your other fingers should be gripping the body of the lighter. Some lighters will have buttons instead of spark wheels. In this case, do the same thing except press the button with your thumb. It may be easier to light if you use your dominant hand."

      "title": "Bring the flame to the tip of your cigarette.",
      "content": "Bring the flame to the tip of your cigarette. Continue holding the button on the lighter as you bring it to the tip of your cigarette. Allow the cigarette to lay in the flame. Holding the flame on a lighter for an extended period of time will make the metal on it incredibly hot because of heat transfer. Stand behind a wall or cup your hand around the lighter to prevent the flame from going out."

    {
      "title": "Inhale while the flame is still touching the tip of your cigarette.",
      "content": "Inhale while the flame is still touching the tip of your cigarette. This will cause air to travel through the tobacco in the cigarette, causing it to light. Once the cigarette is lit, release the button on the lighter. Exhaling through your cigarette will cause a flare up from the flame on the tip of your cigarette."

      "title": "Obtain a match from a box or book of matches.",
      "content": "Obtain a match from a box or book of matches. Remove the match and hold it with your index finger and thumb. You can pick matches up at most department and convenience stores. You can purchase strike-anywhere matches, which can be struck on many rough surfaces or safety matches, which can only be struck on the striker provided with the matches. [2] X Research source Some stores and bars give away matches for free."

    {
      "title": "Drag the match against the striker.",
      "content": "Drag the match against the striker. Holding the match firmly in your hand, strike it against the striker strip that was provided on the side of your box or on the back of your book of matches. Friction between the striker and the match ignites the red phosphorus that’s on the tip of your match and converts it to white phosphorus. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring the match to the tip of your cigarette.",
      "content": "Bring the match to the tip of your cigarette. With the match still lit, bring it to the tip of your cigarette. Make sure that the flame is engulfing the end of the cigarette. You can cup your other hand around the match to ensure it doesn’t go out. Lighting a match is difficult under rainy or windy conditions."

    {
      "title": "Inhale through your cigarette.",
      "content": "Inhale through your cigarette. Inhale through the filter side of your cigarette to light it. Make sure to do this quickly because the match will continue to burn. If your match gets too low, blow it out and try another one."

    {
      "title": "Blow on your match to put it out.",
      "content": "Blow on your match to put it out. Make sure that after you light your cigarette that you fully blow out your match. Leaving a lit or hot match could cause a dangerous fire. You can also shake your hand quickly to put out the flame."

      "title": "Use a grill lighter as an alternative to the traditional cigarette lighter.",
      "content": "Use a grill lighter as an alternative to the traditional cigarette lighter. Even though they are usually used to ignite a grill, grill lighters make for a quick alternative if you don’t have matches or a traditional lighter. Grill lighters have a long stem and a handle with a button on it. [4] X Research source Light your cigarette in the same way you would use a disposable lighter."

      "content": "Turn on your gas stove for a quick flame. If you don’t have any sort of lighter or match in your house, you can turn on your stove and put your cigarette on it to light it. Turn on your gas stove and carefully place the tip of the cigarette into the flame with your hands. Once the flame starts to burn on the end, try to take a drag from it. Don’t put your face near the burner or you can burn yourself. If you smell gas, but there is no flame, put out your cigarette, go outside, and call 911."

      "content": "Use the tip of another person’s lit cigarette to light your own. If you’re in a social situation and there is no lighter or matches in sight, you can use the tip of another lit cigarette to light yours. To do this simply touch the end of the lit cigarette to the end of yours while it’s in your mouth and inhale. This is also a great way to start a conversation with a stranger."

      "title": "Use a Zippo gas lighter.",
      "content": "Use a Zippo gas lighter. Lighting a cigarette with a Zippo lighter is very similar to lighting one with a disposable lighter. Make sure that your lighter has enough fluid. Some Zippo lighters are even wind resistant. Closing the lid on a Zippo lighter extinguishes the flame."
