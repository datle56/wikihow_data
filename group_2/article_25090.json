      "content": "Learn what fleas look like. Most people think that fleas are microscopic, but if you look closely you can see them without a magnifying class. Adult fleas are very small, less than 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.3 cm) long. They're reddish-brown insects and they don't have wings, but they can still jump very high. Fleas' bodies are laterally compressed, so their bodies are wider from back-to-belly than they are from side-to-side."

      "title": "Look for signs of fleas on your cat.",
      "content": "Look for signs of fleas on your cat. Take a fine-toothed comb and comb your cat's hair from back to front. Look at the skin for flea bites. Since fleas must bite in order to feed on blood, their bites will leave behind red, broken skin. You should also look for flea dirt, or poop. Once you've combed your cat, shake the flakes and specks of dirt out of the comb onto a white paper towel and add water. The flea dirt will become reddish brown, because it's made of digested blood. This is another sign that your cat has fleas. If you are unsure if your cat has fleas, take her to your veterinarian. The veterinarian can identify the fleas and prescribe treatments to get rid of the parasites. Check your cat closely if she's been outside or somewhere where she may have been exposed to fleas (boarding facility, groomers, friend's house, motel, etc)."

Be aware that Selamectin is not licensed as a product to kill ticks. It only has partial success with some ticks, and is not effective against Ixodes, which is the species which carries Lyme disease. If ticks are your main concern then speak to your veterinarian about more effective methods of control, such as a Seresto collar or Frontline. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn what ticks look like. Although different tick species have different characteristics, most ticks have an oval-shaped body with a small head. They're usually reddish brown, dark brown, black, or grey in color. Ticks are generally no bigger than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) long and some species may be much smaller. Note that fully fed females can dramatically swell up to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) in size when they're full of blood. Unlike fleas, ticks aren't insects. They're arachnids, like spiders, so the adults have 8 legs. The younger or smallest ticks (larvae) have 6 legs."

You won't be able to see the tick's head while it's feeding, which might make it hard to tell if you're looking at a tick or dark skin growth. To tell the difference, look for the tick's legs. Ticks also tend to accumulate in warm, protected areas of the body, like between the paw pads, in the ears, and armpits. However, they can be found anywhere on your cat’s body. If you are not sure whether the insect is a tick, you can place it in a completely sealed plastic bag and bring it to your cat’s veterinarian. Check your cat closely if she's been outside or somewhere where she may have been exposed to ticks (tall grassy fields, barns, farm, etc)."
