      "content": "Examine your dinnerware for the characteristics of china. Antique china will have certain qualities that distinguish it from other kinds of dinnerware. The two main factors that you'll be looking for include shape/design and the pattern on the china. These factors will change depending on the period in which they were produced. Prior to the 1950s, most china plates were round, with the exception of some art deco pieces in the 1920s. Generally, china will either have rimmed or coupe plates. Rim plate china contains a second circle indented inside the plate, while coupe plates are all one diameter in shape. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Compare the patterns on your china with online examples. This can be especially helpful when you do not know the manufacturer of your china, as many patterns are unique to certain producers. You'll want to make sure the unique features, like corner-work and artistic flourishes, are the same between patterns. Two examples of specialty company designs include Haviland, which was known for china with soft floral displays, and Wedgwood, which themed china patterns off portraits or classical Greek scenes.

      "content": "Look for consistency and evaluate quality in sets. A complete set is often worth more than a single piece. However, different pieces that have similar patterns can often be mistaken as part of a set. Most sets are usually consistent throughout, including similar borders, corner-work, shape, and pattern. While checking for consistency, you'll have a perfect chance to scope out the quality as well. An ideal set will be consistent in both pattern and color. The glaze and construction are also a good way of determining quality. Glaze should not be bubbled or cracked, and the pieces should be completely level so that they don't wobble when laid on the table. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a back stamp or marker stamp.",
      "content": "Look for a back stamp or marker stamp. This is the easiest way to identify the manufacturer of your dinnerware, although in many cases the stamps may have faded or become illegible. [4] X Research source Once you know the manufacturer, you can look up the approximate value of the piece online. The back/marker stamp is usually found on the bottom of the dinnerware. Look for a marking that is painted, impressed, or stamped on the piece. Back/marker stamps can be very small, but these usually include an emblem of some sort, the name of the manufacturer, and possibly numbers indicating the class or date of the piece. A good way of finding the approximate value of your piece is to search for an identical or nearly identical piece on an online auction to see its going value. However, this approximation may vary greatly from that of a professional appraiser. If you find that your dinnerware is valuable, you might want to take it to a professional appraiser so you can determine the precise value. If the stamp on the back of your dinnerware is illegible, you can compare its markings with more visible ones on similar dinnerware in an antique catalog at your local library or an electronic directory online."

      "content": "Use historical trends to your advantage. Certain designs were more popular than others historically. For example, dinnerware from 1900 - 1920 frequently had floral patterns featuring violets, pastel colors, and were rimmed with a shaped edge. Other trends that might help you identify antique dinnerware include: Designs from 1920 - 1940, which often featured bright colors and geometric shapes. Pastel colors were still somewhat popular at this time, as well as ivory or cream white pieces with gold or silver gilding. Designs from 1940 - 1950, which leaned more heavily on bold colors like red, blue, and green. Pastels were rare during this period. The shape most popular in this era was rimless and streamlined. Designs from 1950 - 1970 rarely had gold trim, as the recent invention of the microwave made this impractical. Pastels returned to popularity, but were more muted than the dinnerware of the past.

      "content": "Utilize references from a library or bookstore. Digital images can be of low quality or difficult to scrutinize closely, so you may want to visit a library or the antiques/collectibles section of your local book store. Using references at these places, you can compare your dinnerware to other pieces to assist with identification. Your local library may have a specific section devoted to arts and collectibles. This may be the best place to start your research. If your dinnerware has a specific name stamped on it, such as Limoges or Wedgwood, you'll likely be able to find books about those particular manufacturers."

      "content": "Establish a likely period in which your dinnerware was produced. Sometimes a piece of dinnerware can appear as though it fits in a few different periods. But once you narrow down your choices to a likely few, you can compare your piece to others in that period. If you notice many similarities, chances are good the piece was produced in that period. In some cases, the back/marker stamp on the bottom of your dinnerware may give you the exact date of its production. This can help significantly with your research. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Maintain the original condition of unappraised items. If you see a small crack or some other kind of deformity in your dinnerware, you might be tempted to do a quick-fix repair or touch up. However, altering the original condition of your dinnerware could actually decrease its value. Even if the change you intend on making would normally be considered an improvement, this can result in a lower appraisal than the original. Keep any parts, spare pieces, or broken pieces with the original piece. In some cases, you may be advised by your appraiser to have the piece repaired by a professional."

      "title": "Avoid online appraisers.",
      "content": "Avoid online appraisers. Getting an item appraised online can be both cheap and time efficient, but the quality and attention to detail you receive will be less than a physical appraisal by a professional. To fully understand the condition of your piece, your appraiser will need to handle it. If you're having trouble finding an appraiser or if they are too expensive for your budget, you might inquire with bank Trust managers or Estate Lawyers to find a suitable individual to appraise your dinnerware. You should also avoid auction houses and dealers when getting your dinnerware appraised. These people may deflate the value of your piece with hopes of buying it from you cheap."

Appraisers have different areas of expertise, so to get the perfect appraiser for your dinnerware, you might have to interview a few before you find the right one. Inspect potential appraisers' resumes to find how long they've been working with antique dinnerware, and check references to ensure you're not being misled. After you've narrowed down the candidates for an appraiser, you should request a written estimate of how much the appraisal will cost and how long it will take. Generally, a written report and full appraisal of your dinnerware will take about a month. However, high demand appraisers may need more time."
