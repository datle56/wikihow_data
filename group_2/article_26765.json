      "title": "Wash the aloe vera leaf under running water and pat it dry.",
      "content": "Wash the aloe vera leaf under running water and pat it dry. Aloe vera secretes a yellowish liquid (right after plucking) that is toxic, so you’ll need to wash it well. If you’ve just harvested it from outside, let the leaf sit inside for 1 hour so all the liquid (also known as “latex”) gets out, then wash it. Use a clean cloth to pat it dry once you’re ready to cut into it. [2] X Research source Most store-bought leaves have already had time to release the toxic yellow latex, but you should still wash the leaf beforehand to remove any dirt and debris. The latex kind of substance can cause allergic reactions. Ingesting the yellow latex may cause severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and/or vomiting and it can be deadly if you are allergic to latex.

      "content": "Use a sharp knife to cut the side rind off the leaf and pull it apart. Cutting the sides off will make it easier to open the leaf (almost like you’re filleting it). Slice into the side “seam” of the leaf with the tip of your knife and slide the blade down the entire length of the leaf. Once you pull the leaf apart, you should have 2 pieces. Discard the rind (or side “seams”) that you’ve cut off. [4] X Research source You can also use scissors for this step, just make sure they’re sharp and wash the sticky residue off the blades afterward."

      "title": "Peel the yellow layer just beneath the rind with a sharp knife.",
      "content": "Peel the yellow layer just beneath the rind with a sharp knife. Carefully use the blade of the knife to peel away any yellow residue, film, or specks—that’s the toxic substance that is secreted by the leaf when it’s picked. Discard this layer once you’ve removed all of it. You should be left with nothing but a clear, gooey substance on top of the bottom leaf. [5] X Research source Repeat this step for both leaves. Wash the knife with dish soap and water after removing this yellow layer. The yellow layer can also be removed by gently rinsing the leaf in a solution of 1 tablespoon (3.0 tsp) of white vinegar and 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water."

      "title": "Use a spoon to gather all the clear aloe vera gel.",
      "content": "Use a spoon to gather all the clear aloe vera gel. Run the edge of a spoon along the leaf to scoop up the clear gooey substance. Gather as much as you can—at least 2 tablespoons (6.0 tsp)—and plop it right into your blender or into an airtight container for later use. [6] X Research source Make sure there are no yellow or greenish specks in the extracted gel. The gel can be stored for up to a week in the refrigerator, but to get the most health benefits (and the freshest taste), use it immediately. You can blend all white fleshy parts in the blender so that the gel has no lumps. [7] X Research source To extend the shelf life, add a few drops of lavender essential oil, tea tree essential oil, or vitamin E oil. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Blend aloe vera gel with oranges for a simple sipper. Place 2 tablespoons (6.0 tsp) of aloe vera gel and 3 whole oranges (peeled) into a blender and set it to high speed for 30 seconds to 1 minute. You can also blend the gel with 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) of orange juice (with or without pulp) if you don’t have fresh oranges. Aloe vera gel has a bitter, acidic taste and can have a laxative effect, so it’s important to dilute it with some other liquid."

      "content": "Mix the gel with fresh watermelon juice for a bright and sweet taste. Use about 4 cups (950 mL) of fresh watermelon juice or about half of a small, seedless watermelon (cut into chunks). Toss the juice or chunks in your blender along with the gel from 1 aloe vera leaf, blend it at high speed until it’s fully liquid, and that’s it! [9] X Research source Add a squeeze of lemon or lime for a kick of citrus. Store the juice in an airtight container or bottle in the refrigerator for up to 5 days if you’re not drinking it right away."

      "content": "Add it to your fruit smoothies for a hydrating refresher. Simply combine 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of strawberries or blueberries, 1 banana, 1.5 cups (350 mL) of milk (any kind), 4 tablespoons (12 tsp) of aloe vera gel, and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of ice in a blender. Blend it on high speed for a minute or two (depending on the power of your blender) or until mixture has a smooth, creamy texture. [10] X Research source You can store this smoothie in the refrigerator (in an airtight container) for up to a day, but it’s best enjoyed fresh! Use vanilla or chocolate flavored nut milk for a richer tate. Add 1 tablespoon (3.0 tsp) or 2 tablespoons (6.0 tsp) of peanut or almond butter for a thicker consistency and sweet, nutty taste."

Blend the mixture on high speed until it’s smooth, which should take about 1 or 2 minutes depending on the power of your blender.
