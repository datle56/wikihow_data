      "content": "Get some 6 by 6-inch origami paper. Origami paper is the best but if you don't have any origami paper, cut a 6 by 6-inch (15.24 by 15.24 centimeters) square out of thin paper, such as gift wrap, printer paper, or construction paper. Avoid using cardstock or similar material, it is too thick for this project. You can use smaller sizes as long as it is still a perfect square, but it will be smaller."

When you are done folding, your paper should still be shaped like a triangle, but with a smaller, upside-down triangle inside it. This will create a \"pocket\" for your bookmark."
