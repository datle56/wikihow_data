If you only have a few guests the party will be much more intimate and lend itself to more in depth conversations. However, if you have lots of guests the party will have a different vibe. A party with a lot of people is a great way for people to make new friends and tends to have lighter conversations. The amount of space you have in your home will also determine how many guests to invite. You don’t want a house that is so crowded that people can’t move around easily. [1] X Research source You need about 8-12 square feet per person for a comfortable cocktail party, and about 5-8 square feet per person for a comfortable larger party. To figure out how many people you should invite, divide the number of square feet in the part of your house the party will take place by the number of square feet per person you want to use. If you're hosting a really large party, pick a date that works well for you. Chances are, you won't find a date that works for everyone. [2] X Research source [v161267_b01]. 11 February 2020. If you're inviting 20 people or less, poll your guests to see which date works best. [3] X Research source [v161267_b01]. 11 February 2020."

You should also include other important details like your contact information for people to R.S.V.P. or get in touch with you if they have a question. Anything that you want your guest to bring should also be included on the invitation. If you want your guests to leave at a certain time, you should include an end time on the invitation. Another important detail to include is if there is a dress code. If you want your guests to dress in a certain attire make sure you indicate this on the invitation. An example of this would be if you want your guests to dress in a costume matching the theme of your party. If you don't have all the party details ironed out yet, create an event website and include the link on your invitation. [4] X Research source [v161267_b01]. 11 February 2020.

Serve plenty of hors d'oeuvres if you're hosting a big party, especially if you're serving alcohol. [11] X Research source [v161267_b01]. 11 February 2020."
