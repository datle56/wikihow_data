      "title": "Korean surnames initially reflected clan or family lineage.",
      "content": "Korean surnames initially reflected clan or family lineage. In early kingdoms, surnames were reserved for royalty and aristocrats, signifying divine or noble birth. The king allowed the ruling class to choose surnames during the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), and this later spread to common people during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897). This practice increased the diversity of surnames in Korean society. [4] X Research source During the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), Koreans were forced to formally register surnames, and many chose Kim, Lee, and Park to signal nobility. Traditionally, Korean surnames have a single syllable, and they precede the person’s first name, which is usually 2 syllables. The concept of a “middle name” doesn’t exist. [5] X Research source For example, in the name Kim Jennie (김제니), Kim (김) is the surname, and Jennie (제니) is the first name. Another unique tradition is that Korean women usually do not adopt their husband’s surname, but their children will have the same surname as their father."

No. While Kim is the most common surname in Korea, people with this surname belong to different clans, known as bon-gwan (본관), indicating the clan’s origin and ancestral lineage. Two people with the Kim surname but different bon-gwan are not considered closely related, and even if they share a bon-gwan, the degree of relation is often very distant, going back hundreds or even thousands of years. [9] X Research source There are over 300 different Kim clans in Korea! Some of the most popular bong-gwan include: Gimhae Kim, Gyeongju Kim, Andong Kim, Jeonju Kim, and Nagan Kim."
