      "content": "Use a 4-foot (1.2 m) level to check that your walls are plumb. Take a long level and place it up right against your walls. Look at the bubble in the tube to check if the wall is plumb, which means it’s perfectly vertical. Place your level onto different sections of the well to check that it’s plumb all around. [1] X Research source If any parts of your wall aren’t plumb, make a note of any dips or angles that you’ll need to shim or make alterations for to make sure the cabinets are level. [2] X Research source For instance, if the bottom portion of your wall slopes outward a bit, you may need to add shims, which are small wedges used to make small adjustments, when you install your cabinets so they’re even."

      "content": "Mark a level reference line about 48 inches (120 cm) off the floor. Take a ruler or tape measure and measure the distance from the floor to the center of your wall. Mark an even line all across the wall with a pencil, marker, or chalk. [3] X Research source This will serve as a simple reference point for you to take more measurements. Make sure the line is even all around so your future measurements are accurate! You could also use a laser level for a simple way to create an accurate reference line."

Take multiple measurements along the line and look for the highest point of your floor. Once you identify it, make a small marking on your wall so you can remember where it is. [4] X Research source Finding your floor’s highest point is super important for installing your cabinet evenly."

Measure up from where you marked your floor’s highest point and use a pencil, marker, chalk, or laser level to mark a line across your wall. Make sure the line is even so your cabinets will be level when you install them. [5] X Research source This layout line marks where the tops of your base cabinets will be once they’re installed."

Place a straight cleat just beneath the layout line for your upper cabinets and drill 2-inch (5 cm) drywall screws through them into every other stud so they’re firmly attached and can hold the weight of your cabinets. Add a cleat for every cabinet you plan to install so their weight is fully supported when you hang them. [9] X Research source Attach cleats along the length of your upper cabinet layout line."
