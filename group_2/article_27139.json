      "content": "DO feed baby birds wet dog or cat food. In a pinch, the best emergency food for a baby bird is moistened dry dog or cat food. Dog and cat food is high in protein and nutrients, making it a perfect emergency food source for baby birds. [1] X Research source Make sure the kibble you’re using is “high protein.” Lederer suggests that you can also use wet dog food, as long as it’s not too liquidy. [2] X Expert Source Roger J.

      "content": "DO feed baby birds eggs. Cut-up hard-boiled eggs or pieces of scrambled eggs are great food sources for baby birds. Eggs are high in protein, which is key to a baby bird’s diet. [4] X Research source Mixing eggs with another food source, like kibble or baby food, is an excellent way to give a baby bird more nutrients."

      "content": "DO give baby birds insects and birdseed. Crushed-up mealworms and crickets are an excellent source of protein and nutrients for baby birds. Similarly, a small amount of tiny seeds can also provide energy for their growing bodies. [5] X Research source Look for mealworms and crickets at your local pet store."

      "content": "DO feed baby birds commercial bird formulas . If you can get to the store, purchasing a formula specifically made for baby birds is your best bet. These products are typically sold in pet or agriculture stores. If you use a commercial formula, use the same formula for the baby bird for as long as you feed it. Switching the bird’s formula or diet could be hard on their digestion. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "DON’T give baby birds milk. Unlike other baby animals, baby birds cannot have milk. Dairy milk can upset their stomachs and cause distress, which could be fatal for the small creature. Baby birds are not mammals, and their stomachs are not designed to process milk.

      "title": "DON’T feed baby birds bread.",
      "content": "DON’T feed baby birds bread. Contrary to popular belief, bread is very bad for birds. Bread is dense and has little nutrition. It can expand in a bird’s stomach, causing them to fill up without getting the proper nutrients. This can cause malnutrition, which can be fatal for birds, especially babies. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "DON’T give baby birds water. Baby birds get water through the food they eat. Forcing water down a baby bird’s throat could be harmful. So, make sure they’re getting plenty of food, and they’ll stay hydrated. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Moisten dry dog or cat food with warm water.",
      "content": "Moisten dry dog or cat food with warm water. Baby birds must be fed very small amounts of food to prevent choking. Dog or cat kibble is much too large to be fed whole to a baby bird, so it takes a little extra preparation. Moisten the kibble with warm water until it feels spongy. Then, break it up into smaller pieces that can fit in the bird’s mouth. [10] X Research source To achieve the right moistened consistency, use one part food to two parts water. Dry food that is too moist can drown or choke a baby bird, so it is very important to properly moisten the food."

      "content": "Mash baby food, eggs, or crushed-up insects into the moistened kibble. Once the dog or cat food reaches the right consistency, mash and mix in some baby food, eggs, or pieces of insects if you’d like. These add extra nutrients and can help further hydrate the bird.

      "title": "Encourage the baby bird to gape.",
      "content": "Encourage the baby bird to gape. Baby birds will gape (or open their beaks) when they’re hungry; however, sometimes they need extra stimulation. Try softly whistling or gently nudging the bird to encourage it to open its beak. Do not force the baby bird to open its beak. If you try to feed a baby bird and it won't gape, try again during the next feeding time—the bird might just be full. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Use tweezers or a syringe to feed the baby bird . Pick up or place a small amount of food in the tweezers or on the tip of the syringe. [14] X Research source Place the food inside the bird’s beak once they open their mouth. [15] X Research source Aim the feeding utensil towards the right side (your left) of the bird’s throat. The left side of the baby bird’s throat contains the trachea, which food shouldn’t go down. Hold the utensil at a height where the baby bird will easily be able to take the food from the utensil. Make sure the food is at room temperature. Feed the baby bird until its crop (a pouch on its throat) is full or it stops opening its beak. [16] X Research source Discard any unused food to avoid spoilage."

      "title": "Feed the baby bird on a schedule.",
      "content": "Feed the baby bird on a schedule. It takes patience and routine to feed a baby bird properly. In the wild, a baby bird gets fed every 10 to 20 minutes during daylight for 12 to 14 hours a day. [17] X Research source Maintaining this schedule yourself can be difficult, so always contact a wildlife rehabilitation center for help. Here’s a breakdown of how often baby birds have to eat: [18] X Research source Chicks less than a week old are fed 6 to 10 times a day (every 2 to 3 hours). Chicks that haven’t opened their eyes need 5 to 6 feedings a day (every 3 to 4 hours). Chicks that have opened their eyes need 3 to 5 feedings (every 1 to 5 hours). Chicks that start to grow feathers need food 2 to 3 times a day (every 6 to 12 hours)."

      "title": "Wean the bird off hand-feeding when it develops full feathers.",
      "content": "Wean the bird off hand-feeding when it develops full feathers. As the baby bird grows, it’ll develop a full set of feathers. At this stage, the bird may start weaning off hand-feeding on its own, rejecting the food you try to give it. Offer the bird a variety of other foods, such as pellets , fresh fruits and vegetables, and seeds. [19] X Research source Be careful when giving birds seeds, as they contain a high amount of fat. Use them as a treat or sprinkle them over pellets to help get a bird to eat. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine if the baby bird is a fledgling or nestling. A nestling has little to no feathers and cannot move around freely. A fledgling is a juvenile bird with a mix of fuzzy down and adult feathers. Knowing what type of abandoned baby bird you’re dealing with can help you give them the proper care. [21] X Research source If the bird doesn’t have feathers (nestling), carefully place it back in its nest if you can find it. If you can’t find the nest, surround the bird with shredded paper towels as a makeshift nest. [22] X Research source Never move a bird’s nest. As Jones states, “It is never safe to move a bird’s nest.” [23] X Expert Source Jeff Jones Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 13 May 2021. If the bird does have feathers (fledgling), leave it alone, as it’s likely testing out its wings and is very close to taking its first flight. [24] X Research source Nestlings need food that’s more of a yogurt consistency, while fledglings can have softer, small chunks of food."

A wildlife rehabilitation expert will be able to help the bird or talk you through how to save its life. [25] X Research source Search “wildlife rehabilitator near me” online to find someone to call. When in doubt, call your local veterinary clinic, as they can also provide resources to help or tell you who to call. As Jones explains, “The first thing you need to be sure of is that the baby bird is actually abandoned. Many young birds are left alone by their parents on purpose in between feedings.” [26] X Expert Source Jeff Jones Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 13 May 2021. A rehabilitation center can help you determine this."

      "content": "Make sure a nestling baby bird is warm and comfortable. It’s crucial to the baby bird’s health that it stays warm. While you’re waiting for further help, do your best to ensure the bird stays at a comfortable temperature. Surround the nestling in towels or shredded paper towels, or carefully place it in a small basket lined with paper or towels. [27] X Research source Baby birds with little to no feathers can also be placed under a 40-watt heat lamp at least 12 inches (30 cm) away. Ask the rehabilitation team for extra guidance if you’re not sure how to keep the bird warm."

      "content": "Do not assume you need to feed the baby bird. Although you mean well, you may be doing more harm than good by feeding a wild baby bird. In fact, many wildlife centers recommend not feeding a wild baby bird, even if it appears abandoned. Call a wildlife rehabilitation center to help you assess the situation, and then see if feeding the bird is wise. [28] X Research source It’s very likely the baby bird’s parents are nearby and will return to feed it within a few hours. If you mistakenly take the baby bird out of the wild to feed it, it could deprive the bird of the care that it needs from its parents. [29] X Research source"
