      "content": "Purchase a poster board. You can find a poster board at nearly any arts and crafts store or office supplies store; many drug stores and grocery stores will carry them as well. Decide if you want a white poster board or one with a colored background. Determine what size you want you dream board to be. You can make it as large as you want, including all aspects of your future goals, or you can make a smaller board for each focus of your life. You can either choose a paper-like board (which will not be as sturdy, but is usually of lower cost) or you can choose a foam board (which will be sturdier, but usually costs more)."

      "content": "Tear or cut out chosen photos and quotes. For a more “rugged” or “undone” look, tear your photos or quotes around the edges; for a neater look, cut out the quotes and photos with a pair of scissors, or consider mixing the two styles for a truly unique look."

      "content": "Paste the photos and quotes on the poster board. Be as creative as you want with the actual construction of your dream board. You can place the pictures in an overlapping, intentionally messy way on the board, or you can keep it clean and neat and arrange your photos and quotes in an organized way. Lay everything out before you start gluing or taping. This will ensure your dream board turns out exactly as you envision it. For a particularly creative touch, purchase interesting thumb tacks and tack some pictures and quotes to your dream board. Consider pasting images on colorful backgrounds before attaching them to your dream board to add some color and pattern to your dream board. Feel free to include embellishments, such as glitter or stickers- use whatever makes you feel great. [12] X Research source"
