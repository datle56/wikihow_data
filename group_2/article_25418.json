      "content": "Sex addicts often have trouble redirecting their thoughts elsewhere. You might find that your boyfriend brings up sex all the time, even when it’s inappropriate or you’re not in the mood. This is most likely because he can’t take his mind off of it, and he wants to share his thoughts with you so they don’t keep bottling up. He might even share upsetting thoughts with you, like talking about having sex with other people."

      "content": "Sex addicts often use sexual pleasure as a way to cope. If you notice that your boyfriend “needs” to have sex every time he’s had a bad day, that’s a red flag. Sex can definitely be comforting to some people, but if your boyfriend is addicted, he’s probably using sex to drown out his deeper emotions. Using sex as a coping mechanism often becomes a cycle. The more your boyfriend uses sex to cope, the more sex becomes a problem, which increases his need for sex."

This is not to say that he’s cheating on you necessarily—however, if your boyfriend has trouble getting or maintaining an erection, he may be using pornography or masturbating too much. [7] X Research source Erectile dysfunction can lead to a lot of shame and embarrassment, and you might notice that your boyfriend initiates sex less often after something like this happens. Some sex addicts find that it’s “easier” to satisfy their urges using masturbation and pornography, simply because they can focus on themselves and not anyone else."

If your boyfriend has cheated on you before and it’s mostly been sexual relationships, there’s a good chance that he’s a sex addict. People who are deep into their addiction don’t care how their actions hurt others—they’re only thinking about their next fix. Many sex addicts will also visit sex workers and pay for sex."

You might find that your boyfriend has cheated on you without using protection, or has gone to meet up with someone he’s never met just to have sex. These behaviors are clear indicators that he is a sex addict, and he’ll likely need professional help to curb his desires. If your boyfriend has engaged in risky behaviors, make an appointment with your doctor to get tested for STDs."
